2020-12-11	2020-12-11 14:33:11	XEL	Xcel Energy Inc.	8 Next Energy Solutions as We Pass Peak Oil	"Oil used to be the stuff that the markets couldn’t do without. The then-regular Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meetings were met with traders, economists and governments around the world — and many energy stocks — trembling with fear. Even James Bond films referenced oil supplies as one of the great threats to her Majesty’s Kingdom.
One of my former business partners long ago wrote a very successful book titled: The Oil Factor, Protect Yourself and Profit from the Coming Energy Crisis in 2005. In the book, Stephen Leeb discussed the then biggie theme of peak oil. This concept was that the world only had so much of the vital stuff and that producers were or had reached the peak of what was possible to bring to the market.
But this was all before technology really ramped up in the oil patch. Fracking had been around for many decades, but eventually would really take hold, making the U.S. the largest producer of the stuff. But now, peak oil has another meaning. Demand, not supply, might be reaching a peak.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Of course, the economic fallout of Covid-19 has made this a near term argument as cars and planes are not moving in volumes seen prior to the virus mess.
Source: Global Oil Demand — Source: International Energy Agency (IEA) & Bloomberg

	
Big oil companies are suffering right now. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has been selling oil field interests, including in the North Sea, along with others — including Centrica (OTCMKTS:CPYYY). Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has also announced a series of field troubles around the globe and is cutting its capital expenditures (CAPEX) by 26% for 2021. Total (NYSE:TOT) is selling fields including in Kurdistan. These announcements garner lots of market attention, but really are just admittances that there is no need for expensive fields when US oil and gas is so cheap and plentiful if and when its needed.
In fact, XOM is working on a field that was the site of an ancient coral reef in La Barge, Wyoming which is rich in natural gas, helium and highly desirable carbon dioxide (CO2).
And peak demand, at least for now, is also impacting refineries around the world. Numerous shutdowns around the globe, including in Europe and Australia, have been announced or are underway. Petrol (gasoline) and jet fuel demand is way off, at least for now, making refineries less economically viable.
But while near-term demand from cars and planes might be a problem, there is the highly likely return post the Covid-19 crisis. And electric cars are there — there are many, many infrastructure challenges along with over a billion motor vehicles as calculated by Ward’s Communications that still need petrol.


					7 Cheap Stocks Under $20 To Buy That Span Industries				

Meanwhile, power supplies are still dominated by natural gas and other fossil fuels despite massive inroads by wind and solar. This means that petrol is still a necessity for now – but not forever.
This means that to get ahead of post-peak-petrol demand, you need to understand and invest in the leaders in the next energy solutions.

Post-Peak Profits and New Energy Stocks
Getting past oil and natural gas is going to take time. Natural gas is mission critical (for now) when it comes to the chemicals industry, including for plastics, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers and other necessary products. And yes, there are labs working on alternatives — but these are not proving out in practical fashion to make the jump or even major steps.
Oil, of course, is primarily about refined products. And this comes down to transportation. Cars can work on alternatives with some major infrastructure changes. And the same can be said of busses and trucks. And in a moment, I’ll present better alternatives now and in the works, and the companies behind them.
Planes, of course, are not going to make the jump soon. Jet fuel is how modern planes move safely and quickly around the globe. And there are some labs working on alternative fuels and technologies, but they are not going to be ready for a while.
But where post peak oil and gas is and will work more is in stationary power generation. Utilities feeding power grids and localized off grid distributed generation (DG) is where the biggest potential is happening right now and moving along quickly.
Overall, post-peak energy alternatives are gaining ground. And a privately held investment group called Cirdan Capital Management based in London has developed an index tracking green energy from an ESG (Environmental, Social & Governance) perspective. The Cirdan ESG Green Energy Index shows a surge of 112.04% from late March to date.

Here are some of the post-peak-problem energy stocks and their underlying technologies that work now and should be bought.

Utilities
Utilities are the first-line companies in the shift away from fossil fuels. Wind and solar are known and proven technologies that, outside of trade tariffs and trade restriction costs, are increasingly cost competitive to cost advantageous for energy stocks and the markets that they serve.
Aiding the shift are two government entities. First are public utility commissions (PUCs) that come with various state and local names, but all comes down to the same mission. PUCs negotiate and set rates and plans for energy production and distribution as well as rates charged. This impacts utilities’ regulated markets whereby they negotiate capital budget for both new energy and maintenance of existing facilities and equipment. And PUCs can and are demanding shifts to more green energy away from oil, gas and other fossil fuels.
Then there are state and local governing authorities. Increasingly, state houses as well as governors and even city councils are passing or issuing edicts for utilities to use green power sources either directly or via contracts from wholesale markets and even off-setting credits in carbon dioxide (CO2) schemes.
This is also adding to the push to adopt or deploy green energy generation by both local regulated companies as well as unregulated wholesale companies.
NextEra Energy (NEE)
NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a company that I’ve followed and recommended for years inside Profitable Investing, and have mentioned in InvestorPlace numerous times. And there are plenty of good reasons. The company is the writer of the playbook of modern utilities in the U.S. as it moved from its regulated business in Florida to become one of the world’s largest wind and solar companies in the world by power generation capacity throughout North America.
Let’s start with the stock, which has returned 663.65% for Profitable Investor subscribers including this year’s year to date return of 24.35%.
Source: NextEra Energy (NEE) — Source: Bloomberg

	
The stock is not just going up, it reflects a building value in the underlying company. The underlying intrinsic value (book) of the company has been rising by an average of 9.72% on a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) basis.
And with a yield of just shy of 2% it is a good total return buy in a tax-free account.
Excel Energy (XEL)
Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) is another utility that has taken the playbook of NextEra and is running it successfully. With its base of regulated businesses in the central to western U.S., it is expanding its green energy capabilities and is expanding its unregulated wholesale market reach.
The stock is working — increasingly reflecting the green energy capabilities of the utility. It has returned 117.98% over the trailing five years — outpacing the S&P 500 Index.
Source: Excel Energy (XEL) — Source: Bloomberg

	
The stock is cheaper than  its bigger peer, NextEra, but it has also been ramping up its value for shareholders in growing its intrinsic value (book) by a good annual average margin.


					7 Cyclical Stocks That Likely Won't Rise Again				

And with its yield of 2.64%, which has been rising in distribution by an average of 6.11% over the past five years, it makes for a good total return stock in a tax-free account.

Transportation
Next up in green energy solution companies involves the movement of cars, trucks, busses and other vehicles with batteries rather than petrol. The big challenge is moving away from lithium batteries that come with major environmental costs in mining and gathering. In addition, these batteries are also very heavy — negating some advantages of green energy in cars. And then there’s the whole explosion thing. Lithium batteries overheat and either ignites or explodes. And in crashes, lithium batteries can provide deathly challenges for passengers or first responders.
Solid state batteries are the next new-new thing for vehicles that moves vehicle technology to much more efficient, lighter and much safer batteries. There are two leaders in this technology.
Samsung Electronics (SSNLF, 005930 Korea)
Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF, 005930 Korea) is the global leader in so many technologies that are mission critical for everything from phones and other personal electronics to major industrial components. It has been working on and offering solid state batteries that are the next level for vehicles as well as for a myriad of other products.
Source: Samsung Electronics (SSNLF,005930 Korea) — Source: Bloomberg

	
The stock is one of the cheapest mega tech companies in the world. It is valued not far from its trailing sales and underlying intrinsic value (book) which are at massive discounts to its U.S. and European technology stock peers.
And the stock delivers to U.S. shareholders with just the past five years alone returning 250.30%.
It can be a pain to buy. Many U.S. brokerages make you call in the trade, which may incur additional fees. And you will have to agree that it is a foreign stock with foreign market risks. To make it easier, note the ISIN # of the shares which is KR700593003 and the SEDOL number of 6771720 KR. These are brokerage and stock exchange and stock trading platform identifiers to access the stock.
With a yield of just shy of 2%, it is a buy in a taxable account given its foreign status.
TDK (TTDKY)
TDK (OTCMKTS:TTDKY) is a Japanese company with a long history of varied product specialties, including its long-ago fame for cassette tapes. But now it is one of the go-to companies for electric vehicles.
Nearly every carmaker has electric cars now or in development. And what they all have in common as well as with hybrid cars and even mild-hybrid systems found in Porsche, Audi — both owned by Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) and other cars are the common products of TDK.
Capacitors and inductors receive, store and transmit power that makes all of these products move and stop. And those voltage monitors noted that keep phones from exploding – yep – those are even more critical for cars.
What also makes cars move from electricity are magnets. TDK has developed the go-to magnets. And storing that power takes lots of batteries – again – TDK is a big leader here. And while lithium and still lead in some cases remain the go-to means for batteries – solid state batteries are what’s going to really solve for electric cars and trucks to power up more quickly, hold power more efficiently and not create massive environmental devastation that’s occurring now on a daily basis.
Yep, TDK is one of the leaders developing and already deploying them.
And there is more to TDK that I’ll get to in a moment for another major groundbreaking green energy solution.
Source: TDK (TTDKY) — Source: Bloomberg

	
The stock has been a great initial success for subscribers of Profitable Investing. And this continues the performance of the stock for U.S. investors with the trailing five-year return of 105.08%.
With its yield of 1.27%, it is a buy in a taxable account given the foreign status.

Batteries, More Than Vehicles
Batteries are also one of the prime solutions for green power beyond vehicles. Wind doesn’t always blow, and Mr. Sun isn’t always at his shiny best. This means that backup is a necessity. California is a prime example of what doesn’t work for backup either in slack wind or cloudy days — but also heavy load demand conditions.
It mandated more green power — but cut off a collection of traditional backup in natural-gas-fired power plants. The idea was that the utilities would just buy power from wholesale unregulated markets when needed. That hasn’t always been available, and blackouts and brownouts have ensued. Add in the grid cut-offs with fire risk in transmission lines and it is not a good green energy market.
There are solutions right now in distributed generation (DG) that I referenced earlier. DG is localized power that is off-grid and may well be part of the major solution for much of the US and global power demand.
And to make it work, you need solar and wind equipment with batteries and fuel-cell power capabilities. Fuel cells use chemical processes to make electric power. And there have been some companies that have been entering the market such as Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) — but its backup power relies on natural gas or natural gas derived fuel. This really isn’t any better than a natural gas-fired generator in homes and businesses when there is a power outage. And it is far from being really green.
Hannon Armstrong (HASI)
Hannon Armstrong (NYSE:HASI) is a green energy financial that is structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT). It provides financing that tends to come with government financial guarantees that provide lots of cash for shareholders with credit protection. And since green-energy-producing assets are on foundations on the ground, it complies with basic REIT company structure standards. This enables the company to largely avoid traditional corporate income taxes — making for more cash for investors.
Source: Hannon Armstrong (HASI) — Source: Bloomberg

	
Hannon Armstrong has an impressive collection of green energy investments — but the one that I am focusing on is with Engie SA (OTCMKTS:ENGIY). Engie is a European utility company based in France that is partnering with Hannon to rollout DG systems throughout the U.S. and potentially beyond.
It will be deploying solar systems for business and residential customers that come with battery backup systems that are pure turnkey that takes the customer off-grid.
Hannon has a very successful history as a company and a stock. Since added to the Profitable Investing Portfolio late last year — it has returned 77.27% for subscribers. And it comes with a tax-advantaged yield of 2.48%. The tax advantage comes thanks to the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) which provides a 20% deduction of dividend income for individual investors.
With its very green portfolio, it makes for a great total return stock in a taxable account.
B. Riley (RILY)
B. Riley (NASDAQ:RILY) is one of my tails-you-win-heads-you-win stocks inside Profitable Investing. This means that this financial company has various divisions that provide opportunities for downturns in the economy including bankruptcy workouts including retail store closings as well as other financial operations that cash in in boom times.
One of the boom time investment operations has been in the renewed market for special purpose acquisition corporations (SPACs). SPACs are not my favored structure and they can be pig in a poke deals for shareholders. But in the case of RILY, it did a deal to bring EOS Energy Enterprises (NASDAQ:EOSE) to the market and holds a sizable chunk of the shares.
EOS is a prime alternative to Bloom Energy and its natural gas backup and it way better than Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) lithium battery backup system that requires lithium and major cooling systems for safety.
EOS has proprietary zinc-based batteries that utilize carbon in its power storage and delivery systems. Clean, and able to operate at high or low temperatures — it is a true green power battery solution for both backup and DG systems.
Source: B. Riley (RILY) — Source: Bloomberg

	
RILY has been a star for investors with the past trailing five-year return of 350.28%. And yet the stock is only valued at 1.40 times trailing (and rising sales) and barely more than 2 times intrinsic value.


					8 Battery Stocks That Electric Vehicle Companies Rely On				

Revenue is soaring, with the past year alone gaining 54.2%. And it comes with a yield of 4.2%, making for a great total return stock in a tax-free account.

Hydrogen: Air Liquide (AIQUY) & Air Products (APD)
Hydrogen is a fuel that is perhaps one of the best green energy sources for the future. But it tends to be made using natural gas that makes it not much better than natural gas for the environment. But green hydrogen that is made without natural gas through electrolysis with water or other friendly chemicals is an older technology that is increasingly working on an economic scale.
Two of my favorite hydrogen producing companies are Air Liquide (OTCMKTS:AIQUY) and Air Products (NYSE:APD). Along with other industrial chemicals including frozen carbon dioxide (CO2) known as dry ice that is crucial for Covid-19 vaccine deployment for Pfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) — these are go to companies for now and going forward.
Source: Air Liquide (AIQUY) & Air Products (APD) — Source: Bloomberg

	
But what I want to circle back on it’s the hydrogen batter and fuel cell development of TDK. TDK has as one of its core operations its investment development division. And it recently made a ground-breaking deal with Gencell of Israel to take a major stake.
This will bring Gencell’s ammonia to hydrogen green energy fuel cells to the broader market. This is major for green hydrogen and will be a major source for further TDK revenue and profits as well as for solving for green energy needs post petrol peak for years to come. Again, but TDK now as this development is just coming along on top of the other major initiatives — including many, many more that I haven’t mentioned in this missive.

The 6 Best Solar Stocks to Buy Right Now	Almost anywhere you look in the market, you can find stocks with price-earnings ratios in the triple digits. But no sector makes this reality more evident than renewables. With that in mind, where should investors be looking for solar stocks to buy?Small firms that have survived the boom-and-bust cycles of recent years are once again in fashion. And low interest rates means financing solar is a more compelling option for homeowners and businesses. Why? Solar creates more energy independence and helps property owners save money over the long term.What's more, if paired with a generator, solar becomes a way to lean less on the increasingly stressed, antiquated and unreliable energy grid.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut small companies are just one way to take advantage. As I mentioned last week, there are some big companies leading an eco-friendly shift in institutional investing.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short List Most of the best solar stocks to buy today are solid, large-cap stocks that have plenty going for them. And they help investors avoid the big premiums that typical solar plays command. Lastly, these six picks are all strong long-term investments.  * NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)  * Dominion Energy (NYSE:D)  * Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK)  * Xcel Energy (NYSE:XEL)  * Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure (NYSE:HASI)  * Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) Solar Stocks to Buy: NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Its regulated business may be the leading utility in southern Florida, but its unregulated business is the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy.And this is precisely the kind of stock I'm talking about here. It offers a steady, regulated utility business, so there's a solid dividend and nearly guaranteed returns, as well as a business with a massive growth kicker.Florida Power & Light (now FPL) was launched in 1928, and has been powering the second fastest-growing city and region in the United States.In 2009, it became the largest renewable energy producer in the U.S. And it has grown that lead ever since. That size and scale makes it very attractive to businesses and other utilities that want to add renewable energy to their energy mix but can't afford to build at scale.The stock is up 30% in the past 12 months, and still delivers a nearly 2% dividend. But there's plenty of upside left. Dominion Energy (D)Source: ying / Shutterstock.com With a $66 billion market capitalization, Dominion is one of the biggest utilities on the East Coast. With 7 million customers, its prime service area includes the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area including the Pentagon, as well as Tidewater Virginia, where one of the biggest shipyards and a significant number of armed forces sit.In recent years, Dominion was focused on taking advantage of its natural gas properties in the Marcellus Shale and elsewhere. The industry was converting coal-fired plants to natural gas, and there were enormous export possibilities present.But it ran into significant headwinds building pipelines out of the Marcellus to distribution centers in Virginia and North Carolina. Even as it prevailed in court, it sold most of its gas pipeline and production business to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B).Now, it's plowing that cash into expanding its solar and wind operations. And Wall Street is loving it. It's up about 4% in the last year and has a 4.7% dividend as well. Solar Stocks to Buy: Duke Energy (DUK)Source: jadimages / Shutterstock.com This North Carolina-based utility has been a leader in alternative energy resources for decades.DUK has about 7.8 million customers across the Carolinas, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. In the old days, King Coal powered the plants that generated electricity for these markets, since most of its service area was in or very near coal country.But it started to realize that East Coast coal was a dwindling -- and dirty -- resource and saw the need to pivot to more efficient and cheaper resources. That transition has been underway for decades. And now, DUK is a leader in utility-scale renewable energy distribution and development.DUK stock is off about 8% for the year, but its 4.6% dividend gets you back close to breakeven. It's a great long-term pick for investors looking for stable, investor-friendly growth. Xcel Energy (XEL)Source: Diyana Dimitrova / Shutterstock.com Usually, there's not a lot of news about upper-Midwest companies unless they're exploration and production companies, agriculture firms or mining companies.XEL is a Minnesota-based utility with 3.7 million electric and 2.1 million natural gas customers in its home state, as well as the Dakotas, Colorado, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas and New Mexico.In a region where there's plenty of coal and natural gas, XEL was the first major corporation to declare that its electricity generation was going 100% carbon-free by 2050, and 80% carbon-free by 2030. That's a big deal.It has significant plans to add solar and wind from now to then. And that will transform energy systems in the High Plains.XEL stock is up almost 13% in 2020, but it remains a bargain. That's why Xcel Energy is one of the best solar stocks to buy. Solar Stocks to Buy: Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure (HASI)Source: Shutterstock Beyond the great long-term choices the utilities here offer, this is a hidden gem that has been overlooked by the broader market.And, it is a great play for two reasons. First, it is set up as a real estate investment trust (REIT), which means it pays you its net profits in the form of dividends.Second, its primary focus is the financing, development and installation of renewable energy projects. And most of these projects have state or federal backing, so the financing is rock solid, as well as the rents.At this point, HASI sports a $2.8 billion market cap, and it's about as expensive as the average S&P 500 stock, even in this hot sector. Plus, it's up nearly 45% in the last year and still delivers a 3.4% dividend. Canadian Solar (CSIQ)Source: Shutter B Photo / Shutterstock.com I'm sure some of you are hankering for a pure-play solar company, so I found one that avoids the triple-digit valuations that most firms have at this point.That other danger to avoid is buying companies that have a lot of potential, but don't have the established markets to make it work. If you remember SolarCity, a solar company that was bankrolled by billionaire Elon Musk, it could barely make it through the troughs and valleys and was finally absorbed into Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). It's not easy.But CSIQ doesn't have those problems because its main market, as its name suggests, is Canada. But it has subsidiaries in 20 countries on six continents including 17 manufacturing facilities in Asia and the Americas.It has shipped over 46 gigawatt modules and currently sits on a 15-GW production backlog, which means CSIQ has plenty of business to keep it going, even during a global pandemic.What's more, it has a U.S. division, Recurrent Energy, that has 2.4 GW of projects up and running in the U.S. and a 7-GW project pipeline.CSIQ stock's trailing P/E is still below 6 times and it's up 17% in the past year. It has a $1.5 billion market cap, so it's not huge, but it's big enough for institutions to buy in.Neil George was once an all-star bond trader, but now he works morning and night to steer readers away from traps -- and into safe, top-performing income investments.

Xcel plans to power 1.5 million EVs by 2030, sees EVs making up 20% of all vehicles	Xcel Energy Inc.  announced Wednesday its plan toward powering 1.5 million electric vehicles (EVs) in its service areas by 2030, including efforts to support residential and public charging options and EV adoption. The Minneapolis-based electricity producer and distributor said its plan envisions EVs making up 20% of all vehicles on the road by 2030, or more than 30 times the current number. The company estimates that by 2030, and EV would cost $700 less per year to charge than for fueling a gas-powered vehicle. &quot;We are already busy creating new charging options for customers, whether they are residential customers or companies and government agencies with large vehicle fleets,&quot; said Brett Carter, chief customer and innovation officer at Xcel. The company said it plans to electrify all sedans it uses by 2023, all light-duty vehicles by 2030 and 30% of its medium- to heavy-duty vehicles by 2030. The stock, which rose 1.4% in morning trading, has rallied 12.6% year to date, while the SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF  has lost 5.6% and the S&P 500  has gained 4.5%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a40f72a7-cf60-317c-b5ec-9b2b0080928f/xcel-plans-to-power-1.5.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-30	2020-07-30 08:00:00	XEL	Xcel Energy Inc.	Test a Tesla or Buy a Bolt With Help From Your Electric Company	(Bloomberg) -- Power companies are loaning out Teslas in Washington, electrifying bus fleets in Virginia and lobbying for electric vehicle tax credits on Capitol Hill.San Diego Gas & Electric Co. even went so far as to help train salespeople on how to convince consumers to buy electric cars and then paid them as much as $500 per sale. It’s all part of a $1.5 billion effort by utilities such as Exelon Corp. and Dominion Energy Inc. to promote vehicles that run on electricity.The companies see it not just as a chance to sell more power, but to balance electricity demand and meet sustainability goals, said Max Baumhefner, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.“The grid is built for the one hour of the year when electricity demand peaks,” Baumhefner said. Pushing energy consumption to after hours, when many drivers charge their cars at home, helps smooth out the swings in usage and could even reduce power costs for everyone, he said.But some aspects of the industry’s campaign -- such as lobbying for tax credits or against President Donald Trump’s rollback of efficiency standards -- put the companies at odds with powerful oil interests. Half of U.S. oil demand is for gasoline.Electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles are a threat to that, even if they currently account for about 1.4 million, or 0.7%, of the vehicles on U.S. roads. Within five years, BloombergNEF predicts they will represent as many as 7% of U.S. car sales due to declining battery costs and a growing number of options.That’s a promising figure for utilities, which have seen electricity demand flatten as household appliances become more efficient. According to BloombergNEF projections, 10% of electric demand will come from electric vehicles by 2040.Electric Vehicles Set for Rapid Growth, Defying Recession: ChartYet some motorists still have qualms.“When we did focus groups, customers were telling us, ‘We have apprehension. We’re uneasy,’ whether it’s range anxiety or the upkeep,” said Calvin Butler, the chief executive of Exelon Utilities.That’s led to some extraordinary efforts on the part of the electric companies to put consumers at ease, such as San Diego Gas & Electric’s collaboration with pro-EV PlugStar to train showroom salespeople.“Who better to sell somebody on an EV than the salesperson?” said Estela de Llanos, San Diego Gas & Electric’s chief environmental officer.“By incentivizing some of these dealer employees, we like to think we planted the seed for more of that to happen,” de Llanos said.An Exelon startup called EZ-EV has helped motorists take test drives, calculate mileage needs and winnow down options -- then score discounts at local dealerships. And motorists who sign up for a monthly car subscription with Exelon’s Steer can shift between electric models, from a Tesla Model X to a Porsche Cayenne.Utilities also have asked state regulators to approve more than 80 plans for advancing electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, according to Atlas EV Hub, which tracks the efforts. The bulk of the programs - some 78% of the requested initiatives -- have won approval, said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy.But the proposals are meeting steep resistance from the oil industry, in some cases joined by the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity and large power consumers wary of higher costs. With about half of U.S. oil demand today tied to gasoline, the sector is fighting electric vehicles on all fronts, from statehouses and state regulatory commissions to Capitol Hill.In Congress, oil and utility interests have squared off over efforts to expand a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles. The utility industry’s leading trade group, the Edison Electric Institute, has lobbied alongside automakers Tesla Inc. and General Motors Co. to expand the tax credit, while oil interests argue climbing sales and the surge in Tesla’s value show subsidies are no longer needed to jump-start a new industry.Refiners and their trade associations “have waged a state-by-state campaign” to block utility investments in electric vehicle infrastructure, the Edison Electric Institute said in a May court filing. They are using “all available tools in all available forums to attempt to slow or stop the general move toward electric and other clean energy transportation, which they view as an existential threat.”National GridLast October, Massachusetts regulators turned back much of National Grid Plc’s $167 million plan to install thousands of charging stations at parking lots, government offices, apartment buildings and other spots, after the American Petroleum Institute, gas station chain Cumberland Farms Inc. and fuel supplier Global Partners LP blasted the initiative.And in Minnesota, a coalition including Marathon Petroleum Corp., and Koch Industries Inc. refining company Flint Hills Resources Pine Bend have mounted a legal challenge to Xcel Energy Inc.’s $25 million electric vehicle plan.Oil industry interests also lobbied states to impose annual fees on electric vehicle users they argue are needed to ensure electric car drivers who don’t pay gas taxes help fund roads and bridges.“It’s fundamentally unfair to take the monopoly power that the utility has and charge everybody higher rates to build out infrastructure that 2% of today’s purchasers use,” said Derrick Morgan, senior vice president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. “It’s a very big gamble with other people’s money.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/test-tesla-buy-bolt-help-080000742.html?.tsrc=rss

Xcel Energy, in its submitted plan to meet state renewable energy standards for 2020 and 2021, has proposed expanding community solar garden power capacity by 40 megawatts annually, meaning another 80 megawatts of new community solar garden capacity could be coming to the utility’s service area in two years.  The Colorado Public Utilities Commission also proposed adopting new rules for community solar allowing community solar gardens to supply 3% of an investor-owned utilities’ total electrical load.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9db4246d-1c59-3cb7-be0c-42fd47a279ec/xcel-energy-looks-at.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-30	2019-08-30 16:24:19	XEL	Xcel Energy Inc.	11 Utility Stocks and Funds to Buy for Safety and Income	Utility stocks and funds are in a fortuitous position right now. Investors tend to seek them out when recession fears creep (like they are right now), and they also tend to perform well when interest rates decline.Several countries have shown signs of economic weakness, sparking worries about a global recession. The U.S.-Chinese trade war hasn't helped, blunting the growth of the planet's two largest economies. And Derek Horstmeyer, an assistant finance professor at George Mason University, points out what many experts have said about the yield curve's recent inversion. Namely, he calls it a &quot;strong signal that we are in the late stages of economic expansion and may indeed be headed for a recession within the next 18 months.&quot; That's a boon to safe-haven sectors such as utilities and consumer staples, as what they produce is always in demand, no matter what the economy is doing. Utility stocks, with their high returns on assets and high dividends, should be considered given that they &quot;tend to do well in late-cycle periods,&quot; Horstmeyer says.The utility sector also is attractive as interest rates fall, says Robert Johnson, a finance professor at Creighton University. &quot;The dividend yield on the utility sector is especially attractive in this abnormally low-interest-rate environment as the yields on utility stocks exceed the yields on long-term U.S. government debt by a substantial margin,&quot; he says.Here are 11 utility stocks and fund to buy for safety and income. This list includes a few standouts in the sector, as well as several ways to diversify your risk while collecting these stocks' above-average dividends.

'A real pivot in our energy policy': Colorado laws could help shift state away from carbon emissions	Colorado is dramatically changing how it regulates electrical utilities and requires energy efficiency, and setting up significant cuts to greenhouse gas emissions in the state.  A series of bills passed in the state Legislature in recent days alters state law to reflect that renewable energy and energy efficiency make financial sense and can achieve the goal of eliminating 85% or more of carbon emissions.  “We are seeing a real pivot in our energy policy in Colorado,” said Erin Overturf, director of the clean energy program at Western Resource Advocates, an energy policy and environmental advocacy group based in Boulder.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/571e862c-ccf9-3a22-9a4e-5bdeb3810fdc/%26%2339%3Ba-real-pivot-in-our.html?.tsrc=rss

As Colorado commits to greenhouse gas emissions cuts, coal industry predicts 'crushing blow'	Colorado’s Legislature aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the state sharply in coming years, and by at least 90 percent by 2050 — a move cheered by environmental groups and that sparked concern from the state’s coal mining industry.   The state House Wednesday passed House Bill 1261 and sent the measure to Gov. Jared Polis to sign within the next 30 days.  The measure has been touted as a way to help ward off the health effects and economic damages of climate change predicted if current pollution levels aren’t reduced.  “We can address climate change, create clean energy jobs, reduce carbon pollution and help our economy all at once,” said K.C. Becker, D- Boulder, who is speaker of the House.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/60a0d65e-8ae8-3dd9-937e-d24d0b03af60/as-colorado-commits-to.html?.tsrc=rss

These Xcel-backed bills loom large in the Colorado Legislature	A lot is at stake for Xcel Energy in the final days of the Colorado legislature’s session, which ends Friday.  The Denver metro's electrical utility, with 1.5 million customers, has backed a bill pushing it to slash carbon emissions — but also add a fee to customers bills to help pay for it — and another that would make it legal for Xcel to build electric-vehicle charging stations, which the law doesn’t currently allow.  The legislature could also allow utilities to sell bonds to pay for closing of coal-fired power plants and one funding worker retraining for those displaced from jobs by the switch to clean energy.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/4ead37f3-d50c-3750-8b15-67483fd1ce3b/these-xcel-backed-bills-loom.html?.tsrc=rss

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Implied volatility

Xcel Energy (XEL) and Consolidated Edison (ED) are some of the stable stocks among their peers. On January 10, both of the stocks had implied volatility levels close to 20%, which is lower than their respective 15-day volatilities. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) had an implied volatility of 17%.

The implied volatility represents investors’ unease. Rising volatility is usually related to falling stock prices. Broader markets witnessed increased volatility in the last few months. Usually, broader markets’ implied volatility levels are lower than utilities at large. Recently, the S&P 500 had an implied volatility of 17%.

Recently, the implied volatility of top utilities including Southern Company (SO) and Duke Energy (DUK) was close to 18%.

To learn about broader utilities’ (XLU) chart indicators and where they might go in the near term, read XLU: What to Expect from Utilities in 2019.

Next, we’ll discuss Xcel Energy and Consolidated Edison’s target prices.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Moving averages

Xcel Energy (XEL) is trading at $48.5, which is almost 4% below its 50-day moving average and 2% above its 200-day moving average. The level close to $50.7 will likely act as a resistance, while $47.5 will likely act as a support for Xcel Energy stock in the short term. Xcel Energy’s RSI (relative strength index) was 49 on January 10.

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that takes values between zero and 100. RSI values above 70 suggest that the stock is overbought, while values below 30 suggest that the stock is oversold. An RSI at either extreme suggests that the stock’s direction could reverse.

Consolidated Edison (ED) stock is trading at an RSI of 48, which indicates that it isn’t in the overbought or oversold zone. Consolidated Edison is 4% and 3% lower than its 50-day and 200-day moving average levels, respectively. The discount to both of these levels indicates weakness in the stock. The levels close to $77.7 and $78.5 are expected to act as resistance for Consolidated Edison stock going forward.

## Short interest

The short interest in Xcel Energy decreased 17% on December 30. On December 14, there were 19.5 million shorted shares in Xcel Energy. The total shorted shares decreased to 16.1 million on December 31. Recently, the short interest in Consolidated Edison fell 4%.

A fall in the stock’s short interest could mean that fewer investors expect it to fall from the current price level. The short interest indicates the number of a company’s shares that have been sold short and not squared off yet.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Valuation

Xcel Energy (XEL) and Consolidated Edison (ED) stocks fell more than 10% late last month. The stocks mirrored weakness in the overall utilities space. Xcel Energy is trading at a forward PE ratio of 18x based on analysts’ estimated EPS in 2019. Xcel Energy’s average historical valuation is close to 18x, while utilities at large are valued around 17x. Xcel Energy stock seems to be trading at a marginal premium compared to its five-year historical average and peers’ average.

Analysts expect Xcel Energy’s EPS growth to be above 6%, which is higher than peers’ average EPS growth for 2019. Xcel Energy’s marginally higher premium valuation seems justified.

## Consolidated Edison

Consolidated Edison (ED) is trading at a forward PE ratio of 17x, which is close to peers’ average valuation and higher than its own five-year historical average of ~15x. Consolidated Edison stock seems fairly valued compared to its peers. Consolidated Edison seems to be trading at a premium compared to its historical valuation. Analysts expect Consolidated Edison to have flattish EPS growth in 2019.

The biggest constituent of the Utilities ETF (XLU), NextEra Energy (NEE) is trading at a forward PE ratio of 21x based on analysts’ estimated EPS for the next 12 months. NextEra Energy looks to be trading at a premium compared to its historical valuation and its peers. Southern Company (SO) stock is valued at a forward PE ratio of 14.5x, while Duke Energy (DUK) is valued at 17x.

Investors turned to relatively safer utilities late last year amid market turmoil due to their higher dividend yields and stable stock movements.

## Xcel Energy outperformed

In the last five years, Consolidated Edison returned 70%, while Xcel Energy returned 107% and outperformed utilities at large. Xcel Energy’s relatively higher earnings growth compared to its peers during this period might have played out well. Consolidated Edison’s dividend yield was higher than Xcel Energy in the last five years. We’ll discuss the two utilities’ dividend profiles in the next part of the series. Utilities (XLU) at large returned 65% in the last five years.

NextEra Energy (NEE), the biggest utility by market cap, was the top performer regarding total returns. NextEra Energy’s consistent and above-average earnings growth influenced its stock performance and fueled its superior dividend growth in the last few years. NextEra Energy returned more than 150% in the last term. To learn more, read These S&P 500 Utilities Have Delivered the Best Five-Year Returns.

## Regulated utilities

Mid-sized regulated utilities Consolidated Edison (ED) and Xcel Energy (XEL) operate in different territories, but they have several aspects in common. Both of the utilities are valued at a market cap of ~$25 billion. They generate a large portion of their revenues from regulated operations. Consolidated Edison offers one of the most reliable dividends. The company has increased its dividend for 44 consecutive years. Xcel Energy, with its sturdy stock performance, outperformed utilities at large in the last several years. We’ll analyze Consolidated Edison and Xcel Energy in this series. We’ll see which utility might outperform in the future.

## Market performance

Xcel Energy stock had a decent run last year before weakness in the defensives (XLU) pulled it down. The stock rose 3% in 2018. Consolidated Edison stock fell almost 10% in 2018 despite reporting better-than-expected quarterly results last year. The company beat analysts’ earnings and revenue estimates in 2018.

For the nine months ending September 30, Consolidated Edison and Xcel Energy reported adjusted EPS growth of more than 7% and 9% YoY. Both utilities’ regulated operations facilitate earnings stability and predictability, which bodes well for stable dividends.

Xcel Energy and Consolidated Edison expect their rate bases to grow ~6% compounded annually through 2020, which will likely enable earnings growth around similar levels. The rate base is the value of the property on which the utility is allowed to earn a specific rate of return, according to the rules set by regulators.

Trump Lifting Hurdle to Coal Plants No One Wants to Clear	The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday proposed easing Obama-era limits on carbon dioxide emissions from new and modified coal power plants, including a change that would remove a de facto requirement to use expensive carbon-capture technology at the sites.  The proposal “would rescind excessive burdens on America’s energy providers and level the playing field so that new energy technologies can be part of America’s future,” acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler told energy lobbyists, free-market advocates, and others gathered at the EPA for the announcement.  The carbon-capture requirement EPA is proposing to eliminate is one obstacle to building coal power plants, though economic and market realities have created much higher hurdles that analysts say will endure no matter what the Trump administration does.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-aims-lift-hurdle-coal-090000937.html?.tsrc=rss

Wilson is recommending the utilities sector right now, and these four stocks have overweight ratings from Morgan Stanley: American Electric Power Co. Inc. ( AEP), PG&E Corp. ( PCG), Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. ( PEG), and XCEL Energy Inc. ( XEL)."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b7656cd3-fe65-3240-9795-79b178e22209/4-stocks-that-can-shine-in-a.html?.tsrc=rss

A significant divergence has occurred so far this year between the most risky and least risky assets, the analyst said.  In the near-term, Wilson expects mean reversion will result in relative outperformance for low-risk assets such as utility stocks.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defensive-play-morgan-stanley-upgrades-143311434.html?.tsrc=rss

XEL’s 200-day moving average of ~$47.94 is likely to act as a resistance for the stock in the short term.	http://finance.yahoo.com/r/44c7d4d1-020b-3632-8ecb-5e532e77b361/looking-xcel-energys-moving-averages-short-interest?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=feed&yptr=yahoo&.tsrc=rss
