Other featured articles discuss how cryptocurrency threatens the role of central banks, why steel stocks are due for a fall and whether the tech giants will thrive. Also, see the prospects for a top bank, a leading auto insurer, a paint producer, an iconic shoemaker and more. Cover story ""U.S. Pot Producers Are Growing Like Weeds. Here's How to Buy In"" by Max A. Cherney and Connor Smith makes a case that, while investors chased Canada's pot stocks like Tilray Inc (NASDAQ: TLRY), they ignored the faster-growing U.S. cannabis industry. Barron's believes multistate operators like Curaleaf Holdings Inc (OTC: CURLF) will flourish as state and federal obstacles fall away. Daren Fonda's ""What Happens When Governments Go Crypto"" suggests that the rise of stablecoins as cryptocurrency is a bigger threat to established, government-backed currency than Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). See how some of the biggest economies are pushing back, including China and the Federal Reserve. In ""Why Bank of America Stock Is a Buy,"" Carleton English discusses how, for a financial institution with nearly $3 trillion on its balance sheet, Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) can sometimes end up lost in the shuffle. See why the article suggests that, with earnings on the rise, investors should start to pay more attention here. A data-driven culture has put Progressive Corp (NYSE: PGR) on pace to overtake Geico this year and to become the industry's second-largest player, according to ""Progressive Is a Growth Stock in a Slow-Growth Industry. Here's Why"" by Andrew Bary. Find out why Barron's claims that this auto insurer's stock is a buy now.

What to Know"" by Ben Levisohn points out that steel prices cannot rise forever. The article says investors should steer themselves away from companies with more debt and a need to invest and favor those that have strong balance sheets. In which category do Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) fall? See also: Warren Buffett And Charlie Munger Talk Economy, Markets At Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting 2021 If leading paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE: SHW) can raise prices without hurting sales, it can keep growing its profit margin even as input prices rise.

In ""Tech's Big Five Had Fantastic Pandemics. Here Are 6 Reasons Why They'll Thrive Even After,"" Eric J. Savitz reveals that Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and others have been delivering blowout earnings, and the trends in tech suggest more gains are ahead.

2021-02-18	2021-02-18 06:52:54	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	Sherwin-Williams Hikes Quarterly Dividend By 23.1%; Street Is Bullish	Sherwin-Williams raised its quarterly dividend by 23.1% to $1.65 per share. This marks the Ohio-based paint and coating manufacturer’s 43rd consecutive year of regular dividend increases. Sherwin-Williams (SHW) said that the new dividend will be paid on March 12, to shareholders of record as of March 1. Shares closed at $721.40 on Feb. 17, up almost 2%. The company’s annual dividend of $6.60 per share now reflects a dividend yield of 0.91%. The company also announced the repurchase of an additional 15 million shares. As of Dec. 31, 2020, Sherwin-Williams had 4.55 million shares remaining under its existing share repurchase program. (See Sherwin-Williams stock analysis on TipRanks) On Feb. 3, the company introduced a three-for-one stock split. Therefore, adjusting the total amount authorized proportionately, there will be three times the shares authorized for repurchase after the stock split. On Jan. 29, RBC Capital analyst Arun Viswanathan increased the stock’s price target to $806 (11.7% upside potential) from $765 and maintained a Buy rating following the company’s “Q4 earnings beat.” Viswanathan views, “the company’s positioning heading into FY21 given the continued robust demand in DIY, its ability to offset cost inflation with higher prices, and the eventual recoveries in businesses tied to re-openings such as industrial, P&M, refinish, and interior paints,” as encouraging. The consensus rating among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 4 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target stands at $808 and implies upside potential of 12% to current levels over the next 12 months. Shares have increased 24.3% over the past year. Sherwin-Williams scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations. Related News: T.

2020-12-31	2020-12-31 15:00:19	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	The Five Worst PR Disasters of 2020	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- 2020 will be remembered as a year of crises. Many of the corporate variety were self-inflicted. As in years past, executives often failed to apply the most basic principles of crisis and reputation management. With no shortage of contenders, here are the top corporate PR blunders of the year:  1.  AstraZeneca Plc’s omission of key details in its vaccine announcement: When the company and the University of Oxford released preliminary results on their Covid-19 vaccine, they didn't mention the error that caused some trial participants to get half doses — which inexplicably turned out to be more effective — nor that the most promising results excluded data from older people. Predictably, Astra is now widely perceived as secretive and untrustworthy, which will make it much harder to drum up faith in any vaccine it later releases. It’s especially jaw-dropping that the company wasn’t better advised on one of the most-awaited announcements of the year.2\. Sherwin-Williams’s decision to fire a top TikTok influencer: In July, the company fired Tony Piloseno, a college student who had already amassed over 1.2 million followers on his paint-mixing TikTok channel (@tonesterpaints). Piloseno said that Sherwin-Williams accused him in part of stealing paint, but that he was actually purchasing the cans with his employee discount. I suspect the company simply wasn't comfortable with a staffer using its products in ways it couldn’t control. Whatever the thinking, it was a shockingly shortsighted move. The TikTok channel was generating a huge amount of free, positive publicity for its brand. The lesson is that to reap the benefits of influencers and superfans, companies need to get comfortable not being able to script their messages as tightly as in the past. This wasn’t lost on the competition: Piloseno soon had job offers flooding in from rivals like Behr and Benjamin Moore. (He chose to work for a smaller competitor, Florida Paints, perhaps having learned a lesson about overbearing corporate control.)3. EBay Inc.’s alleged harassment of newsletter publishers, including by sending porn to neighbors and live roaches to their home: Although the alleged events happened in 2019, the details only came to light in an indictment this June — followed by predictably bad publicity. Six former staffers were charged with conspiracy to commit cyberstalking and witness tampering. They’re said to have harassed critics by, among other tactics, posting ads inviting strangers to their home for sex. Shockingly, EBay’s former chief communications officer, Steven Wymer, reportedly told a former top security officer at the company that he wanted one of the newsletter publishers “DONE,” indicating “I want to see ashes.” As the New York Times noted, private security teams of other companies, such as Tesla and Hewlett-Packard, have also been caught engaging in disturbing acts of aggression. The moral of the story, obviously, is simply not to do this. The reputational (and legal) damage can be devastating.4\. Tropicana's ad suggesting parents stressed out by the pandemic secretly make mimosas: Obviously it's never a good idea to propose that the answer to peoples' problems is surreptitiously consuming alcohol, but this one was especially ill-timed given that problem drinking did rise during the pandemic, especially among women. The lesson here is that brands will suffer backlash if they try to make light of problems that have people genuinely feeling overwhelmed. Empathy would have been a better way to tap into the cultural moment.5. Edelman — the world’s largest PR firm — cutting jobs less than three months after its chief executive promised no Covid-related layoffs: In highly unpredictable circumstances, companies shouldn’t make promises like this. Chief executive Richard Edelman was no doubt well-intentioned when he made the no-layoff pledge at the start of the pandemic. But reneging on the promise didn’t only hurt staffers who may have made life decisions about mortgages, spouses’ jobs and more with his commitment in mind. It also caused unnecessary reputational fallout for the agency when it later announced the cuts, since it suggested the CEO can’t be taken at his word.Finally, a major dishonorable mention goes to McKinsey, long considered one of the world’s most elite consulting firms, for its astonishingly imprudent work with Purdue Pharma. The New York Times revealed in November that the company helped fuel the opioid epidemic by seeking to “turbocharge” sales of OxyContin, then later discussed destroying related documents. The report prompted a rare apology from the consultancy. The incident reminds us all that in order to avoid bad publicity — and a spot on this list next year — every business decision an organization makes needs to be considered in light of its long-term reputation. There’s no better time to start than in 2021.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Kara Alaimo is an associate professor of public relations at Hofstra University and author of “Pitch, Tweet, or Engage on the Street: How to Practice Global Public Relations and Strategic Communication.” She previously served in the Obama administration.

2020-10-20	2020-10-20 00:00:00	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	Daily Spotlight: Commodity Prices Start to Recover	Trade issues hammered commodities during 2018-2019, and then the coronavirus piled on. Copper prices were down 28% in April from 2018 highs as construction stalled, but they have since recovered 33%. Oil prices plunged 75% but have more than doubled from historic lows. Meanwhile, soybean prices have remained relatively steady over the past 12 months, and the price of gold has surged as investors fled riskier assets. Commodity investors are accustomed to volatility. The last time the commodities market bottomed was in January 2016, when oil prices were below $30 per barrel and copper was below $4,500 per metric ton, according to the World Bank. But recoveries tend to be sharp. We think underlying long-term economic fundamentals are favorable for most commodities (except oil), but project ongoing volatility from the virus.  A stable or falling dollar would help. Yet with the virus still spreading, risk remains high and our sector recommendation to Basic Materials is Market-Weight. The current market weighting of the sector is 2.4%, and we think investors should consider exposure of 2%-6% in diversified portfolios. We recommend well-managed, financially strong industry leaders that are able to take market share during challenging periods for the chemical, metals, agriculture and paper industries.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/4a7bfe36-9232-31e1-90a2-2b10f73033ac/daily-spotlight%3A-commodity.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-24	2020-09-24 00:00:00	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	Daily Spotlight: Three Signals from Dividend Growth	Dividend growth is among our most-important themes for 2020.  We think companies that raise their dividends consistently at a double-digit rate are sending off three important signals amid market volatility: the company's balance sheet is strong enough to pay a dividend; 2) management is focused on providing shareholder returns; and 3) management is confident enough in the near-term outlook to raise the payout aggressively. This third factor is especially important during a pandemic. On average, the dividends of the companies in the S&P 500 have grown 2.1% per year since 1970. The dividend growth rate has been negative -- during economic slowdowns in the early 1970s and 1980s and 1990s, and during the bear markets of 2000, 2008 and 2009. At the other side of the spectrum, double-digit dividend growth is rare. The average dividend growth rate been 10% or above in only five of the past 43 years. Dividend growth accelerated in 2019, which was a good year for stocks as trade wars settled down and the Fed took a dovish stance on interest rates; we estimate that S&P 500 dividends grew by 9%. Dividend growth is widely expected to slow over the next two years, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and global recession.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/aaed4f55-25ee-3c4c-99fe-4b8fada0b15a/daily-spotlight%3A-three.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-09-16	2020-09-16 00:00:00	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	The Argus Dividend Growth Portfolio	Often overlooked amid the market's gyrations, dividend income is an important element of total return. Consider recent results: in 2015, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 1.4%, including dividends -- but excluding dividends, the market was down 0.7%. Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors. And dividend payments softened the blow in 2018, when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks, particularly in a slow-growth or recessionary economic environment.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ee2cb308-3324-39c8-b0ae-47798c9d8c19/the-argus-dividend-growth.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-14	2020-09-14 00:00:00	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	Weekly Stock List	This is among our most important themes for 2020, and stretches across industries. We think companies that raise their dividends consistently at a double-digit rate are delivering three important signals amid all the recent market volatility:  1) the company's balance sheet is strong enough to pay a dividend; 2) management is focused on providing shareholder returns; and 3) management is confident enough in the near-term outlook to raise the payout aggressively. This third factor is especially important as the pandemic upends the nation's recent record of long-term economic growth.  Here are 13 stocks that meet our double-digit dividend test and are on the Argus BUY List.  They are also new holdings in our Dividend Growth Separately Managed Account and in the Dividend Growers Total Return Trust, sponsored by SmartTrust.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/99621cd7-7a44-3cc1-9d1a-bbc34f77ae89/weekly-stock-list.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-28	2020-08-28 14:10:18	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	7 Companies That Should Split Their Stocks	Stock splits have recently become a hot topic. Why? Several high-profile companies have made announcements, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). But it seems like a good bet we'll see more.Now the sudden interest -- from retail investors -- in stock splits is a bit puzzling. A stock split only means that a company will issue more shares to all holders, which will reduce the price. For example, in the case of Apple, it will pursue a 4-for-1 stock split, which means that if you own 1,000 shares, you will get an additional 3,000. This will lower the stock price from $503 to $126.Why do this then? One reason is that it makes it easier for retail investors to buy stock in a company (although, this benefit is not as significant anymore because various online brokerages offer the purchase of fractional shares). But a stock split may also generate more interest in the shares.  Essentially, it could be a public relations event.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Gold Stocks to Buy That Still Have Room to Run Regardless of the reasons, the fact is that -- with the long bull market -- there are many stocks that have high prices. So then which ones might we see declare stock splits?Here's a look at seven:  * BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)  * AutoZone (NYSE:AZO)  * Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW)  * Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  * Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)  * Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)  * Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) Stock Splits: BlackRock (BLK)Source: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.com Stock Price: $595While the bull market has lifted many wealth management firms, BlackRock is perhaps one of the best positioned. The company has tremendous scale and broad scope, with $7.3 trillion in assets under management.A key to the success has been BlackRock's aggressive move into the exchange-traded fund market, which has been a strong source of growth. This type of investment vehicle has proven quite versatile, such as with providing low-cost diversification and even the ability to engage in sophisticated strategies.But BlackRock's long history with fixed income has been another key. With interest rates at historically low levels, investors are looking for ways to find extra yield.Something else: BlackRock even has a thriving software business, which is called Aladdin. This platform helps financial institutions manage risks.The result of all this is that the company continues to post strong results. In the latest quarter, profits came to $1.2 billion, up from $1 billion in the same period a year ago.As for stock splits, there has been only one for BLK stock, which occurred in 2007 -- right before the financial crisis. AutoZone (AZO)Source: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com Stock Price: $1,196AutoZone, which has more than 6,000 locations, is usually a steady business. But with the pandemic, sales have been extremely volatile. They initially plunged in March but have since seen a comeback.But when you net things out, the second quarter saw a 1% drop in domestic same-store sales. As for earnings per share, they came to $14.39, down about 10% on a year-over-year basis.Yet AutoZone may be poised for growth. The reason is that the company has tended to do quite well when the U.S. economy is recession, as consumers generally delay auto purchases. Keep in mind that this happened during the downturns of early 1990s, 2001 and 2009.In terms of stock splits, AZO has had had two. They occurred in 1992 and 1994 (both were 2-for-1 splits). Stock Splits: Sherwin-Williams (SHW)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Stock Price: $672Sherwin-Williams has taken a hit from the pandemic. In the most recent quarter, the company reported a 5.6% drop in net sales to $4.6 billion. Sherwin-Williams, though, has taken actions to reduce its cost structure and realize efficiencies.Even with the volatility, the company has still been able to show strength with its net operating cash flows. For the first half of the year, there was a 42% increase to $1.07 billion. Sherwin-Williams has also increased its 2020 guidance for earnings per share to $19.21 to $20.71, compared to is prior forecast of $16.46 to $18.46.Since 2000, SHW stock has been one of the top gainers, going from $18 to $672. Then again, the company has a disciplined organization, a strong brand and wide distribution. SHW has also increased its dividend payout for more than 25 years.What about stock splits? SHW stock has had three. They were in 1986, 1991 and 1997. Amazon (AMZN)Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com Stock Price: $3,400True, Amazon stock is fetching a lofty valuation. But hey, it seems like this has been the case since the company came public in the 1990s!The fact is -- other than the valuation -- it's hard to find fault with the company. Jeff Bezos has built a digital empire that targets some of the most important growth markets: ecommerce, entertainment and cloud computing. The pandemic has also accelerated the growth.Now one of the common complaints about AMZN stock has been its lack of profitability. But this really does seem like a thing of the past. In the second quarter, the company reported earnings of $5.2 billion, up from $2.6 billion in the same period a year ago. Sales were up by 40% to $88.9 billion.In terms of stock splits, there have been three for AMZN stock. They were in 1998 and 1999 -- all during the roaring dot-com era. Stock Splits: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com Stock Price: $1,629While Alphabet stock has done well this year -- up 22% -- it is no where near the levels of other mega-cap tech companies. But this does present an opportunity to get a high-quality company at a reasonable valuation. Note that the price-earnings ratio is roughly 36x.With uncertainty in the economy, the advertising business has felt lots of pressure. In the latest quarter, Alphabet suffered its first drop in ad revenues, off 8% to about $2.6 billion.But despite this, the company has some major advantages. To this end, it owns seven properties that have more than 1 billion users: the main Google property, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Chrome, Android and Play. Alphabet also has been showing traction with its cloud business, YouTube subscriptions and the G Suite (especially with Google Meet).Then there are the &quot;Other Bets.&quot; At the heart of this is Waymo, which has raised $3.2 billion from outside investors. This business unit may ultimately become a valuable standalone pubic entity.Regarding stock splits, GOOG stock did have an unusual one in 2014. It involved creating a new class of stock that meant having two ticker symbols. The goal was to help the founders maintain their voting power. Adobe (ADBE)Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Stock Price: $510Back in 2011, the prospects for Adobe looked bleak. The growth had flat-lined and the company's offerings were showing their age. But CEO Shantanu Narayen took bold actions, as he transitioned the business toward subscriptions and cloud solutions. Initially, there was skepticism on Wall Street. But Narayen's strategy proved to be spot on. The stock price has since gone from $25 in 2011 to $477.Consider that Adobe now is targeting various large market segments. There is the Creative Cloud, which includes franchise platforms like Photoshop and Illustrator. Next, Adobe has the Experience Cloud. It is focused on analytics, content management and personalization to enhance marketing efforts. And finally, there is the Document Cloud. At the center of this is the PDF document standard that has capabilities like digital signatures, similar to what DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) provides. This business has seen substantial growth because of the move toward remote work. Note that the Document Cloud is on track with annual recurring revenue of $1.24 billion.In terms of the stock splits, there have been six for ADBE stock. They occurred in 1997, 1988, 1993, 1999, 2000 and 2005. Stock Splits: Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Stock Price: $709Intuitive Surgical, which is the leader in robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery, has had a challenging year. The pandemic has led to a reduction in the number of procedures.But when looking at the long term, ISRG stock still looks attractive. First of all, the company has a fortress balance sheet, with $6.1 billion in the bank. As a result, the company has had plenty of resources to invest heavily in research and development. In fact, rivals like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) have struggled to match ISRG's capabilities.The business model for the company is also attractive. For the most part, it generates recurring fees for services, add-ons, updates and maintenance. And finally, there is a secular trend toward robotics and automation in healthcare, especially as costs continue to escalate.And as for stock splits, ISRG stock has had only one its history, which came in 2017.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is an advisor/board member for startups and author of various books and online courses about technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, The Robotic Process Automation Handbook and Learn Python Super Fast. He is also the founder of WebIPO, which was one of the first platforms for public offerings during the 1990s. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-08-03	2020-08-03 18:15:00	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	RBC: These 3 Stocks Are Poised to Benefit If Biden Wins Election	It’s August in a leap year, and we all know what that means: the quadrennial silly season is upon us, the regular campaign for the Presidency. This year, politics are more divided than ever, and how a pundit sees the mid-term future tends to be more a function of party affiliation than skill in divination. In any case, RBC has dusted off the crystal ball, and listed the stocks that stand to gain on a Joe Biden win come the fall.In a way, this may be a no-brainer. Biden, who served nearly 40 years in the Senate and as Obama’s Vice President, is widely viewed as one of the best-qualified candidates ever to run for White House. Between his experience, and his Senate history of giving business a friendly nod, Biden’s presence at the top of the ticket eases some voters’ anxiety about anti-business planks in the Democratic Party platform.Still, some companies may be better positioned than others in the event of a change of Administrations. We’ve pulled up the details on three of RBC’s picks to gain from an election year switch. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, we lined up the three alongside each other to get the lowdown on what the near-term holds for the trio.Valero Energy Corporation (VLO)Valero Energy is a petroleum refining company, producing a wide range of products including gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel, as well as non-fuel oil products like asphalt and lubricating oils. The company brings in well over $110 billion in annual revenues. Given the absolutely essential nature of petroleum-based fuels in the modern economy, Valero sees itself as insulated from rapid changes. While candidate Biden has promised to cut back dramatically on oil digging and production, as part of a Green economic initiative, in the near- to mid-term Valero’s fuels will remain the driver of the country.In addition, Valero has a strong biofuel segment, as a hedge against the future. The company is a major producer and transporter of biodiesel, and regularly uses ethanol in its gasoline blends. A Biden Administration, pushing to get away from petroleum fuels, would simply accelerate a move that Valero is already starting.The company’s fundamental strength can be seen in its dividend policy. In July, VLO declared a regular common stock quarterly dividend of 98 cents per share, or $3.92 annualized. This was the third quarter in a row that Valero has declared the dividend, which has remained stable at this level through the coronavirus crisis. The current yield is nearly 7%, a strong return by any standard.RBC’s Brad Heffern notes Valero’s biofuel exposure in his comments on the stock, saying, “We believe if Biden wins the 2020 election this favors VLO, as Vice President Biden has historically been in favor of next generation biofuels. VLO is the 2nd largest renewable diesel producer in the world and the largest renewable fuels producer in North America. VLO continues to expand its renewable diesel footprint and is targeting 675 million gallons of production capacity per year over the next few years.”Heffern’s $69 price target supports his Buy rating on VLO, and implies a 28% upside potential for the stock in the coming year. (To watch Heffern’s track record, click here)Overall, Valero's Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 12 Buys opposed to just 2 Holds. The stock’s $73.85 average price target suggests it has room for 36.5% upside growth from the current trading price of $54.11. (See Valero’s stock analysis on TipRanks)Summit Materials (SUM)Next on or list, Summit Materials, is always under your feet, if not your thoughts. The company supplies building materials – specifically, asphalt, cement, and ready-mix concrete – to the construction industry. These are the building blocks of our roads and sidewalks, making them basic products in any infrastructure project. Summit supplements its materials business with services, including deliver, paving, and trucking.Both parties have been promising Federal funding for infrastructure projects, but the current division, with Republicans controlling the White House and Senate while Democrats lead the House, makes getting a bill through difficult, to say the least. While there are many scenarios in which Trump wins reelection, few of them include a Republican win in both chambers of Congress – but, such a sweep is considered likely for the Democrats should Biden take the White House.In that event, investors can look for increased Federal spending generally, and likely a major infrastructure bill in the early part of the 2021 Presidential term. In that case, Summit is one of the likely winners.This is the case laid out for RBC by analyst Michael Dahl. He writes, “In a Biden presidency and democratic sweep in Congress, the prospect of passing federal infrastructure legislation becomes much more likely, which would be a clear positive catalyst for our aggregates names. We … prefer SUM as we see greater relative upside potential given its relative leverage and valuation discount to larger aggs peers. We believe for aggregates, the risk of higher taxes is more than offset by the higher probability of the passage of a federal infrastructure bill.”Dahl back his Buy rating with a $25 price target, suggesting a 65.5% upside for Summit in the coming year. (To watch Dahl’s track record, click here)Summit is another company with a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, this one based on 8 Buys and 2 Holds. Summit’s shares are selling for $14.72 and the average price target, at $22.44, indicates it has a 52% upside potential. (See Summit stock analysis on TipRanks)Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW)Last on our list may seem an unlikely candidate, but Sherwin-Williams has some undeniable strengths behind it. The company makes paint, and is a stand-by of the home improvement and do-it-yourself segments. Sherwin-Williams’ products are highly regarded for quality by both professional and individual consumers.Biden’s platform includes planks to increase the Federal outlay for made-in-America products, as well as formal requirements for Federal contractors to use American products. Both are seen as bullish for a company like Sherwin-Williams, which boasts that it has been American made since 1866.Covering the stock for RBC, 5-star analyst Arun Viswanathan likes what he sees in Sherwin-Williams, and more to the point, he likes what he foresees in a Biden White House. Believing that a Democrat win will at least bring greater stability, Viswanathan adds, “We believe Biden's Make it in America program will benefit the US consumer and economy. Therefore we like the coatings names that have larger exposure to US housing and the US consumer.”The analyst puts a Buy rating on the shares, and his $700 price target indicates a modest, but real, 8% upside from current levels. (To watch Viswanathan’s track record, click here)Sherwin-Williams is a Moderate Buy pick, with the consensus rating coming from 9 Buy, 5 Hold, and 1 Sell reviews. The shares are not cheap – this stock sells for $649.21, which limits the room for the upside potential. The average price target is $672.47, implying a 3.5% upside.

2020-07-28	2020-07-28 15:27:39	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Sherwin-Williams	Benzinga's PreMarket Prep airs every morning from 8-9 a.m. ET. During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.For those who don't have the time to tune in live or listen to the podcast, Benzinga will highlight one stock that merits further discussion. This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation.Since the COVID-19 crisis began, the PreMarket Prep Show has discussed &quot;stay at home&quot; stocks -- companies that benefit from people either working at home or just spending more time at home.One issue that has fallen under the radar is Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW), which reported earnings this morning and is the PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day.Long-Term Winner: After 2011 at $97.53, the issue has basically been on an uninterrupted uptrend, rising 530% to the $630 area. Of course, it was on sale in March when it cratered to $325.43, which coincides with its August 2017 low of $326.68.Earlier in today's session, it traded to $659.87, more than doubling off its March low.View more earnings on SHWModest Rally Ahead Of The Report: There is almost always a pre-earnings move ahead of an earnings report as investors anticipate a good or bad report. For issues like Sherwin-Willimas that have been in a strong uptrend, the move is higher.Over the last two weeks, it rallied from its July 13 close ($576.04) to an all-time high on Monday at $631.88 and was just shy of posing a new all-time closing high ($625.52 vs. $625.90).Q2 Report: Before the open, the company reported a second-quarter adjusted EPS beat of $1.33 along with a sales beat of $70 million. The company significantly raised its 2020 EPS guidance from $16,46-$18.46 to $19.21-$20.71 versus the estimate of $20.52.Price Action And Commentary From Show: When the issue was being covered on the show, it was in the green by over $20 at the $650 area and had already made a pre-market high at $657. Co-host Dennis Dick commented, &quot;that everyone is sitting at home, thinking of what to do and decide to paint the house, making it a pure COVID play.&quot;&quot;It may not get any better than this,&quot; he said. &quot;what are people going to do, repaint their home every quarter?&quot;Based on the pre-market action, the author of this article identified the pre-market high ($657) as key level for the session. In order for the issue to keep the rally going, it must breach the pre-market high and move into the $660 handle and hold, or it would likely to fade into Monday's trading range; that was from $623.52 to $631.88 with a close at $625.52.Price Action Off Open: After a higher open ($650), it breached the pre-market high momentarily reaching $659.8 before sharply reversing course. The ensuing decline took the issue just beyond Monday's low ($623.53) to $621.57 and rebounded back into the lower $640 handle at the time of publication.See more from Benzinga  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Apple  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Verizon  * Why The Tesla S&P 500 Trade Has Become 'Too Crowded'(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

His goal? To figure out what the best stocks to buy were over this 33-year period.Davis concluded that if you bought dividend stocks whose companies grew the dividends paid to shareholders over the 33 years, you'd have achieved an annual return of 10.6%, 3.3% better than dividend-paying stocks that didn't increase their yields over the same period.More importantly, Davis's study revealed that dividend growers outperformed non-income-paying stocks by 630 basis points. The moral of the story? If you want to have an income-rich retirement, you've got to have a diversified basket of dividend stocks that will deliver both capital appreciation and income growth.For the purposes of this article, we're going to recommend the seven best stocks to buy to meet or exceed the returns from the S&P; 500 to help you do that.Prices and data are from the original InvestorPlace story published on March 29, 2017.

2019-12-20	2019-12-20 18:41:17	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	Unconventional Housing Stocks to Trade: 2 Buys and 1 Short	It's the four walls and roof over our heads which we call home. But when it comes to investing, the universe of related housing stocks is so much more. And right now the price charts of three housing stocks within this broader market are offering bulls and bears opportunities to build profits today.For many in the United States, living the American dream is strongly associated with home ownership. And these days D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) are names at the forefront of this vision. And rightfully so. These three companies are the country's largest builders of residential homes of all types.Still, there are great opportunities within housing stocks if investors think and look outside the box. For one, there are many other types of dwellings many Americans proudly call home. And importantly, there's the companies which make the materials and tools, as well as the suppliers which are integral to guaranteeing your residence is even possible. And right now, three of these alternative housing stocks have constructed price patterns for big-time bullish and bearish profits.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Housing Stocks to Trade: Home Depot (HD)Source: Chart by TradingView The first of our housing stocks to trade is home improvement retailing giant Home Depot (NYSE:HD). No doubt it's been a great run for HD stock and its investors. Still, all stocks do correct. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) current funk or Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) recent bottom are strong evidence in today's market that even the best and biggest companies hit periods of bearish behavior. And Home Depot is no exception.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd Technically, shares of HD stock have already confirmed a bearish top within a five-point broadening pattern. Now a small rally has brought this housing stock back near November's topping candle signal price. Coupled with a bearish stochastics crossover, the pattern risk relative to profits is skewed very favorably for a short position in this housing stock.Trading HD Stock: Short HD stock today. A stop-loss above the broadening pattern works out to a manageable 8%. However, if all goes more or less according to plan, a deeper corrective phase could land shares in a very profitable support zone between $125-$152 before finding a bottom.   Sherwin Williams (SHW)Source: Chart by TradingView The second of our housing stocks to trade is paint and coatings giant Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW). My colleagues at InvestorPlace are uniformly bullish on SHW stock. In fact, it made Will Ashworth's recent list of nine stocks to own for the next decade despite having rocketed by approximately 1,350% since the financial crisis.I'm unsure as to whether SHW stock investors have been smelling paint thinner with those heady gains. Nevertheless, I'll concede technically the case for buying this housing stock looks good.On the weekly chart shares of Sherwin Williams have put together a smallish symmetrical triangle formation. This is typically seen as a continuation pattern. And following a lengthy double corrective period from 2018 into this past summer, gains following the breakout could be just halfway home for bulls.  * The 8 Biggest Investing Surprises of 2019 Trading SHW Stock: Buy this housing stock on a breakout above pattern resistance near $585. I'd look to start taking profits and reduce exposure near $635-$650. However, another similar size leg could take SHW stock towards $700. To contain risk on the downside I'd keep a tight lid on shares with a stop-loss beneath the triangle's support at $565.   Winnebago (WGO)Source: Chart by TradingView The last of our housing stocks is recreational vehicle or RV giant Winnebago (NYSE:WGO). Remember what I said about alternative dwellings? Well, many folks do aspire to hit and live on the road full-time. And Winnebago is a definite way to go about living this type of American dream.What's more, following an impressive earnings beat, shares of this unconventional housing stock are breaking out in style. I'd call it a large cup-with-handle pattern breakout. Others label today's bullish price action as coming out of a flat base. Either way, WGO stock is a buy today.Trading WGO Stock: Buy WGO stock today and park profits in your trading account by reducing risk at new all-time-highs between $65-$70. To protect against this momentum-driven purchase going south, setting a stop-loss below $47 looks like a smart enough exit off and on the price chart.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]The benefit of fast-growing stocks is self-evident, but if inflation becomes something to start worrying about, fast-growing stocks have an importance tied to timing.Source: Shutterstock If inflation returns, growth will be more uneven than it has been in the past. At that point, you'll need to find firms with solid sales earnings growth as well as technical and fundamental strengths to keep the profits rolling.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Are These 10 High-Yielding S&P Dividend Stocks Traps or Treasures? These are five fast-growing stocks to buy today that will keep you in good stead for years to come, even if inflation returns. Sherwin-Williams (SHW)Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW) has sold paint and coatings now for 152 years. That's a pretty impressive record. But it's a bit unusual to see a paint company in a list of top growth stocks. Usually, it's some cloud-storage firm or a breakout online retailer.Source: Shutterstock However, SHW, by its size and reputation, has not only endured but it has positioned itself on top of the coatings heap. It grew from annual sales of $400,000 in 1866 to annual sales topping $15 billion last year, coming from over 100 countries around the world.Its size, scope and quality is one reason hardware giant Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) inked a deal to be the only nationwide home seller to offer SHW products. This is even more exciting given that housing demand is back on track and the interest in homeowners to fixing up their current houses. SHW is rated a &quot;B&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system. Vertex (VRTX)Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is one of the leading pharmaceutical firms when it comes to treating cystic fibrosis (CF).Source: Shutterstock That may not seem like much of a franchise given all the other more compelling diseases out there, but VRTX has built a $43.8 billion market cap in the sector and most of its competitors are looking for other places to find an opening.That is a big deal for pharma companies that usually are strong until patents run down or generics start eating into margins.  * Are These 10 High-Yielding S&P Dividend Stocks Traps or Treasures? Not so with VRTX. As new approvals keep rolling in for next-generation CF drugs, it has plenty more in the pipeline to keep this growth going. Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A)Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A, NYSE:RDS.B) is one of the biggest players in the global energy markets. With a $227 billion market cap, the only Big Oil name that's bigger is Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). It's what is called an integrated energy company because it has operations from the fields to the pipelines to the refineries to the distribution.Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrAs with all energy firms, when times are bad, the more exposure you have to the entire production and distribution process, the tougher things get. But at the size the big oils are, they have the money to wait out the bad patches.And that's just what RDS.A has done. Now it's time to cash in. RDS stock is rated a &quot;C&quot; by Portfolio Grader, but it is still delivering a mouth-watering 6.64% dividend. However, that may wane as the stock price starts rising. In the meanwhile, it's easy to see why this is one of our picks for the best fast-growing stocks. Lumentum (LITE)Lumentum Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: LITE) is a specialty company that focuses on laser beams. It's one of the biggest optical and photonics companies in the world that is working on the 3D sensing sector.Source: Shutterstock Essentially, 3D sensing is basically the gesture sensing that we all have become accustomed with in our mobile devices, screens in our cars, etc. It is one of the most ubiquitous aspects of our interactive age and one of the key parts of the Internet of Things (IoT) concept.  * Are These 10 High-Yielding S&P Dividend Stocks Traps or Treasures? LITE stock's broader tailwinds make it worthwhile.

Today, KNX is a $6 billion business with 20,000 trucks on the road throughout the U.S. and Mexico. If you see a Swift logo on a truck while driving, it's a KNX truck.Source: David Guo via FlickrCharles Dow, the inspiration for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, also inspired a fundamental theory about the economy and the markets. It's simply called Dow Theory.One of the core tenants is that if you look at the transportation and the industrial sectors, you can predict how well the economy will be doing in the near future. If the transport business is rising, that's a bullish sign that the economy is on an upswing and KNX stock with it.It's worth mentioning, however, that KNX stock sports an &quot;F&quot; rating in my Portfolio Grader system on a quantitative basis, but it has a &quot;C&quot; rating for fundamentals. Its inclusion in this list lies with its astronomical growth -- KNX stock is up 41% from its January low, and its one-year price target of $42 represents 20% growth. On an earnings basis, Knight-Swift is predicted to grow earnings at a long-term (5-year) rate of 10%.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-08-07	2019-08-07 12:34:23	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	4 Defensive Stocks to Weather Trade-War Volatility	Bellicose words and hawkish trade policy have turned into a larger skirmish in the simmering trade war. US President Trump on Thursday tweeted that he would impose new tariffs on Chinese imports starting September 1. The tariffs, set at 10% on some $250 billion in Chinese products, will target consumer goods, including electronics. In response, China allowed the yuan to drop past 7 to the dollar – its weakest in over a decade – a reversal of the government’s usual policy of currency support. China’s government shrugged off Trump’s accusations of currency manipulation, and in today’s trading has set the yuan at a slightly stronger rate.Markets, of course, have reacted, with the Dow Jones losing 5.4% and the S&P 500 losing 5.6% between July 30 and August 5. Both indexes showed modest gains on August 6, and still show strong gains year-to-date.Here, we’ll look at four stocks well-positioned to weather trade-war induced volatility. All are buy-rated, all have recently beaten their earnings estimates, and top analysts have noted paths forward for each of them. And all four fit one of Warren Buffett’s favorite criteria for choosing stocks: “Only invest in simple businesses that you understand.” Coca-Cola Company (KO)We’ll start with the world’s most recognized soft drink, Coca-Cola. Coke is definitely a simple business, in the sense that Buffett meant; even though it markets more than 500 branded products, the company has kept its product line focused steadfastly on bottled beverages. By keeping strictly to a sector it knows and does well, Coke has built a powerful brand and a loyal customer base.On July 23, the company reported 63 cents EPS, beating the forecast by 1.6%. Reported revenues, $10 billion, were just above the expected $9.99 billion. KO shares broke above $54 after the earnings release, and still remains near that all-time high. Year-to-date, KO is up 10.4%.Writing after the earnings report, William Chappell of SunTrust Robinson noted the earnings beat and rising revenues, and said, “The company's strong organic sales trends will continue for the balance of the year based on its anticipated investments and momentum in its markets, with more benign FX conditions in 2020 also relieving some of the headwinds of 2019.” He boosted his price target to $60, to go along with his Buy rating. His target indicates confidence in a 14% upside for KO.RBC Capital’s Nik Modi also sees strength in KO, writing, “The company is executing well against its strategy to becoming a total beverage company—driving both organic revenue and earnings per growth.” Modi sees the company’s near- to mid-term earnings growth remaining in the mid- to high-single digit range. In line with this upbeat outlook, he sets a $60 target on the stock.Overall, Coke’s stock maintains a Moderate Buy rating, based on an even split of 6 buys and 6 holds over the past three months. The current share price is $52.27; as mentioned above, this is close to the stock’s all-time high. The average price target, $57.18, suggests an upside of 9.39% for KO. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)The consumer health giant offers us an interesting study. It’s a market leader in home health products, and also manufactures a variety of prescription drugs. Both business segments are profitable and tend to outperform the market; yet JNJ is only up 1.33% year-to-date, and the stock has slipped 7% since mid-July. The company’s fortunes are balanced between last month’s strong second-quarter earnings and a series of legal actions that have investors worried.For Q2, JNJ reported a 4.8% earnings beat, with EPS of $2.58 per share against the forecast $2.46. This was a 42% year-over-year gain. Revenues were also beat expectations, by 1.3%, and came in at $20.56 billion for the quarter. That was the good news.The bad news – the legal worries – concerns a set of ongoing issues, on the company’s talcum powder and possible liability exposure to the opioid epidemic, that have been dogging JNJ since last year. Investors are concerned based on the size of potential judgements against the company. BMO analyst Joanne Wuensch addressed the legal cases in her review of the stock two months ago. She said, “Litigation is a common occurrence in the health care sector that takes significant time to resolve, and often headlines are worse than reality.” Believing that JNJ has plenty of underlying strength to fall back on, she gives the stock a $157 price target and a 20% upside.Five-star analyst Jayson Bedford, writing from Raymond James, agrees with Wuensch’s assessment of JNJ stock. He says, “There is still plenty of drama ahead for Johnson & Johnson investors in the near term, but the company has solid fundamentals and the stock has an attractive valuation.” While upbeat, Bedford’s price target is more cautious, at $146, but still implies an upside of 11.6%.While Johnson & Johnson shows the most near-term weakness of the stocks in this list, it also shows the highest longer-term potential. JNJ shares have a 15% upside, based on a share price of $130 and an average price target of $151. The moderate buy rating is based on 4 buys and 3 holds from the past three months. Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW)Best known for its line of paints, Sherwin-Williams is the leading provider of paints and coating for the industrial and construction sectors. The company pleased investors and analysts last month, when its Q2 EPS of $6.57 beat the forecast by 3.5%. The beat was especially welcome after SHW missed earnings in the previous quarter.Wall Street’s analysts were quick to pick up on SHW’s performance. Writing from RBC Capital, Arun Viswanathan said, “The quarter was driven by strong execution in its North America retail market and a favorable backlog of delayed projects. The company's comps growth of 4.3% topped our forecast of 3% thanks to the higher sales volume and an increase in selling prices.” Viswanathan increased his price target by 6.3%, to $550, indicating a 10% upside for SHW.Susquehanna analyst Don Carson looked at Sherwin-Williams’ forward potential, and wrote, “We have increased confidence in the outlook for strong earnings growth in 2020 given strong Paint Stores Group sales growth in the face of adverse weather which underscores the potential for further margin expansion from falling raw material costs.” Carson’s $580 price target suggests a 16% upside potential for the stock.SHW’s analyst consensus rating of Moderate Buy is based on 7 buys and 4 holds assigned in recent months. Shares are pricey, at $498, but the high share price means the modest dividend yield of 0.91% pays out $4.52 per share annualized. The average price target, $531, implies a 6.58% upside for this stock. Waste Management, Inc. (WM)Our last stock here is also probably the strongest on this list. Waste Management’s 30% year-to-date gain is more than double the S&P 500’s 15%. In addition, Waste Management has consistently beaten the quarterly earnings expectations, and its last report was no exception. The $1.11 EPS was 3.7% higher than the $1.07 forecast, and the $3.95 billion in quarterly revenue was significantly higher than the year-ago quarter’s $3.74 billion.Waste Management’s secret to consistent outperformance is in its name: the company is North America’s largest provider of garbage collection and recycling services. Like Johnson & Johnson, Waste Management leads in a business segment that will always have ready customers. It is a classic defensive stock.The markets top analysts were predictably upbeat after the earnings report. Two analysts – Patrick Brown, from Raymond James, and Derek Spronck, from RBC Capital – both issued increased price targets for WM. Brown raised his to $127, and Spronck set his at $126. At the same time, Scotiabank analyst Mark Neville opened coverage on the stock, with a Buy rating and an aggressive price target of $130. Neville’s target implies an upside potential of 12% for WM shares.The analyst consensus on WM is a Moderate Buy. The stock has received 4 buys and 2 holds in the past three months. Shares are selling for $116, so the $124 price target gives them an upside of 7.3%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-defensive-stocks-weather-trade-123423338.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-04	2019-08-04 22:09:23	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	13 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Stock Market Correction	The stock market has been shaken in recent days by an escalation of the trade battle with China, as well as a Federal Reserve move to lower benchmark interest rates for the first time since 2008 - but not by as much as some on Wall Street hoped. But even after heavy selling, Standard & Poor's 500-stock index remains just a few percent off all-time highs.Is this the start of a long-awaited stock market correction? Possibly. But rather than trying to gauge exactly when a correction is coming or what will spark it, a better plan is to simply prepare. That is, you can shift the composition of your portfolio so it can better weather a storm - but still profit as long as the bull keeps running.A more defensive posture does have drawbacks; nothing is free. The biggest problem is being underweight the stocks that are still driving the market higher. But for investors who do think a correction is coming and don't want to play the losing game of trying to time the market, we've asked a group of investment managers and other experts which stocks they expect to hold up should the market pull back.Here are 13 of the best stocks to buy to ride out a stock market correction. Most of these revolve around the idea of investing in high-quality companies that have good cash flows and business health, boasting pricing power and stable customer demand. This includes consumer staples stocks that sell products and services that people cannot live without. A couple will help raise your exposure to gold, which is emerging from a multiyear slumber.

2019-07-24	2019-07-24 13:57:39	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	Caterpillar’s Grim Outlook Bulldozes Wishful Thinking	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As investors pore over every earnings report for the very latest read on the economy, Caterpillar Inc. provided fresh evidence that the slowdown in manufacturing is no blip. The maker of bulldozers and mining machinery said Wednesday that its 2019 earnings would fall on the low end of its guidance range, snapping a streak of quarterly boosts to its outlook. Caterpillar’s pain points were similar to those that have routinely popped up in industrial companies’ results so far this second quarter: rising manufacturing costs, moderating demand and weakening confidence in the prospects for a second-half rebound. After a bizarre Tuesday turn in trading, when industrial companies including Pentair Plc and Sherwin-Williams Co. got resoundingly rewarded for cuts to their sales guidance, the glum outlook from an economic bellwether like Caterpillar seems to have shaken the market out of its reverie.  Shares of Caterpillar slumped about 5% in early trading.Caterpillar continues to expect a modest sales increase in 2019, but that assumes oil and gas markets recover toward the end of the year, and that dealers work through inventory buildups and are able to accept the price increases the company is banking on to offset increased costs. Those assumptions seem tenuous.Dealers’ inventories of machines and engines climbed by $500 million in the second quarter, compared with a $100 million rise in the year-earlier period. But Caterpillar’s backlog slumped by about $1.9 billion relative to the first quarter, implying a softer demand environment. Meanwhile, sales of oil and gas equipment in North America declined in the second quarter, in part because of weaker demand in the Permian Basin. Halliburton Co. earlier this week announced an 8% cut to its North American workforce and said it would park unused fracking equipment rather than chase after market share. The oilfield services provider echoed Schlumberger Ltd.’s expectations for further sluggishness in the region in the second half of the year, even as international markets deliver robust growth. It’s also worth noting that the competitive pricing pressure in Asia that so spooked Caterpillar investors in the first quarter isn’t fading away. Sales of construction products slumped 22% in the region in the second quarter.Caterpillar’s results came as IHS Markit’s euro-area manufacturing gauge signaled the steepest contraction in more than six years and Germany’s factory Purchasing Manager’s Index fell to the lowest level in seven years. A gauge of U.S. factories showed activity is hovering on the borderline between expansion and contraction in the lowest reading since 2009. The slowdown in this sector appears to be deepening and I remain skeptical that a quarter-point cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve would be enough to motivate the kind of investment surge that could reverse that trend.Elsewhere in industrials, aerospace has remained a haven this earnings season, with strong organic sales growth in the Honeywell International Inc. and United Technologies Corp.’s units that sell engines and aircraft parts. But it’s worth noting that Boeing Co.’s backlog is shrinking. The planemaker  also reported results on Wednesday, and said its commercial backlog included more than 5,500 airplanes valued at $390 billion, down from more than 5,600 planes valued at $399 billion at the end of the first quarter. That’s likely at least in part a reflection of the fact that the embattled 737 Max is now in the fifth month of a global grounding following two fatal crashes. But should aerospace start to wobble, then we’re really in trouble.  To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

This does comes in above its revenue of $4.77 billion from the same time last year. However, it misses Wall Street's revenue estimate of $4.94 billion for the quarter, but couldn't stop SHW stock from soaring today.Despite the revenue miss, a strong earnings per share of $6.57 for the quarter is helping SHW stock today. This is up from the company's earnings per share of $5.73 from the second quarter of 2018. It also easily beats out analysts' earnings per share estimate of $6.37 for the period.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen it comes to net income for the second quarter of the year, Sherwin-Williams brought in $471.00 million.

2019-07-23	2019-07-23 16:14:11	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	Were Those Earnings Really That Good?	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Good news comes with baggage for industrial companies this earnings season. United Technologies Corp., Stanley Black & Decker Inc. and Sherwin-Williams Co. all reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings per share on Tuesday, but each company also gave investors new data points to worry about.For United Technologies, it was the fact that its aerospace businesses seem to be the only thing driving its improved outlook for sales and earnings in 2019. New equipment orders dropped 12% at Carrier in the period and 6% at the Otis elevator division, echoing reports of damped enthusiasm from industrial distributor Fastenal Co. and indications of an overall stagnation in new U.S. factory orders in June from the Institute for Supply Management. Stanley and Sherwin-Williams both left their full-year adjusted profit guidance unchanged despite notable beats in the second quarter, suggesting a cautious outlook on the rest of the year. Indeed, Stanley modestly reduced its expectation for volume growth amid a weaker outlook for industrial and emerging markets. Sherwin-Williams now expects overall revenue to increase only as much as 4% in 2019, down from an April projection of as much as 7%. Both companies think they can make up ground via price increases, but such sales weakness is troubling because Stanley and Sherwin-Williams can also be good proxies for the housing market and consumer demand.Despite the mixed results, stocks of all three companies rose Tuesday. Sherwin-Williams hit a new high and was on track for its biggest gain since 2009, while Stanley saw its biggest intraday gain since December. This is partly a reflection of lowered expectations. Industrial companies within the S&P 500 command a price-earnings ratio of about 17.5, a 10% discount to the broader benchmark’s  valuation of 19.5 times profit. The average discount over the past five years is closer to 4%. Stanley had been down nearly 2% in the year leading up to Tuesday’s earnings report, owing in part to margin pressure it flagged earlier in the year. United Technologies has missed out on a nearly 4% gain in the S&P 500 after announcing a merger with Raytheon Co. that’s roused pushback from activist investors Bill Ackman and Dan Loeb.Generally speaking, though, investors appear to be choosing to prioritize the good headlines over the bad. Pentair Plc rose as much as 5.1% on Tuesday, despite relying mostly on tax benefits to beat analysts' second-quarter earnings estimates and cutting its organic growth guidance for the year. The International Monetary Fund further reduced its global growth outlook on Tuesday, saying a projected pickup from 2019’s pace in 2020 is “precarious,” with the principal risk factors being the U.S.’s various trade battles and Brexit. But for now, industrial companies are drawing on every means they have to keep the boom going, whether that’s relying on the still-robust aerospace market, pushing through price increases and cost cuts, or simply wagering a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut will boost investment.The thing about price increases is they get much trickier to pass along if demand starts to wobble. Stanley is also feeling the pain from the U.S.-China trade war. It now expects a $390 million hit to 2019 earnings from tariffs, currency swings and rising commodity prices, up from $340 million previously. Come 2020, United Technologies’ Carrier and Otis units will be spun off as independent companies, freeing the company from any future underperformance. Currency swings wiped out the modest organic revenue gain at Carrier in the second quarter, leaving it with a 1% decline in overall sales for the first six months of the year, and United Technologies lowered its full-year sales and profit outlook for the division. The flip side of United Technologies’ breakup is that it will be more exposed to an eventual downturn in aerospace markets without those two divisions, something it hopes to offset by expanding its defense business through the Raytheon deal.This willingness to look past trouble spots will be put to the test later this week when Caterpillar Inc. and 3M Co. report.(Updates stock activity in the third and fourth paragraphs.)To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-05-01	2019-05-01 16:33:22	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	5 Elephant-Sized Companies Warren Buffett Could Buy	Warren Buffett has a problem. One-hundred and twelve billion of them to be exact. That's the amount of cash that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B) has on its balance sheet at the end of 2018. And odds are, Buffett's cash hoard has only grown over the last three months as his vast empire continues to pay some hefty dividends. The problem for Warren Buffett and Berkshire is that amount of cash starts to be a real drag on its profitability and returns. So, for the last year or so, Buffett has been searching for a firm to buy. And given BRK's size, it needs to be a big one to move the needle. Unfortunately, the Oracle of Omaha hasn't found just the right one yet.But there could be plenty of choices.  * 7 Stocks That Are Soaring This Earnings Season Analysts have started to look at what Buffett could buy to add to the Berkshire Hathaway arsenal. In total, about 141 different firms could meet the Warren Buffett standard for cash flows, profitability and value. Here are the best possible Warren Buffett stocks that regular retail investors may want to snag up as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF)Source: Shutterstock It's no secret that Warren Buffett loves insurance stocks and BRK is chockfull of them. That's because Buffett loves their float. An insurance company's float is basically all the premiums it's collected, but hasn't paid out just yet. This money can be invested in a wide range of things -- with some caveats on amounts. Most insurance companies use bonds and other fixed-income instruments, but not all. Berkshire's subsidiaries use their float to bet on stocks.And so does insurer Cincinnati Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:CINF).CINF is property and causality insurer that has been very successful in using its float to boost its returns over the years. Additionally, the company has some very conservative underwriting standards which have helped limit losses. Combining this plus its local agent-specific businesses model -- which partners with existing insurance agencies to promote its businesses -- and Cincinnati Financial has been a long-term winner.In fact, with its last dividend hike, CINF has managed to raise its dividend for 59 years straight.That sort of steadfastness could be exactly what Buffett is looking for. Moreover, CINF could be an easy fit into Berkshire's other insurance assets. With a market cap of around $15 billion, the stock would be an easy one for Buffett to swallow as well. Fastenal (FAST)Source: Shutterstock If there is one thing Buffett likes, its simple to explain businesses that churn out hefty cash flows year in and year out. That's basically what Fastenal (NASADQ:FAST) has been doing for the last 50 years.FAST produces and sells a variety of hardware and supplies that other industrial firms or businesses need to keep running. This includes everything from boring nuts and bolts to more exotic fare like tools and pumps. It's basically an industrial supplier to the industrials. That's a good place to be.Over the years, Fastenal has cemented itself as one of the top players in this niche. The key for the firm comes down to its relationships with other industrials and manufacturers. FAST's system makes it easy for procurement managers to order. The firm operates more than 2,220 branches and a hefty online website. But the real win is that FAST has been able to get inside manufacturers themselves. This comes from Fastenal's storage bin replenishment and vending machine programs. Here, FAST is able to directly integrate into a manufacturer's ordering/supply chain and allows for ease of repeat customers. Simply, FAST is able to integrate itself into a customers' workflow. Last year, the firm processed more than 41 million orders and pulled in more than $5 billion in revenues. More importantly, it has allowed FAST to grow at a very hefty clip in terms of margins and profits.  * 10 Times Apple's Hardware Failed Consumers -- And Hurt Its Business With a wide moat, great growth and $20 billion market-cap, Buffett could and should swallow up Fastenal. Sherwin-Williams (SHW)Source: Shutterstock Buffett is clearly a fan of homeownership as several of Berkshire Hathaway's subsidiaries focus on products for construction and decorating. This includes carpet-producer Shaw Flooring. Under this banner, paint-producer Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) could get the nod from Buffett.With its 2017 purchase of Valspar, SHW became the global leader in paints and coatings. This includes a hefty amount of paints and stains for personal/home use. But the real reason why Buffett could give SHW a nod is its industrial businesses. Sherwin-Williams produces a ton of different coatings and paints for a variety of industries -- including lucrative aerospace and automotive/transportation finishes. These sort of performance coatings have been a bright spot in its business -- with sales jumping 5% in the last quarter. Profits here jumped by over 60% as Valspar was able to significantly contribute. That's the sort of growth that Buffett would love to see inside Berkshire.And Buffett could find plenty to love in its dividend as well.Thanks to big growth in several of these performance coatings segments, Sherwin-Williams recently was able to raise its dividend by an eye-popping 31%. Meanwhile, the stocks payout ratio is measly 23%. That leaves plenty of room for future payout increases.In the end, SHW is the kind of specialty industrial business that throws off serious cash flows. Exactly what characterizes most Warren Buffett stocks. Southwest Airlines (LUV)Source: Jerry Landers via Flickr (Modified)The long joke among investors is that investing in an airline was the surest way to lose to money. For the longest time, no Warren Buffett stocks were airlines. But that was then and this is now. And now Berkshire counts holdings in the four major airlines, but Southwest (NYSE:LUV) could ultimately be the one that gets bought out.Things have changed a lot for the industry. Thanks to deregulation and the wave of mergers, the number of airlines has shrunk in the U.S. That has provided the remaining ones with larger operating footprints and better profit profiles. Additionally, dropping oil prices have reduced one of the biggest costs for the sector. That's what initially drew Buffett into the sector in the first place.Why Southwest will get the love is that it the airline checks a lot of boxes for Buffett.For one thing, the corporate culture at LUV is top notch and is still run by early insiders and founders. Secondly, it's moat as a carrier is deeply entrenched and many low-cost competitors have difficulty competing. Finally, the top-notch carrier may be cheap.  * 4 Big Tech Stocks in Major Trouble LUV cut its guidance twice in the last two months thanks to woes over canceled flights. Southwest flies almost exclusively 737 planes -- though not exclusively 737 Max planes. With that, shares have dropped and now trade for just 10 times free cash flows. That's a very juicy figure and could get Buffett to just buy out the stock. Moody's Corporation (MCO)Businesses that produce plenty of cash flows because they have no overhead are something Buffett likes as well. So, when you combine with this with an irreplaceable moat, you know Buffett is 100% onboard. This could help explain his attraction to Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO).Moody's -- along with rival S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) -- provides credit ratings, research, and risk analysis services. And as one of the three main ratings agencies, investors, banks and other customers rely on MCO to make their investment decisions. This includes BRK. In fact, a company can't issue a bond without a ratings agency giving it it's blessing.The best part is that Moody's only real overhead is salary. That leads to plenty of cash generation and mega-sized margins for its products. This year, Moody's estimates that it will generate more than $1.6 billion in free cash flows. Meanwhile, the firm has been more than happy to share those cash flows with investors. Over the last five years, MCO has managed to grow its dividend by an average of 12%. Currently, the stock yields 1.03%.These factors are some of the reasons why Buffett and Berkshire own a hefty slog of Moody's shares.Add in its growth potential from side analytic business and the need for robust credit research and there's a good chance that Buffett could finally take the firm private.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The company said it had net income of $245.2 millin, or $2.62 a share, down from $250.1 million, or $2.62 a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings, excluding acquisition-related costs and pension settlement costs, came to $3.60, below the $3.66 FactSet consensus. Sales rose to $4.04 billion from $3.97 billion, also below the FactSet consensus of $4.09 billion. &quot;We made good progress on our pricing initiatives across all segments during the quarter and effectively managed SG&A spending, but volumes fell short of expectations due to a slower start to the architectural painting season in North America and continued challenging conditions in many end markets outside North America,&quot; Chief Executive John Morikis said in a statement. The company is expecting volume growth to improve in the second half, particularly in the back half of the year, he said. For the second quarter, the company is expecting sales to grow 2% to 5%. &quot;As a reminder, second quarter revenue comparisons to 2018 in The Americas Group and the Performance Coatings Group are the most challenging of the year, and Consumer Brands Group faces comparisons to early load in volume from the Lowes program and the divested Guardsman business,&quot; said Morikis. For the full year, the company expects sales to grow 4% to 7%. It expects full-year EPS of $16.93 to $17.39 and adjusted EPS of $20.40 to $21.40. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of 21.09.

2019-03-27	2019-03-27 12:01:11	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	Best ETFs for 2019: The Rally in the iShares Home Construction ETF Should Continue	Editor's note: This article is a part of InvestorPlace.com's Best ETFs for 2019 contest. Vince Martin's pick for the contest is the iShares Dow Jones US Home Const. ETF (BATS:ITB).Heading into 2019, the case for the iShares Dow Jones US Home Const. ETF (BATS:ITB) was reasonably simple. Housing and construction stocks were hammered in 2018. In fact, ITB stock dropped some 31%. While there were concerns -- slowing new construction spending, labor shortages, rising input costs -- the steepness of the decline seemed to be an overreaction.That case is why I chose ITB as my pick for the Best ETF of 2019. So far, the call is working out. ITB stock has gained 16% so far this year -- and risen 25% from late December lows.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet even with those gains, the core bull case here still holds. Many housing stocks still are cheap. The sector on the whole doesn't seem to be getting enough credit. While the rest of the market signals continuing economic strength, ITB stock still discounts quite a bit of risk. Particularly for investors who believe the market, and the economy, will stay healthy going forward, ITB remains an attractive choice. The iShares Dow Jones US Home Const. ETF in 2019Again, ITB has performed well so far this year. But in context, the 16% gains so far this year perhaps aren't that impressive. The S&P 500 index has gained almost 12%, meaning housing and construction stocks have only modestly beaten the market so far in 2019.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Play the CBD Trend That gap actually is narrower than a housing bull might have expected. After all, the divergence in 2018 was much sharper: ITB dropped a whopping 31% against just a 6% decline in the index. Going back to the beginning of 2018, ITB has declined 13%, and the S&P 500 has risen nearly 5%.The question at the moment is whether that gap should persist or narrow. Skeptics might point to slower new home sales, in particular, as a reason for caution. Whether it's demand for rentals among younger customers or a literal lack of land in popular markets like Denver and Seattle, housing simply is a tougher industry than most right now. ITB's five largest holdings are homebuilders, with Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) alone comprising 27.3% of the fund.But homebuilder stocks actually have done quite well this year: LEN has gained 25% and DHI 21%. And yet the group remains cheap, with those stocks generally trading at a single-digit multiple to earnings. The rest of the fund, meanwhile, has a potential catalyst as 2019 rolls on. Will Smaller Positions Boost ITB Stock?Even with homebuilders doing better, building suppliers and retailers are performing mostly in line with the market. Home Depot (NYSE:HD), for instance, has modestly underperformed the market. So has The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), the fund's eighth-largest holding.The case for ITB was that even if new home sales stayed soft, a strong economy would lift renovation and remodeling spending. Yet it has been ITB's exposure to new construction, not R&R, that has driven a majority of its gains so far.Over the rest of 2019, then, there's a clear path for ITB to continue to rise. Economic strength should increase confidence toward renovation and remodeling, providing another driver for the fund's holdings.In that context, the bull case here seems largely intact. Even with a strong start to the year, construction stocks still are lagging the market over a broader timeframe. That leaves room for ITB to continue to outperform in coming quarters. And if new home sales numbers can strengthen, the ETF could skyrocket.ITB does require the U.S. economy to stay strong, and any macro weakness is the biggest risk to the thesis. But for investors projecting that strength will continue, ITB remains a solid choice for market-beating returns.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-01-15	2019-01-15 19:48:17	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	Sherwin-Williams (SHW) Stock Tumbles on Profit Warning	"Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) stock is taking a hit on Tuesday as the company warned of an update surrounding its profit for its fiscal year, which is now slated to be below both the paint maker's guidance and Wall Street's consensus estimate.

The Cleveland, Ohio-based company saw its stock decline by as much as 7.5% in premarket trading today as its fiscal 2018 earnings are going to be short of what everyone was calling for. CEO John Morikis said that these underwhelming results are associated with a performance that &quot;was disappointing across the board.&quot;

&quot;Consolidated revenue growth for the fourth quarter fell well short of our previous expectation, due in large part to weak sales growth by our North American stores in October and November,&quot; CEO John Morikis added in his statement. The Sherwin-Williams boss added that the company's store sales did rebound slightly in December, but this improvement was not enough to carry the rest of it shortcomings during the period.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The paint company added that it now sees its fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings to be about $18.53 per share, which is below the company's previous guidance of earnings in the range of $19.05 to $19.20 per share. Analysts were calling for Sherwin-Williams to rake in a profit of $19.11 per share for the fiscal year.

The company added that it sees its fourth-quarter revenue to gain 2% year-over-year, below its previous guidance of a mid-single digit percentage surge.

SHW stock is declining about 4.1% on Tuesday following the update.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Axalta’s 2019 automotive color of the year

On January 10, Axalta (AXTA) choose ‘Sahara,’ a golden bronze tone, as the 2019 automotive color of the year. Sahara radiates warmth and brings richness and strength to all vehicles irrespective of sizes. Axalta showcased Sahara in manufacturing facilities as well as the aftermarket for the first time in the five-year history of the automotive color of the year. Sahara could be the main color for two-tones. Axalta has been announcing the automotive color of the year since 2015. Axalta selected Radiant Red in 2015, Brilliant Blue in 2016, Gallant Gray in 2017, and Starlite in 2018.

Axalta will display Sahara at the 2019 North American International auto show in Detroit. Dan Benton, the marketing manager ofAxalta’s refinish color department, said, “Axalta’s Color of the Year is another example of how Axalta transfers OEM technology to the aftermarket and repair businesses. We get calls every year from some of the industry’s best custom builders looking to use color to differentiate their products. We have Sahara formulated and ready-to-go in our industry-leading refinish brands including Cromax, Standox, and Spies Hecker.”

## Axalta’s stock price update

Axalta continued its upward trend in 2019. The stock gained 4.8% and closed at $24.96 for the week ending January 11. The gain in the stock price helped narrow the company’s 100-day moving average gap. Axalta traded 4.8% below its 100-day moving average price of $26.23. So far in 2019, Axalta has gained 6.6%%. RPM International (RPM) and PPG Industries have declined 7.0% and 0.4%, respectively, while Sherwin-Williams (SHW) has gained 0.6%.

Axalta’s 14-day RSI (relative strength index) is at 61, which indicates that the stock isn’t overbought or oversold. An RSI of 30 and below suggests that the stock is oversold, while an RSI of 70 and above suggests that the stock is overbought.

Investors can hold Axalta indirectly by investing in the iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF (IYM). IYM has invested 0.9% of its holdings in Axalta as of January 11.

## RPM International’s first-quarter dividend

In a press release on January 2, RPM International (RPM) announced the rates and key dates for its first-quarter dividend.

To be eligible for RPM International’s first-quarter dividend, investors must hold RPM International shares in the company’s records as of the market close on January 16. The dividend is expected to be paid on January 31.

For the first quarter, RPM International declared a dividend of $0.35 per share—no change from the previous quarter. However, the dividend represents an increase of ~9.4% compared to the same quarter the previous year. PPG Industries (PPG) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW) paid their fourth-quarter dividend of $0.48 and $0.86 per share, respectively, while Axalta (AXTA) hasn’t paid any dividends.

RPM International had ~131.7 million outstanding shares after its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Assuming that no share buybacks take place before the record date, RPM International will be paying $46.1 million in the form of dividends to its shareholders.

## Dividend growth trend

RPM International has increased its dividend for 45 consecutive years. Since 2015, RPM International’s dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of ~8.7%. We need to discuss the cash flows to see if RPM International can sustain its dividend growth.

Next, we’ll discuss RPM International’s free cash flow growth and its ability to support its dividend growth. Investors can get indirect exposure to RPM International through the Invesco DWA Basic Materials Momentum ETF (PYZ). PYZ had 3.1% of its holdings invested in RPM International as of January 10.

2019-01-07	2019-01-07 18:16:17	SHW	The Sherwin-Williams Company	RPM International Announced Its Q2 2019 Earnings	"Analyzing Chemical Companies in the Week Ending January 4

(Continued from Prior Part)

## RPM International’s earnings

On January 4, RPM International (RPM) announced its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The company reported an adjusted EPS of $0.52—a decline of 8.77% over the adjusted EPS of $0.57 the previous year. RPM International’s adjusted EPS fell short of analysts’ estimates of $0.68.

RPM International reported revenues of $1.36 billion compared to $1.32 billion in the second quarter of 2018—3.6% growth year-over-year. However, RPM International missed analysts’ estimates of $1.38 billion. The revenue growth was mainly driven by organic growth and acquisition growth, while unfavorable foreign currency had a negative impact. Both of RPM International’s reporting segments witnessed revenue growth.

Frank C. Sullivan, RPM’s chairman and CEO said, “We achieved solid top-line improvement with sales growth of 3.6%, despite the unfavorable foreign currency translation effect of 2.0%. Like many manufacturers, our bottom line was impacted by a continued rise in costs for raw materials, freight, labor, and energy, as well as adverse foreign exchange translation.”

RPM International expects to report an EPS of $0.10–$0.12 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019.

## RPM International’s stock price

The markets appeared to be disappointed with RPM International’s earnings. The stock price declined ~9.9% for the week and closed at 52.26. Sherwin-Williams (SHW) and Axalta (AXTA) gained 0.2% and 4.1%, respectively, for the week, while PPG Industries (PPG) declined 1.3%. The decline in RPM International’s stock price caused the stock to trade 16.7% below its 100-day moving average price of $62.71

RPM International’s 14-day relative strength index of 26 indicates that the stock has temporarily moved into the oversold position.

Investors could hold RPM International indirectly by investing in the First Trust Dorsey Wright Momentum & Dividend ETF (FXZ). FXZ has invested 2.9% of its holdings in RPM International as of January 4.
