""In the first quarter, we delivered solid results that exceeded our expectations and reflect a robust 5G leasing environment, positioning us to generate an expected double-digit growth in both AFFO per share and dividends per share for full year 2021,"" stated Jay Brown, Crown Castle’s Chief Executive Officer. ""We are excited to continue to support our customers' wireless infrastructure needs as they deploy nationwide 5G in the U.S., and we expect to once again generate industry leading domestic tower revenue growth in 2021. We believe our unique portfolio of tower, small cell and fiber assets positions us to benefit from what we expect will be a decade-long investment cycle as our customers develop next-generation wireless networks. As a result, we expect the deployment of 5G in the U.S. to extend our opportunity to create long-term value for our shareholders while delivering dividend per share long-term growth of 7% to 8% per year. ""We believe our ability to offer towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all integral components of communications networks and are shared among multiple tenants, provides us the best opportunity to generate significant growth while delivering high returns for our shareholders. Based on the expected growth in data traffic and wireless carrier network investment, we believe the U.S. represents the highest growth and lowest risk market in the world for communications infrastructure ownership, and we are pursuing that opportunity with our comprehensive offering."" RESULTS FOR THE QUARTERThe table below sets forth select financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020. (in millions, except per share amounts)Q1 2021Q1 2020Change% ChangeSite rental revenues$1,369$1,310 +$59+5%Net income (loss)$121$185 -$64-35%Net income (loss) per share—diluted(a)$0.28$0.38 -$0.10-26%Adjusted EBITDA(b)$897$814 +$83+10%AFFO(a)(b)$738$593 +$145+24%AFFO per share(a)(b)$1.71$1.42 +$0.29+20% (a) Attributable to CCIC common stockholders.(b) See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations"" for further information and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to net income (loss), as computed in accordance with GAAP. HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE QUARTER Site rental revenues. Site rental revenues grew 5%, or $59 million, from first quarter 2020 to first quarter 2021, inclusive of approximately $82 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and a $24 million decrease in straight-lined revenues. The $82 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues represents approximately 6.3% growth, comprised of approximately 9.4% growth from new leasing activity and contracted tenant escalations, net of approximately 3.1% from tenant non-renewals.Net income. Net income for the first quarter 2021 was $121 million compared to $185 million for the first quarter 2020 and was impacted by a $143 million loss on the retirement of long-term obligations due to first quarter 2021 refinancing activities.AFFO per share. AFFO per share for the first quarter 2021 was $1.71, representing 20% growth when compared to $1.42 for the first quarter 2020.Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $302 million, comprised of $17 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $285 million of discretionary capital expenditures. Discretionary capital expenditures during the quarter primarily included approximately $225 million attributable to Fiber and approximately $49 million attributable to Towers.Common stock dividend. During the quarter, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately $588 million in the aggregate, or $1.33 per common share, an increase of approximately 11% on a per share basis compared to the same period a year ago.Financing Activities. During the quarter, Crown Castle issued $3.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a combination of 5-year, 10-year and 20-year maturities, resulting in a weighted average maturity and coupon of 12 years and approximately 2.1%, respectively. Net proceeds from the offering were used to redeem all of the outstanding 5.25% Senior Notes, repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan A, and repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper notes at their maturity date. ""We are excited about the increasing level of activity we see in our business as our customers have begun to deploy 5G at scale,"" stated Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. ""We believe we are well positioned to support our growing number of customers by providing a comprehensive set of solutions across towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all necessary to build out 5G wireless networks. Looking forward, we believe we are in a great position to deliver on our long-term annual dividend growth target of 7% to 8% while at the same time making significant investments in our business that we believe will generate attractive long-term returns and support future growth. To help fund that growth, we were able to opportunistically access the bond market during the first quarter to refinance upcoming maturities, extending our maturity profile and reducing our overall cost of capital. We continue to take steps to complement our compelling total return opportunity with a lower risk profile, and we expect to have sufficient capacity to once again fund our discretionary investments this year with free cash flow and incremental borrowings."" OUTLOOK This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the SEC. The following table sets forth Crown Castle's current Outlook for full year 2021.

Full Year 2021 OutlookThe table below compares the results for full year 2020, the midpoint of the current full year 2021 Outlook and the midpoint of our previous full year 2021 Outlook for select metrics.

The increase to the midpoint of the full year 2021 Outlook for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO primarily reflect: 1) $140 million of additional straight-lined revenues associated with a long-term tower leasing agreement with Verizon that became effective April 1, 2021 and also resulted in an increase of the average contracted lease term under our existing Verizon tower site leases to approximately 10 years; 2) a $25 million increase in the expected services contribution; and 3) a $30 million decrease in expected interest expense, offset by $15 million of additional labor related costs associated with higher Towers activity than previously expected.The chart below reconciles the components of expected growth in site rental revenues from 2020 to 2021 of $355 million to $400 million, inclusive of expected Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues during 2021 of $295 million to $335 million, or approximately 6%, which is unchanged from our previously provided 2021 Outlook.Chart 1: https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/6ca126e8-06ee-4085-9092-cb9946b7c925 The chart below reconciles the components of expected growth in AFFO from 2020 to 2021 of $340 million to $385 million, adjusted to exclude the impact of the Nontypical Items discussed in our press release dated January 27, 2021.Chart 2: https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/7360bb17-f95a-4126-8353-a7d50d70972cAdditional information is available in Crown Castle's quarterly Supplemental Information Package posted in the Investors section of our website.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations This press release includes presentations of Net income (as adjusted), including per share—diluted amounts, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Funds from Operations (""AFFO""), including per share amounts, Funds from Operations (""FFO""), including per share amounts, and Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"")). Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other real estate investment trusts (""REITs""). Our definition of FFO is consistent with guidelines from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein, we also provide Segment Site Rental Gross Margin, Segment Services and Other Gross Margin and Segment Operating Profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. In addition, we provide the components of certain GAAP measures, such as capital expenditures. Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our business. Among other things, management believes that: Net Income (as adjusted), including per share—diluted amounts, is useful to investors and other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors as it adjusts net income to exclude the impact of the Nontypical Items (as defined in this press release and described further in our press release dated January 27, 2021), which management believes are unusual (including with respect to magnitude), infrequent and not reasonably likely to recur in the near term, to provide further insight into our results of operations and underlying trends and projections. Management also believes that identifying the impact of Nontypical Items as adjustments provides more transparency and comparability across periods. There can be no assurances that such items will not recur in future periods. Net income (as adjusted), including per share—diluted amounts should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Separately, we are also disclosing Adjusted EBITDA as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, which management believes are unusual (including with respect to magnitude), infrequent and not reasonably likely to recur in the near term, to provide further insight into our results of operations and underlying trends and projections. Management also believes that identifying the impact of Nontypical Items as adjustments provides increased transparency and comparability across periods. There can be no assurances that such items will not recur in future periods. Adjusted EBITDA (including as further adjusted to exclude Nontypical Items) should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.AFFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that AFFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as it includes (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt and dividends on our preferred stock (in periods where applicable)) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures, and excludes the impact of our (a) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (b) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. Management notes that Crown Castle uses AFFO only as a performance measure. Separately, we are also disclosing AFFO as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, which management believes are unusual (including with respect to magnitude), infrequent and not reasonably likely to recur in the near term, to provide further insight into our results of operations and underlying trends and projections. Management also believes that identifying the impact of Nontypical Items as adjustments provides increased transparency and comparability across periods. There can be no assurances that such items will not recur in future periods. AFFO (including as further adjusted to exclude Nontypical Items) should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.FFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that FFO may be used by investors or other interested parties as a basis to compare our financial performance with that of other REITs. FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion). FFO is not a key performance indicator used by Crown Castle. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations.Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is useful to investors or other interested parties in understanding the components of the year-over-year changes in our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. Management uses the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues to assess year-over-year growth rates for our rental activities, to evaluate current performance, to capture trends in rental rates, new leasing activities and tenant non-renewals in our core business, as well to forecast future results. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is not meant as an alternative measure of revenue and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing the performance of our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. We define our non-GAAP financial measures, segment measures and other calculations as follows: Non-GAAP Financial Measures Net Income (as adjusted). We define Net Income (as adjusted) as net income (loss) less other operating income resulting from the Nontypical Items, plus incremental operating expenses and asset write-downs as a result of the Nontypical Items. Net Income (as adjusted) per share—diluted. We define net income (as adjusted) per share—diluted as Net Income (as adjusted), divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, (income) loss from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. Separately, Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, reflects Adjusted EBITDA, less other operating income resulting from the Nontypical Items, plus incremental operating expenses as a result of the Nontypical Items. Adjusted Funds from Operations. We define Adjusted Funds from Operations as FFO before straight-lined revenue, straight-lined expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash portion of tax provision, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of non-cash interest expense, other (income) expense, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring charges (credits), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, (income) loss from discontinued operations and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, less sustaining capital expenditures. Separately, Adjusted Funds from Operations, as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, reflects Adjusted Funds from Operations, less other operating income resulting from the Nontypical Items, plus incremental operating expenses as a result of the Nontypical Items. AFFO per share. We define AFFO per share as AFFO, including as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Funds from Operations. We define Funds from Operations as net income plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset write-down charges, less noncontrolling interest and cash paid for preferred stock dividends (in periods where applicable), and is a measure of funds from operations attributable to CCIC common stockholders. FFO per share. We define FFO per share as FFO divided by the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues. We define the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues as the sum of the change in GAAP site rental revenues related to (1) new leasing activity, including revenues from the construction of small cells and the impact of prepaid rent, (2) escalators and less (3) non-renewals of tenant contracts. Segment Measures Segment Site Rental Gross Margin. We define Segment Site Rental Gross Margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations. Segment Services and Other Gross Margin. We define Segment Services and Other Gross Margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other cost of operations. Segment Operating Profit. We define Segment Operating Profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, and segment other operating (income) expense, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment. All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable. Other Calculations Discretionary capital expenditures. We define discretionary capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects. Sustaining capital expenditures. We define sustaining capital expenditures as those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as either discretionary or integration capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures. The tables set forth on the following pages reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures used herein to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on our management's current expectations as of the date of this news release. Statements that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward-looking statements. In addition, words such as ""estimate,"" ""see,"" ""anticipate,"" ""project,"" ""plan,"" ""intend,"" ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""likely,"" ""predicted,"" ""positioned,"" ""continue,"" ""target,"" and any variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include our full year 2021 Outlook and plans, projections, and estimates regarding (1) potential benefits, growth, returns, capabilities, opportunities and shareholder value which may be derived from our business, strategy, risk profile, assets, investments, acquisitions and dividends, (2) our business, strategy, strategic position, business model and capabilities and the strength thereof, (3) industry fundamentals and driving factors for improvements in such fundamentals, (4) our customers' investment, including investment cycles and the timing thereof, in network improvements (including 5G), the trends driving such investment and opportunities and demand for our assets created thereby, (5) our long-and short-term prospects and the trends, events and industry activities impacting our business, (6) opportunities we see to deliver value to our shareholders, (7) our dividends (including timing of payment thereof) and our long- and short-term dividend (including on a per share basis) growth rate, including its driving factors, and targets, (8) revenue growth in the Towers segment, (9) debt maturities, (10) strategic position of our portfolio of assets, (11) cash flows, including growth thereof, (12) leasing environment and the activity we see in our business, (13) tenant non-renewals, including the impact and timing thereof, (14) capital expenditures, including sustaining and discretionary capital expenditures, the timing thereof and any efficiencies that may result therefrom, and the discretionary capital budget and the funding (including capacity to fund) thereof, (15) straight-line adjustments, (16) revenues and growth thereof and benefits derived therefrom, (17) the recurrence of Nontypical Items, (18) net income (loss) (including on a per share basis and as adjusted for Nontypical Items), (19) Adjusted EBITDA (including as adjusted for Nontypical Items), including components thereof and growth thereof, (20) expenses, including interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (21) FFO (including on a per share basis) and growth thereof, (22) AFFO (including on a per share basis and as adjusted for Nontypical Items) and its components and growth thereof and corresponding driving factors, (23) Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and its components, including growth thereof and contributions therefrom, (24) our weighted-average common shares outstanding (including on a diluted basis) and growth thereof, (25) services contribution and labor related costs, (26) our growing number of customers, (27) benefits stemming from our recent tower leasing agreement with Verizon, (28) the utility of certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures and (29) the strength of the U.S. market for communications infrastructure ownership. All future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including prevailing market conditions and the following: Our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services.The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.Our Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.Failure to timely, efficiently and safely execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the rights to land under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.The restatement of our previously issued financial statements, the errors that resulted in such restatement, the material weakness that was previously identified in our internal control over financial reporting and the determination that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, could result in loss of investor confidence, shareholder litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations, any of which could cause the market value of our common stock or debt securities to decline or impact our ability to access the capital markets.New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.If we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.We may be vulnerable to security breaches or other unforeseen events that could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.Future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available through the SEC website at www.sec.gov or through our investor relations website at investor.crowncastle.com. We use our investor relations website to disclose information about us that may be deemed to be material. We encourage investors, the media and others interested in us to visit our investor relations website from time to time to review up-to-date information or to sign up for e-mail alerts to be notified when new or updated information is posted on the site.

2021-04-12	2021-04-12 16:35:59	CCI	Crown Castle International Corp.	Verizon Forged Deals With Crown Castle, SBA Communications To Fast-Track C-Band Equipment Deployment	Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ) has inked deals with Crown Castle International Corp (NYSE: CCI) and SBA Communications Corp (NASDAQ: SBAC) to accelerate the deployment of C-band equipment for the launch of 5G Ultra-Wideband and fixed wireless broadband service on the newly acquired spectrum. Castle and SBA already hosted Verizon infrastructure equipment. Verizon won an average of 161 MHz of C-band nationwide spectrum in the recent FCC auction. The C-band offered greater speeds and coverage for both mobility, home broadband, and business internet solutions. The 5G Ultra-Wideband deployment on the spectrum required new network equipment, including basebands and antennas on existing towers. The deals with both Crown Castle and SBA Communications offered process improvements leading to Verizon's faster deployment of C-band equipment. Both the agreements established terms for leasing space on existing towers for C-band equipment. The addition of the C-band spectrum will enable Verizon to offer the differentiated 5G Ultra-Wideband mobility service to an additional 250 million customers offering the internet provider choice to 50 million additional customers, stated Verizon SVP Heidi Hemmer. Price action: VZ shares traded higher by 0.10% at $57.55 on the last check Monday.

(CCI) and Encourages Long-Term CCI Investors to Contact the Firm	PHILADELPHIA, March 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kaskela Law LLC announces that it is investigating Crown Castle International Corp. (“Crown Castle” or the “Company”) (NYSE: CCI) on behalf of long-term Crown Castle stockholders. Recently a shareholder class action complaint was filed against Crown Castle on behalf of investors who purchased shares of Crown Castle’s common stock between February 26, 2018 and February 26, 2020. The complaint alleges that during that time period Crown Castle and certain of the Company’s executive officers issued a series of false and misleading statements to investors about the Company’s financial accounting and internal controls. On February 26, 2020, Crown Castle disclosed that it would be restating its previously issued financial statements for fiscal years 2017, 2018, and for the first three quarters of fiscal 2019. The Company further disclosed that, as a result of the restatement, “the preliminary impact to each of Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO is a decrease of approximately $100 million for full year 2019 actuals and a decrease of approximately $90 million to [Crown Castle’s] Previous 2020 Outlook.” Following this news, shares of Crown Castle’s common stock declined $14.38 per share, or nearly 9% in value, to close on February 27, 2020 at $148.31 per share. The investigation seeks to determine whether the members of Crown Castle’s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders in connection with the above alleged misconduct. Crown Castle stockholders who purchased or acquired shares of the Company’s common stock prior to February 26, 2018 are encouraged to contact Kaskela Law LLC (D. Seamus Kaskela, Esq.) at (484) 258 – 1585, or by email at skaskela@kaskelalaw.com or online at https://kaskelalaw.com/case/crown-castle/, for additional information about this investigation and their legal rights and options with respect to this matter.

2021-02-03	2021-02-03 19:04:15	CCI	Crown Castle International Corp.	2 Stocks Flashing Signs of Strong Insider Buying	"Tracking insiders’ stock purchases can make a viable investment strategy. Corporate insiders – the company officers and board members – are naturally positioned to be in the know, to know how company policies and performance will impact stock prices. They can use that knowledge to inform their own stock purchases – but not unfairly. By law, they must disclose publicly their own stock holdings, and the general public can learn from those purchases and sales. Insider moves can informative or uninformative. The latter are simple shifts in portfolio holdings, usually not of great magnitude, done to tweak an ownership percentage or adhere to a tax regulation. The informative moves, however, are different. These are the big-number buys and sells – and when an insider, or several insiders, start making informative share moves, market watchers should take note. These are signs that something big may be in store. TipRanks follows the insiders’ trades, making use of the publicly published stock moves to track them. The Insiders’ Hot Stocks page provides the scoop on which stocks the market’s insiders are buying so that you can make informed purchases. We’ve picked two stocks with recent informative buys to show how the data works for you. Brown & Brown (BRO) Brown & Brown is an insurance company – one that does over $2.3 billion in annual business. The company is based in Florida, boasts a market cap of $12.4 billion, has 300 office locations, and is the fifth largest insurance broker in the US. Brown & Brown deals in risk management, offering insurance products for customers of all sizes: government agencies, professional organization, businesses, corporations, and families and individuals. Brown & Brown has seen its revenues and earnings rise year-over-year during the corona crisis – which makes sense, as a stable and reliable insurance company should expect to see an increase in business during unsettled times. The 4Q20 results showed revenue of $642.1 million, up 10.9% yoy. Earnings came in at 34 cents per share, an increase of 25% yoy. On the insider front, Board of Directors member James Hay put down $433,750 for a purchase of 10,000 shares on January 29. This brings the insider sentiment here into positive territory. Truist analyst Mark Hughes, rated 5-stars by TipRanks, sees Brown & Brown as a solid choice for investors interesting in the insurance sector. “The company is generating solid organic revenue growth, margins should be steady-to-up this year, and M&A activity has been healthy, all of which should drive solid top- and bottom-line expansion in coming periods. We believe BRO shares remain a good way for investors to get exposure to the recovering economy and firming P&C pricing,” Hughes opined. In line with his optimistic approach, Hughes rates BRO a Buy, and his $55 price target indicates confidence in ~25% growth for the next 12 months. (To watch Hughes’ track record, click here) Is the rest of the Street in agreement? As it turns out, the analyst consensus is more of a mixed bag. Split almost right down in the middle, 4 Buy ratings and 5 Holds were assigned in the last three months, giving BRO Moderate Buy status. With a $51.44 average price target, the potential twelve-month gain comes in at 17%. (See BRO stock analysis on TipRanks) Crown Castle (CCI) The second insider pick we’re looking at, Crown Castle, is a real estate investment trust with a twist. The company owns and manages communications infrastructure, specifically, the tower and transmitter locations so important to cellular networks. Crown Castle’s property portfolio includes more than 40,000 towers, 70,000 small cell locations, and 80,000 miles worth of connecting fiber optic cables. The rollout of the new 5G wireless network has been a boon to Crown Castle’s model in the past year. Crown Castle's revenues remained steady through 2020, ranging between $1.4 to $1.49 billion, with the third and fourth quarter results both at $1.49 billion. For Q4, that was an 11% yoy gain. For 2020 as a whole, CCI reported $5.3 billion, up 3.8% yoy. Crown Castle’s position was sound enough that the company raised its dividend payment by more than 10% in December. The new payment, $1.33 per common share, gives an annual payment of $5.32 and a yield of 3.2%. Turning to the insider trades, we find that Kevin Stephens, one of the company’s Directors, paid $328,300 for a bloc of 2,000 shares. Stephens now owns $671,000 worth of CCI; this recent purchase nearly doubled his total holding. 5-star analyst Colby Synesael, from Cowen, takes a highly bullish stance on Crown Castle. He notes that CCI has “a new agreement with Verizon in which the carrier has agreed to lease 15K small cells from Crown that will install over the next four years…"" The analyst added, ""[We] estimate the avg. ARPU is $500/mo. (w/ a 1.5% escalator), suggesting an initial annualized value of ~$90MM. The deal represents the company’s largest single small cell deal in its history… the deal raises Crown’s small cell backlog to ~30K from previously ~20K.” Synesael’s confidence is clear from his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock. His $197 price target suggests a one-year upside of 21%. (To watch Synesael’s track record, click here) Overall, Wall Street’s analysts like what they see here. CCI's Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 8 recent reviews, breaking down to 7 Buys and a single Hold. CCI's average price target is $177.25, implying a 9% upside from the current share price of $177.25.

""We delivered another solid year of growth in 2020, highlighting the strength of our business model and the significant value creation opportunity we believe our strategy provides to shareholders,"" stated Jay Brown, Crown Castle’s Chief Executive Officer. ""Despite the challenges 2020 presented, we generated industry leading tower revenue growth in the U.S., resulting in AFFO per share growth that was in line with our long-term target range. We expect our growth trend to continue with approximately 6% growth in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenue for our Towers segment in 2021, supporting the previously announced 11% increase in our dividend per share. Adding to our long-term growth opportunity, we finished the year with approximately 50,000 small cells on air, and we meaningfully increased our backlog of small cells committed or under construction to approximately 30,000 with the 5G small cell agreement with Verizon we announced today. We believe our unique portfolio of assets positions us to benefit from what we expect will be a decade-long investment cycle as our customers deploy 5G, extending the opportunity we see to create long-term value for our shareholders while delivering dividend per share growth of 7% to 8% per year. ""We believe our ability to offer towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all integral components of communications networks and are shared among multiple tenants, provides us the best opportunity to generate significant growth while delivering high returns for our shareholders. Based on the expected growth in data traffic and wireless carrier network investment, we believe the U.S. represents the best market in the world for communications infrastructure ownership, and we are pursuing that opportunity with our comprehensive offering. This differentiated strategy is delivering compelling results, as evidenced by our superior tower revenue growth rate in the U.S., and the strategic long-term agreements we recently announced with Verizon and DISH to support their nationwide 5G build outs."" RECENT DEVELOPMENTS In a separate press release today, Crown Castle announced a long-term 5G small cell agreement with Verizon whereby Verizon has committed to lease a total of 15,000 new small cells from Crown Castle over the next four years.In December 2020, T-Mobile US, Inc. (""T-Mobile"") notified Crown Castle it was cancelling approximately 5,700 small cells contracted with Sprint Corporation (""Sprint Cancellation"") prior to its merger with T-Mobile. The majority of the cancelled small cells were not yet constructed and, upon completion, would have been located at the same locations as other T-Mobile small cells. The Sprint Cancellation resulted in T-Mobile accelerating payment of all contractual rental obligations associated with the approximately 5,700 small cells as well as the payment of capital costs incurred to date.The fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were impacted by the Sprint Cancellation and a reduction in staffing completed during the fourth quarter 2020 (collectively referred to herein as ""Nontypical Items""). The Nontypical Items included in the fourth quarter operating results generated other operating income of $362 million and incremental operating expenses of $76 million and resulted in a charge for the write-off of capital of $63 million. The full year 2020 net benefit on net income, Adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO from the Nontypical Items, which were not contemplated in the prior full year 2020 Outlook issued on October 21, 2020, is $223 million, $286 million and $286 million, respectively. The Nontypical Items do not have a material impact on the full year 2021 Outlook, which previously contemplated the deployment of approximately 1,000 Sprint small cells that were subject to the Sprint Cancellation.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR Site rental revenues. Site rental revenues grew 4%, or $227 million, from full year 2019 to full year 2020, inclusive of approximately $283 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and a $59 million decrease in straight-lined revenues. The $283 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues represents approximately 5.6% growth, comprised of approximately 9.3% growth from new leasing activity and contracted tenant escalations, net of approximately 3.7% from tenant non-renewals.Net income. Net income for full year 2020 was $1.1 billion compared to $860 million for full year 2019 and was impacted by the retirement of $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes during July 2020, which resulted in a $95 million loss on the retirement of long-term obligations. Net income for full year 2020 was also positively impacted by approximately $223 million from the Nontypical Items.Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO for full year 2020 were $3.7 billion and $2.9 billion compared to $3.3 billion and $2.4 billion for full year 2019, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO for full year 2020 were positively impacted by approximately $286 million from the Nontypical Items.Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures during the year were $1.6 billion, comprised of $86 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $1.5 billion of discretionary capital expenditures. Discretionary capital expenditures during the year primarily included approximately $1.2 billion attributable to Fiber and approximately $321 million attributable to Towers.Common stock dividend. During 2020, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately $2.1 billion in the aggregate, or $4.93 per common share, an increase of approximately 8% on a per share basis compared to dividends paid during 2019. ""In 2020, we added to our long history of consistently delivering solid growth through various market cycles and disruptions,"" stated Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. ""We are excited about how well positioned we are to support our growing number of customers by providing a comprehensive set of solutions across towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all necessary to build out next generation wireless networks. Looking forward, we believe we are in a great position to deliver on our annual dividend growth target of 7% to 8% while at the same time making significant investments in our business that we believe will generate attractive long-term returns and support future growth. We have also taken deliberate steps to complement our compelling total return opportunity with a lower risk profile by focusing on the U.S. market with our investment grade balance sheet, and we expect to have sufficient capacity to fund our discretionary investments in 2021 with free cash flow and incremental borrowings.""

Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the SEC.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations This press release includes presentations of Net income (as adjusted), including per share—diluted amounts, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Funds from Operations (""AFFO""), including per share amounts, Funds from Operations (""FFO""), including per share amounts, and Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"")). Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other real estate investment trusts (""REITs""). Our definition of FFO is consistent with guidelines from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts with the exception of the impact of income taxes in periods prior to our REIT conversion in 2014. In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein, we also provide Segment Site Rental Gross Margin, Segment Services and Other Gross Margin and Segment Operating Profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. In addition, we provide the components of certain GAAP measures, such as capital expenditures. Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our business. Among other things, management believes that: Net Income (as adjusted), including per share—diluted amounts, is useful to investors and other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors as it adjusts net income to exclude the impact of the Nontypical Items (as defined in ""Recent Developments""), which management believes are unusual (including with respect to magnitude), infrequent and not reasonably likely to recur in the near term, to provide further insight into our results of operations and underlying trends. Management also believes that identifying the impact of Nontypical Items as these adjustments provides more transparency and comparability across periods. There can be no assurances that such items will not recur in future periods. Net income (as adjusted), including per share—diluted amounts should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Separately, we are also disclosing Adjusted EBITDA as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, which management believes are unusual (including with respect to magnitude), infrequent and not reasonably likely to recur in the near term, to provide further insight into our results of operations and underlying trends. Management also believes that identifying the impact of Nontypical Items as these adjustments provides increased transparency and comparability across periods. There can be no assurances that such items will not recur in future periods. Adjusted EBITDA (including as further adjusted to exclude Nontypical Items) should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.AFFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that AFFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as it includes (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt and dividends on our preferred stock (in periods where applicable)) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures, and excludes the impact of our (a) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (b) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. Management notes that Crown Castle uses AFFO only as a performance measure. Separately, we are also disclosing AFFO as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, which management believes are unusual (including with respect to magnitude), infrequent and not reasonably likely to recur in the near term, to provide further insight into our results of operations and underlying trends. Management also believes that identifying the impact of Nontypical Items as adjustments provides increased transparency and comparability across periods. There can be no assurances that such items will not recur in future periods. AFFO (including as further adjusted to exclude Nontypical Items) should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.FFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that FFO may be used by investors or other interested parties as a basis to compare our financial performance with that of other REITs. FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion). FFO is not a key performance indicator used by Crown Castle. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations.Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is useful to investors or other interested parties in understanding the components of the year-over-year changes in our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. Management uses the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues to assess year-over-year growth rates for our rental activities, to evaluate current performance, to capture trends in rental rates, new leasing activities and tenant non-renewals in our core business, as well to forecast future results. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is not meant as an alternative measure of revenue and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing the performance of our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. We define our non-GAAP financial measures, segment measures and other calculations as follows: Non-GAAP Financial Measures Net Income (as adjusted). We define Net Income (as adjusted) as net income (loss) less other operating income resulting from the Nontypical Items, plus incremental operating expenses as a result of the Nontypical Items and asset write-downs as a result of the Nontypical Items. Net Income (as adjusted) per share—diluted. We define net income (as adjusted) per share—diluted as Net Income (as adjusted), divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, (income) loss from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. Separately, Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, reflects Adjusted EBITDA, less other operating income resulting from the Nontypical Items, plus incremental operating expenses as a result of the Nontypical Items. Adjusted Funds from Operations. We define Adjusted Funds from Operations as FFO before straight-lined revenue, straight-lined expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash portion of tax provision, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of non-cash interest expense, other (income) expense, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring charges (credits), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, (income) loss from discontinued operations and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, less sustaining capital expenditures. Separately, Adjusted Funds from Operations, as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, reflects Adjusted Funds from Operations, less other operating income resulting from the Nontypical Items, plus incremental operating expenses as a result of the Nontypical Items. AFFO per share. We define AFFO per share as AFFO, including as adjusted to exclude the impact of Nontypical Items, divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Funds from Operations. We define Funds from Operations as net income plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset write-down charges, less noncontrolling interest and cash paid for preferred stock dividends (in periods where applicable), and is a measure of funds from operations attributable to CCIC common stockholders. FFO per share. We define FFO per share as FFO divided by the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues. We define the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues as the sum of the change in GAAP site rental revenues related to (1) new leasing activity, including revenues from the construction of small cells and the impact of prepaid rent, (2) escalators and less (3) non-renewals of tenant contracts. Segment Measures Segment Site Rental Gross Margin. We define Segment Site Rental Gross Margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations. Segment Services and Other Gross Margin. We define Segment Services and Other Gross Margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other cost of operations. Segment Operating Profit. We define Segment Operating Profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, and segment other operating (income) expense, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment. All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable. Other Calculations Discretionary capital expenditures. We define discretionary capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects. Integration capital expenditures. We define integration capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made as a result of integrating acquired companies into our business. Sustaining capital expenditures. We define sustaining capital expenditures as those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as either discretionary or integration capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures. The tables set forth on the following pages reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures used herein to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on our management's current expectations as of the date of this news release. Statements that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward-looking statements. In addition, words such as ""estimate,"" ""see,"" ""anticipate,"" ""project,"" ""plan,"" ""intend,"" ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""likely,"" ""predicted,"" ""positioned,"" ""continue,"" ""target,"" and any variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include our full year 2021 Outlook and plans, projections, and estimates regarding (1) potential benefits, growth, returns, capabilities, opportunities and shareholder value which may be derived from our business, strategy, risk profile, assets, investments, acquisitions and dividends, (2) our business, strategy, strategic position, business model and capabilities and the strength thereof, (3) industry fundamentals and driving factors for improvements in such fundamentals, (4) our customers' investment, including investment cycles and the timing thereof, in network improvements (including 5G), the trends driving such investment and opportunities and demand for our assets created thereby, (5) our long-and short-term prospects and the trends, events and industry activities impacting our business, (6) opportunities we see to deliver value to our shareholders, (7) our dividends (including timing of payment thereof) and our dividend (including on a per share basis) growth rate, including its driving factors, and targets, (8) small cell backlog, (9) revenue growth in the Towers segment, (10) debt maturities, (11) strategic position of our portfolio of assets, (12) cash flows, including growth thereof, (13) leasing activity and the timing thereof, (14) tenant non-renewals, including the impact and timing thereof, (15) capital expenditures, including sustaining and discretionary capital expenditures, the timing thereof and any efficiencies that may result therefrom, and the discretionary capital budget and the funding (including capacity to fund) thereof, (16) straight-line adjustments, (17) the recurrence of Nontypical Items, (18) revenues and growth thereof and benefits derived therefrom, (19) net income (loss) (including on a per share basis and as adjusted for Nontypical Items), (20) Adjusted EBITDA (including as adjusted for Nontypical Items), including components thereof and growth thereof, (21) expenses, including interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (22) FFO (including on a per share basis) and growth thereof, (23) AFFO (including on a per share basis and as adjusted for Nontypical Items) and its components and growth thereof and corresponding driving factors, (24) Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and its components, including growth thereof and contributions therefrom, (25) our weighted-average common shares outstanding (including on a diluted basis) and growth thereof, (26) services contribution, (27) the long-term 5G small cell agreement with Verizon, (28) our growing number of customers, and (29) the utility of certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including prevailing market conditions and the following: Our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services.The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.Our Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.Failure to timely and efficiently execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the land interests under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.The restatement of our previously issued financial statements, the errors that resulted in such restatement, the material weakness that was identified in our internal control over financial reporting and the determination that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, could result in loss of investor confidence, shareholder litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations, any of which could cause the market value of our common stock or debt securities to decline or impact our ability to access the capital markets.New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.If we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.We may be vulnerable to security breaches or other unforeseen events that could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.Future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available through the SEC website at www.sec.gov or through our investor relations website at investor.crowncastle.com. We use our investor relations website to disclose information about us that may be deemed to be material.

2020-12-20	2020-12-20 20:56:58	CCI	Crown Castle International Corp.	The 5G Revolution Could Send These 3 Stocks Higher	"5G is here. The new networks are online and expanding, and customers – individual consumers, institutional users, and industrial applications – are starting to take advantage of the new technology. The advantages of 5G are already well-known: faster connections, more efficient upload and download capability, lower latency, greater security. 5G tech is essential for developing the full potential of autonomous vehicles and IoT projects. How it will impact ordinary life remains to be seen.Some of Wall Street’s top analysts have been taking the measure of the new network, and its probably effect on related companies – and their stocks. Using TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up the latest data on three such stocks that the analysts have tapped for gains in the growing 5G environment. CommScope Holding (COMM)We will start with CommScope, a hardware provider for network infrastructure. The company produces antennas for building and tower installation, base stations, and outdoor wireless system power supplies. As a holding company, these CommScope products are produced and marketed by subsidiaries, to customers worldwide.The company announced last month a partnership with Nokia on a passive-active antenna platform, promising a faster 5G rollout for customers. And earlier this month, CommScope announced a contract with the city of Wyandotte, Michigan, for networking installation, including 5G, and giving the company access to over 25,000 potential customers.CommScope reported $2.17 billion in Q3 revenue, up 3% year-over-year. The Broadband segment showed 20% year-over-year growth, and the free cash flow hit $350 million. JPMorgan’s 5-star analyst Samik Chatterjee elaborates on CommScope forward potential: “Our constructive view on shares of CommScope is led by expectations for an improving outlook for the Outdoor Wireless Segment which stands positioned to benefit from the ramp in 5G densification efforts for wireless networks, in combination with continuing resilient spending from cable/broadband networks.”""We expect the pace of investments in the wireline network to continue, led by bandwidth requirements to support peak usage, in addition to tailwinds stemming from initiatives such as RDOF and reclamation of satellite spectrum for 5G,"" the analyst added.In line with these comments, Chatterjee rates the stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $18 price target suggests a 35% upside in the coming year. (To watch Chatterjee’s track record, click here)Chatterjee is broadly in line with the rest of Wall Street, which has assigned COMM slightly more ""buy"" ratings than ""holds"" over the past three months -- and sees the stock growing about 19% over the next 12 months, to a target price of $15.80. (See COMM stock analysis on TipRanks)Crown Castle (CCI)The next stock on our list, Crown Castle, operates as a real estate investment trust, owning and managing cell network assets, including towers and transmitter locations. The company boasts over 40,000 towers, 70,000 operational small cells, and 80,000 miles of fiberoptic lines. Crown Castle’s network is part of the shared infrastructure supporting the wireless communications system in the US.The expansion of 5G networks has been good to Crown Castle, and the company has seen growth and expansion.In November, Crown Castle signed an agreement with DISH, which is looking to expand its 5G footprint. The lease agreement gives DISH rental rights on up to 20,000 towers, and includes fiber transport.Quarterly revenues have held steady between $1.4 and $1.49 billion all year, with Q3, the most recent, coming at the latter value. The company saw site rental revenue gain 4% yoy. Customer rollouts to 5G, and consequent need for additional tower sites, underlies the sound financial results.The sound quarterly results allowed the company to increase its quarterly dividend by 11%. Common share holders now receive $1.33 per common share, annualizing to $5.32 and giving a yield of 3.4%.Deutsche Bank analyst Matthew Niknam sees the DISH deal as part of an overall positive picture for Crown Castle: ""CCI is poised to be the early beneficiary of multiple new industry catalysts in upcoming years, including DISH's 5G build and C-Band spectrum deployments.""""Specifically, we believe its agreement with DISH for up to 20k sites puts it in a premier position to be the tower partner of choice, at least early on. Our analysis indicates DISH could easily account for 10% of CCI's Tower site leasing revenue by 2027E, with the agreement (conservatively) adding $15/share in value for CCI. Second, with ~70% of CCI's sites located in the top 100 markets, we believe its portfolio over indexes to markets most likely to see initial C-Band builds,"" the analyst added. To this end, Niknam rates CCI a Buy along with a $180 price target. This figure implies a 17% upside from current levels. (To watch Niknam’s track record, click here)So, that’s Deutsche Bank's view, let’s turn our attention now to rest of the Street: CCI's 3 Buys and 2 Holds coalesce into a Moderate Buy rating. Should the $170.25 average price target be met, about 11% upside could be in store. (See CCI stock analysis on TipRanks)Sierra Wireless (SWIR)Based in British Columbia, Canada, Sierra Wireless designs and manufactures wireless equipment for an international customer base. The company products include machine-to-machine and mobile computing devices for use on wireless networks, as well as modems, routers, and gateways for mobile broadband wireless. Sierra holds over 550 unique patents.Sierra’s focus on machine-to-machine systems make its hardware especially valuable for IoT applications. The company offers 5G capable routers and broadcast solutions for IoT networks, as well as the first 5G enabled vehicle router on the market.Turning to the financials and the stock, we see the company moving in two directions at once. Quarterly revenues have been falling this year, and Q3 came in at just $113 million – far down from the $144 million reported in Q2. While the quarter was generally down, the automotive business did show a 3.6% yoy increase.The company’s stock, however, has been on an upward trajectory, and with a 49% year-to-date gain has outperformed the S&P 500 index.Among the bulls is Colliers analyst Charles Anderson who calls SWIR a ""5G IoT play."" Anderson rates the stock a Buy along with a $20 price target. This target indicates the extent of his confidence – it implies a 40% one-year upside.

""I'm so proud of how our employees navigated through a pandemic and a significant carrier consolidation in the wireless market this year. We have a long history of consistently delivering compelling growth through various market cycles and disruptions, highlighting the strength of our business model and the compelling value creation opportunity we believe our strategy provides to shareholders.  ""As we look ahead, we have increased our annualized common stock dividend by 11% to $5.32 per share. With the strong demand we see for our Towers and Fiber infrastructure as our customers deploy additional cell sites and spectrum in response to the rapid growth in mobile data traffic, we expect approximately 6% growth in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenue across both our Towers and Fiber segments in 2021, supporting an expected acceleration in AFFO per share growth to approximately 10%. Our unique portfolio of assets positions us to benefit from what we expect will be a decade-long investment cycle as our customers deploy 5G, which we believe will start in earnest in 2021.  We believe our ability to offer towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all integral components of communications networks and are shared among multiple tenants, provides us the best opportunity to generate significant growth while delivering high returns for our shareholders. Based on the expected growth in data traffic and wireless carrier network investment, we believe the U.S. represents the best market in the world for communications infrastructure ownership, and we are pursuing that compelling opportunity with our comprehensive offering.""RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER  The table below sets forth select financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019.(in millions, except per share amounts)Q3 2020Q3 2019Change% Change    (As Restated)(c)    Site rental revenues$1,339$1,287+$52+4%  Net income (loss)$163$242-$79-33%  Net income (loss) per share—diluted(a)$0.38$0.51-$0.13-25%  Adjusted EBITDA(b)$883$853+$30+4%  AFFO(a)(b)$668$617+$51+8%  AFFO per share(a)(b)$1.56$1.47+$0.09+6%    (a) Attributable to CCIC common stockholders.

(c) See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for further information.HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE QUARTER  * Site rental revenues. Site rental revenues grew 4.0%, or $52 million, from third quarter 2019 to third quarter 2020, inclusive of approximately $70 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and a $18 million decrease in straight-lined revenues. The $70 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues represents approximately 5.5% growth, comprised of approximately 9.1% growth from new leasing activity and contracted tenant escalations, net of approximately 3.6% from tenant non-renewals.  * Net income. Net income for the third quarter 2020 was $163 million compared to $242 million during the third quarter of 2019 and was impacted by the retirement of $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes during July 2020, which resulted in a $95 million loss on the retirement of long-term obligations.  * Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $377 million, comprised of $20 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $357 million of discretionary capital expenditures. Discretionary capital expenditures during the quarter primarily included approximately $274 million attributable to Fiber and approximately $73 million attributable to Towers.  * Common stock dividend. During the quarter, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately $518 million in the aggregate, or $1.20 per common share, an increase of approximately 7% on a per share basis compared to the same period a year ago.  * Financing Activity. In July, Crown Castle utilized net proceeds from a June 2020 senior unsecured notes offering to retire an aggregate of $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes. Also during the quarter, all outstanding shares of Crown Castle's 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into approximately 14.5 million shares of Crown Castle common stock. These conversions increased the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for 2020 by approximately 6 million shares and reduced the annual preferred stock dividends paid by approximately $28 million when compared to full year 2019.  ""We believe we can deliver on our long-term annual dividend growth target of 7% to 8% while at the same time making investments in our business that will support future growth,"" stated Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. ""Looking to 2021, the portion of our small cell backlog we expect to put on air has a higher proportion of collocation nodes relative to recent years, reducing the capital intensity in that business. Due to this reduced capital intensity, combined with the completion of several large fiber expansion projects in 2020, we expect our discretionary capital expenditures to be approximately $400 million lower in 2021 when compared to 2019 while delivering AFFO per share growth above our long-term target. We anticipate the combination of lower capital expenditures and higher cash flow growth will allow us to fund our discretionary capital budget next year with free cash flow and incremental debt capacity, consistent with our Investment Grade credit profile.""OUTLOOKThis Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.

(b) See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations"" for further information and reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income (loss).  * The reduction to the 2020 Outlook primarily reflects an expected shift in the timing of Towers activity from the second half of 2020 to the first half of 2021. The change in the timing of Towers activity negatively impacts the expected Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues by approximately $20 million and services contribution from towers by approximately $50 million. In addition, straight-lined revenues from Towers for full year 2020 are expected to be approximately $20 million lower than previously expected, due to a combination of the timing of Towers activity as well as fewer lease extensions than previously forecasted.  * These changes are offset by approximately $10 million in lower expenses, approximately $30 million in lower interest expense and approximately $25 million in lower sustaining capital expenditures as compared to our prior 2020 Outlook.  * The chart below reconciles the components of expected growth in site rental revenues from 2020 to 2021 of $215 million to $260 million, inclusive of expected Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues during 2021 of $295 million to $335 million, or approximately 6%.  Chart 1: https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a44e7d91-5f00-438d-adfb-18a47577b833    * New leasing activity is expected to contribute $375 million to $405 million to 2021 Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues, consisting of new leasing activity from towers of $150 million to $160 million (compared to approximately $150 million expected in full year 2020), small cells of $65 million to $75 million (compared to approximately $70 million expected in full year 2020), and fiber solutions of $160 million to $170 million (compared to approximately $160 million expected in full year 2020).    * In addition, discretionary capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2021, which compares to an expected $1.6 billion in 2020 and $1.9 billion in 2019. Prepaid rent additions are expected to be approximately $550 million in 2021, which compares to approximately $450 million expected in full year 2020 and approximately $650 million in 2019.  * The expected decrease in discretionary capital expenditures of approximately $400 million from 2019 to 2021 primarily reflects an expected decrease in small cell capital expenditures supporting similar revenue growth due to an expected increase in collocation activity, and the expected completion of several large fiber expansion projects by the end of 2020 that resulted from prior acquisitions.  * The chart below reconciles the components of expected growth in AFFO from 2020 to 2021 of $300 million to $345 million.  Chart 2: https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/90382e94-ad47-47ab-8292-81511796c74a    * The expected contribution to 2021 AFFO growth of $60 million to $90 million from Other items is primarily tied to the conversions of preferred stock that occurred during the third quarter, which will reduce annual preferred stock dividends paid by approximately $85 million when compared to full year 2020.    * The increase in services contribution is a result of the expected increase in tower activity in 2021.  * The expected increase in expenses primarily reflects the combination of typical escalations and cost of living increases on the existing base of expenses, and incremental direct costs associated with Fiber revenue growth.  * Additional information is available in Crown Castle's quarterly Supplemental Information Package posted in the Investors section of our website.DIVIDEND INCREASE ANNOUNCEMENT  Crown Castle's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.33 per common share, representing an increase of approximately 11% over the previous quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share.

This nationwide portfolio of communications infrastructure connects cities and communities to essential data, technology and wireless service - bringing information, ideas and innovations to the people and businesses that need them. For more information on Crown Castle, please visit www.crowncastle.com.Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations  This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Funds from Operations (""AFFO""), including per share amounts, Funds from Operations (""FFO""), including per share amounts, and Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"")).Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other real estate investment trusts (""REITs""). Our definition of FFO is consistent with guidelines from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts with the exception of the impact of income taxes in periods prior to our REIT conversion in 2014.In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein, we also provide Segment Site Rental Gross Margin, Segment Services and Other Gross Margin and Segment Operating Profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. In addition, we provide the components of certain GAAP measures, such as capital expenditures.Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our business. Among other things, management believes that:  * Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.  * AFFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that AFFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as it includes (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt and dividends on our preferred stock (in periods where applicable)) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures, and excludes the impact of our (a) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (b) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. Management notes that Crown Castle uses AFFO only as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.  * FFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that FFO may be used by investors or other interested parties as a basis to compare our financial performance with that of other REITs. FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion). FFO is not a key performance indicator used by Crown Castle. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations.  * Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is useful to investors or other interested parties in understanding the components of the year-over-year changes in our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. Management uses the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues to assess year-over-year growth rates for our rental activities, to evaluate current performance, to capture trends in rental rates, new leasing activities and tenant non-renewals in our core business, as well to forecast future results. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is not meant as an alternative measure of revenue and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing the performance of our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP.We define our non-GAAP financial measures, segment measures and other calculations as follows:Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, (income) loss from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense.Adjusted Funds from Operations. We define Adjusted Funds from Operations as FFO before straight-lined revenue, straight-lined expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash portion of tax provision, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of non-cash interest expense, other (income) expense, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, acquisition and integration costs, and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, and less sustaining capital expenditures.AFFO per share. We define AFFO per share as AFFO divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.Funds from Operations. We define Funds from Operations as net income plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset write-down charges, less noncontrolling interest and cash paid for preferred stock dividends (in periods where applicable), and is a measure of funds from operations attributable to CCIC common stockholders.FFO per share. We define FFO per share as FFO divided by the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues. We define the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues as the sum of the change in GAAP site rental revenues related to (1) new leasing activity, including revenues from the construction of small cells and the impact of prepaid rent, (2) escalators and less (3) non-renewals of tenant contracts.Segment MeasuresSegment Site Rental Gross Margin. We define Segment Site Rental Gross Margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations.Segment Services and Other Gross Margin. We define Segment Services and Other Gross Margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other cost of operations.Segment Operating Profit. We define Segment Operating Profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment.All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable.Other CalculationsDiscretionary capital expenditures. We define discretionary capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects.Integration capital expenditures. We define integration capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made as a result of integrating acquired companies into our business.Sustaining capital expenditures. We define sustaining capital expenditures as those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as either discretionary or integration capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures.The tables set forth on the following pages reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures used herein to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations to Comparable GAAP Financial Measures:Reconciliation of Historical Adjusted EBITDA: For the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended For the Twelve   Months Ended   September 30,   2020 September 30,   2019 September 30,   2020 September 30,   2019 December 31,   2019  (in millions)  (As Restated)(d)   (As Restated)(d)    Net income (loss)$163  $242  $548  $652  $860   Adjustments to increase (decrease) net income (loss):           Asset write-down charges3  2  10  13  19   Acquisition and integration costs2  4  9  10  13   Depreciation, amortization and accretion406  388  1,207  1,175  1,572   Amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments5  5  14  15  20   Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs(a)168  173  521  510  683   (Gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations95  —  95  2  2   Interest income—  (2) (2) (5) (6)  Other (income) expense3  5  3  6  (1)  (Benefit) provision for income taxes5  5  16  15  21   Stock-based compensation expense33  29  106  90  116   Adjusted EBITDA(b)(c)$883  $853  $2,527  $2,483  $3,299        Reconciliation of Current Outlook for Adjusted EBITDA: Full Year 2020 Full Year 2021  (in millions)Outlook Outlook  Net income (loss)$799to$839 $957to$1,037  Adjustments to increase (decrease) net income (loss):         Asset write-down charges$10to$20 $15to$25  Acquisition and integration costs$7to$17 $0to$8  Depreciation, amortization and accretion$1,589to$1,639 $1,615to$1,710  Amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments$18to$20 $17to$19  Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs(a)$683to$693 $663to$708  (Gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations$95to$95 $0to$100  Interest income$(4)to$0 $(3)to$0  Other (income) expense$2to$4 $(1)to$1  (Benefit) provision for income taxes$17to$25 $18to$26  Stock-based compensation expense$134to$138 $145to$149  Adjusted EBITDA(b)(c)$3,409to$3,429 $3,584to$3,629              (a) See reconciliation of ""components of current outlook for interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs"" for a discussion of non-cash interest expense.

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis news release contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on our management's current expectations as of the date of this news release. Statements that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward-looking statements. In addition, words such as ""estimate,"" ""see,"" ""anticipate,"" ""project,"" ""plan,"" ""intend,"" ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""likely,"" ""predicted,"" ""positioned,"" ""continue,"" ""target,"" and any variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include our full year 2020 and 2021 Outlook and plans, projections, and estimates regarding (1) potential benefits, growth, returns, capabilities, opportunities and shareholder value which may be derived from our business, assets, investments, acquisitions and dividends, (2) our business, strategy, strategic position, business model and capabilities and the strength thereof, (3) industry fundamentals and driving factors for improvements in such fundamentals, (4) our customers' investment, including investment cycles and the timing thereof, in network improvements (including 5G), the trends driving such improvements and opportunities and demand for our assets created thereby, (5) our long-and short-term prospects and the trends, events and industry activities impacting our business, (6) opportunities we see to deliver value to our shareholders, (7) our dividends (including timing of payment thereof) and our dividend (including on a per share basis) growth rate, including its driving factors, and targets, (8) expected completion of fiber expansion projects, (9) small cell backlog, (10) debt maturities, (11) strategic position of our portfolio of assets, (12) cash flows, including growth thereof, (13) leasing activity and the timing thereof, (14) tenant non-renewals, including the impact and timing thereof, (15) capital expenditures, including sustaining and discretionary capital expenditures, the timing thereof and any efficiencies that may result therefrom, and the discretionary capital budget and the funding thereof, (16) straight-line adjustments, (17) revenues and growth thereof and benefits derived therefrom, (18) net income (loss) (including on a per share basis), (19) Adjusted EBITDA, including components thereof and growth thereof, (20) expenses, including interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (21) FFO (including on a per share basis) and growth thereof, (22) AFFO (including on a per share basis) and its components and growth thereof and corresponding driving factors, (23) Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and its components, including growth thereof and contributions therefrom, (24) our weighted-average common shares outstanding (including on a diluted basis) and growth thereof, (25) services contribution, (26) pre-paid rent, (27) appointment of directors, including the effective date thereof, and (28) the utility of certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including prevailing market conditions and the following:  * Our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).  * A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services.  * The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.  * Our Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.  * Failure to timely and efficiently execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.  * Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.  * We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.  * Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  * As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.  * New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.  * If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the land interests under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.  * Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.  * The restatement of our previously issued financial statements, the errors that resulted in such restatement, the material weakness that was identified in our internal control over financial reporting and the determination that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, could result in loss of investor confidence, shareholder litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations, any of which could cause the market value of our common stock or debt securities to decline or impact our ability to access the capital markets.  * New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.  * If we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.  * If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.  * Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.  * We may be vulnerable to security breaches or other unforeseen events that could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.  * Future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.  * Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.  * Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.  * REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.  * The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available through the SEC website at www.sec.gov or through our investor relations website at investor.crowncastle.com. We use our investor relations website to disclose information about us that may be deemed to be material. We encourage investors, the media and others interested in us to visit our investor relations website from time to time to review up-to-date information or to sign up for e-mail alerts to be notified when new or updated information is posted on the site.As used in this release, the term ""including,"" and any variation thereof, means ""including without limitation.""   CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP.

These outstanding directors have been instrumental in enabling Crown Castle to advance from a startup to the national leader we are today. We wish them all the best in their future endeavors when they depart from the Board following the 2021 Annual Meeting.”Jay Brown, Crown Castle’s Chief Executive Officer, said, “The collective advice, oversight and wisdom of these directors have been significant drivers in the creation of Crown Castle’s unmatched portfolio of towers, small cell networks and fiber.

(c) As issued on April 29, 2020.&quot;In the second quarter, we generated solid results that were in line with our expectations as our business continues to perform well during this period of unprecedented uncertainty,&quot; stated Jay Brown, Crown Castle’s Chief Executive Officer. &quot;We continue to anticipate a significant increase in industry activity in the second half of this year as our carrier customers invest to improve their existing networks and as 5G investments ramp. Although the full rebound in overall industry activity on towers is taking a bit more time to materialize than we previously expected, we remain on track to generate at least 7% growth in AFFO per share this year. Looking beyond this year, I am excited about what will likely be another decade-long investment cycle for our customers with the deployment of 5G, and see the potential for our AFFO per share growth to improve next year.&quot;We believe our ability to offer towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all integral components of communications networks and are shared among multiple tenants, provides us the best opportunity to generate significant growth while delivering high returns for our shareholders. We believe that the U.S. represents the best market in the world for communications infrastructure ownership, and we are pursuing that compelling opportunity with our comprehensive offering. As we look forward, I am excited about the opportunity we see for Crown Castle to deliver long-term value to our shareholders while delivering dividend per share growth of 7% to 8% per year. Over the past several weeks, we have had the opportunity to engage with many of our shareholders. We have appreciated the thoughtful exchange of ideas during those discussions as well as the feedback they have given us. During these conversations, we heard two consistent points of investor feedback: they want more visibility into how our strategy and business are performing and they would like us to make certain improvements to our corporate governance practices. To address this feedback, we will discuss some increased disclosure around our small cell and fiber strategy during our earnings call tomorrow and, as we disclosed in a separate press release today, we are making changes to our corporate governance.&quot;RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER  The table below sets forth select financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019.(in millions, except per share amounts)Q2 2020Q2 2019Change% Change    (As Restated)(c)    Site rental revenues$1,319$1,263+$56+4%  Net income (loss)$200$216-$16-7%  Net income (loss) per share—diluted(a)$0.41$0.45-$0.04-9%  Adjusted EBITDA(b)$831$827+$4—%  AFFO(a)(b)$609$589+$20+3%  AFFO per share(a)(b)$1.45$1.41+$0.04+3%                (a) Attributable to CCIC common stockholders.

The $69 million in Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues represents approximately 5.6% growth, comprised of approximately 9.4% growth from new leasing activity and contracted tenant escalations, net of approximately 3.8% from tenant non-renewals.  * Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $414 million, comprised of $24 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $390 million of discretionary capital expenditures. Discretionary capital expenditures included approximately $295 million attributable to Fiber, approximately $88 million attributable to Towers, and approximately $7 million attributable to Other.  * Common stock dividend. During the quarter, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately $500 million in the aggregate, or $1.20 per common share, an increase of approximately 7% on a per share basis compared to the same period a year ago.  * Financing Activity. In April, Crown Castle issued $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, with a combination of 10-year and 30-year maturities, resulting in a weighted average maturity and coupon of 18 years and approximately 3.6%, respectively. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.  In June, Crown Castle issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, with a combination of 5-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities, resulting in a weighted average maturity and coupon of 16 years and approximately 2.4%, respectively. In July, net proceeds from the offering were used to retire $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate, resulting in a $95 million loss on the retirement of debt. After giving effect to the refinancing of the outstanding senior unsecured notes, Crown Castle had approximately $18.9 billion of total debt outstanding.&quot;We are excited about the significant network investments our customers are pursuing as they deploy 5G, and how well we are positioned with our comprehensive infrastructure offering across towers and fiber to meet our customers’ needs and create significant value for our shareholders,&quot; stated Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. &quot;By opportunistically accessing the investment grade bond market twice in recent months, we further strengthened our balance sheet by extending the maturity of our debt and reducing our cost of capital. We believe our liquidity position is strong with nearly $5 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility and no meaningful debt maturities until 2022, providing us with confidence that we are well positioned to navigate the current environment while investing in assets that we believe will add to long-term growth in dividends per share.&quot;OUTLOOKThis Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.

For more information on Crown Castle, please visit www.crowncastle.com.   Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other CalculationsThis press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Funds from Operations (&quot;AFFO&quot;), including per share amounts, Funds from Operations (&quot;FFO&quot;), including per share amounts, and Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&quot;GAAP&quot;)).Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other real estate investment trusts (&quot;REITs&quot;). Our definition of FFO is consistent with guidelines from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts with the exception of the impact of income taxes in periods prior to our REIT conversion in 2014.In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein, we also provide Segment Site Rental Gross Margin, Segment Services and Other Gross Margin and Segment Operating Profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. In addition, we provide the components of certain GAAP measures, such as capital expenditures.Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our business. Among other things, management believes that:  * Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.      * AFFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that AFFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as it includes (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt and dividends on our preferred stock) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures, and excludes the impact of our (a) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (b) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. Management notes that Crown Castle uses AFFO only as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.      * FFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that FFO may be used by investors or other interested parties as a basis to compare our financial performance with that of other REITs. FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion). FFO is not a key performance indicator used by Crown Castle. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations.      * Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is useful to investors or other interested parties in understanding the components of the year-over-year changes in our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. Management uses the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues to assess year-over-year growth rates for our rental activities, to evaluate current performance, to capture trends in rental rates, new leasing activities and tenant non-renewals in our core business, as well to forecast future results. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is not meant as an alternative measure of revenue and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing the performance of our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP.We define our non-GAAP financial measures, segment measures and other calculations as follows:Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, (income) loss from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense.Adjusted Funds from Operations. We define Adjusted Funds from Operations as FFO before straight-lined revenue, straight-lined expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash portion of tax provision, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of non-cash interest expense, other (income) expense, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, acquisition and integration costs, and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, and less sustaining capital expenditures.AFFO per share. We define AFFO per share as AFFO divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.Funds from Operations. We define Funds from Operations as net income plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset write-down charges, less noncontrolling interest and cash paid for preferred stock dividends, and is a measure of funds from operations attributable to CCIC common stockholders.FFO per share. We define FFO per share as FFO divided by the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues. We define the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues as the sum of the change in GAAP site rental revenues related to (1) new leasing activity, including revenues from the construction of small cells and the impact of prepaid rent, (2) escalators and less (3) non-renewals of tenant contracts.Segment MeasuresSegment Site Rental Gross Margin. We define Segment Site Rental Gross Margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations.Segment Services and Other Gross Margin. We define Segment Services and Other Gross Margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other cost of operations.Segment Operating Profit. We define Segment Operating Profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment.All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable.Other CalculationsDiscretionary capital expenditures. We define discretionary capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects.Integration capital expenditures. We define integration capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made as a result of integrating acquired companies into our business.Sustaining capital expenditures. We define sustaining capital expenditures as those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as either discretionary or integration capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures.The tables set forth on the following pages reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures used herein to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations to Comparable GAAP Financial Measures:Reconciliation of Historical Adjusted EBITDA: For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended For the Twelve   Months Ended   June 30, 2020 June 30, 2019 June 30, 2020 June 30, 2019 December 31,  2019  (in millions)  (As Restated)(d)   (As Restated)(d)    Net income (loss)$200  $216  $386  $409  $860   Adjustments to increase (decrease) net income (loss):           Asset write-down charges3  6  7  12  19   Acquisition and integration costs2  2  7  6  13   Depreciation, amortization and accretion402  393  801  787  1,572   Amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments4  5  9  10  20   Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs(a)178  169  353  337  683   (Gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations—  1  —  2  2   Interest income(1) (1) (2) (3) (6)  Other (income) expense—  —  —  1  (1)  (Benefit) provision for income taxes6  4  11  10  21   Stock-based compensation expense37  32  73  61  116   Adjusted EBITDA(b)(c)$831  $827  $1,645  $1,632  $3,299     (a)    See the reconciliation of &quot;components of historical interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs&quot; herein for a discussion of non-cash interest expense.

Statements that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward-looking statements. In addition, words such as &quot;estimate,&quot; &quot;see,&quot; &quot;anticipate,&quot; &quot;project,&quot; &quot;plan,&quot; &quot;intend,&quot; &quot;believe,&quot; &quot;expect,&quot; &quot;likely,&quot; &quot;predicted,&quot; &quot;positioned,&quot; &quot;continue,&quot; &quot;target,&quot; and any variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include our Outlook and plans, projections, and estimates regarding (1) potential benefits, growth, returns, opportunities and tenant and shareholder value which may be derived from our business, assets, investments, acquisitions and dividends, (2) our business, strategy, strategic position, business model and capabilities and the strength thereof, (3) industry fundamentals and driving factors for improvements in such fundamentals, (4) our customers' investment, including investment cycles, in network improvements (including 5G), the trends driving such improvements and opportunities created thereby, (5) impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, (6) our long-and short-term prospects and the trends, events and industry activities impacting our business, (7) opportunities we see to deliver value to our shareholders, (8) our dividends and our dividend (including on a per share basis) growth rate, including its driving factors, and targets, (9) debt maturities, (10) strategic position of our portfolio of assets, (11) assumed conversion of preferred stock and the impact therefrom, (12) cash flows, including growth thereof, (13) leasing activity, (14) tenant non-renewals, including the impact and timing thereof, (15) capital expenditures, including sustaining and discretionary capital expenditures, and the timing thereof, (16) straight-line adjustments, (17) revenues and growth thereof and benefits derived therefrom, (18) net income (loss) (including on a per share basis), (19) Adjusted EBITDA, including the impact of the timing of certain components thereof and growth thereof, (20) expenses, including interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (21) FFO (including on a per share basis) and growth thereof, (22) AFFO (including on a per share basis) and growth thereof and corresponding driving factors, (23) Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and its components, including contributions therefrom, (24) our weighted-average common shares outstanding (including on a diluted basis) and growth thereof, (25) services contribution, and (26) the utility of certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions prevailing market conditions and the following:  * Our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).  * A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services.  * The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.  * Our Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.  * Failure to timely and efficiently execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.  * Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments and our 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.  * We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.  * Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  * As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.  * New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.  * If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the land interests under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.  * Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.  * The restatement of our previously issued financial statements, the errors that resulted in such restatement, the material weakness that was identified in our internal control over financial reporting and the determination that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, could result in loss of investor confidence, shareholder litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations, any of which could cause the market value of our common stock or debt securities to decline or impact our ability to access the capital markets.  * New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.  * If we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.  * If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.  * Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.  * We may be vulnerable to security breaches or other unforeseen events that could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.  * Future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.  * Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.  * If we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (prior to or in connection with the automatic conversion in August 2020), in cash, common stock, or any combination of cash and common stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our status as a REIT.  * Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.  * REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.  * The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available through the SEC website at www.sec.gov or through our investor relations website at investor.crowncastle.com. We use our investor relations website to disclose information about us that may be deemed to be material.

2020-05-29	2020-05-29 16:31:42	CCI	Crown Castle International Corp.	The 5 Best 5G Stocks on the Market Today for Investors	Just a few months ago, 5G was the market catalyst on every investor's mind. But when the novel coronavirus started to grab the headlines, the promise of a revamped mobile network took a backseat. To be sure, coronavirus news appears to be leading the charge when it comes to movement on the stock market. That being said, however, choosing a few 5G stocks to buy during this downturn is a good way to hedge for the future. The beneficiaries in the 5G space come from many different areas. From network providers to chipmakers, there are a lot of sectors that look poised to profit from the introduction of 5G.  * 7 Red-Hot Vaccine Stocks Racing to Develop a Coronavirus Cure With all of that in mind, here's a look at five companies that should ride the 5G wave this year:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS)  * AT&T (NYSE:T)  * Nokia (NYSE:NOK)  * Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI)  * Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)So, let's dive in. 5G Stocks to Buy: Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com One of my favorite picks for 5G is Skyworks Solutions, a semiconductor firm headquartered in Irvine, California.The firm suffered some coronavirus-related pain when it released its fiscal second-quarter results. Like the rest of its peers, management had to downshift its expectations for the current quarter and was unable to offer long-term predictions.However, Skyworks Solutions does in fact have a bright long-term future. While tension between the U.S. and China does offer a potential roadblock, Skyworks' business with Huawei has been hurt by the trade war which could continue to weigh on the firm's future revenue. That said, if Skyworks is able to secure a deal with Samsung to supply the phone maker with 5G chips, it could help offset some of the Huawei pain. Additionally, Skyworks also has a solid relationship with Apple, which should continue to pay off as the firm rolls out new iPhone versions. Plus, Skyworks is carrying no long-term debt and has cultivated a sound cash pile. That's going to be essential for the firm to get through the coronavirus crisis during the current quarter, and makes SWKS stock a much safer investment than some of its heavily-leveraged peers.  AT&T (T)Source: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.com Another beneficiary of the 5G revolutions is T stock. AT&T has an impressive future plan that could put the telecom giant at the top of the pack if management is able to execute. The firm's wireless business has been booming, even offering a revenue increase in the first quarter despite the pandemic. As far as future growth, the firm is banking on a huge 5G rollout this summer, at which time current customers are likely to buy new devices in order to access the faster speeds. Plus, AT&T is finally putting its strategic acquisitions to good use with a new streaming service -HBO Max -- that launched this past Wednesday.Moreover, the firm has said 5G is &quot;transforming the future&quot; -- likely a nod to the firm's extensive plans to create an ecosystem in which customers can bundle their streaming service together with their wireless network. The advertising potential from that kind of ecosystem is incredible.  * 7 Low-Rated Stocks to Sell Before They Drag You Down So while AT&T offers a compelling buy-case, it's important to note that the firm is highly leveraged after the past few years of transforming itself. In turn, this is not the best-case scenario when you're marching into a stark economic downturn. However, if you're willing to take on that risk, T stock looks like one of the best 5G stocks to buy. Nokia (NOK)Source: RistoH / Shutterstock.com Nokia has had a rough year, as the firm muddled its way through the U.S.-China trade war and was then hit once again by the coronavirus pandemic. It's been a long time since investors were confident in the direction of NOK stock. But with the introduction of 5G on the horizon, Nokia looks like it could be a winning supplier.Nokia's first-quarter results were impressive, as the firm brokered 70 commercial 5G deals and installed 21 live networks. What's more, the firm didn't see demand wane at all in Q1 despite the challenges presented by coronavirus. Q2 is a different story, though, as CEO Rajeev Suri cautioned that the large-scale shutdowns would have an impact on the company's results. However, it's expected to make a solid recovery and finish the year strong.Moreover, Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold says Nokia offers the potential of better returns because of its depressed share price. Although, he admitted it's not quite as safe as competitors like LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC):&quot;I do think that Ericsson has executed better and is ahead in technology and therefore is a better company for 5G. Nokia has made mistakes, and they've upset customers and they're behind. That said, I think an investor can make a bigger return investing in Nokia than in Ericsson…But we like both of these companies because of the 5G theme.&quot;That said, Leopold gives NOK stock a $5.50 price target -- suggesting a nearly 40% upside from where shares are trading today. Crown Castle (CCI)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Tower REITs that rent out the infrastructure and space that wireless firms need to roll out a new network are another way to capitalize on 5G stocks. And while there are a few players in the industry, Crown Castle has a compelling value proposition because of its position in the U.S. market.Oppenheimer's Timothy Horan named CCI stock as a good 5G pick, fining the firm an &quot;outperform&quot; rating with a $175 price target. Horan noted that CCI is uniquely positioned because of the firm's focus on small cells, which are able to support more data.  * 3 Social Media Stocks to Trade Out of the Covid-19 Crisis He sees the market for small cells growing from 100,000 to 1 million in the US, a compelling reason to consider CCI stock:&quot;We expect small cells will eventually cover half the U.S. population, or 160 million people. This would be more than 1 million small cells in the U.S., up from about 100,000 today and about 250,000 macro cell sites.&quot; Apple (AAPL)Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.com Buying Apple stock isn't exactly a pure-play on the 5G revolution, but it offers investors a way to play the trend without jumping in headfirst. Apple stands to make a lot of money in the coming years as people upgrade their devices in order to make them 5G compatible. That said, Apple's upcoming iPhone model is expected to see a surge in demand as early adopters switch out their phones.Additionally, Apple has created a recurring revenue model that allows people to pay a subscription fee in order to continuously upgrade their phones. This method is a good way to ensure there's always money coming through the door. And with that, the leap from 4G to 5G is going to be a compelling reason for more people to sign up for the program.However, if 5G isn't the boom investors are expecting it to be, Apple is a safe pick because of its solid business and iron-clad financials. The company has enough cash to get through almost anything, which should give investors some comfort during uncertain times. Therefore, it makes the cut among 5G stocks because the new network will offer a powerful incentive for users to upgrade their phones over the next few quarters.Laura Hoy has a Finance degree from Duquesne University and has been writing about financial markets for the past 8 years.

For investors, this means it's time to think about 5G stocks.5G will not only be faster, but it will provide more bandwidth. This means that we, and the companies that provide us with data, can provide more data simultaneously.If I can lean on the analogy of water through a hose -- not only will the water move faster through the hose, but the hose will also increase in size. This is going to mean that wireless connections will be as fast, and in some places faster, than the available wireline services.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt will mean technologies like smart cars and everything provided through cloud services will be accessed in near real time, wherever you are. It will also change providers' ability to share content like movies, games or teleconferences. Along the way, the companies facilitating all of this could see enormous upside in their share prices.  * 7 Red-Hot Vaccine Stocks Racing to Develop a Coronavirus Cure And the seven 5G stocks looking to the future that I feature below are laying the tracks for the next telecom expansion across the U.S. and the world.  * Ciena (NYSE:CIEN)  * Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)  * Lumentum (NASDAQ:LITE)  * American Tower REIT (NYSE:AMT)  * Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI)  * Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)  * Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) 5G Stocks to Buy: Ciena (CIEN)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com This optical networking firm has been around since 1992. It's been around so long, it's headquartered in quiet Hanover, Maryland, since Silicon Valley was just glimmer in geeks' eyes back then.It was way ahead of its time. It specializes in optical networking equipment. The thing was, back then, fiber optic cable was as scarce as hen's teeth. It was a play on the future of the internet.Before the tech bubble burst, CIEN stock traded as high as $847 a share. But those were the days when brokers were telling clients that growth was the new income and a growth stock wasn't respectable if it didn't have a triple-digit price-earnings ratio.But CIEN made it through, which is testament to its management and its technology. Now, 20 years later, it is one of the leading companies in the vibrant and expanding optical networking space.The stock is up 56% in the past 12 months and 28% year to date. Yet, it still only trades at a P/E of 30. Intel (INTC)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The computer you're using to read this likely has an Intel chip or two inside it. It's the largest semiconductor company in the world and invented the x86 chip that sits in almost every personal computer.  And next month it will celebrate its 51st birthday.Intel has had its struggles remaining at the top of the chip heap. Management didn't get in the mobility sector until it was too late, and missed a huge opportunity in the smartphone world. But it is well-positioned in the internet of things (IOT), and has found opportunities in markets like 5G, AI, memory and networking as well.The competition is tough. CEO Bob Swan is an industry veteran but not a career Intel guy, and he took over in January 2019. Much of his leadership career was operating as a CFO for various large tech firms, so it will be interesting to see if he can keep INTC moving in the right directions.  * 7 Cheap Stocks to Buy With Great Potential So far, so good. The stock is up 42% in the past year and 3% year to date. It also delivers a solid 2.1% dividend. And besides INTC itself, the 5G upgrade offers investors the chance to buy potentially the &quot;next Intel&quot; today. Lumentum (LITE)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com This company is also in the optical networking sector, but it launched just five years ago. And instead of focusing on the optical switching aspects, LITE focuses on the distribution and transmission of fiber optic networks.It also makes a variety of lasers for numerous applications. The lasers are used to build equipment in industries as varied as the automotive sector to mobile phones and semiconductors. And they are used for 3D sensing equipment.Just as cloud computing ultimately needs real hardware to operate, mobile networks need the fastest data transmission possible. And for now, that's fiber optic cables.That means that the greater the global demand for 5G, the more business LITE stands to gain. Also, the more we rely on advanced technologies, the more demand there will be to build more advance devices.The stock is up 72% in the past year and is off 9% year to date. American Tower REIT (AMT)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com As you well know, mobile signals need mobile transmission towers. AMT is one of the top tower companies in the world, and it's one of the top 5G stocks to buy.It has operations across North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia. Since towers are property, AMT became a real estate investment trust (REIT), which has tax advantages for the company and the shareholders. All REITs consider shareholders direct owners and distribute net income via a dividend.5G is going to need towers because its antenna are different than previous generations of telecom services. Given the fact that AMT already has more than 180,000 towers around the world, and a solid history as a reliable partner, it's well positioned for the 5G wave.It continues to acquire smaller broadcast companies around the globe, including India and Africa, where mobile telecom is much denser than traditional wireline services.  * 25 Stocks to Buy for the Reopening Rally The stock is up 27% in the past year and 12% year to date. It also provides a 1.7% dividend. It's among my top stocks for the worldwide 5G upgrade taking hold now. Crown Castle International (CCI)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com This is another tower company, but it has two difference from AMT. First, it focuses its operations on the U.S., where it has over 40,000 towers.Second, it also has a significant small cells business for denser spots like office buildings and stadiums, as well as more than 80,000 miles of fiber optic cable. These are key sectors for 5G stocks because 5G has unique challenges in cities, and venues like stadiums will have growing challenges as events become carried on live streams and guests will be sharing across social media.CCI is also a REIT and is delivering an impressive 3% dividend currently. The stock is up 34% in the past 12 months, and 19% year to date.Owning both AMT and CCI stock captures a significant amount of the potential 5G transmission sector, but both stocks are trading at premiums currently. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com This telecom chipmaker has been around since 1985 and has been a major player in the mobility revolution. Its origins were building out CDMA telecom technology for commercial trucking operations. When mobile phones came out, one of the leading channels used for phones in the U.S. became CDMA.Now, CDMA and GSM run all the phones around the world and most chips can switch from one channel to the other if necessary.QCOM makes more money on licensing its patents than it does on actually shipping chips. That means it doesn't have to build massively expensive chip plants, and focuses on design rather than production.However, Qualcomm has run into antitrust issues. A few years ago it had to pay out massive fines to China and other countries that sued it because of its monopolistic hold on mobile phone infrastructure.But those days are behind it, and it is certainly going to be a major player as 5G starts to roll out globally.The stock is up 20% in the past year and off almost 12% year to date. It has an impressive 3.2% dividend and is trading at a reasonable P/E of 23. Texas Instruments (TXN)Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com Many people remember TXN as the company that built the coolest calculators around. And the fact is, it continues to make the default calculators for most high school students.But Texas Instruments, which has been around since 1930, is also one of the biggest chipmakers in the world. Nearly 80% of its revenue comes from analog chips and embedded processors. Analog chips convert analog inputs -- like voice -- into digital form for processing. And embedded processors are dedicated systems that provide a function within a larger piece of equipment or system. Think a sound system inside a car.These aren't sexy, but they are everywhere. And TXN can produce high-quality, reliable chips and processors in huge quantities. With everything going digital, that means TXN is in a growth business and is already producing at scale, and making money doing it.Not every aspect of our digital lives has to be built from cutting-edge designs; keeping some things simple makes high-performance equipment easier to maintain and more reliable. And TXN is certainly keeping up with the biggest trends, including 5G, but it is a significant supporting player, not a headliner.The stock is up nearly 14% in the past 12 months, and off 10% year to date. It also offers a durable and generous 3% dividend.Texas Instruments and other hardware makers I've mentioned here today are great examples of 5G stocks that stand to benefit from the 5G revolution.And I see even better potential with the companies that are making this massive infrastructure upgrade possible in the first place! The 5G Buildout Is an Incredible Opportunity for Investors Right NowWithin two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. With 5G, we'll have cable modem speeds on any device; no need to plug in. That's a big deal for rural areas … the very same areas that are also key to President Donald Trump's reelection. So, by pushing 5G over the goal line, Trump will deliver a big win for his base -- and strike a blow against Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies.But, in the big picture, 5G is about much more than trade wars and faster downloads. Because 5G is 100 times faster than 4G, it'll allow your internet devices to work in real time. That advancement is a game changer for tech companies.With the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity with 5G stocks now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics … but they can't compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it's got ultra-fast 5G. That's how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I'm targeting is enjoying an influx of big money on Wall Street, and it has strong fundamentals, too -- making it an A-rated &quot;Strong Buy&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system.Click here to watch my new, free briefing on this extraordinary technology and the opportunity with 5G stocks.When you do, you'll see how to claim a free copy of my investment report, The King of 5G &quot;Turbo Button&quot; Technology, which has full details on this company -- and what makes it such a great buy now.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett. In his latest feat, Louis discovered the &quot;Master Key&quot; to profiting from the biggest tech revolution of this (or any) generation. Louis Navellier may hold some of the aforementioned securities in one or more of his newsletters.

2020-05-28	2020-05-28 19:34:41	CCI	Crown Castle International Corp.	9 Best REITs to Buy for COVID-19 Protection	The real estate sector has, simply put, been a loser in 2020.Real estate investment trusts (REITs), which own and operate various types of properties and facilities, are off nearly 11% versus a 6% decline for the S&P; 500&#92;. But there's a world of difference separating the sector's best REITs and its worst.Much of the pain in real estate has come courtesy of retail-focused companies, many of which have lost more than 50% of their value as investors correctly surmised that stay-at-home orders would minimize shopping trips and curtail customer spending. Office REITs have experienced outsized struggles, too, as shuttered businesses are unable to pay rents, and as large-scale work-from-home strategies have investors rethinking the future of office space.Not every REIT sector has been equally affected, however. Some REITs are riding out the pandemic shutdowns relatively unscathed - and some are even benefiting from the recent sea changes.However, while defensive business models are an important characteristic to have when determining REITs to buy, other qualities should be considered, too. Solid balance sheets are a must. Conservative payouts, which leave room for dividends to be easily covered in the event of a shock, and raised in the future when all is well, are ideal, too.Here are nine of the best REITs to buy not just for their durable businesses, but also their financial strength and dividend coverage.

Oppenheimer Bullish On Wireless Services, Upgrades American Tower, Crown Castle	While the coronavirus has caused uncertainty and sparked recessionary fears, temporarily slowing new network builds, tower growth appears set to reaccelerate, according to Oppenheimer.The American Tower, Crown Castle Analyst Timothy Horan upgraded American Tower Corp (NYSE: AMT) and Crown Castle International Corp (NYSE: CCI) from Perform to Outperform and set price targets of $270 and $175, respectively.The American Tower, Crown Castle Thesis American Tower and Crown Castle are both witnessing strong and accelerating demand from carriers, with mobile broadband becoming more important than ever, Horan said in the Friday upgrade note.

(NASDAQ: TMUS) this year, buildouts by DISH Network Corp (NASDAQ: DISH), strong spend by Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) and rural fixed wireless boosted by government subsidies.Massive spectrum auctions scheduled for the back half of 2020 are also positives, he said.Oppenheimer projects that tower volume growth will accelerate from 4% in 2019 to 9% within two years from small cell strength.&quot;Various channel checks on 5G builds this week confirm our optimism, as the industry's wireless operators are seeing fixed wireless/enterprise use cases,&quot; Horan said.

Overnight futures presage potential declines on Friday. The VIX, often referred to as the 'fear gauge' for the market, remains at an enormously elevated 72. Any investors who believes the worst is over probably is being too optimistic.Still, it does seem like U.S. authorities are getting their arms around the potential impact of the coronavirus. That raises hopes that investors will do the same.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOf course, one key question remains: are U.S. stocks actually cheap? Yes, the S&P 500 declined 29% in a month. But there was no shortage of investors who believed valuations were questionable heading into 2020. Recession risk almost certainly has risen, and the short-term effects of the coronavirus-driven shutdown will add up to be material. There's a case that most, and maybe all, of that decline is justified.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip Friday's big stock charts focus on three large-cap names for which investors are debating that very question. As they show, the question has not been answered. Nvidia (NVDA)Source: Provided by Finviz Like the market, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has found a bit of a bottom. And the first of Friday's big stock charts does suggest the bottom might hold:  * Most notably, NVDA has managed to find support basically right at the 200-day moving average. That comes after a bearish inverted cup-and-handle pattern played out, and on reasonably solid volume. This does look a chart where selling is starting to peter out. Simply put, Nvidia is starting to consolidate.  * That's almost certainly good news for the market, because Nvidia stock largely is a valuation play. To be sure, investors can debate how much market share the company might take from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in data center, or the pace and value of revenue growth in the automotive business. Still, from a broad standpoint, most investors would agree that the business is attractive; the question is what it is worth.  * There's still work left to do and NVDA is going to need market sentiment to at least hold up from here. At 23x forward earnings, the stock is expensive enough that it can continue to decline if selling pressure returns to the broad market. But the fact that Nvidia has found temporary support does provide a small bit of optimism that the market itself can do so more permanently. Danaher (DHR)Source: Provided by Finviz On the industrial side of the market, however, the news isn't quite as good. Danaher (NYSE:DHR) has been considered one of the world's best companies, but as the second of our big stock charts shows, that hasn't triggered a bottom yet:  * One key reason for concern is that during this decline support barely held. DHR stock fell through the 20-day moving average, blew through the 50DMA, and briefly paused around the 200DMA before continuing its descent. 2019 support around $135 didn't hold, either. There's really little evidence right now that buyers are on the way.  * One possible reason why is that DHR stock is not cheap. This is an industrial company that still trades at 20x 2021 earnings per share estimates (estimates which haven't yet moved, and thus don't appear to incorporate any impact from the recent economic disruption). That's not cheap by any historical fundamental standard.  * That fact colors the recent decline as well. As steep as the sell-off has been, the current price doesn't on its face seem like a multi-year buying opportunity. The stock is down just 8% from where it traded in November. Even with these declines, it's rallied 43% over the past three years, and 88% over the past five. This is not a 2009-style sell-off. It's not even necessarily a late 2018-type opportunity.  * DHR highlights the key fundamental worry here: that the huge decline in the market isn't coming solely because investors are panicking now, but also because the market was far too optimistic in January and February. In other words, this is a correction more than an opportunity. At least for now, that seems to be the tack investors are taking with Danaher stock. Crown Castle (CCI)Source: Provided by Finviz The case for cellular tower operator Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) somewhat splits the middle between Nvidia and DHR. CCI hasn't seen quite the same rally -- or the same valuation. But as the third of Friday's big stock charts shows, it is looking to find support:  * Buyers have stepped in around $130 in the past, most recently in November and December. They will need to do so again. Thursday's decline, on reasonably steep volume, isn't necessarily comforting, even though shares did manage to close above the lows.  * To be sure, support may hold. This is not a business whose prospects should be materially impacted by a recession. Wireless operators like Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) are close to utilities at this point. Consumers are not going to give up their smartphone plans right now.  * Still, it might be that stocks as a whole have to re-rate. And if that's the case, the decline in Crown Castle stock may have further to go. This simply might be a 'new normal' for stocks as the bull market ends. And that in turn means that investors expecting a return to bull market valuations are going to be disappointed.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-01-03	2020-01-03 15:26:51	CCI	Crown Castle International Corp.	9 Boring Stocks to Buy You Should Never Let Go Of	With the holidays coming to a close and a new year (and decade) upon us, this is typically a period of change: just take a look at your friends and family writing up their new year's resolutions. And many times, change involves risks. As such, a temptation exists to load up our portfolios with exciting names, not boring stocks to buy.Certainly, as a fan of several speculative industries, I'm in no position to lecture people about conservative investing habits. In order to grow your portfolio, you must take risks: that's the nature of the game. However, whether you're a speculator or a by-the-numbers type of investor, boring stocks such as blue-chip giants offer significant value.For one thing, boring stocks typically pay dividends, rewarding you simply for holding the equity. Usually, you're not going to get rich off dividends, unless you purchase an ungodly amount of shares. However, passive-income generating companies tend to weather market storms better than high-flying growth names.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSecond and on a related note, 2019 was a year full of drama. Much of that drama remains unresolved. Even something like a limited trade agreement between the U.S. and China can go awry, as prior negotiations have. Thus, boring stocks to buy may offer some confidence and stability should events not pan out as expected.  * 7 Stocks to Buy to Get 2020 Started the Right Way Finally, every portfolio, even for young investors, should have some exposure to boring stocks. You're simply not going to win them all, and these established names should provide some downside mitigation.So, without further ado, here are nine boring stocks to buy. IBM (IBM)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Chances are, if you're thinking about technology names, IBM (NYSE:IBM) doesn't come to mind; that is, unless you were discussing legacy names that were relevant in the pre-internet era. As a result, IBM stock has been among the most boring of boring stocks to buy.Nevertheless, this is a situation where Big Blue's (negative) reputation precedes it. True, IBM stock has failed to inspire investors despite many shifts in strategy. Further, more exciting tech firms have overshadowed the legacy company.However, with IBM's acquisition of Red Hat, management is making a credible push into cloud computing for large enterprises. Specifically, the company has invested heavily in Kubernetes, a container-based cloud protocol that allows unprecedented scale and efficiency.With this Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)-developed innovation, end-users can share applications in self-contained data packages, thus eliminating the need for everyone to download the same system architecture. It's a massive step forward in cloud technologies, thereby providing a long-term lift for IBM stock. Crown Castle (CCI)Source: Shutterstock A real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in communication towers and small cells, Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) and CCI stock represent a vital cog in our digitalization initiatives. But no matter what the industry, most folks rarely pay attention to the background players. Instead, they tend to focus on the front-facing action; in this case, smart device manufacturers.Granted, the 5G rollout is a major paradigm shift in our telecommunications industries. Undoubtedly, those frontline companies will attract investor dollars. But for the astute buyer (that's you!), CCI stock offers steady and viable capital growth and passive income opportunities. Obviously, none of the innovations associated with 5G can happen without the small cells that harness the telecom spectrums.  * 10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers In addition, the transition from 4G to 5G will not happen overnight. Therefore, the big cell towers that facilitate 4G waves will still be relevant for many years. Plus, additional technologies may open new applications for cell towers. Therefore, this is a time to consider loading up on CCI stock despite its less-than-exciting reputation. Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source: Michael Gordon / Shutterstock.com Today, digital technologies don't just impact internet speeds and device capacities. Increasingly, more people have expressed broader concerns about environmental sustainability. For instance, a Gallup poll earlier in 2019 stated that Millennials' environmental consciousness has impacted business decisions. Under this context, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and XOM stock doesn't seem like a great choice among boring stocks to buy.Admittedly, XOM stock is a tough play. Based on stereotypes about young Americans, you'd expect them to protest Exxon rather than embrace its investment potential. Moreover, the rise of alternative sources of transportation like electric vehicles have steadily made big oil less relevant.Yet I don't think it's quite time to give up on XOM stock. Sure, as one of the boring stocks of the Dow Jones, Exxon isn't as exciting as a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, EVs have yet to prove they can integrate into society beyond the rich yuppies.Petroleum-based vehicles don't impose on the electrical grid to the extent that EVs do. And they're cheaper and more accessible, making Exxon Mobil a viable investment. Albemarle (ALB)Source: Shutterstock In many if not most cases, lectures on specialty chemicals and industrial metals will make eyes glaze over. By logical deduction, companies that focus on such elements can be relegated to a portfolio of boring stocks.However, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) rightfully belongs among boring stocks to buy. One of the world's leading producers of lithium, ALB stock should move higher over the long run if EVs integrate more deeply into the mainstream. In some ways, Albemarle is a hedge against my bullish thesis for Exxon Mobil.But even if the EV narrative doesn't pan out as environmentalists hope, ALB stock still has upside potential. As you know, lithium plays a vital role in battery technology, particularly those optimized for electronic devices.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for January and Beyond I don't see this tailwind declining anytime soon. Therefore, despite the occasional supply chain challenges, lithium and ALB stock should have a bright future. Iron Mountain (IRM)Source: Shutterstock A recognized brand in data storage and protection, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) is probably the most dry investment in this list of boring stocks to buy. Indeed, its physical paper-related businesses - including shredding services and document storage - seem anachronistic in this day and age. Ironically, though, digitalization makes IRM stock immeasurably viable.Although companies like IBM are encouraging corporate clients to shift to the digital cloud, large enterprises will never stop using actual paper. That's because digital data is too easy to exploit and compromise. And if something were to go wrong - data breach, infrastructural crisis, or an Act of God - a physical backup can help mitigate the overall damage. It's one of the understated reasons why astute investors love IRM stock.Furthermore, as a company grows, their paper record storage needs expand. Iron Mountain offers an easy solution, providing safe storage in an offsite location. Therefore, even if the target company is compromised, its documents will not be. Again, this is a huge, underappreciated catalyst for IRM stock. Disney (DIS)Source: spiderman777 / Shutterstock.com While Disney's (NYSE:DIS) vast content library is anything but tedious, DIS stock is at home among boring stocks to buy. Here's the reality: if your equity shares are traded on the Dow, chances are, they didn't get there by taking investors on the ride of their lives.However, boring doesn't necessarily have to equate with low growth. Despite its reputation as a slow-and-steady dividend bearer, DIS stock returned over 36% in 2019. Now, the question is, can prospective buyers expect continued gains in 2020 and beyond? I believe they can.No matter the criticisms against the Magic Kingdom, the media giant's acquisitions have been well worth the price of admission. For instance, Disney's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was a cinematic disaster. Truly, it was a pathetic way to end the Skywalker saga. Nevertheless, at the box office - where it really counts for DIS stock - Rise of Skywalker is a hit.If you can take a big steaming pile and turn it into box office success, it's official: Disney is a cash-printing machine! Kellogg (K)Source: DenisMArt / Shutterstock.com Putting Kellogg (NYSE:K) on a list of boring stocks to buy shouldn't offend anyone's sensibilities. Aside from our breakfast table, we really don't think too much about the company. As a largely secular company, K stock is good for solid dividends and for holding the fort in a downturn.But that's not the reason why I'm interested in K stock this time around. Instead, it's the hype machine surrounding Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and the rejuvenated plant-based meat industry. Supposedly, BYND is a transformative investment that can convert meat-eaters toward alternative meat. However, the problem is that real meat is almost universally flavorful to carnivores. Fake meat, though, has sharp critics.But a bigger problem is scale and competition. Beyond Meat only produces fake meats. But Kellogg can disrupt this space through its MorningStar Farms subsidiary while not skipping a beat in its core markets.  * 6 Transportation Stocks That Are Going Places Now, I'm not really sure how long this fake meat fad will last. But if you want a safer, boring bet, go with K stock. Philip Morris International (PM)Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.com For many years, electronic-cigarette smoking or vaping occurred as a niche practice. But in the latter half of 2019, everybody was talking about vaping, and not for good reasons. The public blamed a rash of illnesses and deaths on flavored vape devices, creating a panic.When the outbreak occurred, Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) shares took a hit in the markets. Although PM stock is primarily levered to traditional tobacco products, the underlying company invested heavily in heat-not-burn devices called IQOS. Similar to vaporizers, IQOS mimics the experience of &quot;analog&quot; smoking but in a cleaner and arguably healthier platform.Despite the ugliness of the vaping crisis, PM stock has skyrocketed since late September of 2019. I firmly believe that this was because the hysteria over vape devices was substantially exaggerated. In December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed to vitamin E acetate as the main culprit.Since vitamin E acetate is not a substance found in legal vaping products, the crisis was really about risky behaviors. This suggests PM stock has more upside growth potential. CVS Health (CVS)Source: Shutterstock When e-commerce behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) wants to disrupt your industry, it's almost always bad news for you. Retail pharmacy specialist CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) learned this the hard way earlier in 2019. Combined with fiscal concerns such as a worrying debt load, CVS stock bled out in February.However, in the second half of the year, CVS stock staged a remarkable comeback. Because of this surge, shares of the company returned double digits for investors in 2019. Not only that, CVS should have some juice in the tank to continue its promising recovery narrative.Though Amazon's encroachment is a serious challenge, CVS stock may have a moat. Like many other boring stocks to buy, CVS has a powerful brand identity. Additionally, the pharmacy has a vast physical footprint, with many locations open 24 hours.Unless Amazon can offer immediate shipment, it simply can't compete with CVS without investing onerous amounts of money. Therefore, the underlying company likely has many years to mount a counteroffensive.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

A two-and-a-half session sell-off has been followed by a rally of equal length. While broad market indices remain modestly off their highs, it does seem like stability, at least, has returned heading into 2020.Source: Shutterstock In that context, the question at the moment is whether there's enough time, and enough optimism, for one more leg higher before year-end. And that question is of particular importance when looking at Friday's big stock charts.  * 7 Hot Stocks for 2020's Big Trends All three stocks have missed out on at least part of this year's rally. And all three big stock charts show at least the potential for a breakout in the near-term. It will take some outside help, however -- with stronger broad market sentiment the simplest source at the moment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Advance Auto Parts (AAP)Source: Provided by Finviz So far, 2019 has not been kind to Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP). AAP stock actually has declined a bit over 3% this year, making it one of just 81 stocks in the S&P 500 in the red for 2019. The first of Friday's big stock charts suggests the news could get worse -- but there's hope for a reversal:  * The exit from an ascending triangle pattern last week generally is a bearish move, and indeed AAP stock saw a small gap down on Tuesday. It seems likely that $154, which formerly acted as support, is reversing to resistance. That, too, suggests a negative outlook.  * That said, AAP has found its footing in the past two sessions, with modest declines on heavy buying. There are buyers willing to step in at the moment. And if AAP can find a way to grind higher, there is some reason for bullishness. $154 could again act as support. Moving averages will come in.  *   Click to Enlarge Source: Provided by Finviz From a broad perspective, this simply is a stock still looking for direction. That's true looking at 2019 trading and going back to early 2016. With some bullishness toward the sector and/or broad markets, the stock's direction could reverse.  * The concerns might be both valuation and the lack of a catalyst. AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) reports earnings next week, and good news could read across to both AAP stock and rival O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY). But AZO stock has a similar valuation to AAP, and Advance Auto Parts earnings last month disappointed. Good news from AutoZone might lead investors to buy AZO moreso than AAP. So while there's potential for an upside reversion in Advance Auto Parts stock, this may be a 2020 story without a significant year-end market-wide rally. iQiyi (IQ)Source: Provided by Finviz The setup is there for Chinese streaming video play iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ). If IQ stock can rally, the second of our big stock charts shows a path toward a breakout:  * There's clear resistance from a near-term standpoint. IQ stock twice has stalled out at $20 in recent months. The broader trend is still modestly negative. And the 200-day moving average sits right at current levels. But if IQ stock can move above $20, the trend will look positive. The stock would make a bullish exit from a narrowing wedge. It would have cleared all three moving averages, and broken out the downtrend that has held since May.  * All that said, a reversal is possible as well, given the multiple trendlines creating resistance. A reversal likely would move the stock back toward support around $17.  * As I wrote this week, the swing factor might be the broader market. As I noted in October, IQ stock has somewhat missed out in the rally in Chinese stocks due to a reticence by U.S. investors to pay up for unprofitable companies. Shares still have lagged the likes of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), both of which have reached 52-week highs in recent weeks. Investors are willing to take on China risk. If they're back to taking on growth stock risk as well, a breakout looms for iQiyi stock. Crown Castle International (CCI)Source: Provided by Finviz Celullar tower real estate investment trust Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) has struggled since reaching an all-time high in September. But CCI stock has righted itself over the last month, and the last of Friday's big stock charts shows hope for a rebound:  * CCI stock is in the middle of a downtrend at the moment -- but it's also in the middle of a narrowing wedge. A move through the 50-day moving average would challenge a key pivot point at $138, and set shares up for a bullish exit. The trend certainly isn't confirmed yet, but a continued near-term rally could set up a breakout that would re-test September highs.  * Meanwhile, valuation is reasonable. The stock trades at 22.7x the midpoint of 2019 guidance for adjusted funds for operations per share. Looking to 2020, the multiple drops closer to 21x. A 3.56% dividend yield adds to the case, particularly in a low interest rate environment and with the payout hiked 7% in October.  *   Click to Enlarge Source: Provided by Finviz It may be the sector, and 5G stocks more broadly, that define the near-term direction of CCI stock. Perhaps surprisingly, 5G plays have struggled of late. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has reversed since earnings. Nokia (NYSE:NOK) plunged after its Q3 report. And rival American Tower (NYSE:AMT) has a similar chart (and perhaps stronger hopes for a breakout from a descending triangle), though a higher valuation and lower yield. If bullishness toward 5G returns, the chart sets CCI up to be a prime beneficiary.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-12-05	2019-12-05 20:26:45	CCI	Crown Castle International Corp.	19 Best Retirement Stocks to Buy in 2019	Generating safe, regular income and preserving capital are two primary objectives in retirement. The best retirement stocks to buy, then - whether you're buying in 2019 or any other year - must be quality dividend payers that can help meet both of those goals in the long-term.Unlike many fixed-income investments, numerous dividend stocks offer relatively high yields, grow their payouts each year and appreciate in price over time as their businesses generate more profits and become more valuable.Not all dividends are safe, however. From General Electric (GE) and Owens & Minor (OMI) to L Brands (LB) and Buckeye Partners LP (BPL), several high-profile dividend-payers slashed their payouts in 2018, sending their stock prices tumbling. So the dividend stocks you depend on must be chosen with care.These are the 19 best retirement stocks to buy for 2019. Research firm Simply Safe Dividends developed a Dividend Safety Score system that has helped investors avoid more than 98% of dividend cuts, including each of those companies listed above. The 19 stocks on this list have solid Dividend Safety Scores and generous yields near 4% or higher, making them appealing retirement stocks for income. Importantly, they also have strong potential to maintain and grow their dividends in all manner of economic and market environments.

2019-12-02	2019-12-02 17:09:51	CCI	Crown Castle International Corp.	The 13 Best REITs to Own in 2019	Real estate investment trusts (REITs) - a way for investors to gain access to assets such as apartments and office buildings while often collecting generous yields - had a disappointing 2018. With just a few days left to go in the year, the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) had lost 13.5% compared to a 12% decline for the broader market. This contrasts with 10-year average annual gains of just more than 12% for the VNQ.Will REITs bounce back in 2019? Well, the same fear that hampered these real-estate plays in 2018 - rising interest rates - still is on the board for the coming year. And higher rates on bonds sometimes hamper the performance of REITs.However, these companies are not created equal. The best REITs for 2019 could benefit from other powerful trends in 2019. For instance, cloud computing's growth should continue to fuel robust demand for data storage services. A massive infrastructure spending bill could improve the fortunes of related REIT plays. And mobile-data growth, as well as the rollout of lightning-fast 5G technology, offers potential growth for cell-tower REITs.Here are the 13 best REITs to buy and hold in 2019. Not only should they benefit from broad trends that could help them outperform their brethren, but REITs as a whole are trading at much more palatable valuations lately. Moreover, average dividend yields in the space currently exceed 4%; all the more reason for investors to stick with REITs if market rockiness continues in the coming year.

There's a huge industry in connecting these clouds to each other, and to large and small customers alike. It requires cell towers, data centers and other communications technology.A number of real estate investment trusts (REITs) specialize in properties and other assets that ensure your tablet can stream Netflix (NFLX) content and that your company's data is secured in the cloud. As a reminder: REITs are a special type of business structure - one that requires at least 90% of taxable income be paid out to shareholders as dividends, in exchange for generous tax benefits.Many of these stocks have risen by leaps and bounds in 2019, though they're getting expensive as a result. Still, they sit smack-dab in the middle of a growth industry, and some of them remain valuable as takeover targets. Private equity firms EQT Partners and Digital Colony Partners bought fiber network owner Zayo Group for $8 billion in May. And in October, Digital Realty Trust (DLR) bought European data center giant Interxion (INXN) for $8.4 billion.Here are five REITs that can help you squeeze dividends out of the cloud. If you're looking for a broad-based play on the industry, the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF (SRVR) invests in 20 such companies. However, these five holdings stand out among the rest. SEE ALSO: 20 Dividend Stocks to Fund 20 Years of Retirement	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-reits-cloud-pay-dividends-181629350.html?.tsrc=rss

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) might be the asset class investors need to thread the needle in this tenuous bull market.This summer, prominent hedge-fund king Ray Dalio wrote that market paradigms are shifting, and the next decade's prospects are for slow growth and chronically soft interest rates. He believes the world's central banks, including America's Federal Reserve, &quot;doing more of this printing and buying of assets will produce more negative real and nominal returns that will lead investors to increasingly prefer alternative forms of money (e.g., gold) or other storeholds of wealth.&quot;While Dalio suggests investors might add gold to their portfolios, they might want to start researching REITs to buy, too. That's because real estate also has been a classic hedge against inflation, and it tends to benefit from low interest rates.Another upside: REITs can throw off substantial income; gold does not. By law, real estate investment trusts must distribute 90% of taxable income to shareholders through dividends. But the ultimate hedge is finding REITs that reliably (and, when possible, aggressively) increase their payouts, as that will keep the dividend from actually losing value due to inflation over time.Here are seven REITs to buy for investors who are interested in dividend growth. These real estate companies are poised to sustain and improve their cash distributions through the possibly sluggish, low-interest-rate future that some experts are predicting.

Best ETFs for 2019: The Pacer Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF Rules	This article is a part of InvestorPlace's Best ETFs for 2019 contest. Robert Waldo's pick for the contest is the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:SRVR).We're coming toward the end of InvestorPlace's best ETFs for 2019 contest and my pick, the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:SRVR), remains at the top of the pack, only slightly behind Vince Martin's pick, iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB), in terms of year-to-date performance (SRVR is up 40% YTD; ITB is up 42% YTD).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough I don't think investors should expect the 5G exchange-traded fund to climb significantly higher by the end of the year, I do believe it can win the contest, and possibly gain a few more percentage points along the way. Since my last update in July, the ETF has climbed 13%, maintaining its No. 2 ranking among the best ETFs. What to Expect From SRVR at the End of 2019At the start of the year, I mentioned the yield curve inverting and the trade war between the U.S. and China as reasons for investors to have concern. But, broadly speaking, it hasn't necessarily been all doom and gloom for stocks in 2019.In fact, as InvestorPlace contributor Luke Lango points out in his recent article on high-performing S&P 500 stocks:&quot;Through the first half of the year, the S&P 500 was on track for its best year in over two decades. To be sure, gains have been muted in the third quarter despite major indices flirting with all-time highs. But with the S&P 500 up 20% year-to-date, stocks are still having one of their best years this century.&quot;True as this may be, I still maintain my long-term case for SRVR, as its holdings present unique opportunities -- a combination of dividend-boosted stability and continual growth potential -- in a questionable time, where the trade war has no clear end in sight.  * 8 Dividend Stocks to Buy for a Recession Even if you share the optimism of investors like Luke Lango, SRVR is one of the best ETFs you could buy this year. Because regardless of trade war concerns or a recession, the holdings in this real estate investment trust (REIT) ETF mainly focus on infrastructure that's essential to the daily operations of our technologically connected world.And much of this infrastructure is based in the U.S., dodging the influence of trade war peril.Consider top holding Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) as example of this dual strength. According to Yahoo Fiance's description for CCI: &quot;Crown Castle owns, operates and leases more than 40,000 cell towers and approximately 75,000 route miles of fiber supporting small cells and fiber solutions across every major U.S. market.&quot; This is a U.S.-based holding that will be at the forefront of the inevitable 5G future, which will be the catalyst for countless other technological advancements. And SRVR is packed with holdings with similar attributes to CCI.Ultimately, SRVR should remain a strong contender among the best ETFs this year. And it will likely be one of the best ETFs to buy for years to come, as the 5G catalyst, which many of its holdings stand to benefit from, is only getting heated up.The SRVR ETF has an expense ratio of 0.6%, or $60 annually per $10,000 invested.Robert Waldo is an assistant editor at InvestorPlace. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-29	2019-08-29 06:00:00	CCI	Crown Castle International Corp.	U.S. Firms Steer Clear of Europe's Big Mobile Tower Sell-Off	(Bloomberg) -- European phone companies are selling their mobile masts and growth-hungry U.S. tower companies have money to spend -- it looks like a marriage made in heaven.Instead, firms like American Tower Corp. and Crown Castle International Corp. are largely staying away, making it easier for Spain’s Cellnex Telecom SA and infrastructure funds managed by Macquarie Group Ltd., KKR & Co. and others to sweep up the region’s tower assets.Their hesitation is driven partly by price: the global hunt for yield has driven up the premium for these assets, which offer reliable, steady income streams. Independent tower companies also won’t pay top dollar unless they see a path to significant revenue growth -- and that’s where they have a problem with Europe.“The American tower companies say, ‘OK, Europe is fine at the right price, but prices are not where we need them to be, so we think the opportunities elsewhere are more attractive,”’ said Nick Del Deo, senior analyst at U.S. research firm MoffettNathanson.Tens of thousands of European masts are expected to see ownership changes in the next two years as companies such as Iliad SA, Vodafone Group Plc and Telecom Italia SpA bring in new investors to reduce debt and share the heavy cost of rolling out 5G technology.But only a quarter are likely to end up with independent operators, according to TowerXchange. Vodafone and CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. are creating separate units for almost 90,000 towers and the consultancy expects them to maintain control over those businesses. That’s a turn-off for independent companies, which try to maximize revenue by leasing mast space to as many network operators as possible.Many European carriers want to keep some hold on their towers because they see mobile infrastructure as a strategic asset that can help them manage costs and perhaps gain a competitive edge. They’re also mindful of what happened in the U.S., where operators rushed to sell their towers more than a decade ago only to find themselves stuck with a big bill for leases and capacity rights.Vodafone Surges on Possible IPO, Stake Sale of Towers UnitVodafone and Telefonica Ink 5G Terms in Move to U.K. Tower SalesNiel Agrees to $3 Billion of Phone Tower Sales to CellnexCK Hutchison to Separate Out European Phone Towers BusinessSelling full ownership of towers to independent players can spur innovation and reduce expenses by encouraging carriers to share infrastructure, avoiding costly duplication. European carriers’ insistence on maintaining control means the continent’s progress in rolling out 5G will likely continue to be slower compared to the U.S., where towers are largely in independent hands.“There is a risk that the European carriers go too far the other way,” Del Deo said. “The captive tower model, if you look globally, has never proven to be that effective.”For now, American Tower is mostly relying on building towers in Africa, Latin America and India for its international growth.Crown Castle didn’t respond to a request for comment on its future European asset bidding plans. American Tower declined to comment. Its chief executive officer, James Taiclet, told analysts last month that recent large European tower sales didn’t meet its bar for growth prospects and asset costs.Here are some other reasons why U.S. tower firms aren’t piling into Europe:Redundancy: Europe has more cases of towers operated by rival carriers sitting in close proximity. An independent owner may want to remove one to cut costs, but the tower often comes with a ground lease that they must keep paying for years.Less Potential: Europe has lots of rooftop antenna sites, which can’t accommodate as many customers as can a ground-based tower. Many European portfolios include broadcast towers in rural areas that may not be as valuable as mobile towers.Radio Emission Rules: In some countries, rules on maximum electromagnetic radio emissions limit the number of antennas a tower firm can install at a single site.&#92;--With assistance from Scott Moritz.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Pfeiffer in London at tpfeiffer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net, Jennifer Ryan, Anthony PalazzoFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-firms-steer-clear-europes-060000509.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-27	2019-08-27 20:49:06	CCI	Crown Castle International Corp.	Are 5G Stocks Worth the Hype? This Chart Says It All	Every once in a while, a stock chart just reaches out and grabs you. The trend is so strong that it compels you to pay attention. I recently had one of those moments with 5G stocks, so I wanted to share it now.This particular chart highlights a trend that debunks one of the biggest myths I'm hearing right now - the one that says, &quot;the market is doomed, everyone's selling off, and if you haven't yet, then you should, too.&quot;If that were true, why are these &quot;random&quot; stocks going absolutely wild compared to the broader market?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs you can see in the one-year chart below, they're racking up 30%, even 50% gains… during a time period when the S&P 500 (the orange line at the bottom) is flat.I call them &quot;random&quot; stocks because Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) and American Tower Corp. (NYSE:AMT) are likely not top-of-mind for many investors. They're not the kind of stocks that folks like me usually get called to discuss on TV. (But with performance like that, they should.)But these are NOT &quot;random&quot; stocks. In fact, they'll be crucial in implementing 5G wireless, one of the biggest revolutionary technologies that's just taking off now and is set to explode into the 2020s.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow Crown Castle and American Tower are real estate investment trusts (REITs) specializing in telecom services. In other words, they often play landlord to companies like Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Sprint (NYSE:S). At this point, that's basically the whole industry. And these telecom REITs help provide cell towers, plus newer technology called &quot;small cells,&quot; as well as the fiber-optic cables that run out to customers.Are cell towers a growth industry? Absolutely. And that's because people's usage of mobile data is skyrocketing. In 2018, the average smartphone in North America used 7 gigabytes per month. In 2024, that'll be more like 40 gigabytes per month, according to a June report from Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC).That's nearly 6X growth in just six years.Crown Castle CEO Jay Brown cited that stat when giving his 2019 guidance on new-leasing activity. In the July earnings report, Brown announced that his company expects a 30% increase in tower leasing, year-over-year.But this is a much bigger story than Crown Castle, American Tower, or any other individual 5G stocks.At Investment Opportunities, I've really been digging into the 5G mega-trend -- and you can bet I'll continue to do so. The closer I look, the more opportunities I find… some that you might never expect.Keep in mind that when we talk about 5G, we're talking about speed. Taking devices that don't look much different than the ones we use now… and transforming them into something exponentially faster and more powerful.With 5G, you will be able to download a movie in six seconds. Today it takes seven minutes with the current 4G technology.Now, here in the United States -- in tech strongholds like San Francisco and wealthy suburbs like Montgomery County, Maryland -- homeowners aren't too thrilled when Crown Castle or Verizon come to their neighborhood to put up a cell tower. (Or add to an existing one, like with the 5G buildout.)I get it, but these folks aren't seeing the big picture. They just see a big gray box. Ultimately, though, 5G is coming -- and it'll take us to the next level of wireless communications. Not just for consumer products, like our iPhones, but for industrial applications, advanced medicine, and even transportation. If we're talking about self-driving cars, we're talking about a lot of data that needs relayed back and forth in an instant.The speeds 5G provides will be the catalyst for just about every other game-changing technology that's coming down the pike. And the more people realize that, the more they'll start to notice stock charts like the one above.This is what I'm talking about when I say: The market is full of buying opportunities right now.

2019-08-21	2019-08-21 15:32:40	CCI	Crown Castle International Corp.	Amazon’s Cloud-Computing Empire Faces Threat From Edge of the Network	(Bloomberg) -- Three companies — Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. — quietly dominate the world of cloud computing.With more more than 100 giant data centers worldwide, they rent out computing power to all manner of customers, making billions of dollars along the way. In fact, cloud computing has done more to fuel Amazon’s earnings in recent years than its e-commerce business.But there’s a threat looming on the horizon, quite literally at the edge of the network. With so many mobile devices and sensors now connected to the internet — and relying on artificial intelligence — more people and companies need their computing power close to them. For everything from fast analysis of road conditions to streaming holographic concerts, remote data centers are just too far away.That’s going to hand a huge opportunity to wireless carriers, which are building fast 5G networks to handle the task. And create a threat for the dominant cloud-computing players, according to telecom analyst Chetan Sharma. “Over time, cloud will be primarily used for storage and running longer computational models, while most of the processing of data and AI inference will take place at the edge,” said Sharma, who just wrote a report on the topic sponsored by software provider AlefEdge Inc. He pegs the size of this so-called edge-computing market at more than $4 trillion by 2030.Wireless carriers and the owners of cell towers have a big advantage in the edge-computing race: Not only do they control access to high-speed telecommunications networks, they have valuable real estate, such as tens of thousands of cell sites all over the country.Cloud computing isn’t going away by any means. But there’s more pressure on the industry’s Big Three to team up with wireless carriers, so they’re not left out of the burgeoning edge market.“The big players realize that at a minimum they need to partner up with operators to get access to their real-estate property,” Sharma said.Already, AT&T Inc. — the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier — has joined forces with Microsoft Corp. and IBM Corp., two cloud providers.“Our goal is that our partners are wildly successful,” said Sam George, a cloud executive at Microsoft. “If our partners are wildly successful, we’ll be wildly successful. There’s a lot of money to be made for partners.”Amazon and Google declined to comment on their plans.AT&T has hundreds of workers focused on edge computing, and it’s “a core part of our 5G strategy,” said Mo Katibeh, chief marketing officer of AT&T’s business division.“This is one that takes a village.”IBM, meanwhile, is also working with carrier Vodafone Group Plc in Europe.“The networks are essentially themselves becoming a cloud,” said Steve Canepa, IBM’s global managing director for the telecom industry. “The telcos today have a point of presence at the edge, and that becomes a great place to have an extension of the platform.”Cloud providers in China — such as Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. — invested in carrier China Unicom two years ago. And more such investments and partnerships could be coming, Sharma said.For other tech companies, including chipmakers like Intel Corp., the hope is the shift leads to a bigger opportunity for everyone.“We see a rapid convergence between the cloud providers and connectivity providers,” said Caroline Chan, a general manager at Intel. “In our view, it’s a bigger pie.”Other telecom players are angling to team up with both carriers and cloud providers. Crown Castle International Corp., which owns fiber lines as well as more than 40,000 cell towers in the U.S., is in talks with the two camps, said Paul Reddick, a vice president at the company.Crown Castle also is an investor in startup Vapor IO, which is deploying edge computing this year in six metro areas, including Chicago.“I would say this is one that takes a village,” Reddick said.Other projects are already well underway. At CenturyLink Inc., about 100 facilities that used to store telecom equipment are now outfitted with servers. And it’s making them available to corporate customers in sectors like retail and industrial robotics.“We’ve already sold these facilities to a number of customers that need to get that compute closer to the network edge,” said Paul Savill, a senior vice president at CenturyLink. “We’ve seen enough activity in this space that we can confidently build out this infrastructure.”To contact the author of this story: Olga Kharif in Portland at okharif@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-cloud-computing-empire-faces-153240799.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-08-20	2019-08-20 19:36:06	CCI	Crown Castle International Corp.	7 Unusual, Growth-Oriented REITs to Buy for Your Portfolio	In a low interest rate environment, dividend stocks often come into focus. One type of dividend stock that gets attention is the real estate investment trust (REIT). To gain this status, companies must pay at least 90% of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Consequently, investors often look for REITs to buy because such rules lead to higher interest rates. Average yields for REITs have now climbed to 4.06%, more than double the average return of the S&P 500.  * 10 Stocks That Every 30-Year-Old Should Buy and Hold Forever Investors should also note that REITs remain a dynamic sector. For example, the advent of e-commerce has hurt retail REITs and boosted industrial REITs as a large portion of retailing moved from malls to warehouses. Also, new REIT sectors sometimes emerge. For example, data center REITs came about to meet the demand for cool, wired, secured real estate to store IT equipment. Such changes bring about new REITs to buy, and these stocks offer opportunities in such emerging industries.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust (CORR)Source: Shutterstock CorEnergy (NYSE:CORR) owns the infrastructure that runs the oil and gas industry. This includes structures such as pipelines, storage terminals and other transmission and distribution-related assets.Interestingly, as oil and gas prices struggle to gain traction, CORR stock remains one of the REITs to buy as its rise continues in this challenging environment. It now trades at just over $45 per share, a high not seen since 2012. Despite this increase, it trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 19.5.Moreover, the recent slump has not hurt profit growth. Wall Street predicts CORR stock will see profits grow by 9.3% and 23.9% next year before a slowdown in subsequent years.However, this could boost an already generous dividend payment. Right now, CORR stock pays out $3 per share. That yields around 6.6%. Although it has not risen since 2016, the current pace of profit growth could force it higher.After the current run-up, both revenue and profit growth could plateau. However, it should level off at a point that will still yield current investors a high dividend return. Crown Castle (CCI)Source: iStockphoto Among REITs to buy, Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) specializes in what many call &quot;vertical real estate.&quot; It owns towers throughout the world that make wireless communication possible. CNN Business's Paul R. La Monica went so far to label Crown Castle and peers American Tower (NYSE:AMT) and SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC) as the &quot;real winners&quot; of 5G. SBA's CEO expects 5G to provide his industry with &quot;multiple years of solid customer demand and strong growth.&quot;Hence, it should come as no surprise that CCI stock has risen to about $144 per share. It has increased by about 40% over the last year. Admittedly, this has made CCI a pricey stock as it trades at a forward P/E ratio of about 69.4.However, for this price, investors can expect to derive both significant growth and income. Analysts predict average profit growth of 21% per year over the next five years.  * 7 Fintech ETFs to Buy Now for Fabulous Financial Exposure The dividend has also risen consistently after becoming a REIT in 2014. Investors currently receive $4.50 per year in payouts. This brings its dividend yield to just over 3.1%, higher than either AMT or SBAC stock. Thanks to the 5G buildout, these payouts should continue to grow for years to come. Essential Properties Realty Trust (EPRT)Source: Shutterstock Essential Properties Realty Trust (NYSE:EPRT) has only traded for a little over one year. However, this diversified REIT, which specializes in properties with one tenant, has already delivered huge returns for its investors. Restaurants, movie theaters and vet clinics are among the property types it owns.It debuted at $14 per share in June 2018. Although it saw little price action in 2018, its growth in 2019 has made it one of the best REITs to buy. After last Christmas, it began a steady rise which has now taken it north of $22 per share.But can that continue for EPRT stock?Quite possibly, yes. The move higher took its forward P/E ratio to about 34. That may seem elevated. However, with average profit growth estimated at 34.61% per year over the next five years, that multiple appears reasonable.EPRT stock pays 88 cents per share in dividends. Despite the run-up, that amounts to a yield of around 4%. As a young company, it has only made four quarterly dividend payments in its history. While that has shown no increase, the profit growth rate will force that payout to move higher. As long as that growth continues at its current pace, I think EPRT stock will continue its move higher. Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)Source: Shutterstock Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) came about due to the emerging marijuana industry. This has created the need for spaces that provide ideal growing conditions for marijuana. This demand has gone ever higher due to hemp attaining legal status and cannabidiol (CBD) flying off store shelves.This company owns 21 properties specifically designed for producing cannabis. Over the last two years, IIPR stock has boomed. The yield of about 2.25% may look low by REIT standards; however, these payouts continue to rise. Two years ago, IIPR stock paid shareholders 15 cents per share in dividends every quarter. Now, the quarterly payout has increased to 60 cents per share.Furthermore, stock price appreciation has seen nearly as much growth. It traded below $20 per share in late 2017. Today it has risen to about $106 per share as of the time of this writing. Moreover, unlike most marijuana stocks now, it trades near its all-time high.  * The 10 Best Marijuana Stocks to Buy Now To be sure, IIPR stock carries with it more risk. The forward P/E ratio has risen to 35.6. That comes in low for a cannabis stock, but high for a REIT. However, Wall Street forecasts earnings increases of 128% this year and 74.3% in fiscal 2020. As long as the cannabis industry continues to see massive growth, IIPR stock should follow suit. Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI)Source: Shutterstock Omega Healthcare (NYSE:OHI) should make REITs to buy lists for demographics as much as any company-related factor. All things healthcare continue to benefit from the fact that about 10,000 baby boomers per day age into Medicare. Between their growing need for healthcare and help to pay through Medicare, the demand for healthcare-related facilities continues to rise.Consequently, analysts project a 10% earnings increase for Omega this year. Over the next five years, they believe average profit growth will rise to 15.8%. This will significantly boost the dividend for OHI stock as it has in past years.That said, investors should treat this as an income stock. Admittedly, the stock price has seen little growth over the last five years. In August 2014, it traded near the $36 per share level. Today, OHI stock sells for just over $39 per share. Moreover, the forward P/E ratio of almost 23 does not make this REIT cheap.Still, the payout should more than compensate for these shortcomings. The current annual dividend stands at $2.64 per share, a yield of almost 6.75%. Over time, this payout tends to rise steadily. Although it has not increased since the beginning of 2018, the increasing profit should keep the payout moving higher. These profit increases and the demographic trend backing them up make OHI stock one of the better REITs to buy for the foreseeable future. Ryman Hospitality (RHP)Source: FlickrAlthough many may not recognize the Ryman Hospitality (NYSE:RHP) name, they do know its flagship property, Nashville's Gaylord Opryland Resort. They also own four other Gaylord resort properties spread across the country. The company also owns several entertainment venues in Nashville and two others outside of the area.Investors should place RHP stock on their REITs to buy list, not so much for its excitement, but a track record of mostly steady growth. The stock price has nearly doubled in value over the last five years. Shrinking profits likely contributed to a slight decline in RHP over the previous year.However, this may have given investors a buying opportunity. RHP stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of about 25.3, thanks to a temporary drop in annual profits. However, after this year, Wall Street predicts an average earnings growth rate of 15.51% for the next five years.  * 7 Marijuana Penny Stocks That I May Buy Since its second REIT dividend payment in 2013, the payout has steadily increased. It now pays shareholders $3.60 per year for a yield of just over 4.3%. As the valuation falls and profits and dividends increase, long-term investors should continue to benefit from both a growth and an income standpoint. Safehold, Inc. (SAFE)Source: Shutterstock Safehold (NYSE:SAFE) has become one of the REITs to buy for its unique take on property ownership. It specializes in ground leases. They buy the property under the building, leasing it back to the building owner. This unlocks the value of the property under buildings, allowing property holders to hold less equity and push cash to use in other areas. The REIT has applied this strategy to multiple property types.Since launching their IPO in 2017, SAFE stock and its dividend initially struggled. Moreover, the dividend yield of about 2.1% has remained below REIT averages. However, the stock began to appreciate in 2019. Now trading at about $29 per share, SAFE has appreciated by about 80% since January. Also, the company raised the annual dividend by 2 cents per share in July.Those increases should continue. Wall Street also predicts profit growth for the next five years will average 42.6% per year. Furthermore, despite this massive growth, it still sells for a forward multiple of about 22.2. As long as SAFE stock can maintain this pace of profit growth, shareholders should benefit from not only the dividend but also a continually rising stock price.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

To meet this demand, the wireless industry has been rapidly developing 5G technologies. Based on a Research and Markets report, the global 5G market is expected to reach $277 Billion by 2025. 5G networks will cover 40% of the world by 2024 according to Ericsson, with these networks expected to handle 25% of all mobile data traffic. The introduction of 5G coverage and devices has created a new segment in the market, with some stocks representing unique investment opportunities. This new standard is expected to revolutionize online communications, and analysts are saying now’s the time to get on board. Here are the analysts’ top 3 5G stocks. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS)T-Mobile is becoming a strong player in the 5G sector of the market.After drawn out lobbying and negotiations that lasted 15 months, TMUS and Sprint Corporation (S) are close to finalizing their merger after the Department of Justice gave its approval on July 29. Once the merger is finalized, TMUS will have 90 million customers and be able to compete with AT&T (T) and Verizon’s (VZ) size for the first time in its history. Both of its competitors have about 100 million customers each.Not to mention the company reported a second quarter earnings beat on July 25. EPS increased from $0.92 in the prior-year quarter to $1.29, surpassing the Street’s $0.99 estimate. Total revenue also gained 4% year-over-year reaching a record high of $11 billion. While T-Mobile has had trouble in the past with competitive pricing, the Sprint deal puts it in a position to sustain healthy long-term growth. “Price competition on the low-end — which has been a huge problem for T-Mobile over the past few years — will ease dramatically because the industry will go from Big 4 to Big 3. The company will have a much larger base heading into the mainstream development and roll-out of 5G coverage and 5G phones, giving it broader exposure to that secular growth tailwind. Broadly, this deal should significantly boost T-Mobile’s long term revenue and profit growth prospects,” financial blogger, Luke Lango, writes.      Top analyst, Jennifer Fritzsche, reiterated her Buy rating and raised her price target from $82 to $98 on July 29. She believes share prices could surge by 26% over the next twelve months. “While we are still waiting on the resolution of State lawsuit, we believe this deal is a significant positive for T-Mobile,” the Wells Fargo analyst said. She has a 69% success rate and gets an average return of 8% per rating. Wall Street takes a bullish stance on TMUS as well. It has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus, with 6 Buy ratings vs 1 Hold received over the last three months. The stock has an average price target of $92, suggesting 18% upside potential.  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)While its litigation with Apple Inc. (AAPL) has cast a shadow over the chip maker, some analysts are telling investors not to count Qualcomm out just yet. Many point to QCOM as one of the original forces behind the 5G movement. The company has a wide variety of 5G internet protocols and modem chips, with it only standing to benefit as 5G is more widely deployed. QCOM also wouldn't be negatively impacted by the T-Mobile/Sprint merger. T-Mobile now has a greater competitive advantage and the resources to offer improved 5G coverage. The better the offerings, the more 5G products that will be sold to consumers, which is good news for Qualcomm.    Despite reporting an earnings miss on July 31 in which revenue dropped 13% year-over-year to almost $5 billion, the company expects a large boost in 2020 and 2021 after the widespread release of 5G smart phones. Raymond James analyst, Chris Caso, said, “While we can't be as confident in the timing, the improvement is inevitable. The near-term issues don’t change the 5G story.” On August 1, he reiterated his Buy rating and price target of $115, suggesting a whopping 62% upside.  Another analyst, Tal Liani, agrees that demand weakness is a temporary issue ahead of the 5G smart phone release. On August 1, he reiterated his Buy rating and lowered the price target from $105 to $100. Despite the price target drop, he believes share prices could jump 41% over the next twelve months. “We believe Qualcomm's bull case is unchanged, with global 5G roll outs expected to increase both royalty income and demand for semiconductors beginning in 2020. Press reports suggest that all of Apple's 2020 iPhones will contain Qualcomm's 5G chipset, which could drive a 5G cycle across the entire industry,&quot; the Merrill Lynch analyst said. QCOM has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and a $79 average price target, indicating 11% upside potential.  Crown Castle International Corporation (CCI)In order to deploy 5G coverage, an investment will have to be made in upgrading current infrastructure. The new communication standard will require smaller cell towers and antennas located within several hundred yards of mobile devices. That’s where CCI comes in. Crown Castle is one of the leading providers of shared communications infrastructure. The company operates 65,000 small cell nodes, with it planning to expand to 85,000 by 2020. It is poised to sustain its long-term growth as carrier networks will more often than not rent tower spaces as opposed to building their own. On July 17, the company not only reported that its second quarter results had exceeded the mid-point on each of its targets, but also raised its full-year profit guidance. Net income is now expected to be $926 million, up from the previous $821 million estimate. Adjusted funds from operations (AFFD) was raised to $5.94 per diluted share, up from $5.84. On August 1, CCI got a vote of confidence from J.P. Morgan. Top analyst, Philip Cusick, believes the telecom stock is well positioned to surge as connectivity continues to grow. He upgraded CCI to a Buy and raised his price target from $125 to $150, suggesting 11% upside. Cusick has a 70% success rate and gets an average return of 12% per rating.Five-star rated financial blogger, Laura Hoy, also believes that CCI is in it for the long haul. “Demand for CCI’s infrastructure will only increase as 5G gains momentum and unlike companies like VZ and TMUS, Crown Castle doesn’t have to battle it out to hold on to subscribers. CCI stock wins as long as mobile usage and the demand for connectivity is growing — and that trend looks likely to continue for the foreseeable future,” she writes.     The telecom stock has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and a $150 average price target, indicating 11% upside potential.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-5g-stocks-analysts-add-144923930.html?.tsrc=rss

Sure, the Ferrari is a lot of fun to drive, and you look cool sitting behind the wheel. But it's also going to cost you a fortune, and high-performance cars spend a lot of time at the mechanic's shop.Now, compare that to a Honda Civic. You never really notice a Honda Civic on the road. It's utterly forgettable. But it's also just about indestructible, requires virtually no attention from you, and it quietly and efficiently does its job.Consider that mentality when you're tracking down stocks to buy. A highflying growth pick can be a lot of fun to own. You look smart owning it, and it's fun to talk about at parties. But when the market's mood swings the other way, you're often left with some nasty losses and a bruised ego. Meanwhile, that dividend-paying value stock in your portfolio might not be particularly interesting. But over the long haul, it's a lot less likely to give you problems. Like that Honda Civic, it will quietly do its job with no stress and no drama.&quot;Some of our most profitable trades over the years have been some of our most boring,&quot; explains Chase Robertson, principal of Houston-based RIA Robertson Wealth Management. &quot;We've done well for our clients by mostly avoiding the trendy sectors and focusing instead on value and income.&quot;Here are 11 boring but beautiful dividend stocks to buy now. They might not be much to look at, but they're likely to get the job done over the long term. And when you need them most - in retirement - they'll be less likely to break down on you.

Where will President Donald Trump's tariffs land next? Sure, Mexico is off the list for now - but it's clear that Trump favors the use of tariffs for more than just trade imbalances, which means anywhere on the map (including countries we've reached agreements with) is fair game for future trade wars.Which means it's important to consider stock picks not just based on the current tariff situation, but on the possibility that Europe, Mexico and other regions could become more problematic in the future.Finding insulation from the tariff effect is trickier than it sounds. For instance, most publicly traded casual dining restaurants operate most of their restaurants in the U.S. Thus, catering to primarily American consumers insulates them, right? Unfortunately, no. A University of California at Davis study shows 43% of fruit and vegetables - everything from strawberries and watermelons to avocados and onions - come from Mexico.Autos? More than 1,000 Chinese companies export parts to the U.S.; some U.S. firms already are switching their suppliers. Apparel? A lot of that textile work in China is going to, um, come out in the wash. Even utilities are tricky. Sure, their customers are almost entirely domestic. But many are converting to wind and solar power, and while those natural resources are American, many of the solar panels and wind turbines are not.Tariffs have far more impact than just the products themselves, too. The U.S. has slid from the fifth-most popular destination for Chinese tourists to 10th, thus losing some share of the estimated $315 billion they spend overseas. When considering the trade war, the warnings were about industrial companies and semiconductor firms. Few were thinking about the lodging industry.Here, then, are five stock picks with trade war safety in mind. They come from a handful of disparate industries that provide more insulation from current and future trade salvos than most.

While real estate and telecom are among the worst performers on the Stoxx 600 Index this year, Cellnex has soared after snapping up towers from carriers eager to convert their assets to cash, helping them keep up with network investments.“They are in a very sweet spot,” Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud, said by phone. “The only worry at the moment for me is that the stock has moved an awful long way in a very, very short space of time.”The tower company model is fairly new to Europe, in contrast with the U.S., where American Tower Corp. and Crown Castle International Corp. began buying communication sites in the mid-1990s. Since its initial public offering in 2015, Cellnex has seized the relatively open field with aggressive dealmaking, spending 2.7 billion euros ($3.1 billion) just last month on more than 10,000 towers in Italy, France and Switzerland.The company looks set to continue its acquisition spree -- it announced on Tuesday the issuance of as much as 850 million euros in a nine-year convertible bond to fund purchases. The company has increased the number of network infrastructure sites in its portfolio by six-fold to about 45,000 in the past 4.5 years, including ones it has agreements on building for clients.Cellnex has gained nearly 60% in the first half, taking this year’s estimated price-to-earnings ratio to an eye-watering 131, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s beyond such high-growth companies as the Dutch payments prodigy Adyen NA, or computer-games maker CD Projekt SA, which is about to publish its most-hyped title ever. Cellnex declined to comment on the valuation.While Cellnex’s expected revenue growth is much slower than the other names at the top, the surveyed 12 analysts estimate its earnings per share to nearly double from 2019 to 2021. Tower stocks have showed up on investors’ radar thanks to their stable cash flows and good visibility: smaller Italian peer Inwit SpA has also had a good year with a 43% gain so far. Tower contracts are usually signed for a decade or two.“There is a premium being paid for corporates that offer visibility,’’ Guy Peddy, an analyst at Macquarie, said by phone. “Cellnex is the only clear, European, free-from-ownership-issues, tower-focused operator.”Cellnex’s biggest shareholder is Italy’s Benetton family, which owns about 30% of the stock via its investment company Edizione. The family is said to be backing former Telecom Italia SpA head Franco Bernabe to replace Marco Patuano as chairman, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.During the stellar run of the second quarter, Cellnex shares have mostly traded above the average price target, leaving analysts to play catch-up. The gap became the widest ever this week at 3 euros and currently implies a 4.8% downside to the stock, according to 27 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.In Europe, the share of telecommunications infrastructure held by independent tower companies is low compared with other regions, according to an April report by accounting and consultancy firm EY and the European Wireless Infrastructure Association (EWIA). The share of independent tower firms was a mere 17% in 2017, compared with 67% in North America and 42% in the Caribbean and Latin America. Operators could free up 28 billion euros if that share grew to 50%, the report estimates.Race to BuyOne risk to Cellnex’s tower campaign across Europe is competition for assets. The region’s emerging tower business is “not a one-horse race,” analysts at Kempen warned in a note last month, saying that Cellnex losing out on deals could lead to investor disappointment. In 2016, American Towers teamed up with Dutch pension fund PGGM Fondsenbeheer BV, beating Cellnex to win Antin Infrastructure Partners’ French phone towers.While American Towers has been more focused on emerging markets since, there’s a possibility that a private equity firm such as KKR & Co. Inc. would join the party, Giles Thorne, an analyst at Jefferies said in a note on Tuesday, keeping his buy rating and raising his price target by more than 50%.“The one candidate that has the assets and scope on paper to replicate Cellnex’s march across Europe is KKR,” Thorne said. “Its actions suggest it doesn’t see the regional synergy case for cross-border M&A. This may yet change.”Additionally, some telecom carriers see network quality as an important competitive advantage and are reluctant to relinquish control of their top sites. Tim Hoettges, chief executive officer of Deutsche Telekom AG -- which is not a client of Cellnex -- has spoken of “golden sites” as a category of differentiating network infrastructure locations the company wouldn’t be willing to share.Yet overall, tower companies are well placed to benefit from industry-specific drivers, including increased data consumption, Josh Sambrook-Smith, a thematic equity analyst at Sarasin & Partners, said by phone.“You have all the other super exciting, long-term trends,” said Sambrook-Smith. “This is just a relatively safe way to play it.”(Updates share prices from the 6th paragraph, chart)To contact the reporter on this story: Kit Rees in London at krees1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Beth Mellor at bmellor@bloomberg.net, Kasper Viita, Celeste PerriFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aggressive-dealmaking-drives-europes-most-100535692.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-03-27	2019-03-27 16:02:56	CCI	Crown Castle International Corp.	3 5G Stocks to Buy That Also Pay Dividends	When considering near-term technological catalysts that will have a huge impact on the world, there's perhaps no greater advancement than 5G. And with that impending advancement, the focus on 5G stocks has started to gain traction among analysts and investors alike.For those wondering what 5G is, it stands for fifth-generation mobile networks. Simply put, that means it's the next generation of wireless internet connectivity that will have reduced latency and enable greater data capacity and quicker data transfer.However, while you get caught up in the hype, it's important to remember that 5G is not &quot;just&quot; about the general speed boost that will make using your phone even more addictive than it already is.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMuch of the excitement about 5G exists because of how it will facilitate greater developments in major tech trends such as autonomous vehicles, IoT, smart cities, artificial intelligence and cutting-edge healthcare implements … to name a few.Never thought remote surgery would be a thing? With 5G it will be.Getting a bit more simple, consider that by 2020, Gartner expects that nearly 21 billion devices will use the internet. This includes everything from toasters to home security devices and even &quot;dog collars.&quot;And that -- not the speed boost alone -- is the real reason everyone is talking about 5G now. It will inevitably influence almost everything we do.In the near term, our 5G future might not be as immediately awe-inspiring as the old-school 1950's interpretations of the future, loaded with flying cars and massive, robotic cityscapes, but the general scope of its effect will be massive, long-lasting and influence many different sectors.With such grand potential, there are certainly many promising 5G stocks to buy … but not all of these stocks are created equal.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Housing Stocks in 2019 Here are three of the best 5G stocks to buy as the trend heats up in 2019. Best 5G Stocks: Crown Castle (CCI)Source: Sy via Flickr (Modified)When looking at 5G stocks to buy, many investors focus on the sexy, big-name tech companies that will be behind the innovations that take advantage of this technology.But they shouldn't forget those companies that will help set the foundation to make our hyper-connected future possible.There are several companies that will help lay the groundwork for 5G and one of the standouts among these is the real estate investment trust (REIT) Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI).Crown Castle will be vital to the rollout of 5G because it &quot;owns, operates and leases more than 40,000 cell towers and 65,000 miles of fiber&quot;, all of which will be necessary for the widespread adoption of 5G in the years ahead.CCI's importance to the 5G rollout is even more clear when you consider that most cell companies rent these towers rather than own them. As Stephen McBride asserts in an article for Forbes, &quot;Crown Castle built 7,000 small towers in 2018. And it'll put up 15,000 more this year.&quot; McBride estimates that by 2025, CCI will have built 240,000 towers, each of which it &quot;will collect rent on … from the likes of Verizon and AT&T.&quot;Combine this long-term strength with a respectable 3.6% dividend and CCI stock solidifies itself among the best 5G stocks to buy for the long run. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Shutterstock Although it's important to consider infrastructure stocks like Crown Castle when betting on the 5G trend, it's also important to acknowledge better-known tech stocks like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) as well.From a 5G perspective, QCOM stock is one of the better stocks to buy as it is developing the hardware that will be used in cell phones to support 5G connectivity. Specifically, its recently announced Snapdragon X55 modem is an important evolution for the 5G rollout as it has support for 5G and &quot;older networks, too.&quot; Its previous 5G-supported modem -- the Snapdragon X50 -- was exclusively 5G.The continued support of older systems of connectivity in a singular modem will help ease the transition to 5G, all while retaining a future-centric approach in new hardware.Indeed, QCOM stock has been on a rough road over the past few months as its legal dispute with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other concerns have hampered its performance, but this doesn't necessarily mean you should completely count the stock out.Rather, this lackluster performance presents an interesting opportunity in QCOM, when you look at it through a perspective that considers a 5G future. Qualcomm's hardware will have an even greater role in this tech trend as its related cellphone hardware is finally implemented on a wider scale. (Note that while 5G got an early start in 2018, things aren't truly expected to pick up steam until 2020 or so.)  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Play the CBD Trend And investors who are willing to ride the long-term waves in Qualcomm also have its 4.4% dividend to help ease their concerns. China Mobile (CHL)Source: Shutterstock This final pick -- China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) -- is one of the more &quot;risky&quot; 5G stocks to buy, but with that risk comes a whole lot of potential that shouldn't be overlooked.Touted by some as the &quot;Chinese Verizon&quot;, CHL stock will be one of the key players in China that benefits from the 5G rollout. Mobile data research firm GSMA Intelligence estimates that &quot;Chinese 5G connections will scale rapidly over time, to reach 428 million by 2025.&quot; And that massive number is one of the key reasons China Mobile is worth a look.Although GSMA asserts that 5G adoption will be less rapid than the adoption of 4G, CHL is already testing 5G infrastructure in China, with &quot;commercial launches [expected] by 2020.&quot; Combine this frontrunner aspect with its generally steady growth that isn't directly tied to the 5G catalyst and CHL stock suddenly seems less risky … if you're willing to take a bet on a Chinese stock.And like the other 5G stocks on this list, China Mobile also offers a nice dividend, which currently yields 4.2%.Robert Waldo is an Assistant Editor for InvestorPlace.

  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for CCI with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting CCI.
