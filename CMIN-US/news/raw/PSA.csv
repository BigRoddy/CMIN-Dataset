Cove Hill Partners, Storable’s private equity owner, will retain a minority stake in the Austin, Texas-based company, which makes software used by self-storage companies.The people asked not to be identified speaking about the value of the deal since financial terms weren’t disclosed.Storable’s technology helps storage companies run their businesses and it also operates a consumer-facing portal called SpareFoot where people can browse for the best deals on self-storage near them.Storable’s Chief Executive Officer Chuck Gordon said in an interview that Storable’s customers include publicly traded real-estate investment trusts.The pandemic has caused more people to move from cities, he said, which has increased some demand for self-storage.Gordon, who co-founded SpareFoot while he was in college in 2008, said some of the new investment will go toward product and engineering.EQT U.S. PushThe potential acquisition comes as EQT weighs an exit for one of its biggest technology bets to date, SUSE. It acquired the open-source software developer in 2018 and has been building it up via acquisitions, including buying Rancher Labs this year. Bloomberg News reported last month that EQT is speaking to advisers about a potential initial public offering of SUSE that could seek a valuation of nearly $6 billion.Stockholm-based EQT is making a U.S. push for software deals and has invested in companies in the space in the past few years including analytics company Innovyze and cloud-based, business-software maker Acumatica. EQT’s infrastructure fund has also made large U.S. investments in telecommunications, fiber and data centers.Arvindh Kumar, an EQT partner, was hired last year from Iconiq Capital to boost the U.S. technology effort.“Storable is consistent with some of the software investments we’ve made in how it has a growing-end market that’s accelerating in terms of digital transformation,” Kumar said in an interview.The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021.Evercore Inc. advised EQT and William Blair & Co. advised Storable’s majority owner Cove Hill Partners.(Updates with confirmation from press release starting in first paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eqt-talks-stake-storable-2-190112605.html?.tsrc=rss

The Glendale, California-based company said it held ""constructive discussions"" with Eillott in the recent weeks and disclosed receiving six confidential recommendations for the election to the Public Storage Board of Trustees from Elliott before the Dec. 12 deadline for nominations.The three new directors appointed by Public Storage include Shankh Mitra, David Neithercut, and Paul Williams.Shankh Mitra is the CEO of the real estate investment trust Welltower Inc (NYSE: WELL). David Neithercut was the former President, CEO, and a current board member of the publicly-traded REIT Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR). Whereas, Paul Williams is the president of the Chicago chapter of the National Association of Corporate Directors.The Public Storage board overall has a strength of 13, meaning the six appointments sought by Elliott would constitute a minority, the Journal noted.Why Does It Matter: Current board members Uri P. Harkham, B. Wayne Hughes, Jr., and Daniel C. Staton will be retiring on Dec. 31.The Journal reports that self-storage services company is witnessing increased competition from rivals Extra Space Storage Inc (NYSE: EXR) and Cubesmart (NYSE: CUBE). Towards the end of October, there were reports that Blackstone Group Inc's (NYSE: BX) real estate division will acquire Brookfield Asset Management Inc (NYSE: BAM) owned Simply Self Storage for $1.2 billion.It isn't immediately clear what changes Elliott is pushing for at the company to improve its market performance.Price Action: PSA stock closed 1.61% higher at $220.06 on Friday.Photo, courtesy of Public StorageSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Amazon Aims To Upskill 29 Million In Cloud Computing  * COVID-19 Led To Biggest Drop In Global Carbon Emissions(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Moreover, over the past month, the stock fell by 5.99%, but in the past year, spiked by 8.54%.

2020-09-14	2020-09-14 14:02:27	PSA	Public Storage	Analyzing Public Storage's Unusual Options Activity	"Shares of Public Storage (NASDAQ: PSA) saw some unusual options activity on Monday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $220.66.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-16  * Strike Price: $230.00  * Volume: 358  * Open Interest: 150Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.When a contract has an expiration date in the distant future, it is generally another sign of unusual activity. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Earnings Scheduled For August 5, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

At time of writing, the S&P; 500 is just 1% away from being positive on the year and 6% away from literally the highest point in the index's history. Many discounts in prospective retirement stocks have evaporated completely.Yet the real economy still is in rough shape. Advance estimates showed first-quarter GDP slowing by 4.8%, and early estimates by the Atlanta Fed show Q2 GDP falling by an almost inconceivable 53.8%. These numbers should be taken with a grain of salt, as production will naturally bounce back as America comes out of lockdown. But it's going to be a while before things start to look normal again.High prices at a time when the economy is in freefall might seem odd. It actually gets worse when you look at stock valuations. We won't even bother with the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or the forward P/E. With earnings per share so distorted by COVID-19 disruptions, any metric that uses an estimation of corporate profits for the next year will be all but useless, making stocks priced against nonexistent earnings look artificially expensive.But even the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE), based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the past decade, tells a rather sobering story. At today's CAPE of 30, the S&P; 500 is 78% higher than its long-term average and priced to lose about 1.5% annually over the next eight years, according to research site GuruFocus.Yet as the old saying goes, the stock market is a market of stocks. While the major market averages are priced to disappoint, some bargains remain. And with the Federal Reserve continuing to pump liquidity into the system for the foreseeable future, the general direction will likely be higher.Today, we're going to look at 15 retirement stocks to buy at still-reasonable prices, even in the post-COVID-19 market. Not all are once-in-a-lifetime buys, but investors can rest assured that they're buying good companies at decent prices - exactly the way you want to build a retirement portfolio.

But there's a world of difference separating the sector's best REITs and its worst.Much of the pain in real estate has come courtesy of retail-focused companies, many of which have lost more than 50% of their value as investors correctly surmised that stay-at-home orders would minimize shopping trips and curtail customer spending. Office REITs have experienced outsized struggles, too, as shuttered businesses are unable to pay rents, and as large-scale work-from-home strategies have investors rethinking the future of office space.Not every REIT sector has been equally affected, however. Some REITs are riding out the pandemic shutdowns relatively unscathed - and some are even benefiting from the recent sea changes.However, while defensive business models are an important characteristic to have when determining REITs to buy, other qualities should be considered, too. Solid balance sheets are a must. Conservative payouts, which leave room for dividends to be easily covered in the event of a shock, and raised in the future when all is well, are ideal, too.Here are nine of the best REITs to buy not just for their durable businesses, but also their financial strength and dividend coverage.

2020-04-17	2020-04-17 23:02:53	PSA	Public Storage	3 Hot Insider Stock Picks You Need to Know	The S&P 500 has gained nearly 11% so far this month, and this rally is truly what seems to be – a bullish rally in the midst of a larger bear market. And this, of course, brings us to the main issue that investors must answer now: where to put their money. Markets bottomed on March 23, almost four weeks ago, and that trough brought many stocks down to an attractive point of entry. The current rally has not pushed them back high enough to erase that; the current price plateau offers latecomers a chance to buy into the rally while prices are still attractively low.So how to recognize the most compelling buying opportunities?One way is to follow the insiders. The word may have an unsavory flavor, especially after recent allegations that several Senators made ‘inside trades’ just as the coronavirus lockdowns started. But in reality, insiders are just corporate officers and Board members, the men and women responsible to shareholders for running America’s publicly traded corporations – and who also, by virtue of their positions, have access to earlier and better knowledge of the factors that will move stock values. They do trade on that knowledge – and to help keep the playing field level, they are required to make their inside stock moves public. Following their purchases is a viable strategy for finding potentially profitable stock plays.TipRanks has the tools to help you do just that. The Insiders’ Hot Stocks page shows which stocks top insiders are most active on, for both purchases and sales. You can sort insider trades by a variety of filters, including trading strategy. We’ve done some of the legwork for you, and pulled up three stocks with recent informative buy-side transactions. Here are the results.Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure (FTAI)The first company on our list today, Fortress Transportation, resembles REITs. Fortress buys, owns, and manages properties in the transportation industry, especially in the infrastructure segment. Where it deviates from the usual REIT format is in its other assets: Fortress also owns and operates the actual equipment in the transport niche, equipment like shipping containers, offshore drilling ships, and commercial jet aircraft. That last, commercial aircraft, makes up over 61% of the company’s asset portfolio. Fortress generates its profits through leases on its owned assets.On the insider front, three informative purchases have swung sentiment on this stock strongly positive. Two were made by members of the Board of Directors; the smaller, by Kenneth Nicholson, for $215,700, and the larger, by Paul Goodwin, for $435,880. The truly huge purchase, however, was made by a 10% owner in the company – an institutional investor, the Washington State Investment Board, which laid down $19.9 million for a 2.353 million shares. The magnitude of these purchases are clear indicators of confidence in the stock.As last year ended, FTAI finished with strong quarterly earnings. The 12 cents reported were 71% above the forecast, it was the third consecutive quarter to beat the forecast. Better yet, for investors, Fortress reported that, as of the end of 2019, 80% of its aviation equipment assets were leased out – and that the average remaining lease term was 29 months. This puts the company in a strong position to weather the coronavirus storm, as it guarantees income from half of the company’s assets for another two years.In addition to a solid fiscal footing, FTAI offers a 33-cent quarterly dividend. At $1.32, the annualized payment gives the stock a yield of 14.4%, more than enough to attract investors now that the Fed has cut rates back to near-zero, and made sweeter by a 5-year reliable payment history.Stephens analyst Justin Long is also confident in FTAI. He notes the stock’s high dividend, as well as its advantageous debt position, despite a heavy recent sell-off. At the bottom line, he writes, “We feel like the damage has been done with a draconian scenario being priced-in. We would also note FTAI is relatively well positioned in the aviation leasing industry with total debt to cap under 50% and no debt maturities until 2022... We also believe the infrastructure assets should drive substantial cash flow over the long term with FTAI continuing to opportunistically assess opportunities to monetize these assets…”Long puts a Buy on this FTAI shares, and his $22 price target implies a powerful upside potential of 125%, another attractive feature to go along with the high-yield dividend. (To watch Long’s track record, click here)Fortress has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, with 6 Buys outweighing a single Hold. The shares sell for $9.77, and the $21.43 average price target suggests that there is room for an impressive 118% upside growth in the coming 12 months. (See Fortress stock analysis at TipRanks)Stich Fix, Inc. (SFIX)Now here is an interesting niche; this small-cap company works to personalize online clothing shopping. The company’s platform allows customers to make stylistic preferences – and then receive periodic packages of clothing, selected by the company’s stylists. Once received, customers can choose to keep or return some or all of the clothes choices. It’s a unique take on eCommerce, combining data science, machine learning, and a personal touch to predict what customers will enjoy most.Looking ahead, the company is expected to post a 15-cent per share loss in fiscal Q3, for the period in this month – and covering, in large part, the economic shutdown due to the COVID-19 epidemic.But despite the tough path forward, two company directors have made multi-million dollar purchases in recent days. William Gurley spent $15.8 million on a 1 million share purchase this past Monday; Steven Spurlock spent $16.6 million on 1.05 million shares the same day. The two buys swung the sentiment need sharply into positive territory, and also show that both shareholders are willing to take advantage of current low prices to expand their holdings.Youssef Squali, 5-star analyst with SunTrust Robinson, explains why this may be a good idea. Acknowledging that the company has sharply pulled back its Q3 and full year guidance due to the commercial disruptions of COVID-19, Squali also says, “While we recognize that demand trends are likely to worsen in 2Q and possibly 3Q before they start getting better in 4Q (our estimate), we believe that shareholders with a longer-term horizon will be rewarded given the company's strong competitive positioning and sustainable business model…”For that long term, Squali sees a fit to place $27 price target, implying 80% growth for the stock. In line with this, he maintains his Buy rating. (To watch Squali’s track record, click here)The Moderate Buy analyst consensus view on this stock is backed by a near-even split of 8 Buys and 6 Holds. The $19.31 average price target indicates a 23% premium from the $15.70 current trading price of the shares. (See Stitch Fix stock analysis at TipRanks)Public Storage (PSA)Public Storage is well known for its chain of self-storage facilities across the US. In organization, PSA is a real estate investment trust, owning the properties and deriving income from leases and management fees.In recent days, three company Board members – Avedick Baruyr, Wayne Hughes, and Gary Pruitt – each purchased a block of 5,000 shares, for the price of $471,250. The purchases show clear confidence in the stock. These purchases bring the insider buys of the past three months to well over $1.5 million dollars.Public Storage came into 2020 with rising earnings, although results were just below the forecasts. Finishing calendar year 2019, PSA showed $2.84 in Q4 funds from operations, along with $598 million in total quarterly revenues. For the full year, FFO was $10.75, up 1.8% yoy, and revenue came in at $2.4 billion, up 1.4% from 2018. The numbers give the company a firm foundation, which it found it needed to face the dislocations in today’s economic landscape. Looking forward, PSA will be reporting first quarter results at the end of the month, and is expected to show $2.58 in FFO – a sequential decline of 9.2%.In a bright spot, however, PSA is maintaining its dividend. The company has made the payments reliably for the last 11 years – an admirable record – and the current payment is $2 per share quarterly. This gives a payout ratio of 70%, indicating that the dividend is affordable at current income levels – and will likely stay affordable, even if FFO slips this year. The annualized payment of $8 per share makes the dividend yield 4.1%; not huge, but still double the average among S&P listed companies.Turning to Wall Street’s view of the stock, we find that Merrill Lynch analyst Jeffrey Spector has recently upgraded his stance on PSA. Spector bumped his outlook from Neutral to Buy, and raised his price target to $267, suggesting a robust 36% upside. (To watch Spector’s track record, click here)Backing his view, Spector wrote, “PSA remains well positioned in our view, with minimal debt coming due in 2020 and ~$400M cash on hand as of 4Q… PSA [has] ample liquidity to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that arise.”Overall, PSA shares are still rated a &quot;hold&quot; by Wall Street’s analyst corps, based on an even 3-way split: 3 Buys, 3 Holds, and 3 Sells. The stock sells for $196.48 – and the average price target of $208.78 suggests only 6% upside.

2020-03-24	2020-03-24 19:39:33	PSA	Public Storage	BofA Upgrades Self-Storage REITs	"The U.S. is poised to enter a recession amid the growing coronavirus pandemic, but this outlook is favorable for self-storage companies, according to BofA Securities.The Analyst Jeffrey Spector upgraded Life Storage Inc (NYSE: LSI) from Neutral to Buy with a price target lowered from $126 to $117.The analyst also upgraded Public Storage (NYSE: PSA) from Neutral to Buy with a price target lifted from $254 from $267.The Thesis Self-Storage REIT companies offer investors exposure to a ""relatively defensive sector"" within the broader real estate segment for three reasons, Spector wrote in a note. These include:  * Demand for storage space is mostly sticky during recessions and higher during more severe recessions.  * Existing users will stay in place so occupancy rates will remain stable and offer cash flow and stability.  * Demand for storage will become ""more of a necessity"" today versus in the past.Life Storage: 'Rent Now' Initiative Life Storage's ""Rent Now"" initiative lets customers reserve and execute a lease without human interactions, Spector wrote. This move would be well accepted amid current demands for ""social distancing"" and result in a reduction in payroll expenses at the company level.Life Storage was better positioned to manage marketing expenses compared to its peers in 2019 and this should play out throughout 2020.Public Storage: Liquidity And Minimal Debt Spencer said Public Storage boasts ""ample"" liquidity along with ""minimal"" debt, which makes it well-positioned to operate throughout any downturn. Specifically, the company has $400 million in cash on hand with minimal debt obligations in 2020.The company's recent move to withdraw a $1.2 billion offer to acquire Australia-based NSR gives it even more liquidity to seek out future M&A opportunities.LSI and PSA Price Action Shares of Life Storage were trading higher by more than 10% at $77.68, while shares of Public Storage were higher by more than 4% at $167.72.Related Links:El-Erian Says Our Economic Situation Has Reached 'Critical Mass'Plunge In Oil Prices, Coronavirus Sell-Off Signal Recession, Analyst SaysSee more from Benzinga  * Tuesday Is 'Great American Takeout' Day  * Virgin Galactic Is A Buy After 70% Stock Decline, Morgan Stanley Says In Upgrade  * BTIG's Emanuel Says Stocks Risk 1987's 40% Downside Scenario If Senate Doesn't Act(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-03-04	2020-03-04 18:10:22	PSA	Public Storage	11 Defensive Dividend Stocks for Riding Out the Storm	"Remember when 1,000-point moves in the Dow where a big deal?Lately, they've become almost commonplace. The Dow fell by just shy of 1,000 points on March 3 after rallying by more than 1,200 points on March 2. This follows a week in which the Dow closed down by more than 1,000 twice and down 879 another day.That's some monster volatility. Yet despite the market turmoil, a handful of defensive dividend stocks are keeping their heads above water. It's an eclectic group, but you do see some common threads. Many are in basic industries that aren't particularly sensitive to economic growth or virus fears, such as packed foods and grocery stores. Many are low-beta stocks - shares that are less volatile than the broader market. And most pay above-average dividends, which helps to smooth out the ups and downs of the share price swings.These survivors also are a little off the beaten path and don't have much representation on the major stock indexes. That matters because when investors dump index funds, the mega-cap stocks that dominate the Dow, S&P; 500 and Nasdaq often get hit hard.""Aggressive selling in the indexes can translate into aggressive selling in historically strong stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and the other trillion-dollar names,"" says Mario Randholm, portfolio manager at alternative investments firm Randholm & Co. ""It's hard to picture a scenario in which all these dominant names will continue to outperform during a broad-market selloff.""Today, we're going to take a look at 11 low-beta, defensive dividend stocks that have been keeping their heads above water. As of the time of this writing, all were not only outperforming the market since the correction began Feb. 19, but most were clinging to at least modest gains. Those gains might prove to be tenuous if the market takes another leg down. But at the very least, these stocks seem better-positioned to sustain less damage than most of their peers.

The best retirement stocks to buy, then - whether you're buying in 2019 or any other year - must be quality dividend payers that can help meet both of those goals in the long-term.Unlike many fixed-income investments, numerous dividend stocks offer relatively high yields, grow their payouts each year and appreciate in price over time as their businesses generate more profits and become more valuable.Not all dividends are safe, however. From General Electric (GE) and Owens & Minor (OMI) to L Brands (LB) and Buckeye Partners LP (BPL), several high-profile dividend-payers slashed their payouts in 2018, sending their stock prices tumbling. So the dividend stocks you depend on must be chosen with care.These are the 19 best retirement stocks to buy for 2019. Research firm Simply Safe Dividends developed a Dividend Safety Score system that has helped investors avoid more than 98% of dividend cuts, including each of those companies listed above. The 19 stocks on this list have solid Dividend Safety Scores and generous yields near 4% or higher, making them appealing retirement stocks for income. Importantly, they also have strong potential to maintain and grow their dividends in all manner of economic and market environments.

With that in mind, it's time to start positioning your portfolio for 2020. It's a great time to cut loose some stocks that have stopped working and redeploy the capital elsewhere. Tax-loss selling in particular can make for a great time to jettison some old positions and pick up more promising stocks to buy going forward.And now, as 2019 winds to a close, it's time to start thinking about more defensive stocks. Over the past two months we've seen a clear rotation out of pure growth stocks into more value-oriented names. Particularly with the move in interest rates, investors will demand safe income-paying stocks to buy in 2020. Here's seven safe stocks that should be great buy-and-hold candidates for at least the next year.   Stocks to Buy: Altria (MO)Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 7.6%InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt appears that the bottom may be in for the tobacco stocks. The sector has rallied sharply since I highlighted it recently. As these things tend to do, it appears the general media scare around vaping illnesses is starting to taper off. Additionally, more and more focus is going to the vaping of THC, often in illicit cartridges. Very few of the reported lung problems so far have been tied to Juul or other credible regulated nicotine suppliers.This doesn't mean Juul's problems will go away overnight. In the long run, however, I expect Altria (NYSE:MO) to make money on its vaping investment. That's in sharp contrast to the market, which has recently been pricing MO stock as if the company will need to write off the full investment entirely.As it is, Altria's existing cigarette sales along with cash flow from its stake in Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) is enough to cover the dividend. If and when Juul starts providing meaningful cash flow to Altria, it will support a higher share price and dividend -- but you don't need to justify the current $46 MO stock price and greater than 7% dividend yield. Over the long haul, tobacco companies have continued to make tremendous amounts of cash flow despite considerable regulatory intervention and downright hostile media coverage.  * 10 Hot Pot Stocks to Buy Vaping worries will pass sooner or later; the desire to consume nicotine, however, isn't going anywhere. By the end of 2020, people that bought Altria when it was cheap will be enjoying their dividends with the vaping scare already long forgotten. Wells Fargo (WFC)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 4.1%It's almost unbelievable that Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) stock remains this much of a value. The company has announced all sorts of good news this year, but the share price hasn't gone anywhere yet.The company brought in a highly credible new CEO in the form of Charles Scharf, the former head of Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) and Visa (NYSE:V). Those are two of the largest and most reputable financial firms in the country. Wells Fargo's critics had slammed the company, saying management was untrustworthy and that the company couldn't attract a competent outsider CEO. The board proved them wrong and brought in a superstar new chief executive. Scharf's particular competence in financial technology matters will assist Wells Fargo greatly.WFC's earnings have also come in stronger than expected. People have been slamming the bank stocks all year. As interest rates have dropped, people are afraid of what will happen to banks' profit margins. Yet Wells Fargo's diversified business has continued to generate steady earnings despite the net interest margin headwind.That point, combined with the company's excess capital position, leads to the dividend. Since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, companies have stockpiled capital in response to regulatory demands. Capital levels reached historically extreme levels, in fact. Now the regulators are starting to loosen up a bit, and that is letting the banks put money back to work. Wells Fargo is doing so with both a double-digit dividend increase this year and a massive share buyback. Management intends to repurchase more than 10% of all outstanding WFC stock over the next year. With the company paying an over 4% dividend and providing a massive persistent bid under the share price with the buyback, Wells Fargo is a great safe stock holding for 2020. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3%Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) isn't the most exciting stock on this list by any means. But it is one of the safest. In fact, the company has been a bedrock of conservative portfolios for an entire century now. And nothing has changed. The company remains well-diversified with business operations spanning prescription drugs, consumer health and hygiene products, and medical devices.J&J runs as a decentralized firm, giving each unit independent management and operating authority. This creates a high level of resilience, as Johnson and Johnson has always been able to offset weakness from any one division or product with strength in others. Now, for example, the company is seeing weakness in consumer products but strength elsewhere has balanced it out.Why JNJ stock for 2020 in particular? Recently, the company has been dinged by lawsuits for both its involvement in the opioid crisis and various other matters. It just got hit with another scare this past week, as JNJ stock slumped on news of a baby powder recall. However, some folks tend to trade the headline and not think about the longer-term impact. Generally, J&J is able to get fines reduced greatly on appeal, and despite many decades of making sometimes controversial healthcare products, it has rarely gotten stung with true shareholder-value destroying liabilities.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before December's Meltdown With JNJ stock down 20% from its highs despite a strong rally in defensive stocks, there's a great argument for locking in the stock's rock-solid dividend for 2020, along with a potential run-up in the share price to $150 as lawsuit fears diminish. Dow (DOW)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 5.9%Dow (NYSE:DOW) is not the safest company on this list. There's generally a trade-off between dividend yield and safety of said dividend. But at least through the end of 2020, Dow should be able to maintain its current dividend level, offering shareholders an almost 6% yield. And the stock price could appreciate nicely as current recession fears and worries about the chemical market recede.Simply put, Dow is a high-yield company that also faces significant potential trade war disruption. Throw in all the confusion around the recent spinoff, and investors don't quite know what to make of the new DOW stock. My take, at least through the end of 2020, is to look for a safe 6% dividend yield and the possibility of some nice share price upside if global economic sentiment improves.Already, we've seen some significant improvement on the economic front. Not only does data keep coming in reasonably strong, now the yield curve has reverted to normal. Remember everyone panicking over the yield curve inversion a few months ago? That's gone now. A company like Dow wins the most as the economic tide rises again. At 11 times forward earnings, DOW stock is a bargain too. Public Storage (PSA)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.3%Looking to park some money away for safekeeping at a higher interest rate than you'd get at the bank? Why not consider stowing it at Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)? Real estate investment trusts have been hard stocks to buy lately -- the sector has soared to new all-time highs as investors hunt for yield. This has made valuations extremely expensive for real estate stocks in general.Due to concerns about pricing and capacity in the self-storage space, REITs like Public Storage have trailed their peers to an extent. PSA stock is up nicely this year, but it's still well short of its all-time highs, at least for the time being.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Buy Now That could change in 2020 though. New self-storage site building has slowed down dramatically. Meanwhile, the industry remains fragmented with mom-and-pop operators holding a major portion of the business. This gives Public Storage the opportunity to keep using its industry-best balance sheet to pick up properties opportunistically and create additional growth. And at worst, PSA stock would tread water, safely kicking out its rock-solid dividend as Americans continue to store their belongings, regardless of the economic winds. Walgreens (WBA)Source: saaton / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.3%Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) is having a bad year. And this bad year comes on top of a series of mediocre ones. Dating back to 2013, WBA stock has been merely flat during a raging bull market. Don't bet against Walgreens forever though. In fact, 2020 could be the rebound year for WBA stock.You may not know Walgreens as a safe conservative stock play. Historically, Walgreens has had a surging share price, and as a result, a relatively low dividend yield. Things have changed though. With the prolonged stagnation in the share price, Walgreens' dividend yield has now moved up to 3.3%.That's in large part because Walgreens' earnings continue to grow, and it pays a higher and higher dividend with every passing year. In fact, it's a dividend aristocrat stock with more than 25 years of consecutive dividend hikes.There are long-term concerns about the company's business model. Drug pricing is a question mark, and investors fear that Walgreens will earn lower profit margins on prescriptions in the future. Meanwhile, front-of-the-store sales of convenience goods such as soda and candy may be pressured due to the changing retail climate. Still, Walgreens has proved resilient over the decades and any sort of political clarity on drug pricing in 2020 as the election plays out could send WBA stock sharply higher. In the meantime, enjoy the stock's highest dividend yield in ages. Novo Nordisk (NVO)Source: joreks / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.2%If you're a newer investor, you may not have heard of Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO). You've certainly heard about its products though. Novo is the world's leader in producing insulin and other therapies for diabetes. As the diabetes public health crisis continues to worsen both in the U.S. and abroad, Novo's importance in the global healthcare system increases with every passing year.Short of some massive dietary and lifestyle changes, it's hard to imagine a world in which the rate of diabetes declines significantly in coming years, given current demographic trends. This, in turn, will ensure that Novo Nordisk has much work to do.NVO stock is still down significantly from its all-time highs. There was a major concern about insulin pricing a couple years ago, and even with that largely resolved, shares aren't back to their peak -- yet. The company just picked up a huge regulatory approval, adding a specific catalyst to the company's already powerful demographic tailwinds. Novo pays a steadily rising dividend (as measured in its home currency, Danish Kroner) and should enjoy a significant share price increase in 2020 as well, making it a perfect growth and income opportunity in a defensive safe stock.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned DOW, JNJ, MO, NVO, PSA, WBA and WFC stock.

2019-09-09	2019-09-09 18:26:51	PSA	Public Storage	5 REITs You Can Buy and Hold for Decades	When it comes to your investments, a decade is a long time. Ten years ago, we were just recovering from the 2008 meltdown and the worst recession since the Great Depression. Investors were nursing catastrophic losses. For some, it felt like the world was ending.Ten years before that, we were in the midst of dot-com mania and the biggest stock market bubble in history. Just a decade before that, no one had ever heard of the internet, and mobile phones were the size of a cinder block. We can only guess what the world will look like 10 years from now.Real estate traditionally has been a stable store of value. But with the rate of change accelerating in recent years, even the stability of some real estate investment trusts (REITs) has come into question. Amazon.com (AMZN) is taking a wrecking ball to brick-and-mortar retail, Airbnb is turning every spare bed into a viable hotel competitor, and telecommuting is making the traditional office far less critical than it used to be.For buy-and-hold investors, the key to making money in REITs over the coming decades will be to focus on properties that are as &quot;future-proof&quot; as possible. As fast as the world is changing, we'll likely always need places to live, medical facilities, warehouses and other mission-critical properties.Today, we're going to look at five REITs to buy and hold for decades. After the recent run-up in REIT prices, you don't necessarily need to run out and buy them today. But find somewhere to write each of these names down so you remember them during a dip. Because if you're looking for a collection of real estate stocks to throw off the income you'll need in retirement, each of these fits the bill.

2019-08-26	2019-08-26 16:22:45	PSA	Public Storage	4 Safe Havens From the Trade War	The ranks of trade war victims are growing with every Trump tweet. Friday's bloodbath and this morning's upside reversal is simply the latest volatility seizure suffered by stocks. If the heightened uncertainty has left you wounded, you're in good company.Today we'll offer up four safe stocks to buy that have provided ample shelter from the storm. They all boast significant year-to-date gains, low volatility, and rock-solid technical trends. Furthermore, their status as safety plays was reaffirmed by their behavior on Friday.Two of them shot to the moon. The other two fell but much less than the S&P 500.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 4 Triggers That Could Kick Gold Into High Gear Let's take a closer look at these safe stocks. Utilities SPDR (XLU)Source: ThinkorSwim The Utilities SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLU) notched a new all-time high Friday at $62.46. The morning strength pushed its year-to-date gains to 18.4% before XLU finally succumbed to broad market selling into the close. On the technical front, it has a consistent uptrend complete with rising 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages.Aside from its beautiful price chart, XLU has two other dynamics going for it. First is its juicy 3.16% dividend yield. Now that the Fed has begun what could be a series of rate cuts, high dividend-paying stocks are becoming increasingly attractive. Second is its low volatility, defensive nature. Historically, the utility sector has held up well during recessions and offers lower day-to-day volatility than other sectors.Buy XLU and relish in the slow-moving, income-producing ride. iShares US Real Estate ETF (IYR)Source: ThinkorSwim The iShares US Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:IYR) shares many characteristics with XLU, including the above-average dividend yield and low volatility. Its current dividend yield is 3%, and at Friday's peak, its year-to-date gains were 24%.IYR is one of the most liquid real estate investment trusts in the market and has listed options if derivatives are your instrument of choice. It offers a diversified basket of over 100 real estate companies like Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) and Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX). All remain attractive safe stocks to buy as alternatives to a pure sector bet.To offer context on volatility for IYR, its beta is a lowly 0.59. XLU was even lower at 0.24.  * 5 Stocks That Could Pop When the Trade War Ends Falling interest rates and investors desire for volatility reduction should continue to boost this safe stock for months to come. SPDR Gold Trust (GLD)Source: ThinkorSwim For traders looking to sidestep stocks altogether, I suggest looking to gold. Its safe-haven status has been questioned throughout the years, but there's no doubt it's been an effective diversifier in 2019. Year-to-date the yellow metal is up 19%, putting it on pace for one of its best years over the past decade.Its beta is -0.21, which reveals its inverse correlation to stocks as well as its extremely low volatility. Ever since June's breakout, GLD has acted extremely well on the technical front. Buyers have gobbled up every dip and chased every breakout. Friday's market beatdown brought buyers flocking into gold, reaffirming its popularity among safe stock seekers.GLD should continue to shine bright. iShares Barclays 20+ Year Treas.Bond (TLT)Source: ThinkorSwim No list of safe stocks or safe investments would be complete without including treasury bonds. Given their almost perfect inverse correlation to stocks in recent months, they've been a perfect yin to the market's yang.

2019-07-02	2019-07-02 18:25:45	PSA	Public Storage	25 Stocks Every Retiree Should Own	Retirement is a major life milestone, eclipsed only by marriage or the birth of your first child in terms of financial impact. For many, it's an exhilarating leap into the unknown. In your working years, you can take investing setbacks in stride, as portfolio losses can be offset by new savings or working an extra year or two.But once retired, you no longer have that luxury. Your portfolio must last for the the rest of your life, and that of your spouse as well. So, the decision of what retirement stocks you should include your portfolio is an important one.An ideal retirement stock will pay a healthy dividend. As Sonia Joao, president of Houston-based RIA Robertson Wealth Management, explains, &quot;Four out of five of our clients are in or near retirement, and essentially all of them tell us the same thing. They want safe, secure streams of income to meet their living expenses and replace their paychecks.&quot;While a good dividend is probably the most important characteristic to look for, it's certainly not the only one. Yields across most asset classes are lower today than in years past, and retirees need growth to stay ahead of inflation. So, while a retirement portfolio should have a large share of income stocks, it also will include some growth names for balance.The following are 25 stocks every retiree should own. This group of retirement stocks includes both pure income plays and growth companies, with a focus on very-long-term performance and durability.

When rates increase, the stock market will have to stand by itself, which will be difficult because the repayment of debts will be more expensive for many companies that borrowed cheap money.  While all REITs are likely to take a hit, some will present excellent buying opportunities, especially since you will be collecting relatively generous dividend yields in the meantime.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/65224583-a3cb-31ce-900b-4ed71c6dc288/10-biggest-reits%3A-an-overview.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-04-16	2019-04-16 19:03:24	PSA	Public Storage	5 Wonderful REITs to Buy Today	After an abysmal 2018, real estate investment trusts (REITs) have been on a roll this year. After pulling one of the worst performances since the Great Recession, REITs have surged by double digits in 2019 as investors have flocked back to the sector. And there's plenty of reasons why.For starters, the Federal Reserve and its dovishness have provided a base for the sector. As a high-yielding security type, REITs generally take it on the chin when the Fed raises benchmark interest rates. But with Powell & Company pausing, investors can own the REITs' better-than-average dividend yields much more safely.Secondly, that pause in rates makes it much cheaper for real estate firms to take out mortgages and loans to buy/build properties.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, the still-growing economy has continued to strengthen a variety of real estate sectors, including office, industrial and even retail properties. With better cash flows and rent growth, the REITs have been stellar this year. And it looks like they can keep the party going.  * 7 Stocks That Can Outperform for Years While we probably won't see continued double-digit jumps throughout the rest of 2019, the combination of high dividends and some decent capital appreciation will still make owning REITs a highly desirable prospect in the quarters ahead. With that, here are five of the best REITs to buy today. Best REITs to Buy: Public Storage (PSA)Source: Mike Mozart Via FlickrDividend Yield: 3.7%Despite owning a decent sized house and a shed, every weekend I see my neighbors zoom off and back to exchange items at their storage facility. And I know they aren't alone. Americans have too much stuff, and Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) is helping solve the problem of where to keep it all.PSA is the world's largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities. The firm owns more than 2,500 locations across the United States with more than 170 million square feet of rentable space. And it turns out, Americans need that space.Since the recession, PSA has benefited from the trend of downsizing and the rise of apartment dwelling. People still need space to store holiday decorations, special items, and even clothes. Here, thanks to its massive footprint, Public Storage has been able to capitalize on America's needs. Occupancy rates for its facilities topped 90% during the last reported quarter.Perhaps the best part is, that thanks to its low cost of maintenance, building and operating expenses, PSA is able to pull in plenty of cash flows from its properties. Funds from operations -- which determine dividends -- rose more than 7.7% overall of 2018. This has allowed PSA to pay a very juicy 3.7% dividend.With continued rent hikes and demand, PSA should be able to keep the dividends coming. And that makes it a strong choice among REITs. Blackstone Mortgage Trust Inc (BXMT) Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 7.1%With the Fed pausing on its rate of hikes, Blackstone Mortgage Trust (NASDAQ:BXMT) could be a rewarding, high-yielding play. BXMT is considered a mortgage REIT. That is, the firm doesn't own physical properties but invests in mortgages or loans tied to buildings. Since these paper REITs often use leverage and don't physically own the buildings, they are sometimes considered riskier than then equity REIT sisters. As a result, you get a higher yield.In this case, BXMT is paying out more than 7.1%.However, that high yield does mask some &quot;safety&quot; with BXMT. For starters, with the Fed pausing, it takes the pressure off of Blackstone's ability to use leverage. But secondly, the REIT's portfolio of loans is top notch. Using its expertise from parent Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX), BXMT's portfolio focuses on senior -- read: first in line during bankruptcy -- loans. The amazing thing is that 100% of its portfolio is performing and paying their interest back on time. As if it couldn't get any better, 96% of its portfolio is floating rate and will adjust higher if the Fed raises benchmarks again. This strength is a rarity among the mREITs.  * 7 Mid-Cap Stocks to Find the Market's Sweet Spot This focus on quality and cash flows has allowed BXMT to cover its dividend by more than 117%. With more firepower in its reserves and BX's backing, BXMT makes a very compelling high-yield REIT to add to any portfolio. Host Hotels and Resorts Inc (HST)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.2%With the economy growing, travel and leisure have come back in a big way. That seems to benefit the hotel REITs. And the king of them all is Host Hotels and Resorts (NYSE:HST).Host owns 93 properties with around 52,000 rooms. The vast bulk of these are luxury and upper upscale resort, large convention center, and city center hotel. Or as HST likes to call them &quot;Iconic Assets That Cannot Be Replicated.&quot; These aren't your local Holiday Inn Express. This has benefited Host is a variety of ways.For one thing, its revenue per available room (RevPAR) is very high and averaged $272 per room for its total portfolio last quarter. It's top 40 assets pulled in over $360 per room. This is extremely high, as luxury resort seekers don't usually skimp on the extras. Even better is that hotel REITs are able to adjust their rent rates daily to reflect demand. With travel rising, Host has been able to score higher rates and in turn, higher RevPAR figures.That's important because all of that drives dividends. After cutting its dividend to a penny back during the recession, Host has been able to grow its payout by 1,900% as well as pay a few special dividends and grow its cash hoard to over $1.5 billion.All in all, when it comes to REITs, Host Hotels has the right mix of properties to drive future returns. Equity Residential (EQR)Source: Equity Residential Dividend Yield: 3%When it comes to real estate, the old adage still rings true. It really is about &quot;location, location and location.&quot; And apartment REIT Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) has managed to turn its locations into gold mines.Founded by real estate guru Sam Zell, EQR is a powerhouse in the apartment sector with more than 300 different communities and 79,000 apartment units. The key is that these buildings are located in six core markets of Boston, New York, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco, and Southern California. These six markets all feature high home prices, low supplies of rental units and strong younger demographics -- all things that are very conducive to apartments.  As a result, EQR's properties are at a high 96%-plus occupancy rate.That operating area and high demand allow it to steadily increase rates at above-average levels.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives With these prime assets and rent growth, EQR has been a dividend machine. The firm has grown its dividend since 2010 at a nearly 5% annual growth rate (CAGR). It recently upped its payout again at the start of this year. Meanwhile, EQR has paid plenty in special dividends as well.In the end, location is what drives REIT success, and EQR has it in spades. SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3.9%As the saying goes, If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere. New York-based REIT SL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG) is proof of that.SLG is the largest owner of office properties in New York City. The firm owns more than 101 different buildings in Manhattan, including some of the priciest digs and sought-after office spaces. Additionally, the REIT holds plenty of office and retail space in Brooklyn, Westchester and neighboring Connecticut and New Jersey. All in all, SLG's portfolio features some of the most irreplaceable buildings in the entire city.As such, the REIT is able to charge some pretty hefty rents for its properties while still enjoying high occupancy rates. New York City rents have stayed pretty stable since the end of the recession.Meanwhile, SLG has been smartly selling off smaller assets and many of its suburban properties to provide capital for its rich development pipeline. This includes several show-stopper buildings that have already been leased to near-capacity. Ultimately, recycling this capital makes sense and SLG should enjoy higher rents/occupancy rates when its construction is online.As they wait, investors in SLG stock can enjoy its 3.9% dividend that has slowly grown over the years.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the REITs mentioned.

## Summary

  * ETFs holding this stock are seeing positive inflows but are weakening 
  * Bearish sentiment is low



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is low for PSA with fewer than 5% of shares on loan. The last change in the short interest score occurred more than 1 month ago and implies that there has been little change in sentiment among investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Negative

ETF activity is negative and may be weakening. The net inflows of $200 million over the last one-month into ETFs that hold PSA are among the lowest of the last year and appear to be slowing.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Neutral

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Financials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap

It’s difficult, if not downright dangerous, to evaluate any REIT like a typical equity, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).  Whereas names like BofA or Microsoft are measured by clear-cut metrics like per-share profits, quirky figures like FFO (funds from operations) are better indicators of a REIT’s health.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reason-analysts-don-t-public-140940762.html?.tsrc=rss

Stocks haven&apos;t recorded a 20% drop since March 9, 2009 - the beginning of the recovery from the Great Recession. At 3,444 days at last count, this bull market is on pace to set the all-time record on Aug. 22, surpassing the 3,452-day rally between Oct. 11, 1990. Nothing lasts forever, of course, and that will be true of the current bull market at some point. &quot;Since we are back close to the highs for the S&P 500, risks of a pullback have certainly risen,&quot; Wall Street veteran Bill Stone told CNBC on Aug. 9. But even with a bear market nowhere in sight, some individual stocks may be in trouble. TipRanks&apos; Stock Screener reveals stocks with a bearish analyst consensus rating - so while we often use the screener to identify stocks to buy, it&apos;s also useful in targeting stocks to avoid or even sell. Today, we&apos;ll look at seven stocks that have consensus hold or sell ratings from Wall Street right now, indicating that they could be trouble in the months ahead. We&apos;ll also share analysts&apos; price targets on these stocks to avoid, and the pros&apos; reasons as to why.

2018-06-27	2018-06-27 19:51:06	PSA	Public Storage	25 Stocks Every Retiree Should Own	Retirement for most Americans is a giant and often scary jump into the unknown. In your working years, you can generally take the occasional investing mistake in stride. Retirement portfolio losses can be offset by simply saving more or working a little longer. But once you&apos;ve retired, you no longer have that luxury. You need your nest egg to last throughout your life and possibly that of your spouse as well. So, as you choose your investments, choose wisely. A good retirement stock will ideally pay a healthy dividend. Sonia Joao, President of Robertson Wealth Management, a Houston-based RIA, explains, &quot;Eighty percent of our clients are in or near retirement, and virtually all of them tell us the same thing. They&apos;re looking for safe, secure streams of income to meet their living expenses and replace their paychecks.&quot; A safe dividend is arguably the most important characteristic to look for. But with inflation likely to be higher over the next decade than it was over the previous one, retirees also need growth to maintain their purchasing power. So, a good retirement portfolio will be laden with income stocks - but also a few growth plays for balance. Just remember: Not all &quot;income stocks&quot; belong in a retirement portfolio. For example, troubled industries like tobacco and telecom might have juicy yields, but they offer virtually no possibility for growth. Now, let&apos;s dig in. Here are 25 stocks every retiree should own. SEE ALSO: 53 Best Dividend Stocks for 2018 and Beyond	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-stocks-every-retiree-own-195106419.html?.tsrc=rss
