Analysts are specialists within banking and financial systems that typically report for specific stocks or within defined sectors. These people research company financial statements, sit in conference calls and meetings, and speak with relevant insiders to determine what are known as analyst ratings for stocks. Typically, analysts will rate each stock once a quarter. Analysts also give out recommendations like ""buy"", ""sell"", ""hold"", or similar verbage for each stock based on their overall evaluations of the corres ponding company. A ""buy"" indicates that an analyst is optimistic about a stock's short-term or mid-term growth, recommending traders to purchase the stock. Contrastingly, a ""sell"" means that an analyst believes the stock will trend downwards in that same time frame. A ""hold"" suggests that investors should not buy more of or sell any of the specified stock due to that analyst's prediction of stagnation. Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors.

2021-03-23	2021-03-23 12:49:43	AMT	American Tower Corporation	A Look Into American Tower's Debt	Shares of American Tower (NYSE:AMT) rose by 2.15% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt American Tower has. American Tower's Debt According to the American Tower's most recent financial statement as reported on October 29, 2020, total debt is at $24.92 billion, with $24.01 billion in long-term debt and $910.70 million in current debt. Adjusting for $1.63 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $23.30 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering American Tower's $41.46 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.6. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) lays claim to being the nation's first and largest owner and operator of life sciences property, and that sector is getting larger.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e774924d-2d83-3728-b041-bb509d159693/3-best-reits-to-buy-right-now.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-03-15	2021-03-15 15:46:42	AMT	American Tower Corporation	Following Its Sharp Slide, American Tower Could Begin To Bounce Back	In the world of REITs, investors have many options and while most REITs focus on conventional forms of real estate (like apartment buildings, office buildings, shopping centers), others are more unconventional. American Tower (AMT) focuses on infrastructure assets, namely cellular phone towers, and while not the most glamorous segment of real estate, its underlying business has remained resilient throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. However, after several years of strong returns, AMT shares have been trending lower since last summer and the stock experienced a significant drop during the Feb. 2021 stock market sell-off. As shares start to recover, there may be renewed investor interest in this high-quality REIT, which could push the shares back up to prior price levels. American Tower Stock Has Fallen To Appealing Levels AMT stock has fallen to attractive levels after months of trending lower, which culminated in its double-digit pullback in Feb. It continues to command rich forward multiples, which may be justified given its track record of both earnings and dividend growth (average annual dividend growth rate of 19.8% over the past five years). However, investors should not expect to see quick gains in AMT. This is more of a long-term, compounder opportunity. When factoring in both dividend yield and earnings growth (despite slowing relative to prior years), the potential exists for double-digit annualized returns over a longer time frame. Future Returns May Fall Short Of Expectations The bull case for American Tower appears to be solid but there is no guarantee that this stock will continue to deliver blockbuster returns to investors. AMT is a high-quality REIT and has remained resilient throughout the pandemic. But these positives are what has contributed to its premium valuation, which could become an issue if said valuation continues to contract. It should be noted that AMT has been trending lower since hitting all-time highs of $269.38 per share last summer. Further declines in the near-term may be limited, but after a decade of above average appreciation (16.8% annualized returns, including dividends), we could see more modest long-term returns going forward. While both the bull and bear cases for AMT remain possibilities, confidence remains high among sell-side analysts that the stock will continue to deliver for investors. What Analysts Are Saying About AMT Stock AMT has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on 7 Buys and 1 Hold recommendation. The average analyst price target of $273.13 implies around 27% upside potential from current levels over the next 12 months. Analyst price targets range from a high of $324 per share, to a low of $230 per share. (See American Tower stock analysis on TipRanks) Bottom Line: Further Rebound Possible With American Tower American Tower is a premium REIT, commanding a premium price. Yet, after its double-digit slide, we may be starting to see renewed investor interest. That’s not to say we’ll see a rapid rebound in the coming months. But, as more investors get wind of its long-term potential as a “buy and hold” stock, the AMT post-correction rebound may just be getting warmed up.

2021-02-04	2021-02-04 13:06:57	AMT	American Tower Corporation	Telefonica’s M&A Plan Leaves CEO With No Room for Error	(Bloomberg) -- Telefonica SA notched up its strongest January share rally in six years after it clinched a sale of its wireless towers for 7.7 billion euros ($9.4 billion).The jump still leaves Telefonica far behind its rivals, and Chairman Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete now faces a series of more daunting challenges to keep his new investors onside.First up is a sale of most of Telefonica’s underperforming Latin American units. The promise remains mostly unfulfilled because the pandemic is ravaging economies and putting off potential buyers, according to people familiar with the negotiations. Efforts to bring new investors into Telefonica’s technology ventures are also proving to be a much bigger challenge than expected, they said.For now, the sale of more than 30,000 tower sites to American Tower Corp. has helped to counter a perception often voiced by investors that Telefonica management is over-promising and under-delivering on asset sales needed to cut debt. Few had expected Pallete to give up full control of the wireless infrastructure to net a bigger cash windfall.“For some time, Telefonica’s management credibility was questioned and it showed through clearly in the stock’s under-performance,” said Bestinver Gestion fund manager Ricardo Seixas, who bought into Telefonica toward the end of last year. The tower sale “signals the company is doing what the market expects of it.”There’s a lot more to do. Telefonica’s cash-rich core business in Spain is under pressure as the pandemic exacerbates intense competition. That means Pallete must move faster to cut a 37 billion-euro mountain of debt by selling underperforming assets and boost returns in Brazil, the U.K. and Germany. Debt is set to fall by 4.6 billion euros once the American Tower deal is complete.One of his biggest moves came last May, when Telefonica and Liberty Global Plc announced the merger of their British wireless and cable businesses in Telefonica’s biggest-ever deal. In December, a consortium formed by Telefonica and two other carriers moved to acquire Brazil’s Oi SA, paving the way for a long-awaited consolidation of the country’s mobile industry.Bringing new partners into Telefonica’s cloud computing, cybersecurity and Internet of Things businesses would help to honor Pallete’s promise to modernize the staid former phone monopoly and develop its tech business to boost returns. Even after January’s 10% share gain, Telefonica’s forward share price-to-earnings ratio -- a measure of its profit growth prospects -- is among the lowest of its big European peers, according to Bloomberg data.Pallete hived off the tech activities into a new division and gave it its own CEO in 2019. The effort is only partially complete. Splitting teams such as sales away from the legacy business is proving a challenge, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Until the tech units are fully autonomous, Pallete can’t invite in new investors, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.Telefonica declined to comment.The company’s shares were down 0.48% to 3.705 euros per share as of 2:04 p.m. Shares are up 14.2% this year.Spanish BattleSince he became chairman in April 2016, the 57-year-old Pallete has relied mostly on using cash flow to cut debt, rather than disposals, and resisted calls to cut the dividend. Leverage has fallen by about 27%.The tower deal fits with Pallete’s plan to find other investors to help shoulder new infrastructure investments and rein in his own spending. Telefonica has even partnered with insurer Allianz SE to set up a wholesale fiber-broadband business in Germany.A durable turnaround for Telefonica can’t happen without improvements in Spain, which contributes almost a third of its revenue.The pandemic has hammered the country’s economy and led the quietly-spoken Pallete, who usually shuns politics, to forge a closer working relationship with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.Pallete has worked closely with the government to help draw up a national digital industry policy paid for out of European Union recovery funds. Spain passed a law during the pandemic allowing the government to block acquisitions of stakes above 10% in any company considered strategic. The law was passed to protect companies, such as Telefonica, whose shares have performed poorly in recent years from hostile takeovers.The Spanish business depends heavily on higher-spending clients. Telefonica has added digital services ranging from home security to health and is even working on plans to sell solar panels and energy. Now it’s getting harder to squeeze more revenue from premium customers, just as the company battles to retain clients on cheaper subscription plans.The mid- to lower end of the Spanish market is fiercely competitive, with one of the highest rates of customer defections in Europe and a host of phone brands fighting for business.“Telefonica is forced to pivot urgently from premium to value in Spain,” Jefferies analysts wrote this month as they cut their rating on the carrier to underperform from hold. “Recession and a six-player market are the driving forces.”(Updates with shares in 11th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/telefonica-m-plan-leaves-ceo-093028044.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-15	2021-01-15 17:03:33	AMT	American Tower Corporation	4 Perfect Stocks to Start Your Retirement Portfolio	Picking retirement stocks is never an easy task. Stocks historically generated long-term gains that are bigger than those of any other asset class. However, picking retirement stocks is easier said than done. You always have a new sector upending the markets. This past year we saw that with electric vehicle stocks. Along with risky SPAC plays, they went hyperbolic. And the momentum doesn’t seem to stop. However, retirees must figure out how to produce enough income without a job. They shouldn’t operate with the same mentality as swing traders, a trading style that attempts to capture short- to medium-term gains. Since 1926, large stocks delivered an average of 10% return per year. And at no point have they lost ground over any period of 20 years or longer during that time. But the key theme here is that you have to go long to maximize your gains. Something that retirees can do, so long as the income stream is stable. It also goes without saying that the best retirement stocks have excellent yields. A good track record of dividend payments is a strong sign of security and is very attractive to income-oriented customers. Most of the retirement stocks we discuss in this list are real estate investment trusts, or REITs. REITs own or finance income-producing real estate across a range of property sectors. The reason for their selection is REITs must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders annually via dividends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon Therefore, without further ado, let’s look at four of the best retirement stocks to start planning for your future: Healthcare Trust of America (NYSE:HTA) Extra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR) American Tower (NYSE:AMT) AT&T (NYSE:T) Retirement Stocks: Healthcare Trust of America (HTA) Source: Shutterstock Healthcare Trust of America is a safe way to play the medical sector. Investors are looking to fill up their portfolio with biotechs and pharmaceuticals in the hopes of striking gold. Whether or not any one of these picks manages to create a vaccine is irrelevant. Unless you diversify your portfolio with a host of names, you could get burned pretty badly. That’s where HTA stock comes in. It’s a REIT that invests in medical office buildings. Medical professionals will continue to use these buildings regardless of whether their work revolves around developing vaccines or not. Let’s face it. Like most advanced developed nations, America is aging. The baby boomer generation has the disposable income to spend on quality medical facilities, which will keep demand up for the 25 million square feet of office space that HTA has at its disposal. Granted, there was a decrease in funds from operations per share in the second quarter of 2020. But things are pretty much back to pre-pandemic levels as of Q3. HTA hiked its dividend, reported normalized FFO of $0.43 per diluted share – a record for HTA – and revenue, NOI, adjusted EBITDA growth across the board. From a dividend perspective, you can’t get any more rock-solid than this one. Due to the steady net operating income growth, the company has consistently increased its dividend, leading to a very healthy yield at the moment of 4.8%. Considering that it’s a REIT, expect money coming into your account on a very regular basis if you buy HTA stock. Just the kind of investment you need when you have your feet up and enjoying traveling the world or remodeling your home. Extra Space Storage (EXR) Source: Shutterstock Our next entry is one of the largest self-storage REITs in the U.S. and is a member of the S&P 500. It has a fairly diversified portfolio. With a dividend yield of 3.2%, it is an excellent pick for long-term growth and stable returns. Despite the novel coronavirus pandemic, EXR managed to increase core FFO/share by 5.6% year-over-year to $1.31 in Q3’20. The business model is recession-resistant, so I am not surprised by the performance. Same-store occupancy is an excellent 95.9%, 210 basis points higher than the year-ago figure. From a financial health perspective, everything looks OK. The self-storage REIT has a solid balance sheet, with a debt-to-EBITDA of 6.07 times. That is par for the course if we are talking REITs. Its interest coverage ratio is a solid 3.7 times, and sales growth is a solid 11.3% for the last five years. Because of the factors discussed, the payout is not in danger. By 2025, the self-storage market’s valuation is expected to grow to $115.62 billion from $87.65 billion in 2019. A compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 134.79% over the forecast period of 2020-2025. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon Ultimately, EXR stock should garner your attention because of its solid balance sheet, strong occupancy and FFO/share growth, and juicy dividend yield. Shares are not the most affordable at the moment, trading at 31 times forward price-to-earnings. However, these are retirement stocks we are talking about. At this price, you are buying into an industry that will only grow, guaranteeing sustained income for several years to come. Retirement Stocks: American Tower (AMT) Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com For the final REIT on our list, we have another solid performer. Only this time, it’s in the broadcast communications space. American Tower is one of the largest providers of wireless communications services. The growing demand for 5G wireless streaming capability is pushing revenue higher for the communications REIT. Even before the pandemic, the world was marching to 5G network technology. But the current crisis has only exacerbated the need for faster uptake. That provides a secular trend that AMT can exploit in the United States and foreign countries. Operations are spread across the U.S., Germany, Ghana, Nigeria, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, South Africa, Uganda, Brazil and Peru. So you get a lot of geographic diversification when you buy EXR stock, always a good thing when you don’t want to hedge your bets. The company recently reported AFFO earnings of $2.29, beating analyst expectations by 22 cents and growing 14.5% year-over-year. Total revenue was up 3% year-over-year and beat Wall Street analysts’ estimates by $40 million. AMT boosted its dividend 34 quarters in a row. The multitenant communications REIT has grown its dividend for the last nine consecutive years and is increasing its dividend by an average of 20.02% each year. American Tower pays 62.61% of its earnings as a dividend, but the yield of 2.3% is not in danger. The solid earnings and revenue growth allow the company to keep investing in the 5G expansion while maintaining healthy distributions. AT&T (T) Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com We finally have a non-REIT here. InvestorPlace readers know that I love T stock for a variety of reasons. The telecommunications giant has a solid business model and is all set to have a blockbuster 2021 due to HBO Max. There were certainly issues that the platform experienced at its launch. But these are resolved. Late last year, AT&T reached an agreement to bring the platform to Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), finally bringing its content to one of the largest streaming services in the world. WarnerMedia announced that its entire movie slate for 2021 will release simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max. The movies will stream on HBO Max for one month before leaving the platform for a period of time. According to AT&T CEO John Stankey, HBO Max, which closed the third quarter at 8.6 million active subscribers in the U.S., scored another 4 million to reach 12.6 million as of early December. Meanwhile, reports are also emerging that the company is in discussions with a group of banks to raise $14 billion to buy more 5G airwaves. The move is essential because control of 5G airwaves will decide which company will emerge as the leader in U.S. telecommunications. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon Now let’s talk about my favorite aspect of the company: its dividend yield of 7.2%. This compares very favorably with the industry yield of 3.5%. Only Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) comes close with a 6.2% yield among its peer group. AT&T increased its dividend distribution for 10 consecutive years. If you are looking for one of the best retirement stocks for your portfolio, look no further.

The deal makes sense for both parties, and as of this writing shares of American Tower are up slightly as well.  On Wednesday Telefonica said its Telxius Telecom unit has agreed to sell towers in Spain, Germany, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina for 7.7 billion euros, or about $9.41 billion in cash.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/12402bef-e586-39d0-8a67-82dbbcdd0847/why-shares-of-telefonica-are.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-01-13	2021-01-13 15:01:01	AMT	American Tower Corporation	American Tower Enters Europe in $9.4 Billion Telefonica Deal	(Bloomberg) -- Telefonica SA’s sale of telecommunication masts to American Tower Corp. opens a new front in the race to control Europe’s fast-growing tower industry.American Tower is paying 7.7 billion euros ($9.4 billion) cash for about 30,700 tower sites in Spain, Germany, Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina held by Telefonica unit Telxius Telecom. This marks the biggest threat yet to Cellnex Telecom SA, Europe’s biggest independent tower operator.American Tower had been evaluating dozens of deals across Europe for years but never found the right fit in terms of assets and prices, Chief Executive Officer Tom Bartlett said on a call with analysts Wednesday. With the Telefonica deal, AMT gets “premier assets” in Germany and Spain that will weave in well with the towers the company already controls in France, Bartlett said.Most of the Telefonica towers have as few as one tenant, and as a neutral host, AMT can take advantage of that by adding other carriers to the array, Bartlett said.“We expect to get an outsized share of the market over the next several years,” the AMT CEO said.The arrival of AMT comes as European carriers prepare a major network upgrade to 5G technology and have sought to sell towers to help finance those costs.Cellnex has snapped up assets across the region without much interference from U.S. rivals, including CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.’s European masts for around 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion) in November. American Tower, along with fellow U.S. operator Crown Castle International Corp., had largely stayed away from Europe, at least until carriers started spinning off tens of thousands of masts to cut debt and pay for costly 5G rollouts.For Telefonica, whose shares jumped as much as 11%, it will help cut a 37 billion-euro debt pile, one of the biggest in the industry.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“The deleveraging need justifies the sale, and the deal should reduce net leverage on an after-lease basis by 0.3x to 2.74x.”\--Erhan Gurses, telecom analystClick here to read the research.U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co. owns 40% of Telxius and Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega owns close to 10% through his investment vehicle. The main pressure point for Cellnex is the foothold American Tower gains in Germany, the one big European market where the Spanish company is still absent.Germany is a “real crown jewel in the marketplace” especially as the region takes a “leadership position” in building out 5G, Bartlett said.American Tower said it would pay for the towers in a way that preserves its investment grade credit rating, and has raised financing from Bank of America Corp.The U.S. company has focused mostly on building towers in Africa, Latin America and India to sustain its international growth. In 2019 it bought Eaton Towers Ltd. for about $1.85 billion including debt to expand in Africa. American Tower and Telefonica already have partnerships in Brazil in optic fiber networks.Telefonica WindfallTelefonica said it expects to book a capital gain of around 3.5 billion euros and cut its net debt by about 4.6 billion euros.Telefonica’s shares were up 9.6% as of 3:40 p.m. in Madrid after rising as much as 11%, the biggest intraday gain since November. Cellnex was up 0.6% after initially falling as much as 2.4%.Phone companies in the region have been reluctant to lose control of the assets, seeing them as strategically important. The deal on Wednesday shows how some are willing to rethink that approach in an effort to reduce costs and raise cash.Vodafone Group Plc, Europe’s biggest wireless carrier, is working on an initial public offering of its tower unit in the first half of the year. Orange SA also plans to create a stand-alone tower operating unit.(Updates with American Tower comments from third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-tower-buys-telefonica-masts-074214813.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-13	2021-01-13 11:17:22	AMT	American Tower Corporation	Telefonica Offloads Europe, LATAM Tower Sites To American Tower In $9.4B Cash Deal	Spanish telecom company Telefonica S.A. (NYSE: TEF) announced Wednesday that it has entered into a tower sale agreement via its subsidiary Telxius Telecom S.A., with broadcast communications infrastructure operator American Tower Corp (NYSE: AMT). The deal is valued at €7.7 billion (roughly $9.38 billion), payable entirely in cash.What Happened: Telefonica has agreed to offload its telecommunication towers in Spain, Germany, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina to American Tower. The companies will enter into two separate transactions, one for the European assets and the other for the Latin American assets, collectively covering 30,722 tower sites.One of the deal's terms is that the Telefonica Group will retain its current leasing agreements with its subsidiary to ensure consistency in services.Why Does It Matter: According to Reuters, Telefonica sold 10,100 phone masts in Germany to Telxium for €1.5 billion. In comparison, Telxius' generated an operating income before depreciation and amortization of €190 million from its tower business in the past 12 months.Completing the sale will cut down Telefonica's net financial debt by roughly €4.6 billion. The financial leverage ratio is expected to dip by 0.3x times and generate a capital gain of approximately €3.5 billion.President of Telefonica, Jose Maria Álvarez-Pallete said that Telxius and American Tower were the company's leading suppliers. After the sale, American Tower will hold the top spot as the leading supplier in the European and Latin American region and play the role of a partner in strategic projects across Argentina, Brazil, and Columbia.Price Action: TEF shares are trading higher by 9.23% in the pre-market session on the last check Wednesday.For news coverage in Italian or Spanish, check out Benzinga Italia and Benzinga España.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * US Lawmakers Seek Information From Telco's To Decide Broadband Stimulus Aid: Washington Post  * Regeneron To Supply US With Another 1.25M COVID-19 Treatment Doses(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-16	2020-09-16 00:00:00	AMT	American Tower Corporation	The Argus Dividend Growth Portfolio	Often overlooked amid the market's gyrations, dividend income is an important element of total return. Consider recent results: in 2015, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 1.4%, including dividends -- but excluding dividends, the market was down 0.7%. Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors. And dividend payments softened the blow in 2018, when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks, particularly in a slow-growth or recessionary economic environment.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ee2cb308-3324-39c8-b0ae-47798c9d8c19/the-argus-dividend-growth.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-25	2020-06-25 15:47:40	AMT	American Tower Corporation	Tech-Exposed Real Estate Is Pulling Away From Other Properties	(Bloomberg) -- The same trends behind soaring stock prices for Amazon.com Inc. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. are benefiting shares in the companies associated with their real estate.Communication towers and data center stocks -- sometimes referred to as “where the internet lives” -- have seen some of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 so far this year as stay-in-place measures to combat the coronavirus have accelerated the demand for digital services and connectivity.Whereas the pandemic has severely hit many commercial property owners, shares in real estate investment trusts related to technology are outperforming. The combined market value gained by just five of those stocks is almost the same as the amount lost by 30 REITs specializing in malls and shopping centers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.“If you’re a real estate investor and your mandate is to own real estate, you’re obviously not doing very well owning offices or owning retail,” Cowen analyst Colby Synesael said in a phone interview.With more people at home, the demands on technology and its infrastructure have been tremendous, whether it’s allowing for online shopping, mobile streaming or working remotely. As a result, certain REITs have emerged as defensive plays for investors, Synesael said.American Tower Corp., Digital Reality Trust Inc., Equinix Inc., Crown Castle International Inc. and SBA Communications Corp. have added roughly $50 billion in total market capitalization this year, and valuations for towers and data centers have never been higher.Data centers, for instance, are trading at a roughly 15% premium to the overall REIT average on a price to estimated adjusted funds from operations basis, according to Berenberg analyst Nate Crossett. Historically they’ve traded at a 7% discount.As a global data center company, Equinix has boasted of its work building out coverage and scale for clients that have gone on to become household names in the work-from-home era including Zoom and Cisco Systems Inc.’s Webex.“Two significant customers of ours is Zoom and Webex -- both of whom obviously saw exceptional increases in their demand as work from home took off,” Chief Executive Officer Charles Meyers said in an interview. “We played a very key role in helping them ramp up their capacity to meet that demand. That was true also in networking cloud providers.”Meyers said it’s difficult to anticipate how much more revenue the company could see over time. In terms of demand, he pointed to recent overall online traffic trends, which surged 25% to 30% over a 30- to 45-day period-- growth that normally would take nine months to a year to achieve.Digital Realty Chief Financial Officer Andy Power said in an interview that the company had seen a pickup in data center demand from clients filling near-term gaps but that longer-term, he was “pleasantly surprised” at how larger enterprises were also taking this moment to plan for the future.“We’re seeing the criticality of our infrastructure playing out front and center while many of our other asset classes [in real estate] are seeing sloping rent,” he said. Even for clients in struggling industries such as travel, the company has seen increased deployments. “Our services are fundamentally mission critical for their businesses. You cannot book an airline ticket or any hotel reservation without the infrastructure we’re essentially providing.”Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lindsay Dutch said the need for increased connectivity during the pandemic has demonstrated the importance of digital infrastructure, which is a long-term driver for the stocks.“If you think of everyone on their computers, trying to connect to their workplace and do all these Zoom calls and stream Netflix -- that creates more traffic and the need for power,” she said.Before the virus, shares in tech-related REITs had already been rising, catching the attention of investors, Cowen’s Synesael said.For communication towers, he noted a sea change in 2018 when Vanguard Group began adding towers to its investment portfolio, prompting more investors to do the same ahead of the U.S. rollout of 5G spectrum.Unlike data centers, tower stocks aren’t seeing a fundamental change in earnings from the pandemic, Synesael said. However, they are still benefiting from trends Covid-19 has accelerated like mobile data use, which Synesael expects to continue.Despite their relative premium, Berenberg’s Crossett said that on an absolute basis “there’s still plenty of room to run” for data center stocks.“To the extent that there’s a pullback, I would be adding to these names,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-exposed-real-estate-pulling-154740149.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-06-23	2020-06-23 23:29:06	AMT	American Tower Corporation	The Coming 5G Boom Is Not Fully Priced in These 3 Stocks	The late, great, Neil Peart wrote, in Tom Sawyer, “He knows changes aren’t permanent, but change is.” His words are an apt description of our modern world, an ever-changing landscape of pending tech. Right now, the shiny new change is 5G.Even the coronavirus couldn’t fully derail the coming build-out of the new 5G networks. It only delayed it. China and Korea are leading the world right now in bringing 5G networks online, with the US expanding its own new systems and Europe lagging behind. In the US, most urban areas have at least partial 5G connectivity online, and the major service providers are working to connect those centers.For investors, the key here will be finding companies that are primed to gain as 5G expands. It’s tempting to invest directly in the service providers; AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile/Sprint, the three largest wireless providers, are all heavily invested in 5G networks. But they face certain headwinds that make them less than ideal as 5G investments – for the present. They are absorbing the costs of the new networks, but without bringing in the new service fees to cover those costs. From a consumer perspective, the new service is more expensive, but hasn’t surpassed existing 4G in convenience – yet.This leaves investors seeking the right place to put their money, to benefit from 5G rollouts. Two segments come to mind, both deeply involved in different ways. The first is semiconductor chips; the second, surprisingly, are real estate investment trusts. These companies, inhabiting such different niches, find themselves well-positioned to profit – for different reasons – as 5G networks expand. Those different reasons are interesting to explore, as we open the TipRanks database to see what makes semiconductors and REITs compelling investments for 5G. Let's take a closer look. Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)First up is a long-running major market player, a large-cap stock and a perennial champion for dividend investors. Broadcom is also one of the world’s largest semiconductor chip makers, ranked the sixth biggest by annual revenue in 2019, and reporting $5.25 billion in earnings in the first quarter of 2020.Broadcom has been making waves in 5G throughout 1H20. In February, the company announced completion of a 5G switching portfolio, designed for high-capacity switches and offering the feature set needed to meet new 5G tech standards. In March, Broadcom was noted by Forbes as one of the leaders in 5G wireless infrastructure; the company is deeply invested in providing chips that power the new devices. And earlier this month, handset maker Nokia, which has been having trouble in recent months sourcing 5G chips in sufficient quantity to meet demand, signed Broadcom on a supplier of 5G chips for Nokia’s ReefShark line.With all of this good news for the company, it’s no wonder that AVGO shares have climbed 85% since hitting bottom on March 18, dramatically outperforming the broader markets. Q2 saw revenue grow to $5.74 billion, up 9% sequentially. And, despite the ongoing pandemic, the company has maintained its generous dividend, declaring $3.25 per share on June 4. The current dividend annualizes to $13 and gives an impressive yield of 4.3%.Writing on AVGO for Deutsche Bank is 5-star analyst Ross Seymore, rated 26 overall in the TipRanks analyst database. Seymore notes the Nokia arrangement, and points out that it plays to Broadcom’s strengths in addressing the 5G needs of OEM customers: “We view [the Nokia] announcement as evidence that the co's investments and engagement with infrastructure OEMs on solutions within the base station which AVGO referenced in December, are bearing fruit. Broadcom's strength in custom ASICs and in routing and switching have enabled the co to leverage its Ethernet technology in bringing the network to the Edge (base stations).”To this end, Seymore rates AVGO a Buy alongside a $360 price target, indicating a potential 16% upside for the stock this year. (To watch Seymore’s track record, click here)All in all, Broadcom has a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, with 24 reviews breaking down to 21 Buys and only 3 Holds. Shares are priced at $311.30, and the average price target of $350.18 suggests an upside potential of 13%. (See AVGO stock analysis on TipRanks)SBA Communications (SBAC)The next stock on our list operates as a REIT, focused on cellular infrastructure sites. Specifically, SBA Communications owns small cells, distributed antenna systems, and traditional cell sites throughout the Americas and South Africa. SBA both leases and develops the properties in its portfolio – a business that perfectly positions the company to profit as telecom carriers and providers increase and densify their networks to accommodate 5G technology. This process naturally requires new cell towers, antenna placements, and small cells – and that is SBA’s core business.Standing as it does at the center of the 5G expansion, SBA is already showing gains. The company’s stock is up 4.6% since February, having fully recovered from the market collapse in February/March and survived several weeks of price volatility that followed. It’s not just share price that has gained despite coronavirus-inspired recessionary pressures. SBA has reported modest sequential gains in quarterly earnings since the beginning of 2019, a trend that continued in Q1 2020. Credit Suisse analyst Sami Badri is confident in this company’s business model and solid balance sheet. He writes, “We believe the evidence points to an initial majority mid-band spectrum buildout. Mid-band spectrum will mainly be utilized on macro towers, given its solid propagation characteristics, therefore the initial 5G wave should favor macro tower focused SBAC… With SBAC capable of raising debt at such modest rates (3.875% May 19th) while maintaining its broader tower asset ROIC of 10%, we are comfortable and constructive with its current leverage profile.”Badri rates SBAC an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $361 price target indicates his belief in a 23% upside potential for the stock. (To watch Badri’s track record, click here)Overall, the analyst consensus rating on SBAC, a Strong Buy is based on a 9-to-1 split between Buy and Hold reviews. The average price target, $328, implies an upside of 12% from the current trading price of $293.78. (See SBAC stock analysis on TipRanks)American Tower (AMT)Last up is American Tower, the Boston-based REIT with a global portfolio containing more than 180,000 cellular broadcast tower and wireless communication sites. The core of the portfolio is in the US, but the company has been expanding internationally, both to supplement the core holdings and to take advantage of the global nature of wireless com systems. AMT currently holds more than 40,000 US cellular sites, along with 75,000 Asia and 37,000 in Latin America.As wireless providers expand their networks to introduce 5G connections, AMT is a logical beneficiary. Due to the shorter range of 5G systems, a denser tower network will be required; AMT, which owns and leases such sites, is ramping up acquisitions to take advantage. AMT derives most of its customer base – on the order of 88% – AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint/T-Mobile. These companies are not going anywhere, and lend a sense of permanence to AMT’s holdings.In addition, due to the long-term nature of cellular leases, AMT features a high proportion of recurring revenue in its portfolio – a feature that has insulated the company from the impact of COVID-19. AMT reported sequential gains in earnings for Q1, the coronavirus quarter, and share prices have shown a net gain during the last few months of market volatility.Analyst Sami Badri covers AMT shares as well, and he writes of the stock: “We expect Massive MIMO antennas to place more weight on towers, while taking up the same amount of physical vertical space or more on the structure. This will result in more revenue from tower leasing activity for AMT, which we expect to appear primarily as amendment revenues.”Badri is bullish on AMT, giving the stock a Buy rating with a $300 price target. His target implies an upside of 13% in the coming 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. AMT’s rating is based on 14 reviews, including 12 Buys and just 2 Holds. Shares are selling for $265.60, and the $269.42 suggests a modest upside this year.

For investors, this means it's time to think about 5G stocks.5G will not only be faster, but it will provide more bandwidth.

This is going to mean that wireless connections will be as fast, and in some places faster, than the available wireline services.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt will mean technologies like smart cars and everything provided through cloud services will be accessed in near real time, wherever you are. It will also change providers' ability to share content like movies, games or teleconferences. Along the way, the companies facilitating all of this could see enormous upside in their share prices.  * 7 Red-Hot Vaccine Stocks Racing to Develop a Coronavirus Cure And the seven 5G stocks looking to the future that I feature below are laying the tracks for the next telecom expansion across the U.S. and the world.  * Ciena (NYSE:CIEN)  * Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)  * Lumentum (NASDAQ:LITE)  * American Tower REIT (NYSE:AMT)  * Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI)  * Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)  * Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) 5G Stocks to Buy: Ciena (CIEN)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com This optical networking firm has been around since 1992. It's been around so long, it's headquartered in quiet Hanover, Maryland, since Silicon Valley was just glimmer in geeks' eyes back then.It was way ahead of its time. It specializes in optical networking equipment. The thing was, back then, fiber optic cable was as scarce as hen's teeth. It was a play on the future of the internet.Before the tech bubble burst, CIEN stock traded as high as $847 a share. But those were the days when brokers were telling clients that growth was the new income and a growth stock wasn't respectable if it didn't have a triple-digit price-earnings ratio.But CIEN made it through, which is testament to its management and its technology. Now, 20 years later, it is one of the leading companies in the vibrant and expanding optical networking space.The stock is up 56% in the past 12 months and 28% year to date. Yet, it still only trades at a P/E of 30. Intel (INTC)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The computer you're using to read this likely has an Intel chip or two inside it. It's the largest semiconductor company in the world and invented the x86 chip that sits in almost every personal computer.  And next month it will celebrate its 51st birthday.Intel has had its struggles remaining at the top of the chip heap. Management didn't get in the mobility sector until it was too late, and missed a huge opportunity in the smartphone world. But it is well-positioned in the internet of things (IOT), and has found opportunities in markets like 5G, AI, memory and networking as well.The competition is tough. CEO Bob Swan is an industry veteran but not a career Intel guy, and he took over in January 2019. Much of his leadership career was operating as a CFO for various large tech firms, so it will be interesting to see if he can keep INTC moving in the right directions.  * 7 Cheap Stocks to Buy With Great Potential So far, so good. The stock is up 42% in the past year and 3% year to date. It also delivers a solid 2.1% dividend. And besides INTC itself, the 5G upgrade offers investors the chance to buy potentially the &quot;next Intel&quot; today. Lumentum (LITE)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com This company is also in the optical networking sector, but it launched just five years ago. And instead of focusing on the optical switching aspects, LITE focuses on the distribution and transmission of fiber optic networks.It also makes a variety of lasers for numerous applications. The lasers are used to build equipment in industries as varied as the automotive sector to mobile phones and semiconductors. And they are used for 3D sensing equipment.Just as cloud computing ultimately needs real hardware to operate, mobile networks need the fastest data transmission possible. And for now, that's fiber optic cables.That means that the greater the global demand for 5G, the more business LITE stands to gain. Also, the more we rely on advanced technologies, the more demand there will be to build more advance devices.The stock is up 72% in the past year and is off 9% year to date. American Tower REIT (AMT)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com As you well know, mobile signals need mobile transmission towers. AMT is one of the top tower companies in the world, and it's one of the top 5G stocks to buy.It has operations across North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia. Since towers are property, AMT became a real estate investment trust (REIT), which has tax advantages for the company and the shareholders. All REITs consider shareholders direct owners and distribute net income via a dividend.5G is going to need towers because its antenna are different than previous generations of telecom services. Given the fact that AMT already has more than 180,000 towers around the world, and a solid history as a reliable partner, it's well positioned for the 5G wave.It continues to acquire smaller broadcast companies around the globe, including India and Africa, where mobile telecom is much denser than traditional wireline services.  * 25 Stocks to Buy for the Reopening Rally The stock is up 27% in the past year and 12% year to date. It also provides a 1.7% dividend. It's among my top stocks for the worldwide 5G upgrade taking hold now. Crown Castle International (CCI)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com This is another tower company, but it has two difference from AMT. First, it focuses its operations on the U.S., where it has over 40,000 towers.Second, it also has a significant small cells business for denser spots like office buildings and stadiums, as well as more than 80,000 miles of fiber optic cable. These are key sectors for 5G stocks because 5G has unique challenges in cities, and venues like stadiums will have growing challenges as events become carried on live streams and guests will be sharing across social media.CCI is also a REIT and is delivering an impressive 3% dividend currently. The stock is up 34% in the past 12 months, and 19% year to date.Owning both AMT and CCI stock captures a significant amount of the potential 5G transmission sector, but both stocks are trading at premiums currently. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com This telecom chipmaker has been around since 1985 and has been a major player in the mobility revolution. Its origins were building out CDMA telecom technology for commercial trucking operations. When mobile phones came out, one of the leading channels used for phones in the U.S. became CDMA.Now, CDMA and GSM run all the phones around the world and most chips can switch from one channel to the other if necessary.QCOM makes more money on licensing its patents than it does on actually shipping chips. That means it doesn't have to build massively expensive chip plants, and focuses on design rather than production.However, Qualcomm has run into antitrust issues. A few years ago it had to pay out massive fines to China and other countries that sued it because of its monopolistic hold on mobile phone infrastructure.But those days are behind it, and it is certainly going to be a major player as 5G starts to roll out globally.The stock is up 20% in the past year and off almost 12% year to date. It has an impressive 3.2% dividend and is trading at a reasonable P/E of 23. Texas Instruments (TXN)Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com Many people remember TXN as the company that built the coolest calculators around. And the fact is, it continues to make the default calculators for most high school students.But Texas Instruments, which has been around since 1930, is also one of the biggest chipmakers in the world. Nearly 80% of its revenue comes from analog chips and embedded processors. Analog chips convert analog inputs -- like voice -- into digital form for processing. And embedded processors are dedicated systems that provide a function within a larger piece of equipment or system. Think a sound system inside a car.These aren't sexy, but they are everywhere. And TXN can produce high-quality, reliable chips and processors in huge quantities. With everything going digital, that means TXN is in a growth business and is already producing at scale, and making money doing it.Not every aspect of our digital lives has to be built from cutting-edge designs; keeping some things simple makes high-performance equipment easier to maintain and more reliable. And TXN is certainly keeping up with the biggest trends, including 5G, but it is a significant supporting player, not a headliner.The stock is up nearly 14% in the past 12 months, and off 10% year to date. It also offers a durable and generous 3% dividend.Texas Instruments and other hardware makers I've mentioned here today are great examples of 5G stocks that stand to benefit from the 5G revolution.And I see even better potential with the companies that are making this massive infrastructure upgrade possible in the first place! The 5G Buildout Is an Incredible Opportunity for Investors Right NowWithin two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. With 5G, we'll have cable modem speeds on any device; no need to plug in. That's a big deal for rural areas … the very same areas that are also key to President Donald Trump's reelection. So, by pushing 5G over the goal line, Trump will deliver a big win for his base -- and strike a blow against Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies.But, in the big picture, 5G is about much more than trade wars and faster downloads. Because 5G is 100 times faster than 4G, it'll allow your internet devices to work in real time. That advancement is a game changer for tech companies.With the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity with 5G stocks now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics … but they can't compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it's got ultra-fast 5G. That's how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I'm targeting is enjoying an influx of big money on Wall Street, and it has strong fundamentals, too -- making it an A-rated &quot;Strong Buy&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system.Click here to watch my new, free briefing on this extraordinary technology and the opportunity with 5G stocks.When you do, you'll see how to claim a free copy of my investment report, The King of 5G &quot;Turbo Button&quot; Technology, which has full details on this company -- and what makes it such a great buy now.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett. In his latest feat, Louis discovered the &quot;Master Key&quot; to profiting from the biggest tech revolution of this (or any) generation.

2020-01-15	2020-01-15 14:02:03	AMT	American Tower Corporation	Goldman Sachs: 3 5G Stocks to Snap Up Now	In a set of interesting reports, Goldman Sachs telecom expert Brett Feldman turns his eye on the American wireless market – and its growing rollover to 5G technology. Feldman notes five reasons why 5G will drive a period of sustained growth for companies with an ‘in.’ While the analyst focuses on tower-leasing REITs, his basic point applies to most companies with a strong connection to the 5G switchover: wireless providers, device makers, chip makers.A look at three of Feldman’s points outlines what we can expect in the next couple of years, as 5G networks expand across the country. First, he notes the obvious – that 2020 will see an expansion of 5G coverage by the Big 4 mobile providers. Second, Apple will launch a 5G capable iPhone this year, which should help drive adoption of the new technology for the next several years. Third, as more users switch to 5G devices, data usage will increase, driving increased cell site density – it will be a virtuous circle.Feldman’s final two points touch on what he sees as the bottom line for investors interested in 5G stocks: that cell tower owners and operators are the best stock position to take as the switch begins and expands. For his fourth point, he notes that auctions this year and next will open up the mid-band spectrum, and drive tower new tower leases. And finally, in point five, Feldman sees the deployment of new antennas and consequent increase of mid-band spectrum use, driving the expansion of towers and the increase in tower loading and usage going forward.The move to 5G has potential to turn wireless markets upside down. The Big 4 have all initiated coverage in the new network, but so far only T-Mobile has launched it nation-wide. AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon are initiating 5G coverage on the high-band spectrum in limited, dense, urban markets. And a group of REITs that specialize in tower properties are positioned to gain, no matter how the chips fall out for the wireless providers.In this article, we’ll look at three Goldman Sachs 5G stock recommendations. All three score high on TipRanks’ Smart Score system – rating a 9 or 10. The Smart Score brings together collects and collates data on more than 6,500 stocks, information drawn from across the TipRanks database, and distills it down to a single number. A 9 or 10 rating indicates that the stock is likely to outperform the broader markets in the coming months.SBA Communications Corporation (SBAC)First up is SBA Communications, a real estate investment trust. REITs are companies that buy, own, and operate various residential and commercial properties, making their profits on through rents and management fees. Cell tower properties are a common commercial investment for REITs, and as pointed out above, this combination is Brett Feldman’s favorite 5G investment. SBA is exactly that type of REIT; it owns and operates wireless infrastructure, including small cells, distributed antenna systems, and traditional cell sites.The popularity of wireless systems, the necessity of the tech infrastructure to modern life, and the switch to 5G have all put SBA on an upward trajectory. The shares gained 50% in 2019. The company has consistently beaten the expectations in the quarterly earnings reports.The numbers show that, as far as they can. In Q3 2019, the most recent reported, SBAC showed funds from operations (FFO – the REIT equivalent to earnings per share) of $2.15, opposed to the expected $2.08 and up 12% from the year-ago value. Revenues were equally strong. At $507.55 million, revenues were 2% higher than forecast, and up 8.6% year-over-year.This strong stock performance got Feldman’s full attention. He upgraded SBAC to a Buy rating, writing, “We expect acceleration in domestic organic leasing growth as carriers expand their 5G coverage and begin to overlay mid-band spectrum, and as SBAC sees a material decline in M&A driven churn. We estimate that over the next five years, SBAC can repurchase $7.1bn of stock and return $1.3bn in dividends to shareholders, while maintaining leverage at 7.0x net debt/EBITDA.”Feldman put a $280 price target on SBAC, indicating room for 12% growth in the next 12 months.SBA gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 2 Buys and 1 Hold. The relatively small number of reviews reflects the ‘under the radar’ profile of most REITs in the markets; these stocks, while frequently strong on fundamentals, tend to get passed over in favor of bigger, flashier companies. Shares in SBAC sell for $248, and the $261.33 average price target suggests a modest 5% upside potential. (See SBA stock analysis at TipRanks)American Tower Corporation (AMT)The second stock on our list takes the tower-oriented REIT model a step up in size. American Tower is another owner/operator of wireless infrastructure – but this company has a $103 billion market cap and a global investment footprint. AMT owns over 170,000 telecom infrastructure sites. The company’s portfolio includes over 75,000 sites in Asia, 40,000 in the US, and 37,000 in Latin America. Another 16,000 sites in Europe, Africa, and the Mid-East round out AMT’s holdings.The full-year 2019 numbers are not available yet, but the value of the tower-oriented REIT is shown by AMT’s $7.44 billion in 2018 revenues. The most recent quarterly on record is from Q3, and shows a $2 FFO, 2% over expectation, and revenues of $1.95 billion, a 5% forecast beat. Both FFO and revenues were up significantly year-over-year. In reaction, AMT showed a 49% share appreciation last year.Feldman writes of AMT, “We believe that AMT should trade at a signiﬁcant premium to the median of high-quality REITs… We have also increased the terminal growth rate … to reﬂect our view that the 5G cycle is likely to support leasing activity well beyond our 5-year forecasting period.”In line with his upbeat outlook on the company, Feldman gave AMT shares his second upgrade – to a Buy rating. His $270 price target implies an upside potential of 15%.Like SBAC, American Tower has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. This is based on 6 reviews, including 4 Buys and 2 Holds. The $243.83 average price target suggests an upside of 4% from the $233 current trading price. (See American Tower’s stock analysis at TipRanks)Verizon Communications (VZ)With Verizon, the third stock on our list, we shift gears from wireless infrastructure to a major wireless provider. Verizon is the second largest US wireless services company, by subscriber count, with over 118 million customers as of September 2019. The company’s $130 billion in 2018 revenue shows the both the size and income potential of the mobile market in the US.Verizon hasn’t seen the magnitude of gains that the tower REITs have, but the growth in wireless has given a boost to the company’s top and bottom lines. Revenues in Q3 last year were $32.9 billion, a half percent above the forecast, and the $1.25 EPS was 1% above the estimates. In a key metric – net retail additions – the 601,000 reported was up more than double year-over-year.Solid quarterly results and a firm position in a growth market attracted Feldman to Verizon. In his comments on Verizon, he writes, “How much could 5G boost postpaid ARPU/ARPA? Our analysis of Verizon’s unlimited pricing implies that its consumer accounts with unlimited plans generate monthly ARPA (average revenue per account) that is 11-48% higher than its reported consumer ARPA of $113.39 in 3Q19… [We see] signiﬁcant revenue growth opportunity for Verizon if the 5G upgrade cycle does indeed stimulate more customers to upgrade to unlimited plans, or to migrate to higher unlimited tiers.”Feldman reiterates his Buy rating on this stock, and raised his price target by 3% to $67. His new price target implies an upside for the stock of 7.6% in the coming 12 months. (To watch Feldman’s track record, click here)Like the two stocks above, Verizon holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating. In the case of VZ, this rating is based on 4 Buy and 6 Holds given in the past 3 months. Shares are selling for $59.04, and the average price target of $63.56 suggests an upside of ~8%.

A two-and-a-half session sell-off has been followed by a rally of equal length. While broad market indices remain modestly off their highs, it does seem like stability, at least, has returned heading into 2020.Source: Shutterstock In that context, the question at the moment is whether there's enough time, and enough optimism, for one more leg higher before year-end. And that question is of particular importance when looking at Friday's big stock charts.  * 7 Hot Stocks for 2020's Big Trends All three stocks have missed out on at least part of this year's rally. And all three big stock charts show at least the potential for a breakout in the near-term. It will take some outside help, however -- with stronger broad market sentiment the simplest source at the moment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Advance Auto Parts (AAP)Source: Provided by Finviz So far, 2019 has not been kind to Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP). AAP stock actually has declined a bit over 3% this year, making it one of just 81 stocks in the S&P 500 in the red for 2019. The first of Friday's big stock charts suggests the news could get worse -- but there's hope for a reversal:  * The exit from an ascending triangle pattern last week generally is a bearish move, and indeed AAP stock saw a small gap down on Tuesday. It seems likely that $154, which formerly acted as support, is reversing to resistance. That, too, suggests a negative outlook.  * That said, AAP has found its footing in the past two sessions, with modest declines on heavy buying. There are buyers willing to step in at the moment. And if AAP can find a way to grind higher, there is some reason for bullishness. $154 could again act as support. Moving averages will come in.  *   Click to Enlarge Source: Provided by Finviz From a broad perspective, this simply is a stock still looking for direction. That's true looking at 2019 trading and going back to early 2016. With some bullishness toward the sector and/or broad markets, the stock's direction could reverse.  * The concerns might be both valuation and the lack of a catalyst. AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) reports earnings next week, and good news could read across to both AAP stock and rival O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY). But AZO stock has a similar valuation to AAP, and Advance Auto Parts earnings last month disappointed. Good news from AutoZone might lead investors to buy AZO moreso than AAP. So while there's potential for an upside reversion in Advance Auto Parts stock, this may be a 2020 story without a significant year-end market-wide rally. iQiyi (IQ)Source: Provided by Finviz The setup is there for Chinese streaming video play iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ). If IQ stock can rally, the second of our big stock charts shows a path toward a breakout:  * There's clear resistance from a near-term standpoint. IQ stock twice has stalled out at $20 in recent months. The broader trend is still modestly negative. And the 200-day moving average sits right at current levels. But if IQ stock can move above $20, the trend will look positive. The stock would make a bullish exit from a narrowing wedge. It would have cleared all three moving averages, and broken out the downtrend that has held since May.  * All that said, a reversal is possible as well, given the multiple trendlines creating resistance. A reversal likely would move the stock back toward support around $17.  * As I wrote this week, the swing factor might be the broader market. As I noted in October, IQ stock has somewhat missed out in the rally in Chinese stocks due to a reticence by U.S. investors to pay up for unprofitable companies. Shares still have lagged the likes of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), both of which have reached 52-week highs in recent weeks. Investors are willing to take on China risk. If they're back to taking on growth stock risk as well, a breakout looms for iQiyi stock. Crown Castle International (CCI)Source: Provided by Finviz Celullar tower real estate investment trust Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) has struggled since reaching an all-time high in September. But CCI stock has righted itself over the last month, and the last of Friday's big stock charts shows hope for a rebound:  * CCI stock is in the middle of a downtrend at the moment -- but it's also in the middle of a narrowing wedge. A move through the 50-day moving average would challenge a key pivot point at $138, and set shares up for a bullish exit. The trend certainly isn't confirmed yet, but a continued near-term rally could set up a breakout that would re-test September highs.  * Meanwhile, valuation is reasonable. The stock trades at 22.7x the midpoint of 2019 guidance for adjusted funds for operations per share. Looking to 2020, the multiple drops closer to 21x. A 3.56% dividend yield adds to the case, particularly in a low interest rate environment and with the payout hiked 7% in October.  *   Click to Enlarge Source: Provided by Finviz It may be the sector, and 5G stocks more broadly, that define the near-term direction of CCI stock. Perhaps surprisingly, 5G plays have struggled of late. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has reversed since earnings. Nokia (NYSE:NOK) plunged after its Q3 report. And rival American Tower (NYSE:AMT) has a similar chart (and perhaps stronger hopes for a breakout from a descending triangle), though a higher valuation and lower yield. If bullishness toward 5G returns, the chart sets CCI up to be a prime beneficiary.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-12-02	2019-12-02 17:09:51	AMT	American Tower Corporation	The 13 Best REITs to Own in 2019	Real estate investment trusts (REITs) - a way for investors to gain access to assets such as apartments and office buildings while often collecting generous yields - had a disappointing 2018. With just a few days left to go in the year, the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) had lost 13.5% compared to a 12% decline for the broader market. This contrasts with 10-year average annual gains of just more than 12% for the VNQ.Will REITs bounce back in 2019? Well, the same fear that hampered these real-estate plays in 2018 - rising interest rates - still is on the board for the coming year. And higher rates on bonds sometimes hamper the performance of REITs.However, these companies are not created equal. The best REITs for 2019 could benefit from other powerful trends in 2019. For instance, cloud computing's growth should continue to fuel robust demand for data storage services. A massive infrastructure spending bill could improve the fortunes of related REIT plays. And mobile-data growth, as well as the rollout of lightning-fast 5G technology, offers potential growth for cell-tower REITs.Here are the 13 best REITs to buy and hold in 2019. Not only should they benefit from broad trends that could help them outperform their brethren, but REITs as a whole are trading at much more palatable valuations lately. Moreover, average dividend yields in the space currently exceed 4%; all the more reason for investors to stick with REITs if market rockiness continues in the coming year.

There's a huge industry in connecting these clouds to each other, and to large and small customers alike. It requires cell towers, data centers and other communications technology.A number of real estate investment trusts (REITs) specialize in properties and other assets that ensure your tablet can stream Netflix (NFLX) content and that your company's data is secured in the cloud. As a reminder: REITs are a special type of business structure - one that requires at least 90% of taxable income be paid out to shareholders as dividends, in exchange for generous tax benefits.Many of these stocks have risen by leaps and bounds in 2019, though they're getting expensive as a result. Still, they sit smack-dab in the middle of a growth industry, and some of them remain valuable as takeover targets. Private equity firms EQT Partners and Digital Colony Partners bought fiber network owner Zayo Group for $8 billion in May. And in October, Digital Realty Trust (DLR) bought European data center giant Interxion (INXN) for $8.4 billion.Here are five REITs that can help you squeeze dividends out of the cloud. If you're looking for a broad-based play on the industry, the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF (SRVR) invests in 20 such companies. However, these five holdings stand out among the rest. SEE ALSO: 20 Dividend Stocks to Fund 20 Years of Retirement	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-reits-cloud-pay-dividends-181629350.html?.tsrc=rss

If you don't know what that is yet, it's the next generation of wireless protocols. And if it hasn't already, it's going to change your life … dramatically. Think about the difference between the world before the internet and after. Or the difference between America now and before we had electricity. Or even the difference between what life was like before the steam engine and today.Source: Shutterstock Some analysts have referred to the recent arrival of 5G as the &quot;next industrial revolution.&quot; In fact, it'll eventually change everything from how we do business to how we drive our cars to how we engage with our families in our own homes. Most importantly, however, 5G will change the way we live in cities and towns. That's because with its arrival comes the arrival of &quot;smart cities.&quot;Smart cities are cities that update themselves in real time. Think of traffic lights that predict how many cars are coming and regulate themselves accordingly. Or streetlights that know if people are on the sidewalk and can turn on and off as needed. Smart cities might even be able to do something about finding parking spaces for everybody!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRegardless of the sci-fi dreams 5G and smart cities can bring, it's all coming soon. And today, I want to reveal to you three companies to take a second look at no matter what their earnings forecasts might be. Because with the future on the horizon, all three of these companies stand to profit in a big way … Best 5G Stocks to BuySkyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ:SWKS): After the big semiconductor boom of 2014, Skyworks Solutions' stock quickly trailed off. But this past year alone, SWKS has regained more than 32% of its share price already. That puts it back on track to reach its March 2018 highs once again, and smart investors could be looking to capitalize on that jump.Now, even though some institutional investors are stepping away from the company these days, the next generation of SWKS's transmitters are crucial for delivering 5G capabilities to tomorrow's smart cities. That means Skyworks Solutions is poised for big profits as 5G takes over the rest of the U.S. next year.Plus, with SWKS not expected to report the past quarter's earnings until Nov. 14, right now could be the perfect time to capitalize on this stock's potential … before the market prices in what this year's 5G build-up might have brought with it.American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT): Unlike with SWKS, hedge fund investors appear bullish on American Tower stock. And that's good news for individual investors because there are signs insiders are selling shares these days. But that's not necessarily anything to fear.AMT is expected to announce earnings on Oct. 31. And the share price is already up about 41% year-to-date. But even with dips in recent days, investors are still sitting on a 2.5% earnings surprise from last quarter … not to mention the role American Tower plays in today's 5G conversion.The company is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that owns approximately 171,000 communications real estate sites. As cities get smart, AMT is one organization everybody should be looking at to lead the way.Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ): The real key to smart cities, however, are the networks that 5G signals will be traveling over. That's where Verizon Communications comes in.Verizon has one of the largest cellular networks in the United States. And it's currently rolling out 5G to municipalities. Included in Verizon's smart cities already are stoplight and other streetlight sensors from Boston to San Diego. And those cities and devices are only going to grow in the years to come. 5G and Smart Cities: A $53 Trillion OpportunityAll in all, yesterday's science fiction is today's reality. Smart cities are coming. In some places, they're already here. And the keys to it all are the world's 5G networks.Whether you're interested in semiconductor stocks, cellular tower companies or network providers, we've looked at three possible opportunities today.But the companies we've discussed here are only the tip of the iceberg. 5G has the potential to bring everyday investors like you and me tremendous profits.

Helios is looking to add three new African countries to the five where it currently operates, Pandya said by phone after the initial public offering.Shareholders including Millicom International Cellular SA and Bharti Airtel Ltd. sold down their stakes in the London IPO, with Helios settling for a market valuation of 1.2 billion pounds.Helios has more than 6,800 towers spread across five African countries and the money raised from selling new shares will help it to roll out fourth-generation mobile services and keep pace with soaring mobile data consumption on the continent. It was originally looking to raise as much as $500 million.Read more: Helios CEO says IPO proceeds to be used for expansionHelios went public as many similar offerings are stumbling or being pulled. Two tech IPOs were delayed last week, citing market conditions, and yacht maker Ferretti SpA late on Monday reduced the price range for its upcoming sale.Not everyone is getting shy: special-effects company DNEG Ltd. is exploring selling shares in London to raise 150 million pounds to fund growth, it said Tuesday.Choppy MarketsAfrican and Middle Eastern companies have helped to keep the London IPO market alive, although with mixed results. Airtel Africa Ltd. has lost a third of its value since listing in June.Helios already had to cancel an IPO attempt last year. It was one of three African tower firms that tried to sell stock in London or New York. The most optimistic estimates gave them a potential combined value of $15 billion before choppy markets scuppered the plans and Helios’s two peers went down other routes.The biggest, IHS Towers, decided to raise $1.3 billion via the debt market in two offerings that will close next week. The other, Eaton Towers Ltd., is being bought by American Tower Corp.Following the IPO, Millicom holds a 17% stake in Helios, according to the prospectus. Quantum Strategic Partners Ltd is right behind with a 16.45% stake. Quantum’s investment in Helios is managed by Newlight Partners LP, which was spun off from George Soros’s family office in 2018. The firm is led by Ravi Yadav and David Wassong, who has a seat on Helios’ board.Helios serves carriers including Airtel Africa, MTN Group Ltd. and Vodacom Group Ltd. It’s the only independent tower operator in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania, has operations in Ghana and launched in South Africa this year.(Updates with trading close and CEO interview.)To contact the reporters on this story: Swetha Gopinath in London at sgopinath12@bloomberg.net;Loni Prinsloo in Johannesburg at lprinsloo3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rebecca Penty at rpenty@bloomberg.net, Thomas Pfeiffer, Kasper ViitaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/african-tower-operator-helios-raises-064115257.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-29	2019-08-29 06:00:00	AMT	American Tower Corporation	U.S. Firms Steer Clear of Europe's Big Mobile Tower Sell-Off	(Bloomberg) -- European phone companies are selling their mobile masts and growth-hungry U.S. tower companies have money to spend -- it looks like a marriage made in heaven.Instead, firms like American Tower Corp. and Crown Castle International Corp. are largely staying away, making it easier for Spain’s Cellnex Telecom SA and infrastructure funds managed by Macquarie Group Ltd., KKR & Co. and others to sweep up the region’s tower assets.Their hesitation is driven partly by price: the global hunt for yield has driven up the premium for these assets, which offer reliable, steady income streams. Independent tower companies also won’t pay top dollar unless they see a path to significant revenue growth -- and that’s where they have a problem with Europe.“The American tower companies say, ‘OK, Europe is fine at the right price, but prices are not where we need them to be, so we think the opportunities elsewhere are more attractive,”’ said Nick Del Deo, senior analyst at U.S. research firm MoffettNathanson.Tens of thousands of European masts are expected to see ownership changes in the next two years as companies such as Iliad SA, Vodafone Group Plc and Telecom Italia SpA bring in new investors to reduce debt and share the heavy cost of rolling out 5G technology.But only a quarter are likely to end up with independent operators, according to TowerXchange. Vodafone and CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. are creating separate units for almost 90,000 towers and the consultancy expects them to maintain control over those businesses. That’s a turn-off for independent companies, which try to maximize revenue by leasing mast space to as many network operators as possible.Many European carriers want to keep some hold on their towers because they see mobile infrastructure as a strategic asset that can help them manage costs and perhaps gain a competitive edge. They’re also mindful of what happened in the U.S., where operators rushed to sell their towers more than a decade ago only to find themselves stuck with a big bill for leases and capacity rights.Vodafone Surges on Possible IPO, Stake Sale of Towers UnitVodafone and Telefonica Ink 5G Terms in Move to U.K. Tower SalesNiel Agrees to $3 Billion of Phone Tower Sales to CellnexCK Hutchison to Separate Out European Phone Towers BusinessSelling full ownership of towers to independent players can spur innovation and reduce expenses by encouraging carriers to share infrastructure, avoiding costly duplication. European carriers’ insistence on maintaining control means the continent’s progress in rolling out 5G will likely continue to be slower compared to the U.S., where towers are largely in independent hands.“There is a risk that the European carriers go too far the other way,” Del Deo said. “The captive tower model, if you look globally, has never proven to be that effective.”For now, American Tower is mostly relying on building towers in Africa, Latin America and India for its international growth.Crown Castle didn’t respond to a request for comment on its future European asset bidding plans. American Tower declined to comment. Its chief executive officer, James Taiclet, told analysts last month that recent large European tower sales didn’t meet its bar for growth prospects and asset costs.Here are some other reasons why U.S. tower firms aren’t piling into Europe:Redundancy: Europe has more cases of towers operated by rival carriers sitting in close proximity. An independent owner may want to remove one to cut costs, but the tower often comes with a ground lease that they must keep paying for years.Less Potential: Europe has lots of rooftop antenna sites, which can’t accommodate as many customers as can a ground-based tower. Many European portfolios include broadcast towers in rural areas that may not be as valuable as mobile towers.Radio Emission Rules: In some countries, rules on maximum electromagnetic radio emissions limit the number of antennas a tower firm can install at a single site.&#92;--With assistance from Scott Moritz.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Pfeiffer in London at tpfeiffer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net, Jennifer Ryan, Anthony PalazzoFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-firms-steer-clear-europes-060000509.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-27	2019-08-27 20:49:06	AMT	American Tower Corporation	Are 5G Stocks Worth the Hype? This Chart Says It All	Every once in a while, a stock chart just reaches out and grabs you. The trend is so strong that it compels you to pay attention. I recently had one of those moments with 5G stocks, so I wanted to share it now.This particular chart highlights a trend that debunks one of the biggest myths I'm hearing right now - the one that says, &quot;the market is doomed, everyone's selling off, and if you haven't yet, then you should, too.&quot;If that were true, why are these &quot;random&quot; stocks going absolutely wild compared to the broader market?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs you can see in the one-year chart below, they're racking up 30%, even 50% gains… during a time period when the S&P 500 (the orange line at the bottom) is flat.I call them &quot;random&quot; stocks because Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) and American Tower Corp. (NYSE:AMT) are likely not top-of-mind for many investors. They're not the kind of stocks that folks like me usually get called to discuss on TV. (But with performance like that, they should.)But these are NOT &quot;random&quot; stocks. In fact, they'll be crucial in implementing 5G wireless, one of the biggest revolutionary technologies that's just taking off now and is set to explode into the 2020s.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow Crown Castle and American Tower are real estate investment trusts (REITs) specializing in telecom services. In other words, they often play landlord to companies like Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Sprint (NYSE:S). At this point, that's basically the whole industry. And these telecom REITs help provide cell towers, plus newer technology called &quot;small cells,&quot; as well as the fiber-optic cables that run out to customers.Are cell towers a growth industry? Absolutely. And that's because people's usage of mobile data is skyrocketing. In 2018, the average smartphone in North America used 7 gigabytes per month. In 2024, that'll be more like 40 gigabytes per month, according to a June report from Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC).That's nearly 6X growth in just six years.Crown Castle CEO Jay Brown cited that stat when giving his 2019 guidance on new-leasing activity. In the July earnings report, Brown announced that his company expects a 30% increase in tower leasing, year-over-year.But this is a much bigger story than Crown Castle, American Tower, or any other individual 5G stocks.At Investment Opportunities, I've really been digging into the 5G mega-trend -- and you can bet I'll continue to do so. The closer I look, the more opportunities I find… some that you might never expect.Keep in mind that when we talk about 5G, we're talking about speed. Taking devices that don't look much different than the ones we use now… and transforming them into something exponentially faster and more powerful.With 5G, you will be able to download a movie in six seconds. Today it takes seven minutes with the current 4G technology.Now, here in the United States -- in tech strongholds like San Francisco and wealthy suburbs like Montgomery County, Maryland -- homeowners aren't too thrilled when Crown Castle or Verizon come to their neighborhood to put up a cell tower. (Or add to an existing one, like with the 5G buildout.)I get it, but these folks aren't seeing the big picture. They just see a big gray box. Ultimately, though, 5G is coming -- and it'll take us to the next level of wireless communications. Not just for consumer products, like our iPhones, but for industrial applications, advanced medicine, and even transportation. If we're talking about self-driving cars, we're talking about a lot of data that needs relayed back and forth in an instant.The speeds 5G provides will be the catalyst for just about every other game-changing technology that's coming down the pike. And the more people realize that, the more they'll start to notice stock charts like the one above.This is what I'm talking about when I say: The market is full of buying opportunities right now. Yes, right now.P.S. What are some of these game-changing technologies I'm looking at?Besides self-driving cars, there are electric cars in general (which are being adopted at a phenomenal rate)…There are tons of other connected devices -- a whole Internet of Things…There are smart medical devices, leading to precision healthcare…And artificial intelligence…No wonder data usage is taking off into the stratosphere.And guess what? All those devices need to be powered.Unfortunately, the current technology has some pretty severe limitations. But new technology is emerging to replace it -- one that's safer AND more powerful.Click here to learn more and prepare to ride this trend higher in your portfolio.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2019-08-22	2019-08-22 14:41:24	AMT	American Tower Corporation	Jeff Clark’s Market Minute: World War 5G	Mike's Note: For the past week, we've featured Jeff Brown's insights on the 5G wireless network rollout. Thanks to his direct connection to Silicon Valley's inner circle, and his decades of experience in the technology sector, Jeff's able to uncover big tech news before it hits the mainstream media.Source: Shutterstock Earlier, he showed us why this tech isn't just an investment megatrend, but a &quot;winner-take-all economic struggle.&quot;Read on below as Jeff continues to dive into why deploying this technology is a must-win race for the U.S… and a smart move for our national security…InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBy Jeff Brown, Editor, Exponential Tech InvestorIn the summer of 2018, Boston-based cybersecurity firm Cybereason discovered something troubling…  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More The company exposed a massive international espionage campaign that had hacked into at least 10 major wireless carriers.The hackers wanted to track around 20 high-profile political and military figures - including monitoring their phone calls, texts, and physical locations. It's something right out of a spy movie.This campaign (called Operation Soft Cell) had been going on for years. And based on the data, it appeared to be a nation-state attack - by China.Now, Cybereason didn't release the identities of the targets. It's too dangerous. And while we don't know for sure, prominent Western targets are a safe bet.But all this info was revealed to key U.S. government officials around the same time they started banning 5G tech and networking equipment from China's Huawei and ZTE.And today, I'll share why the ban was a smart move for our national security - and what it means for investors… The Next Generation of Wireless TechYou see, I've been tracking the 5G space very closely. It's the next evolution of wireless networks. And these new networks are going live on a weekly - and sometimes, daily - basis.On average, 5G will deliver mobile speeds 100 times faster than the 4G networks we connect to today. And having the fastest possible communications network on the planet is critical for economic growth and strength…Consider this: The economic impact of 5G will be in the range of three to five times more than the 4G wireless buildout.With 5G, as much as $275 billion will be invested by U.S. wireless carriers. Roughly three million jobs will be created in the U.S. And we can expect approximately $500 billion in GDP growth, too.At an industry level, expect $200 billion invested per year through 2025.So it's no wonder President Trump is eager to push the 5G wireless buildout forward.In fact, early last year, the current administration &quot;threatened&quot; to build out its own national 5G network if wireless carriers couldn't get it done. And my suspicion is that it was a warning.The White House was saying, &quot;Get out there and build these 5G networks quickly - or we'll do it for you.&quot; It was lighting a fire under private companies involved in the 5G buildout.And it worked…Verizon just launched 5G in four more U.S. cities: Atlanta, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Washington, D.C. So President Trump and America's senators will now have access to blazing-fast 5G.Now, some of us might be thinking that this early 5G coverage launch in D.C. isn't a coincidence. And we'd be absolutely right…Putting 5G tech in the hands of busy policymakers demonstrates progress. After all, the president has made his intentions on 5G very clear. In April, he said:The race to 5G is a race America must win, and it's a race, frankly, that our great companies are now involved in. We've given them the incentive they need. It's a race that we will win.And America winning this 5G race could be a matter of national security… Wireless World WarHere's what I mean by that: Countries leading the way in deploying 5G networks will have a competitive advantage over others.And the tech companies in these &quot;first-mover&quot; countries will be the first to develop the hardware and software enabling these 5G wireless services.Now, the fear is that China will set the 5G precedent. It'd leave America dependent on Chinese 5G infrastructure. The U.S. would be vulnerable to further cyber-spying.That's why Cybereason's discovery of Operation Soft Cell was alarming. And it's why the government further determined equipment from Huawei and ZTE was a security threat.Now, given the scale and origin of the operation, the ban looks like a smart move.Plus, the president is now insistent on getting America's 5G networks built out quickly - by American and European firms.And for investors, here's the bottom line…Behind the scenes, the world's top superpowers - the U.S. and China - are waging a war for 5G supremacy.So 5G is an unstoppable trend. And companies providing the necessary tech for these 5G networks will benefit.American Tower (NYSE:AMT) is one of these wireless communications infrastructure companies. It builds and maintains communications infrastructure like cell towers.It was instrumental in the 4G buildout that started in 2011. And it's also heavily involved in erecting and maintaining the towers used in the 5G buildout.Right now, investors should be looking at companies like American Tower that provide critical network infrastructure. These key 5G stocks will soar.Keep this trend on your radar. I expect 5G to be the best investing opportunity of the next decade.Regards,Jeff Brown  Editor, Exponential Tech InvestorP.S. Investors who miss the 5G boom will regret it for the rest of their lives. I expect key 5G stocks to soar as much as 10x - perhaps higher. 99% of investors will miss this chance. I encourage you not to be one of them.That's why I'm hosting the 5G Investment Summit tonight at 8 p.m. ET. I'll reveal my stock-picking method for finding the fastest-moving 5G stocks. I'll even give you the name of my No. 1 5G company to add to your watchlist.I haven't revealed this research anywhere else. And the only way to claim it is by signing up right here.

Just follow this link and add your name to the guest list.Source: Shutterstock For today's dispatch, we're handing the reins over to Jeff. Below, he digs into why 5G is not only an unstoppable investment trend, but also a matter of national security. In fact, as you'll see, 5G is on President Trump's radar right now as a top national security priority…Last summer, a Boston-based cybersecurity firm called Cybereason discovered something disturbing…InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt was a massive espionage campaign targeting at least 10 major wireless carriers around the world.The hackers were tracking about 20 political and military targets. They were collecting data from these carriers about the targets' phone calls, texts, and physical locations.It's right out of a spy movie.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More This campaign - dubbed Operation Soft Cell - had been going on since 2012. And Cybereason says all the evidence points to the culprit being a hacker crew working for Chinese intelligence.Now, we don't know who the Chinese spies were targeting. That's still top-secret information.But what's clear is that key Trump administration officials got wind of this campaign around the same time they started banning 5G networking equipment from two Chinese firms: Huawei (pronounced &quot;wah-way&quot;) and ZTE.Today, I'll show you why the ban was a smart move for our national security. I'll also show you some of the specific ways you can profit from the 5G boom.Next-Generation TechI've been tracking the 5G space for my readers since 2017.It's the next evolution of the wireless networks that connect your smartphone to the internet.

That would leave the U.S. dependent on Chinese 5G infrastructure. We'd be vulnerable to more cyber spying from Chinese spies.That's why the president wants the country's 5G network built out quickly. And it's why he wants it to be built by U.S. and European firms.As I've been showing you, 5G is an unstoppable trend. And companies providing the necessary tech for these 5G networks will benefit.What to Do NowI've been recommending my readers look at companies that provide critical network infrastructure.Take American Tower (NYSE:AMT). I put it on my readers' radars in July 2018.AMT builds and maintains wireless network infrastructure such as cell towers.The firm played a key role in the 4G build-out that started in 2011. Today, it's also involved in putting up the towers used in the 5G build-out.And it's been a great stock to own.But that was just the first phase of the 5G boom.My research shows that the third and final phase is going to be the most profitable by far.During the 4G era, individual stocks soared 868%, 1,745%, and even 3,200%. I believe the biggest winners during the final phase of the 5G boom could soar even higher with time.I'll be revealing full details of my market &quot;script&quot; for 5G today, August 22 at 8 p.m. ET.That's when I'm hosting my free 5G investment summit, The Final Phase of the 5G Boom.I'll show you why the final phase I've identified is set to be so profitable.

And it airs on August 22 at 8 p.m. ET.Jeff will reveal how a few key 5G stocks could deliver 10 times your money - perhaps even more - as this unstoppable trend gains momentum.He'll even be sharing his No. 1 5G watchlist company. So before you read on, make sure to save your spot.But as we'll explore in more detail in today's dispatch, 5G isn't just an investment trend.It's also a matter of national security.That's because, as Jeff explained yesterday, the Chinese government could use Chinese-built 5G networks to mount a mass-espionage campaign against the U.S.It's because of the threat from groups like APT10…That's short for &quot;Advanced Persistent Threat 10.&quot; And it's the code name given to an elite group of Chinese computer hackers.APT10 works for the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS).It's the Chinese intelligence agency responsible for stealing secrets and technology from other countries. (Think the CIA in the U.S.)And it's had near unlimited access to data flowing through global wireless networks.That's according to Boston-based cybersecurity firm Cybereason…It conducted an investigation last year. And it concluded that APT10 was behind &quot;mass-scale espionage&quot; of global cellular networks.The investigation report is a sobering read.In an operation Cybereason dubbed &quot;Operation Soft Cell,&quot; APT10 seized control of at least 10 cellular networks around the world.This gave Chinese spooks almost open access to these networks… and the sensitive data that passes through them.And Operation Soft Cell isn't the only threat. Last year, 30% of telecommunications providers reported that hackers had stolen sensitive information on their customers.The Chinese don't have to hack into your phone to spy on you…It's more efficient to hack into telecommunications companies such as Verizon, AT&T, or T-Mobile.Then, groups like APT10 can use the data these companies collect on their customers to surveil you.And in 2012, that's exactly what APT10 started to do.By secretly gaining access to these network providers, it was able to steal a trove of sensitive information.This included billing data, call-detail records, credentials… even geolocation data (thanks to the GPS units built into smartphones).This gave MSS the ability to &quot;track any person across different countries.&quot; That's what Cybereason CEO Lior Div told The Wall Street Journal.Any time one of MSS's targets used a cell phone, MSS could tell where he was and who he was talking to… along with other &quot;private&quot; data sent across these networks.This is the kind of vulnerability that keeps U.S. intelligence chiefs awake at night…They worry Americans will become more vulnerable to Chinese companies if China builds the world's 5G networks.A Chinese-built 5G network could hand APT10 - and other state-sponsored groups like it - a secret &quot;backdoor&quot; into the rest of the world's private cellular communication.Cybereason believes APT10 is even capable of shutting down or disrupting wireless networks as part of a larger cyberwarfare operation.This issue is so important it's on President Trump's radar…And the radar of his inner circle of advisors.Last year, President Trump's National Security Council (NSC) considered a federal takeover of a portion of America's wireless communications network.That way, the U.S. could better protect its 5G network… and keep China from infiltrating its wireless communications.Trump now opposes nationalizing 5G networks…As Jeff put it in these pages yesterday, the nationalization threat was a way to &quot;light a fire&quot; under the U.S. companies involved in the 5G build-out.The Trump administration was telling Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile, &quot;Start building 5G networks now. Or we'll do it for you.&quot;And Trump is right to be concerned. It's hard to overstate how important it is these networks stay secure.In the future, the 5G network will be used in robotic surgery, for instance. It will also be used to transmit data to and from self-driving cars… and to and from remote-controlled fleets of semi trucks.The military also needs secure networks to communicate with drones and other unmanned vehicles.As Jeff has been writing for years, this is something you don't want to ignore…5G will allow us to download movies in seconds on our smartphones.But what makes 5G a game-changer is the new tech innovations it will give birth to.By 2035, Jeff says 5G will be responsible for at least $12 trillion of new goods and services. That's roughly 60% of America's total GDP in 2017.For the White House, it's essential that the 5G networks are built with U.S. and European technology. It's their only shot at protecting these networks from foreign espionage.Jeff began by focusing on the first phase of the 5G revolution…That's the build-out of the physical infrastructure 5G networks need to exist.For instance, Jeff put American Tower (NYSE:AMT) on readers' radars in July 2018.It builds and maintains wireless network infrastructure such as cell towers.The firm played a key role in 4G build-out that started in 2011. Today, it's also involved in putting up the towers used in the 5G build-out.And it's been a great stock to own.You can see AMT crushed the markets since July 2018. It's up 60% versus a gain of 4% for the S&P 500.And as you'll learn in tomorrow's dispatch, the 5G network build-out is unfolding in three phases. And the next phase promises to be even more profitable than the first.Stay tuned for more on that tomorrow.And don't forget to mark your calendar…As I (Chris) mentioned up top, this Thursday, August 22 at 8 p.m. ET, Jeff is hosting a free 5G investment summit.He'll be detailing how the final, most profitable phase of the 5G boom will unfold.He'll also reveal his method for picking the fastest-moving 5G stocks. These are the investments Jeff believes could 10x your money as the 5G megatrend unfolds.He'll even give you a &quot;Phase 3&quot; 5G company to add to your watchlist.I'll be clearing my schedule to hear Jeff's big reveal.

2019-08-20	2019-08-20 19:36:06	AMT	American Tower Corporation	7 Unusual, Growth-Oriented REITs to Buy for Your Portfolio	In a low interest rate environment, dividend stocks often come into focus. One type of dividend stock that gets attention is the real estate investment trust (REIT). To gain this status, companies must pay at least 90% of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Consequently, investors often look for REITs to buy because such rules lead to higher interest rates. Average yields for REITs have now climbed to 4.06%, more than double the average return of the S&P 500.  * 10 Stocks That Every 30-Year-Old Should Buy and Hold Forever Investors should also note that REITs remain a dynamic sector. For example, the advent of e-commerce has hurt retail REITs and boosted industrial REITs as a large portion of retailing moved from malls to warehouses. Also, new REIT sectors sometimes emerge. For example, data center REITs came about to meet the demand for cool, wired, secured real estate to store IT equipment. Such changes bring about new REITs to buy, and these stocks offer opportunities in such emerging industries.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust (CORR)Source: Shutterstock CorEnergy (NYSE:CORR) owns the infrastructure that runs the oil and gas industry. This includes structures such as pipelines, storage terminals and other transmission and distribution-related assets.Interestingly, as oil and gas prices struggle to gain traction, CORR stock remains one of the REITs to buy as its rise continues in this challenging environment. It now trades at just over $45 per share, a high not seen since 2012. Despite this increase, it trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 19.5.Moreover, the recent slump has not hurt profit growth. Wall Street predicts CORR stock will see profits grow by 9.3% and 23.9% next year before a slowdown in subsequent years.However, this could boost an already generous dividend payment. Right now, CORR stock pays out $3 per share. That yields around 6.6%. Although it has not risen since 2016, the current pace of profit growth could force it higher.After the current run-up, both revenue and profit growth could plateau. However, it should level off at a point that will still yield current investors a high dividend return. Crown Castle (CCI)Source: iStockphoto Among REITs to buy, Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) specializes in what many call &quot;vertical real estate.&quot; It owns towers throughout the world that make wireless communication possible. CNN Business's Paul R. La Monica went so far to label Crown Castle and peers American Tower (NYSE:AMT) and SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC) as the &quot;real winners&quot; of 5G. SBA's CEO expects 5G to provide his industry with &quot;multiple years of solid customer demand and strong growth.&quot;Hence, it should come as no surprise that CCI stock has risen to about $144 per share. It has increased by about 40% over the last year. Admittedly, this has made CCI a pricey stock as it trades at a forward P/E ratio of about 69.4.However, for this price, investors can expect to derive both significant growth and income. Analysts predict average profit growth of 21% per year over the next five years.  * 7 Fintech ETFs to Buy Now for Fabulous Financial Exposure The dividend has also risen consistently after becoming a REIT in 2014. Investors currently receive $4.50 per year in payouts. This brings its dividend yield to just over 3.1%, higher than either AMT or SBAC stock. Thanks to the 5G buildout, these payouts should continue to grow for years to come. Essential Properties Realty Trust (EPRT)Source: Shutterstock Essential Properties Realty Trust (NYSE:EPRT) has only traded for a little over one year. However, this diversified REIT, which specializes in properties with one tenant, has already delivered huge returns for its investors. Restaurants, movie theaters and vet clinics are among the property types it owns.It debuted at $14 per share in June 2018. Although it saw little price action in 2018, its growth in 2019 has made it one of the best REITs to buy. After last Christmas, it began a steady rise which has now taken it north of $22 per share.But can that continue for EPRT stock?Quite possibly, yes. The move higher took its forward P/E ratio to about 34. That may seem elevated. However, with average profit growth estimated at 34.61% per year over the next five years, that multiple appears reasonable.EPRT stock pays 88 cents per share in dividends. Despite the run-up, that amounts to a yield of around 4%. As a young company, it has only made four quarterly dividend payments in its history. While that has shown no increase, the profit growth rate will force that payout to move higher. As long as that growth continues at its current pace, I think EPRT stock will continue its move higher. Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)Source: Shutterstock Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) came about due to the emerging marijuana industry. This has created the need for spaces that provide ideal growing conditions for marijuana. This demand has gone ever higher due to hemp attaining legal status and cannabidiol (CBD) flying off store shelves.This company owns 21 properties specifically designed for producing cannabis. Over the last two years, IIPR stock has boomed. The yield of about 2.25% may look low by REIT standards; however, these payouts continue to rise. Two years ago, IIPR stock paid shareholders 15 cents per share in dividends every quarter. Now, the quarterly payout has increased to 60 cents per share.Furthermore, stock price appreciation has seen nearly as much growth. It traded below $20 per share in late 2017. Today it has risen to about $106 per share as of the time of this writing. Moreover, unlike most marijuana stocks now, it trades near its all-time high.  * The 10 Best Marijuana Stocks to Buy Now To be sure, IIPR stock carries with it more risk. The forward P/E ratio has risen to 35.6. That comes in low for a cannabis stock, but high for a REIT. However, Wall Street forecasts earnings increases of 128% this year and 74.3% in fiscal 2020. As long as the cannabis industry continues to see massive growth, IIPR stock should follow suit. Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI)Source: Shutterstock Omega Healthcare (NYSE:OHI) should make REITs to buy lists for demographics as much as any company-related factor. All things healthcare continue to benefit from the fact that about 10,000 baby boomers per day age into Medicare. Between their growing need for healthcare and help to pay through Medicare, the demand for healthcare-related facilities continues to rise.Consequently, analysts project a 10% earnings increase for Omega this year. Over the next five years, they believe average profit growth will rise to 15.8%. This will significantly boost the dividend for OHI stock as it has in past years.That said, investors should treat this as an income stock. Admittedly, the stock price has seen little growth over the last five years. In August 2014, it traded near the $36 per share level. Today, OHI stock sells for just over $39 per share. Moreover, the forward P/E ratio of almost 23 does not make this REIT cheap.Still, the payout should more than compensate for these shortcomings. The current annual dividend stands at $2.64 per share, a yield of almost 6.75%. Over time, this payout tends to rise steadily. Although it has not increased since the beginning of 2018, the increasing profit should keep the payout moving higher. These profit increases and the demographic trend backing them up make OHI stock one of the better REITs to buy for the foreseeable future. Ryman Hospitality (RHP)Source: FlickrAlthough many may not recognize the Ryman Hospitality (NYSE:RHP) name, they do know its flagship property, Nashville's Gaylord Opryland Resort. They also own four other Gaylord resort properties spread across the country. The company also owns several entertainment venues in Nashville and two others outside of the area.Investors should place RHP stock on their REITs to buy list, not so much for its excitement, but a track record of mostly steady growth. The stock price has nearly doubled in value over the last five years. Shrinking profits likely contributed to a slight decline in RHP over the previous year.However, this may have given investors a buying opportunity. RHP stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of about 25.3, thanks to a temporary drop in annual profits. However, after this year, Wall Street predicts an average earnings growth rate of 15.51% for the next five years.  * 7 Marijuana Penny Stocks That I May Buy Since its second REIT dividend payment in 2013, the payout has steadily increased. It now pays shareholders $3.60 per year for a yield of just over 4.3%. As the valuation falls and profits and dividends increase, long-term investors should continue to benefit from both a growth and an income standpoint. Safehold, Inc. (SAFE)Source: Shutterstock Safehold (NYSE:SAFE) has become one of the REITs to buy for its unique take on property ownership. It specializes in ground leases. They buy the property under the building, leasing it back to the building owner. This unlocks the value of the property under buildings, allowing property holders to hold less equity and push cash to use in other areas. The REIT has applied this strategy to multiple property types.Since launching their IPO in 2017, SAFE stock and its dividend initially struggled. Moreover, the dividend yield of about 2.1% has remained below REIT averages. However, the stock began to appreciate in 2019. Now trading at about $29 per share, SAFE has appreciated by about 80% since January. Also, the company raised the annual dividend by 2 cents per share in July.Those increases should continue. Wall Street also predicts profit growth for the next five years will average 42.6% per year. Furthermore, despite this massive growth, it still sells for a forward multiple of about 22.2. As long as SAFE stock can maintain this pace of profit growth, shareholders should benefit from not only the dividend but also a continually rising stock price.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Taiclet said despite its name, American Tower is a global business, and one thing that is constant around the world is the need for wireless communication, data and entertainment.  When asked about the U.S. telecom landscape in light of the expected Sprint  and T-Mobile  merger, Taiclet said he thinks the market will benefit from having four strong players, which is what there will be once Sprint and T-Mobile divest some assets to Dish Network  , which has its own plans for a 5G roll-out."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a74ce1da-ec3a-32bd-87ad-b5647279b274/american-tower-likely-to.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-26	2019-06-26 10:05:35	AMT	American Tower Corporation	Aggressive Dealmaking Drives Europe's Most Expensive Stock	(Bloomberg) -- Combining two badly performing industries usually doesn’t make them any better. Yet that’s what’s underpinning Europe’s most expensive stock.Spain’s Cellnex Telecom SA has become the highest-valued stock on the regional benchmark by serving as a landlord to the ailing telecom industry. While real estate and telecom are among the worst performers on the Stoxx 600 Index this year, Cellnex has soared after snapping up towers from carriers eager to convert their assets to cash, helping them keep up with network investments.“They are in a very sweet spot,” Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud, said by phone. “The only worry at the moment for me is that the stock has moved an awful long way in a very, very short space of time.”The tower company model is fairly new to Europe, in contrast with the U.S., where American Tower Corp. and Crown Castle International Corp. began buying communication sites in the mid-1990s. Since its initial public offering in 2015, Cellnex has seized the relatively open field with aggressive dealmaking, spending 2.7 billion euros ($3.1 billion) just last month on more than 10,000 towers in Italy, France and Switzerland.The company looks set to continue its acquisition spree -- it announced on Tuesday the issuance of as much as 850 million euros in a nine-year convertible bond to fund purchases. The company has increased the number of network infrastructure sites in its portfolio by six-fold to about 45,000 in the past 4.5 years, including ones it has agreements on building for clients.Cellnex has gained nearly 60% in the first half, taking this year’s estimated price-to-earnings ratio to an eye-watering 131, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s beyond such high-growth companies as the Dutch payments prodigy Adyen NA, or computer-games maker CD Projekt SA, which is about to publish its most-hyped title ever. Cellnex declined to comment on the valuation.While Cellnex’s expected revenue growth is much slower than the other names at the top, the surveyed 12 analysts estimate its earnings per share to nearly double from 2019 to 2021. Tower stocks have showed up on investors’ radar thanks to their stable cash flows and good visibility: smaller Italian peer Inwit SpA has also had a good year with a 43% gain so far. Tower contracts are usually signed for a decade or two.“There is a premium being paid for corporates that offer visibility,’’ Guy Peddy, an analyst at Macquarie, said by phone. “Cellnex is the only clear, European, free-from-ownership-issues, tower-focused operator.”Cellnex’s biggest shareholder is Italy’s Benetton family, which owns about 30% of the stock via its investment company Edizione. The family is said to be backing former Telecom Italia SpA head Franco Bernabe to replace Marco Patuano as chairman, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.During the stellar run of the second quarter, Cellnex shares have mostly traded above the average price target, leaving analysts to play catch-up. The gap became the widest ever this week at 3 euros and currently implies a 4.8% downside to the stock, according to 27 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.In Europe, the share of telecommunications infrastructure held by independent tower companies is low compared with other regions, according to an April report by accounting and consultancy firm EY and the European Wireless Infrastructure Association (EWIA). The share of independent tower firms was a mere 17% in 2017, compared with 67% in North America and 42% in the Caribbean and Latin America. Operators could free up 28 billion euros if that share grew to 50%, the report estimates.Race to BuyOne risk to Cellnex’s tower campaign across Europe is competition for assets. The region’s emerging tower business is “not a one-horse race,” analysts at Kempen warned in a note last month, saying that Cellnex losing out on deals could lead to investor disappointment. In 2016, American Towers teamed up with Dutch pension fund PGGM Fondsenbeheer BV, beating Cellnex to win Antin Infrastructure Partners’ French phone towers.While American Towers has been more focused on emerging markets since, there’s a possibility that a private equity firm such as KKR & Co. Inc. would join the party, Giles Thorne, an analyst at Jefferies said in a note on Tuesday, keeping his buy rating and raising his price target by more than 50%.“The one candidate that has the assets and scope on paper to replicate Cellnex’s march across Europe is KKR,” Thorne said. “Its actions suggest it doesn’t see the regional synergy case for cross-border M&A. This may yet change.”Additionally, some telecom carriers see network quality as an important competitive advantage and are reluctant to relinquish control of their top sites. Tim Hoettges, chief executive officer of Deutsche Telekom AG -- which is not a client of Cellnex -- has spoken of “golden sites” as a category of differentiating network infrastructure locations the company wouldn’t be willing to share.Yet overall, tower companies are well placed to benefit from industry-specific drivers, including increased data consumption, Josh Sambrook-Smith, a thematic equity analyst at Sarasin & Partners, said by phone.“You have all the other super exciting, long-term trends,” said Sambrook-Smith. “This is just a relatively safe way to play it.”(Updates share prices from the 6th paragraph, chart)To contact the reporter on this story: Kit Rees in London at krees1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Beth Mellor at bmellor@bloomberg.net, Kasper Viita, Celeste PerriFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aggressive-dealmaking-drives-europes-most-100535692.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-19	2019-06-19 19:28:58	AMT	American Tower Corporation	Best ETFs for 2019: Financial Sector Spider ETF (XLF) Still Has a Chance	Editor's Note: This article is part of InvestorPlace.com's Best ETFs for 2019 contest. Dana Blankenhorn's pick is Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF).At the start of 2019, when we relaunched our best exchange-traded funds feature, I thought the market was getting frothy and chose to get defensive with the Financial Sector Spider ETF (NYSEARCA:XLF).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo far, that's up 15%. Pretty fly for an old guy. But folks who were more aggressive have done better. The editor of this section, Robert Waldo, has more than doubled me up with his choice, the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:SRVR). SRVR has big holdings in technology landlords like American Tower (NYSE:AMT), which owns most of those big cell towers you love, and Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), a data center REIT that connects the clouds.Can the big banks come back? Look for ConsolidationHope for a comeback lies in consolidation. The merger of BB&T (NYSE:BBT) and SunTrust (NYSE:STI) to create something called Truist is making investors money. It's a big win for Charlotte, which will be the new bank's headquarters, and a loss for my hometown of Atlanta, where SunTrust is based.The Prosperity Bancshares (NYSE:PB) acquisition of LegacyTexas Financial Group (NASDAQ:LTXB) in Dallas gave that state its first big locally owned bank in decades. By such standards it's still a minnow. Total assets will be about $30 billion (SunTrust alone is worth seven times more) but if this is the start of a trend, then XLF investors should benefit. That's because takeovers fuel speculation about more takeovers, leading speculators to feed on potential targets and bankers to start whispering sweet nothings of profit in other bankers' ears.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever  Banks Are Payment ProcessorsIn general, however, banks remain subject to the same computerization trend facing other service-based businesses like insurance and real estate. Don't let your kid think he can grow up to sit behind a desk with pillars at either side and a swinging gate in front of him. That's a game for lawyers.I have only been in banks a few times in the last year … once to visit my safety deposit box and another time to use a notary. (You probably thought I was going to say bathroom.) There was a time when I regularly visited my broker's office to deposit checks into my market account, but there's an app for that now.Willie Sutton, the bank robber who supposedly said banks &quot;are where the money is,&quot; would today be a geeky hacker, because that's where the money is in banking today. It's in programming.Why sit in front of a banker when you can just borrow through Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital -- they have all your financial figures anyhow. On the other hand, the biggest banks are also the biggest payment processors. They're not going to let that business go without a fight.Expect more deals. Bottom Line on the XLF ETFThe bottom line is that as money continues to become magnetic ink, banks will remain under pressure to consolidate and run off to the dog track with the depositors' money. The likelihood of more scandals like that of Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), once seen as a Donald Trump-era darling, is only going to grow.It all comes down to a new sobering reality. Banks are about to become the new stock market casino. But casinos make good money. And if your kid grew up as a geeky programmer type, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is hiring.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-04-02	2019-04-02 11:26:05	AMT	American Tower Corporation	3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: American Tower, AT&T and Allstate	Stocks got the new week started on a bullish foot, with the S&P 500 rallying 1.16% on renewed enthusiasm and hope for an economic revival. The index's close of 2,867.19 was its best yet for the year.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) led the way with a 3.4% gain, though most banks weren't far behind thanks to the inverted yield curve becoming un-inverted again. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) was up 3.3%, extending its new, young uptrend.At the other end of the spectrum, Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) fell another 11.8% yesterday in its second day of trading. Shares ended the day near $69, falling below their IPO price of $72 as traders dump -- or short -- the newly minted stock of the so-far-unprofitable company.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHeaded into Tuesday's action, it's the stock charts of Allstate (NYSE:ALL), AT&T (NYSE:T) and American Tower (NYSE:AMT) that merit the most attention. Here's why. AT&T (T)AT&T has been a miserable performer since early 2017, sliding from a price near $42 to a low of less than $27 in December of last year.  * The Elite 8 Stocks to Buy for Massive Outperformance Like most other stocks, T has recovered from that deep low. However, as of yesterday shares of AT&T have snapped out of a rut and cleared not one but two important technical hurdles.  Click to Enlarge • One of those hurdles is the horizontal resistance level at $31.42, plotted with a red dashed line on the daily chart.• The other ceiling is the white 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. The 200-day line was a decisive technical ceiling in October, ultimately pushing T to even lower lows.• Zooming out to the weekly chart we can see T stock has broken above a falling resistance line, plotted in yellow, that had been guiding it lower since the beginning of 2018.• Underscoring the budding uptrend is the Chaikin line's cross back above zero, confirming there's real bullish interest in AT&T. American Tower (AMT)American Tower was one of the few names that didn't struggle during the fourth quarter of last year, logging gains instead. And though the broad tide was bullish during the first quarter of the year, even then AMT outpaced the broad market's advance.That big move left American Tower overbought and ripe for a pullback. That swing from an uptrend into a downtrend may have materialized yesterday.  Click to Enlarge • The shape and placement of Monday's bar is the key. The open was above Friday's high, but the close fell back under Friday's low. This &quot;outside day&quot; reversal is a strong statement that things changed in a big way.• The volume surge is also a big clue. The outside-day bar on high volume suggests the last of the would-be sellers started to flood out in a big way. This might inspire more of the same.• Potential downside targets include the white 200-day moving average line currently at $160.70, or the congestion between $132 and $152. Allstate (ALL)Allstate shares have been trending sideways for over a month, unable to clear a key technical hurdle, but also finding support at a crucial level. The stock continues to test its technical ceiling though, and some subtle clues suggest a breakout is brewing. One or two more good days could do the trick.  Click to Enlarge • The line in the sand is around $95.60, plotted with a blue line on both stock charts. ALL stock touched that level for a fourth time on Monday.• At the same time, the white 200-day moving average line has stepped up as technical support, quelling pullbacks before they get started in earnest.• Though volume has been below average since early this year, over the course of the past few weeks there has been decidedly more bullish volume than bearish volume.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-26	2019-03-26 11:25:36	AMT	American Tower Corporation	Best ETFs for 2019: Pacer Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF Is a Leader	This article is a part of InvestorPlace's Best ETFs for 2019 contest. Robert Waldo's pick for the contest is the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:SRVR).As of this writing, the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:SRVR) is in the No.1 spot for our best ETFs for 2019 contest, up 20% year-to-date.All of the exchange-traded funds are in the green and it's a close race, with a tie for second place as I write this. But regardless of the success of other ETFs riding on SRVR's tail, I still believe this 5G ETF will come out on top at the end of the year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe SRVR ETF is one of the best ETFs to buy this year because it's a well-rounded play on an upcoming trend that will affect how the world operates for years to come.I'm talking about 5G -- &quot;the next generation of cellular connectivity&quot; that will make the most exciting and futuristic tech ideas possible. To get an idea of how fast 5G is compared to 4G LTE, consider that 4G LTE's top speed is 1GB per second, while 5G will have a top speed of 20 GB per second -- a 2,000% increase!  * 7 5G Stocks to Buy as the Race for Spectrum Tightens While these top speeds won't be obtained consistently, they still signify a significant leap in speed that will help make our hyper-connected, high-tech world operate much quicker and more efficiently. This 5G ETF Is Not Just About 5GBut as hype-worthy of a trend as 5G may be, that's not all that SRVR has going for it. In fact, part of my decision to pick this fund for our best ETFs contest was that it's a real estate investment trust (REIT) ETF. This means its holdings own data centers and fiber that are vital to the 5G rollout, but are also necessary for all of our current, general tech-related luxuries like the cloud.Without SRVR's holdings, our day-to-day, tech-obsessed lifestyle would be much different.And that's the key reason why it's one of the best ETFs to buy: Its holdings are necessary with or without the 5G catalyst, which makes it a safe, long-term play with significant growth potential.The companies that make up SRVR's top holdings, like American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) and Equinix Inc (NASDAQ:EQIX), provide the infrastructure that enables our current connectivity, but each of these will gain a significant boost as 5G is adopted in the years ahead and the need for more fiber, cell towers, etc., becomes a reality.Its design as a REIT ETF also means that it comes with a hefty 3.7% dividend yield, which will help provide steady income to investors as 5G expands over the years. And all this for an expense ratio of 0.6%.All of these perks add up to SRVR's current success as the best performing ETF in our contest right now. But no matter the end result, you can bet that this will be a strong 5G ETF to buy for many years.Robert Waldo is an Assitant Editor for InvestorPlace.

2019-03-20	2019-03-20 19:30:43	AMT	American Tower Corporation	7 5G Stocks to Buy as the Race for Spectrum Tightens	{Editor's note: This story was previously published in Jan. 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]Telecommunications technology has always been an ultra-competitive business. But with the advent of airwave auctions, figuring out which 5G stocks to buy just got a lot more interesting. Sector players are leaving no stone unturned as they battle for prime network coverage. Municipalities and entire nations selling their airwave rights in return for lucrative contracts with telecom giants is nothing new. Because of the 5G revolution, however, an increased number of countries are engaging in airwave auctions for the first time. It's a trend that will likely proliferate.According to a Bloomberg report, Italy auctioned off $7.6 billion of high-speed airwaves. The massive sum was actually twice as much as the Italian government anticipated. That's obviously good for the Mediterranean country, which has suffered significant economic viability concerns. The impact of 5G, however, remains questionable in both the short- and long-term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFirst, we must consider the obvious. In the Italian sector's case, $7.6 billion is a lot of money, especially for many deeply indebted telecom firms. Several 5G stocks are now levered to a huge, binary risk. If things go sour, these names could quickly fall out of the list of stocks to buy. Second, it's not clear how ultra-fast airwaves will impact 5G stocks. The next-generation network has multiple uses beyond quick download speeds, such as gaming and driverless vehicles. If these stated functions experience their own hiccups, that could hurt the telecom industry's big gamble.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly Personally, I'm skeptical of pure driverless vehicles. That said, we won't know how far we can go until we integrate the appropriate infrastructure. If you're ready for the risk, here are seven 5G stocks to buy: Verizon Communications (VZ)Typically, we remember the company that innovated first. For Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), this first-to-market advantage is a significant one, making VZ stock an interesting bull case. As our own James Brumley explains, VZ stock isn't necessarily a perfect play for the upcoming network revolution. Brumley writes, &quot;Though technically speaking Verizon's entry into the race is neither the first 5G network nor the version of 5G connectivity that will become the industry standard, owners of Verizon stock need not be discouraged.&quot;That's because VZ stock struck first, leaving its key competitors scrambling for a response. For a few target markets -- Indianapolis, Houston, Los Angeles and Sacramento -- Verizon members will have the joys of wireless 5G broadband internet service delivered to their homes.True, VZ stock isn't quite yet a pure name among 5G stocks to buy because its 5G mobile service isn't available. But then again, no one is ready, as even most smartphones aren't equipped to handle 5G.Once they are, however, Verizon is in prime position. It has aggressively worked with city governments to secure lucrative airwave rights. In a few years, Verizon stock will be a very serious player in 5G. AT&T (T)In recent times, AT&T (NYSE:T) has become one of the most aggressive stocks investors can buy. Management is not afraid to shell out big bucks to make critical acquisitions. That was on display when AT&T bought out Time Warner for over $85 billion. So it might seem strange that the company is currently playing second fiddle to Verizon in 5G.Ordinarily, I would be worried. However, T stock is not your average investment. In this particular case, I don't mind AT&T not chasing after the 5G hype train. Don't get me wrong: I believe in the next-gen wireless revolution. But for AT&T, waiting to measure twice and cut once is worth the initial pain.As Brumley suggested, Verizon used non-standard equipment to secure pole position among 5G stocks. AT&T will roll out its high-speed network with equipment that will eventually be the industry's gold standard. I think management is being prudent primarily because T stock is highly leveraged from the Time Warner buyout. They should wait to get it right the first time.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly Even if Verizon or any other competitor steals the spotlight, the situation is only temporary. AT&T already enjoys enviable network assets, and it's putting them to good use with their &quot;5G Evolution&quot;. Once the broader infrastructure is set for true 5G, look for T stock to take off. Intel (INTC)For millennials and older generations, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has earned most of its fame as a semiconductor firm. While the PC chip-making business isn't going to go away anytime soon, we've seen a dramatic shift to cloud computing. Eventually, INTC stock will only be known for its innovations in the cloud, and for related sectors like data centers.This trend allows for natural synergies for the 5G revolution. Rather than just provide equipment to handle these advanced airwaves, Intel has a holistic approach. For instance, with 5G, the company can take their virtual-reality endeavors to the next level. We saw a glimpse of their impressive portfolio during the last Winter Olympics when they broadcast events in VR.Intel is also looking to revolutionize transportation, and not just through driverless vehicles. With a 5G-connected municipality, the company can help maximize transportation efficiencies for both personal and commercial purposes. Finally, Intel is looking toward smart-health solutions. With 5G's inherent low-latency (the time it takes to transmit data between devices), medicine can experience its own paradigm-shift.Intel isn't just thinking about current uses -- it has a broader perspective. For this and many other reasons, INTC stock is one of the best 5G stocks to buy. Qualcomm (QCOM)As great as this next-gen wireless innovation is, all 5G stocks currently face two lagging issues: structural and technical. The structural component revolves around what companies like Verizon and AT&T are fighting over, namely, airwave rights. You can't have 5G if the physical foundation doesn't support this upgraded network speed.The other lag is technical. Practically speaking, your phone doesn't have 5G capacity, so right now, it's a moot point. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is looking to change that reality. In July, Qualcomm introduced state-of-the-art radio-frequency antenna modules that are extremely compact, yet can accommodate 5G airwaves. The company recently unveiled 5G-capable mobile platforms.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly The tech giant could use some stability in the markets. While no one questions Qualcomm's technical wizardry, QCOM stock has been one of the wildest among 5G stocks. As the innovation becomes an accepted reality, we should see bullish sentiment regain firm control. American Tower (AMT)American Tower (NYSE:AMT) is what I would consider a hybrid name among 5G stocks to buy. As InvestorPlace contributor Will Healy mentioned, 4G-equipped mobile devices require massive cell towers to function properly. But 5G? These are high-frequency waves that support faster data transmissions, but don't travel as far as prior-gen wireless waves.Therefore, the name of the game is shorter cell posts and in greater amounts. That's why telecoms integrate 5G equipment into already-existing infrastructures. You'd think that would put AMT stock at a disadvantage. But as Healy explains, 5G-specific cells must communicate with larger towers. Also, American Tower's smaller structures would have new life.Another advantage for AMT stock is its international networks. Not all countries, especially the developing ones, will upgrade to 5G simultaneously. It took more than half-a-decade to fully roll out 4G, so that business will not go away so quickly. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)Although the high-speed wireless rollout is a net boost for 5G stocks, not all players are feeling the love. Case in point is Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS). Over the past year, SWKS stock is down approximately 24%. The more concerning part is that SWKS has lost significant momentum …But if you're bullish on 5G stocks, you should give Skyworks more than just a passing glance.Widely known for providing radio-frequency chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Skyworks is stepping up to the 5G revolution. In late July, the company unveiled its state-of-the-art antenna aperture tuners. These are incredibly compact, and provide enhanced bandwidth coverage to accommodate 5G airwaves.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly Beyond that, SWKS stock has other viable businesses that can help mitigate the volatility in the telecom sector. Skyworks levers significant expertise in industrial solutions, automotive design and smart-home platforms. In other words, the company is involved in too many lucrative markets to stay deflated indefinitely. Vodafone (VOD)Anytime I cover a gallery of stocks to buy, I always like to offer at least one speculative name. Granted, you ideally want to load up your portfolio with winning names. But market gambles are like cannabis: no one really talks about it openly, but you know almost everyone does it.So my knife-catching opportunity for 5G stocks is Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD). Unless your sporting activities only revolve around watching NASCAR and wrenching on your truck, you've heard of Vodafone. For NASCAR fans, Vodafone is a British multinational telecom giant. In fact, buying VOD stock makes you an owner of the second-biggest mobile network operator in the world.Unfortunately, that hasn't meant much to Wall Street. In the past year, VOD stock has hemorrhaged an agonizing 31%. Its aggressive bidding for European airwave auctions hasn't really charmed investors, who have been worried about its massive debt.But the old adage is that you have to spend money to make money. The 5G transition, once fully implemented, could dramatically alter the telecom landscape. At that point, those early (and painful) investments could pay off significantly.Undoubtedly, VOD stock is a huge risk, but one that isn't completely crazy.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-08	2019-01-08 20:18:06	AMT	American Tower Corporation	10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market)	"As is usually the case, Santa Claus brought a rally to Wall Street this year. Since the Christmas break, the S&P 500 has gained more than 8%, and it looks ready to test the waters of higher highs.

Still, considering the complete meltdown that played out in the days leading up to the pivot, investors remain reticent. The same index fell 20% between its September peak and its December lows, and it's possible the rebound since then is nothing more than a dead-cat bounce that's on the verge of screeching halt. The political backdrop is certainly troubling enough to inspire doubts about the market's foreseeable future.

It's environments like this that prompt people to look for less stressful solutions … names one can step into and still sleep well at night with, knowing that in time they'll at least keep pace with the market's overall progress. And, with above-average consistency working in their favor, they may well outperform the broad market.

### Walmart (WMT)

It's not a name that needs much in the way of an introduction. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is the world's biggest retailer, operating more than 11,000 stores here and abroad.

It's also the go-to source for a variety of consumer needs, ranging from groceries to school supplies to electronics to medicine. There's never a time when Walmart doesn't have something to sell. It may not be entirely recession-proof, but it's certainly recession-resistant.

Yes, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) lapped Walmart on the e-commerce front at a time when Walmart got lazy and sloppy within the brick-and-mortar arena. The company isn't infallible. The world's biggest retailer has certainly stepped up its game though, and WMT has become competitive again … online and offline.

### Southern Co (SO)

Most thorough lists of the best stocks to buy for investors that don't want to babysit their portfolios will include at least one utility name. That entry this time around is Southern Co (NYSE:SO), which delivers electricity and/or natural gas to a total of nine million customers in the United States.

The logic is obvious enough. Although consumers may postpone the purchase of a new car or decide to skip an extravagant vacation in any given year, there's never a time when consumers don't pay their utility bills. They need electricity 24/7. It may not be a growth-industry, but it's an incredibly reliable one.

The kicker: Utility stocks aren't bad income drivers either. Southern's current yield is an above-average 5.5%, and its per-share payout hasn't failed to grow in any year for almost the past 20.

### Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)

It's not a mistake. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has earned a spot on a list of the market's &quot;set it and forget it stocks.&quot;

Contrary to its common mental categorization, it's not as much of a technology name as it is a consumer services name. And, while the nature of the search/ad business is forever changing (per-click prices have been drifting lower for years, for one), Alphabet's Google is well-positioned to remain the intermediary that connects consumers with internet content.

The advent of mobile internet hasn't changed that reality either. A whopping 88% of smartphones in use today are powered by Android, which was built and is still maintained by Alphabet's Google.

The market may not like the pace of its revenue and profit growth from time to time, but nobody can deny it's become a growth machine.

### Visa (V)

Some investors look at the future of the payments industry and believe it belongs to names like Square (NYSE:SQ) or Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL). And, those names are certainly worthy players, while old-school outfits like Visa (NYSE:V) look and feel like relics simply due to their age.

Don't let the proverbial gray hairs and wrinkles fool you, though. Payment middleman Visa is not only still a player, it's more cutting-edge than most investors may fully appreciate.

Case in point: The company maintains several so-called &quot;Innovation Centers&quot; that solely focus on figuring out where the worlds of technology and money are going to meet in the future.

Visa was one of the first mainstream names to tinker with bitcoin-based payments, and its Visa Checkout platform has made online shopping a one-step snap (not to mention fast). Visa's going to be fine for a long, long time.

### Waste Management (WM)

They say the only two things that are certain in this world are death and taxes, but the axiom skips an important absolute -- That is, as long as mankind populates the planet, there will be trash to dispose of, one way or another. Enter Waste Management (NYSE:WM), which hauls away garbage for 21 million U.S. and Canadian customers.

It's admittedly not the sexiest of business lines, But, it's reliable, and drives more growth than most investors might suspect. Better still, the company is increasingly turning your trash into their treasure. At 130 of its landfills, Waste Management converts naturally occurring decomposition gas into enough energy to power more than 440,000 homes.

Neither business line is ever going to become obsolete.

### American Tower (AMT)

If you think wireless carriers own the cell phone towers you see peppered across the country's landscape, think again. They generally lease access to those towers, and pay the tower's owner/operator to keep power flowing to all the equipment attached to those towers.

American Tower (NYSE:AMT) is one of only a handful of such service providers, boasting a network of more than 170,000 towers in 17 different countries and five different continents. As long as the world uses cell phones (and increasingly, wireless broadband), American Tower will be in business.

That, however, isn't the only reason AMT is one of the best stocks to own at any time, regardless of the environment. Bolstering the bullish case here is that the company is organized as a REIT, which is a tax-advantaged vehicle for sharing its rental income with shareholders.

### Brown-Forman (BF.A, BF.B)

It comes as no real surprise to learn that consumers who drink wine and other spirits do so on a pretty regular basis.

That's not to suggest Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF.A, NYSE:BF.B) has mustered hyper-reliable revenue growth, because it hasn't. Ditto for earnings growth. Progress on both fronts is generally a good bet, but not necessarily bulletproof.

Nevertheless, it's not a lack of demand that causes the company's ebbs and flows. Mostly competition and expenses that sway its results from one quarter to the next … factors that generally end up being only short-term headwinds for the Brown-Forman.

Of course, with brand names like Jack Daniel's, Korbel and Finlandia being part of the family, it's never too tough for Brown-Forman to regroup.

### Verizon Communications (VZ)

For the two companies to be seemingly so similar to one another, it's amazing that AT&T (NYSE:T) and primary rival Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) are able to dish out such different results for shareholders. But, numbers don't lie. For the past twelve months, VZ stock is up nearly 10%, while T shares are down almost 19%.

The mismatched results may largely reflect a less aggressive approach being taken by Verizon to stake a claim in the ever-changing world of video entertainment.

Whereas AT&T swung for the fences with its acquisition of Time Warner -- and arguably overextended itself -- Verizon's not been as quick to wade into waters that were less than clear. That's made a big difference with investors, even if it's only a perceived difference.

### Bank of America (BAC)

Don't misread the message. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is anything but resistant to economic cycles. Indeed, it's uncomfortably sensitive to changes in interest rates… just one of many stumbling blocks it must navigate from time to time. But, if you can deal with the occasional setback and are willing to ride out the rough patches, B of A may be one of the best stocks to own for the long haul.

That wasn't necessarily always the case. More so than others, Bank of America struggled to work its way out of the subprime mortgage funk, struggling with the earliest of its so-called stress tests.

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger though, and at the same time Bank of America finally started clicking with the Federal Reserve, CEO Brian Moynihan was able to cut costs to the bone. What's left is a lean, mean banking machine that could merely coast for years to come and still be a top name to own.

### Church & Dwight (CHD)

Finally, although Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is usually the suggested 'forever' pick from the consumer staples sector, investors may want to instead consider smaller rival Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) as one of the best stocks to invest in from this particular sector.

You know the company better than you think you do. This is the organization that owns brand names like Arm & Hammer, Oxi-Clean, Orajel, Waterpik and more. It didn't used to have the marketing firepower P&G did, but changes in the way consumers evaluate and purchase goods now has leveled the playing field, so to speak.

The end result is an organization that only once in the past ten years has quarterly revenue fallen on a year-over-year basis. Income growth has been almost as impressive, even if not quite as consistent as top-line progress.

This is the promise of sustainable investing, one of the trendiest strategies on Wall Street, but one where the effectiveness remains highly debated and skepticism about long-term performance is preventing even more broad-based adoption.

Since then, Sprint's shares have lost more than a fifth of their value amid questions about how the company can compete effectively under the weight of its long-term debt of more than $32 billion.  Sprint's majority owner, SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), has been looking to trim its debt, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) as of the end of December.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sprint-t-mobile-restart-deal-170414117.html?.tsrc=rss
