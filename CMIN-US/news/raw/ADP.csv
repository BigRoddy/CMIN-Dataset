Mizuho Says ADP Ready To Grow, Sets Price Target At $210	"Human capital management (HCM) solutions company Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ: ADP) has a clear path to grow after Mizuho Securities analysts surveyed HCM executives. The ADP Analyst: Dan Dolev initiated coverage of Automatic Data Processing's stock with a Buy rating and a $210 price target. The ADP Thesis: Mizuho analysts surveyed more than 100 executives across SMBs (small and midsize businesses) to large enterprises to gauge the HCM market and the products workplaces are using, Dolev wrote in the note. The results make it clear the company emerged from a 2017 proxy battle with Bill Ackman's Pershing Square in a much better position. ADP has gained or maintained market share across three of the four major categories it operates in. The three segments include tax services, talent and benefits, while payroll remains challenged. Related Link: Benzinga's Top Ratings Upgrades, Downgrades For February 11, 2021 By segment, ADP gained a ""considerable"" market share in enterprise tax services products. The company's market share rose from the high 30% range five years ago to a mid-40% range today. Similar to taxes, ADP's talent services market share rose from the high-teens five years ago to a mid-20% range today, the analyst wrote. The company's success in benefits is not as strong, but the company appears to have ""staunched market share losses."" Finally, the company has seen share loss in payroll, but the survey encouragingly highlights areas of success, especially in other product categories.

(NASDAQ:ADP) is trading at $164.79, after a 0.16% gain. However, over the past month, the stock fell by 5.19%, and in the past year, by 5.84%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session. The stock is currently above from its 52 week low by 59.82%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with IT Services stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year. View more earnings on ADP The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings. Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Automatic Data Processing Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 78.89 of the IT Services industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. There are many limitations to P/E ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings.

2021-01-27	2021-01-27 12:19:10	ADP	Automatic Data Processing, Inc.	Automatic Data Processing's Debt Overview	Over the past three months, shares of Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) rose by 2.09%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Automatic Data Processing has. Automatic Data Processing's Debt According to the Automatic Data Processing's most recent balance sheet as reported on October 30, 2020, total debt is at $1.99 billion, with $1.99 billion in long-term debt and $0.00 in current debt. Adjusting for $1.61 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $380.80 million. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Automatic Data Processing has $42.39 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.05. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-01-26	2021-01-26 15:22:03	ADP	Automatic Data Processing, Inc.	Earnings Outlook for Automatic Data Processing	"Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) announces its next round of earnings this Wednesday, January 27. Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Wednesday's Q2 earnings announcement. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Based on management's projections, Automatic Data Processing analysts model for earnings of $1.29 per share on sales of $3.57 billion. Automatic Data Processing EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $1.52. Revenue was $3.67 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on ADP If the company were to match the consensus estimate, earnings would be down 15.13%. Revenue would be down 2.72% on a year-over-year basis. Here is how the company's reported EPS has compared to analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 EPS Estimate 0.98 0.96 1.89 1.45 EPS Actual 1.41 1.14 1.92 1.52 Revenue Estimate 3.28 B 3.29 B 4.03 B 3.69 B Revenue Actual 3.47 B 3.38 B 4.05 B 3.67 B Stock Performance Over the past 52-week period, shares of Automatic Data Processing have declined 3.4%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are probably a little upset going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Automatic Data Processing is scheduled to hold the call at 08:30:00 ET and can be accessed here.

Therefore, today we introduce seven “Dividend Aristocrats,” or businesses that have increased the base dividend every year for the past 25 years. According to metrics from S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), “Since 1926, dividends have contributed to approximately one-third of total return while capital appreciations have contributed two-thirds. Therefore, both sustainable dividend income and capital appreciation potential are important to total return expectations.” Over the past year, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has returned over 6%. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has increased by 5%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Solid businesses with wide moats tend to be able to generate stable revenues and strong cash flows in most years, even in volatile times or recessions. In fact, many such firms end up gaining market share at the expense of weaker businesses that might simply fight to stay alive during economically tough times. Meanwhile, companies that consistently grow dividends are in effect saying that they are committed to sharing the success of the business with stockholders. With that information, here are seven Dividend Aristocrats that deserve your attention in 2021: 7 Airline Stocks Being Fueled by Vaccine News AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) Chubb (NYSE:CB) Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (BACS:NOBL) Sysco (NYSE:SYY) Dividend Aristocrats: AbbVie (ABBV) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $62.55 – $113.41 1-year price change: Up 23.82% Dividend yield: 4.71% Illinois-based biopharma group AbbVie is our first Dividend Aristocrat. It has numerous research and development (R&D) centers and manufacturing facilities globally. Several of its therapeutic areas include eye care, gastroenterology, immunology, neuroscience, oncology, rheumatology, virology, and women’s health. In addition, its Allergan Aesthetics portfolio includes products, such as Botox Cosmetics, fillers, and implants. The last quarterly report showed non-GAAP adjusted net revenues of $12.882 billion, an increase of 4.1% year-over-year (YoY). Net earnings of $2.31 billion meant an increase of 22.5% YoY. Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.83, up 21% YoY. Cash and equivalents stood at $7.89 billion. CEO Richard A. Gonzalez cited, “Results from key growth products – including Skyrizi, Rinvoq and Ubrelvy – continue to track ahead of our expectations, our aesthetics portfolio is demonstrating a strong V-shaped recovery, our hematologic-oncology franchise is delivering double-digit growth and we’re advancing numerous attractive late-stage pipeline programs.” The company has in-demand therapies and products that contribute to revenue growth. AbbVie’s pipeline also deserves attention. I’d regard any drop in price as an opportunity to buy the shares. Albemarle (ALB) Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $48.89 – $187.25 1-year price change: Up 124.84% Dividend yield: 0.89% Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle produces specialty chemicals used in a wide range of products manufactured by pharmaceutical companies, agricultural companies, water treatment companies, electronics products manufacturers, refineries, and others. In 2020, Albemarle caught investors’ attention as it is the industry leader in lithium, used to make electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Consumers’ love for EVs translated to a jump in the ALB share price. Investors believe the new administration in Washington will continue to provide tailwinds for the renewable energy sector. Q3 results announced in early November showed net sales of $747 million, down by 15% YoY. Net income was $98.3 million and decreased 36.6%. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.09 showed a decline of 28.8% YoY. CEO Kent Masters said, “We now expect to realize approximately $80 million of cost savings this year and to reach an annual savings rate of $120 million or more by the end of 2021. We expect these savings to represent a first wave of ongoing operational improvements that will reap notable benefits for the company.” 8 Indian Stocks That Belong on Your International Radar ALB stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 48.39x and 6x, respectively. As a result of the recent run-up in price, the valuation metrics are overstretched. Potential investors could consider investing around $170. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $103.11 – $182.32 1-year price change: Down 7.87% Dividend yield: 2.31% Roseland, New Jersey-based Automatic Data Processing provides cloud-based human capital management (HCM) solutions such as human resources (HR) payroll, tax, and benefits administration, as well as business outsourcing services. The company tends to generate steady, recurring revenue. However, 2020 has also meant challenges due to job losses stateside, which has meant revenue loss for the group. According to the most recent quarterly metrics, revenues came at $3.5 billion, down by 1% YoY. Adjusted net earnings of $605 million showed an increase of 4%. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.41 and increased by 5%. CFO Kathleen Winters commented, “Our first quarter results significantly exceeded our expectations across the board… While we still expect to face headwinds over the course of the year, we will continue to look for ways to drive strong performance in both the near and long-term.” Forward P/E and P/S ratios are 27.9x and 4.81x, respectively. Despite the recent decline in price, I believe the shares are still richly valued for the current environment. A potential decline would improve the margin of safety. Emerson Electric (EMR) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $37.75 – $84.44 1-year price change: Up 6.29% Dividend yield: 2.44% St Louis, Missouri-based Emerson Electric is a technology and engineering company. The group focuses on Automation Solutions (manufacturing electrical components and providing services and training) and Commercial & Residential Solutions (covering heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration). FY20 Q4 metrics released in early November showed GAAP net sales of $4.6 billion, down 8% YoY. Net earnings were $723 million, up 1% YoY. Adjusted EPS came at $1.10, down 4%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.02 billion and increased 2%. CEO David N. Farr commented, “Amidst all the challenges, we exceeded our second quarter reset financial forecast in sales, EBITDA, and cash flow… We also continued to invest and took bold action to build on our innovation and technology footprint of the future, with three strategic acquisitions: American Governor, Open Systems International Inc. and Progea.” 9 Beginner Stocks for First-Time Investors EMR stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 25.5x and 2.99x, respectively. Emerson Electric’s automation division currently has significant exposure to the traditional energy (i.e., oil and gas) industry. However, it is also growing its alternative energy (i.e., clean fuels and renewables) businesses. Any decline below $80, especially toward $75, would offer a good entry point into the engineering group. Chubb (CB) Source: thodonal88 / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $87.35 – $167.74 1-year price change: Up 1.66% Dividend yield: 2% Chubb is one of the largest publicly traded property and casualty insurance companies worldwide. 2020 has meant challenges for the industry. The pandemic, hurricanes, flooding, flooding, and civil unrest have meant increased insurance claims. However, the company’s operations stood the test of times. The most recent quarterly earnings showed revenue of $9.46 billion, up 4.6% YoY. Net income was $1.19 billion, an increase of 9.4%. Diluted EPS was $2.63, up by 10.5%. Operating cash flow was $3.5 billion. CEO Evan G. Greenberg cited, “With strong and continuously improving underwriting conditions in most all regions of the world, we grew P&C (property and casualty) net premiums written 6.5% in the quarter in constant dollars, comprised of 10.8% growth in our commercial P&C business and a 3.3% decline in consumer lines … we expect to grow our EPS through both revenue growth and improved margins.” The fact that Chubb was able to grow its premiums written in 2020 makes it stand out among insurers. I believe the shares could find a place in most long-term portfolios. ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $48.62 – $81.96 1-year price change: Up 1.31% Dividend yield: 1.25% Expense ratio: 0.35% Our next choice is an exchange-traded fund (ETF), namely the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF. It focuses on the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index comprised of businesses that have grown dividends for decades, not just for 25 consecutive years. The fund, which started trading in September 2013, has 65 holdings. Total net assets of the fund are around $6.2 billion. As far as sector allocations are concerned, Industrials leads the ETF with 24.03%, followed by Consumer Staples (18.78%), and Materials (13.19%). The top ten names, with approximately equal weights, make up around 20% of net assets. Albemarle, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), AbbVie, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) head the roster. 10 Smart Stocks to Buy With $5,000 NOBL returned 6% in the past 52 weeks. I believe any decline in the price of the fund during this earnings season would make it a good buy for long-term portfolios. Sysco (SYY) Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $26 – $84.12 1-year price change: Down 8.58% Dividend yield: 2.35% Houston, Texas-based Sysco sells food products and related equipment to restaurants, health care facilities, hotels, and educational facilities. It has about 57,000 employees in over 300 distribution facilities worldwide. The customer count exceeds 620,000. Needless to say, 2002 was a difficult year as many of those customers had to scale down operations due to the pandemic. Sysco released FY21 Q1 metrics in early November. Sales were $11.8 billion, a decrease of 23.0% YoY. Non-GAAP net earnings were $173.5 million, down by 66.0%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was 34 cents, a decline of 65.3% CEO Kevin Hourican said, “Although our first quarter 2021 results continue to be impacted by the pandemic, we are pleased with our overall expense management and our ability to produce positive free cash flow and a profitable quarter despite a 23% reduction in sales.” A potential decline toward $70 would offer better long-term value. In the coming quarters, as economies recover and cities and countries go back to normal, Sysco’s operations are likely to recover as well.

2021-01-13	2021-01-13 12:21:34	ADP	Automatic Data Processing, Inc.	What Does Automatic Data Processing's Debt Look Like?	Shares of Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) rose by 15.13% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Automatic Data Processing has.Automatic Data Processing's Debt According to the Automatic Data Processing's most recent financial statement as reported on October 30, 2020, total debt is at $1.99 billion, with $1.99 billion in long-term debt and $0.00 in current debt. Adjusting for $1.61 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $380.80 million.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Automatic Data Processing has $42.39 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.05. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2020-08-05	2020-08-05 20:16:30	ADP	Automatic Data Processing, Inc.	What To Expect From July Unemployment Data: Economists Forecast Slowing Recovery	National unemployment numbers for July are set to be released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and experts are expecting an increase in the unemployment rate.  Early July Predictions: According to a labor report for July released by Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ: ADP), private sector employment saw an increase of 167,000 jobs.Small and large businesses are seeing an increase in employment count, while midsize businesses are seeing a noticeable decrease in employment numbers.&quot;The labor market recovery slowed in the month of July,&quot; Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said in the report. Professional/business services, education and health services and trade/transportation/utilities have seen the largest increase in employment, according to ADP. The financial industry experienced the largest employment decrease, the report said. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US LLP, said he expects the national unemployment rate increase to 11.5% for the month of July. Fed Data Points To Slowdown: On Tuesday, the St. Louis Federal Reserve released data on economic conditions and employment.Since the week of June 12, the recovery in employment has slowed down and slightly reverted, according to the Fed district. Areas of the economy that have been touted as rebounding are starting to slow as well: construction employment numbers saw a decrease in employment. Construction was one of the first industries to reopen following widespread stay-at-home orders. Why This Week Is Important: All eyes will be on Washington, D.C. this week as negotiations for a second stimulus bill wrap up. With the $600 unemployment benefit now expired, we should find out in the coming weeks if it will be replaced -- and if the government Payment Protection Plan is extended.See more from Benzinga  * What A Census Effort Cut Short Could Mean For The Data  * American Income Drops While Spending Increases: Breaking Down The Numbers  * Buckle Up For Thursday's GDP Forecast: What To Expect(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-05	2020-08-05 20:06:00	ADP	Automatic Data Processing, Inc.	Dow books 373-point gain, Nasdaq marks 31st record and S&P 500 ends 1.7% from its all-time high as everything rallies	U.S. stocks ended at or near records Wednesday, with the S&P 500 finishing within a stone's throw of its February all-time high and the Nasdaq Composite notching its 31st record high of 2020. Hope of further stimulus from the U.S. government to help out-of-work Americans was attributed to some of the upbeat trade on Wall street, even as some of the data have come in weaker than expected, setting the stage for a jobs report on Friday that may underscore that a rise in infections of COVID-19 stalled out some of the recent resurgence in business activity created by social-distancing measures to contain the virus. Payroll provider Automatic Data Processing Inc. also said only 167,000 private-sector jobs were created in July, far short of the 1.88 million forecast by economists polled by Econoday. However, a reading of services from the Institute for Supply Management service sector index jumped to a reading of 58.1 in July, beating expectations and signalling stronger economic growth. Deal activity also sparked some optimism as Teladoc Health Inc.  and Livongo Health Inc.  said Wednesday they have agreed to merge in a deal valued at $18.5 billion to create a company that can serve a spectrum of health needs, using virtual care. A nearly 9% surge in shares of Walt Disney Co.  following its quarterly results, also helped to lift the Dow and the broader market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed up about 373 points, or 1.4%, at 27,201, representing its highest closing level since June 8. The S&P 500 index  finished 0.6% higher at around 3,328, putting the broad-market benchmark 1.71% off its Feb. 19 record high at 3,386.15, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed up 0.5% to 10,992, briefly touching the psychologically round-number level at 11,000 intraday and marking another record finish. The tech-heavy index has closed higher six straight sessions. Gaines for equities also came as gold prices finished at a record near 2,050, based on futures for December delivery , highlighting some concerns about the pace of stock gains and the outsize sums that governments have doled out to limit the harm from the COVID-19 pandemic.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/52d3b0a6-2d9e-392c-8f08-8d0985c8da20/dow-books-373-point-gain%2C.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-23	2020-07-23 17:44:53	ADP	Automatic Data Processing, Inc.	We’re All in Big Trouble Without Renewed Jobless Benefits	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.S. has made many big mistakes in handling the coronavirus pandemic. But it got one big thing right. When the economy was collapsing amid fear of the virus, the federal government passed an unprecedented relief package. The centerpiece was what has come to be called pandemic unemployment insurance -- a $600 weekly payment to anyone who was out of work because of the coronavirus, on top of normal unemployment benefits. This became a lifeline for millions of Americans.Pandemic UI was so generous that poverty in the U.S. has actually gone down during the outbreak, despite a stunning spike in unemployment. This represents a monumental accomplishment, and it shows that a government renowned for partisan gridlock and dysfunction is still capable of flashes of effectiveness.Unfortunately, that bright spot seems like it might be short-lived. Pandemic UI is set to expire at the end of July, after which Congress will go on recess:If pandemic UI expires, millions of Americans will find themselves unable to pay rent or even buy groceries. Human suffering and social unrest will increase dramatically, while the drop in demand will further wound the already-struggling economy.Leaders are discussing an emergency short-term extension of the benefits. But this won’t be enough to avert an interruption in payments because the state agencies that administer the program will need time to update their systems. Even if there’s a patch, a great many Americans will have to re-apply for benefits. That’s going to be a source of extreme hassle, anxiety and fear for millions. State unemployment systems weren’t set up to handle this many claimants, and getting the money often involves standing in long lines and waiting weeks to know if your benefits have been denied. Many people fall through the cracks in the system and never get the benefits they deserve; those who won that grim lottery back in March and April will now be forced to roll the dice again.And even if pandemic UI is renewed for the time being, cuts to the program may be on the horizon. Many conservatives are troubled because the benefits sometimes pay unemployed people more than their old jobs did. That seems like an obvious incentive for workers not to go back to work. The cost of the program, which has helped raise the U.S. federal debt to all-time highs, is also causing sticker shock. To address both of these issues, Republicans have proposed lowering benefits from $600 a week to $400.But conservatives’ concerns are probably unfounded. For one thing, the national debt is hardly an issue at this point. With yields on 30-year Treasuries at less than 1.5%, the federal government can easily shoulder the additional debt. And because coronavirus is a one-time occurrence, pandemic UI doesn’t create long-term structural deficits. This is the worst possible time for austerity.As for whether pandemic UI is discouraging people from going back to work, although this is reasonable in theory, evidence shows that it’s also not much of a concern at this point. If pandemic UI were causing a shortage of workers, we’d expect to see wages rising, as companies tried to lure workers back. But median wages are little changed. And data from human-resources management company Automatic Data Processing Inc. shows that workers were much more likely to face wage cuts or freezes this May than they were in May 2019.Job vacancies are also down relative to the number of unemployed workers, suggesting that companies aren’t being forced to work very hard to find employees. Most top economists now agree that a lack of labor demand, rather than unwillingness to work, is the reason unemployment is high:Why would paying people not to work have so little effect on unemployment? One possible reason is that the headache and risk of applying for unemployment benefits is less attractive than the stability of a job. The possibility that Congress will cut off benefits, or make people re-apply, is another reason to want a steady job instead of a government check that might end on short notice. Finally, pandemic UI is probably acting as a fiscal stimulus, sustaining aggregate demand and thus boosting general demand for labor.So although paying people not to work is a bad idea in normal times, in the current crisis situation it looks like it’s safe to do. If Congress is so concerned about the disincentive effects of pandemic UI, it could let people keep some of the benefits if they later return to work, thus removing the incentive to stay at home. But given the evidence that pandemic UI isn’t raising unemployment, the easiest course of action would just be to renew the full $600 benefit for a few more months. The program has its flaws, but it has been the most effective thing the U.S. government has done in response to this crisis.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Noah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Bank of America Double-Downgrades Square on Fear Small Businesses Will Fold	(Bloomberg) -- Bank of America double-downgraded payments stock Square Inc. to underperform from buy on concern small and medium businesses like restaurants, retailers and salons will struggle to stay afloat once they’ve spent government Covid-19 crisis funds.“A significant number” of small and medium outfits may struggle to survive, especially if the U.S. economy only partially reopens and firms are limited to 25% to 50% occupancy, analyst Jason Kupferberg wrote in a note.“The extent of SMB churn is hard to quantify, and likely won’t be known for perhaps another 6 months, but we note that 75% of Square’s payment volume comes from merchants with less $500,000 in annual card volumes,” he said.He also flagged Square’s 26% rally so far this year, which compares with a 9% decline for the S&P 500. The stock may have “moved too far and too fast relative to its near-term fundamental prospects,” he said.In the same note, Kupferberg also became the sole bear on payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc., cutting his rating to underperform from neutral due to “extreme stress on employment markets.” ADP is exposed to the current recession not just because of the number of employees on its clients’ payrolls, he said, but also in terms of client retention, new bookings and lower float income.He added that Paychex Inc.’s business update call on Tuesday may be a “negative catalyst” for ADP, as Paychex will probably pre-announce a guidance miss for the quarter ended May 31. Kupferberg rates Paychex underperform too, as 99% of its revenue comes from U.S. small and medium businesses averaging 16 employees.Square pared a decline of as much as 2.5% in early Monday trading, while ADP nearly erased a gain of as much as 2% and Paychex rose as much as 4%.

2020-05-08	2020-05-08 16:45:02	ADP	Automatic Data Processing, Inc.	Shopify’s Premium Is a Symptom of Our Social Disconnect	Undoubtedly, one of the biggest surprises of this year is Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). At a time when the discretionary retail segment has been gutted, the online merchant platform has defied all expectations. If positive momentum continues, Shopify stock will soon double in value on a year-to-date basis. Even factoring in that its online business caters fortuitously well to the shutdowns imposed by the novel coronavirus, SHOP is an extreme anomaly.Source: Jirapong Manustrong / Shutterstock.com However, some fundamental justification exists for its tremendous surge. Primarily, the company delivered a blisteringly positive first-quarter earnings report, especially considering the broader context. Heading into the disclosure, covering analysts expected SHOP to produce an earnings loss of 18 cents per share. Instead, it delivered an earnings per share of 19 cents, obliterating the consensus target.Additionally, SHOP generated revenue of $470 million, up 47% from the year-ago quarter. This also beat analysts' expectations, which called for $443.2 million.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven more impressive, though, was gross merchandise volume from merchant customers, which increased 46% to $17.4 billion. This beat the consensus target of $16.83 billion by a wide margin. In particular, GMV of apparel and accessories normalized by April following softness in mid-March. Not surprisingly, Shopify stock skyrocketed on the announcement.  * 10 Key Stocks to Watch Over the Next Few Months However, a growing chorus of analysts are expressing skepticism toward SHOP's upside potential. With valuations at nosebleed levels, it seems almost foolish to buy Shopify stock now. Moreover, so many investments are trading at rock-bottom prices.Plus, it's important to contrast Shopify's Q1 results with recent results from Target (NYSE:TGT). The big-box retailer saw a huge spike in groceries (as you would expect) but a decline in discretionary items.Can you still trust Shopify stock? Sort of. Shopify Stock Makes Sense for NowI understand the common argument against SHOP. Recently, the Department of Labor revealed that 3.2 million workers filed for unemployment benefits for the week ending May 2. Over the course of seven weeks, the number of initial jobless claims filed has totaled over 33 million.If that wasn't scary enough, every indicator is screaming that the labor market has suffered cataclysmic damage. Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) reported that the private sector shed more than 20 million jobs in April. Therefore, the very idea of people buying anything other than food, water, and other essentials seems absurd.More to the point, Shopify's reported increases in GMV for apparel and accessories runs counter to both intuition and hard economic data.Yet to understand the seemingly discordant rise of Shopify stock, you must ask a difficult question: who does the coronavirus impact the most?Logically, most of the nominal job losses have come from more easily replaceable, low-income positions. Further, the Pew Research Center disclosed that Covid-19 has disproportionately impacted communities of color, specifically Hispanics and African Americans.  Click to Enlarge Source: Data from Pew Research Center When you look at the trends, they're jarring. Between March and April, the percentage of Hispanics that reported they or someone in their household suffered a job or wage loss increased 49% to 61%. For African Americans, the metric increased from 36% to 44%.So, what does this have to do with Shopify stock? Everything, as I'll explain below. SHOP Is an Economic BarometerAccording to the Dallas Morning News, race in America still matters. In a blunt but relevant discussion, journalist Mitchell Schnurman argues that white workers still get more of the good jobs. As an aside, I find it remarkable that this article was written in January of this year. In my opinion, Schnurman really got the essence of why Shopify stock is so hot today.Having established that white workers typically tend to be higher-paid employees than their non-white counterparts, it's only logical that Shopify has yet to be fully impacted by the coronavirus. According to a 2015 survey by ThinkNow Research, on average, white consumers spent the most money online of all races/ethnicities.As Schnurman would likely say, they can afford it. Since the initial wave of job losses impacted low-income jobs, white workers have been relatively insulated. Thus, many apparently got through this period of quarantining with retail therapy, thereby bolstering Shopify stock.Is SHOP a buy then? Absolutely not! Because at some point, you got to figure that the coronavirus impact will soon hit high-paying positions, which largely affect white workers.According to the New York Times' contributors Patricia Cohen and Tiffany Hsu, that might be already happening. As they worryingly wrote:While restaurant, travel, hospitality and retail workers were among the first to lose their jobs, layoffs have become more widespread in recent weeks, affecting engineers at Uber, advertising account executives at Omnicom, designers at Airbnb and other office employees.Therefore, I fully expect the Hispanic and African American job loss rate to decline moving forward, with the proportion of impacted white workers increasing. How Shopify responds to the gradual loss of white consumers will be the real test of its resilience. Fundamentals Will Soon Make SenseFor those who are screaming that Shopify stock doesn't make fundamental sense, I hear you. Eventually, SHOP will reflect whatever is the true health of the underlying economy. If high-paying jobs remain largely unaffected by Covid-19, then shares deserve their rich valuation.But I doubt it. We can't have an economy where only the well-to-do have everything and everyone else has nothing. After all, big business has to sell their crap to somebody. When those somebodies no longer exist, that's when you start having serious problems.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

2020-05-05	2020-05-05 11:12:34	ADP	Automatic Data Processing, Inc.	In the Pandemic Era, Hiring Gets Automated	(Bloomberg) -- Tara Lindstrom doesn’t know when she’ll be able to fully reopen the 56 restaurants she runs across California and Utah. But the minute coronavirus restrictions lift, she wants to be ready.“Every day we think, when are we going to be done with this?” said Lindstrom, whose restaurant sales are down between 30% and 60% since March 16, when California was ordered to shelter in place. “It’s been one punch after the next.”As city and state officials are beginning to reopen their economies, Lindstrom’s biggest challenge is bringing back about two-thirds of the 1,000 employees at her Jamba Juice, Carl’s Jr. and Pieology franchises who haven’t worked in about seven weeks. But many are students who may have moved back home and workers who might have found jobs elsewhere or can’t leave their kids at home without childcare. And with Jamba Juice’s peak summer season approaching, she could be looking to fill lots of new positions.Lindstrom plans to start ramping up hiring this month and to “have our new normal by July 1,” she said. “You can’t train people in a day, so you have to just project out and prepare so we can be ready to go.”To hasten the task--while reducing physical contact during the pandemic-- Lindstrom has moved the hiring process almost entirely online. She’s tapped a San Francisco-based tech startup called Workstream, which helps automate the hiring of hourly and gig-economy workers for nearly 5,000 managers at companies including Uber Technologies Inc., Marriott International Inc., Chick-fil-A Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.’s third-party delivery operators.Workstream operates like a silent machine turning the gears of a company’s recruiting process from start to finish. The software integrates with online job boards. Applicants receive a string of automated, tailored screening questions via text messages that make it feel like they’re chatting with a company recruiter. Those the company deems a good fit pick an interview time slot by text. In the Covid-19 era, most conversations are conducted by phone or video chat. Jobseekers complete paperwork on their mobile devices. The whole process can be done within a few hours.“We use data and AI so businesses can save time and do more with less, and so hourly workers won’t get lost in the process,” said Workstream co-founder Desmond Lim.Hiring has been moving online for years and funding for startups making human resources software rose to $6.7 billion last year, more than double in 2017, according to CB Insights. Workstream, which just raised $10 million from investors including the Founders Fund, Charles River Ventures, and Basis Set Ventures said its niche is recruiting and retaining hourly workers. That group has been among the hardest hit after restaurants and retailers shut their doors and people no longer hire cars to drive them to work. Other startups in the field, such as  Lever and Greenhouse, mostly focus on white-collar jobs, while Instawork and Wonolo connect workers with businesses for short-term gigs, rather than full-time employment. Workstream says the global health outbreak has also made the shift toward automation feel more urgent for its customers who are rushing to get comfortable with screening, interviewing, hiring and training a new worker remotely, without as much as a handshake. In mid-March, Amazon was still holding packed recruiting events in person. After images and a report by Bloomberg  about the lack of safety precautions made the rounds on Twitter, Amazon moved all new hire events and orientations to virtual platforms.More than 30 million people in the U.S. have filed for unemployment since mid-March, and when restaurants and retailers can come back online, they’re going to have to move fast, said Ravin Jesuthasan, managing director at consultancy Willis Towers Watson.“Companies have no other choice but to be resilient,” Jesuthasan said. “Automation is something we've been talking about for 50 years, but it took a pandemic to change people’s minds about ingrained habits like requiring face-to-face interviews,” he said.Being ready to bounce back quickly is paramount to businesses like King Courier, one of Amazon’s third-party delivery service partners in the San Francisco Bay area.Before the pandemic hit, the average King Courier driver would make 250 daily deliveries and would last about five months in the job, “so we’re always hiring,” said Chief Operating Officer Andrew Brady. But with Amazon prioritizing essential goods and implementing social distancing in its warehouses, demand for King Courier’s drivers waned. “For the first time ever, we had more capacity than Amazon could use,” he said.Meanwhile, applications are up by 75% and drivers are eager to work. That’s a change from before the pandemic, Brady said, recounting a former employee who left for “a $30-an-hour job at Twitter where he just had to make sure the conference rooms had warm coffee and neatly-placed notebooks.” Now, Brady is leaning on Workstream to increase staff by eight times in a matter of weeks. “Ramp up times for Amazon are very aggressive and we have to be prepared,” Brady said.Workstream’s Lim is familiar with the difficulties of hourly workers, from both sides of the equation. His father is a driver and his mother a cleaner. Lim, 34, ran a restaurant before working on Wall Street and launched Workstream in 2017 after seeing how much time managers wasted on scheduling interviews with job applicants who didn’t use email.But the company is facing some well-entrenched rivals: Human resource software leaders like Automatic Data Processing Inc. and Workday Inc. dominate the industry and many businesses that have been using their software for years are reticent to switch providers. The pandemic has also led to a slowdown in new software adoption as companies try to reduce costs and avoid the disruptions that come from trying out new things. And even if social distancing has put an end to in-person interviews for now, some hiring managers may not be won over the the practice enough to continue after regulations lift. In the first quarter of this year, the number of deals in HR tech dropped by nearly a third from a year ago, according to CB Insights.Workstream is adapting with new features to help managers in tight spots. For businesses unsure of future hiring plans, the software allows them to funnel potential employees into a reserve pool for later. The moment a position opens up, the manager can push a button and send a text message to the whole database to see who is still interested. Since their details and paperwork are already saved, hiring can move faster.Other new features include remote Covid-19 safety training and batch hiring, where, for example, a restaurant could split its staff into three distinct groups who never come into contact with one another. That way if one employee gets sick, it won’t risk infecting the whole staff and rendering the business inoperable.Workstream helped Envoy America,  a ride-sharing company for senior citizens, screen for better applicants and reduce its 40-day hiring process to an average of 18 days, said recruiting manager Sheri Thueson. “We need to make sure grandma is in good hands and it turns out you can screen for compassion in the language people use in their texts.”Envoy’s business dropped during the pandemic, but seniors still need to get to doctor’s appointments and dialysis treatments. The company has seen a flood of new applicants from Lyft Inc., Uber and other drivers who can’t find work. Forecasting a business pickup in June, Envoy is using Workstream to collect a pipeline of drivers on demand “so as soon as the situation improves, we can pick up the process right where we left off,” Thueson said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pandemic-era-hiring-manager-now-111234682.html?.tsrc=rss

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  opened down 889 points, or 4%, at 21,053, the S&P 500 index  retreated 3.7% at 2,488, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  gave up 3.1% to reach 7,469. Markets are coming off of their worst monthly losses since the 2008 financial crisis. And investors appear to be attempting to come to grips with the prospect of a long slog from out of the morass of a viral outbreak that is pushing the domestic and global economy into a recession. The White House on Tuesday released new projections for 100,000 to 240,000 deaths in the U.S. from the coronavirus pandemic even if current social-distancing guidelines are maintained. Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases world-wide rose to 862,234 on Wednesday, while the number of deaths rose to 42,404 according to aggregated data from Johns Hopkins University. In economic news, Automatic Data Processing  reported the U.S. economy shed 27,000 private-sector jobs in March, though the data is expected to be of little use in predicting the official unemployment numbers due on Friday due to distortions created by the pandemic.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/bb985e44-adc4-3051-b394-833824ab170c/dow-skids-nearly-900-points.html?.tsrc=rss

It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]When the stock market marches higher, it pushes the prices of many companies higher along with it. But as investors bid up good and bad businesses alike, that can make it hard to discern which companies are the best dividend stocks for long-term investors.In this income-centric world, income-starved investors face great temptation to reach for high-dividend stocks that offer juicy yields. Fortunately, Simply Safe Dividends identified the nine best dividend growth stocks that investors can rely on for secure, fast-growing income.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese companies all have very healthy Dividend Safety Scores, which measure a firm's most important financial metrics to gauge how likely it is to cut its dividend in the future.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 Let's take a look at nine of the safest dividend stocks in the market. These dividend-paying companies generate excellent free cash flow, maintain safe payout ratios, are committed to rewarding shareholders with healthy dividend increases and have bright long-term outlooks. Lowe's Companies (LOW)Dividend Yield: 2%  Year-to-Date Gain: 18.7%Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) is the world's second-largest home improvement retailer.With more than 65 years of operations, this dividend stock has gained recognition as one of the trusted national brands. Over the years, Lowe's has developed an extensive line of thousands of products for maintenance, repair, remodeling and decorating across lumber and building materials, tools and hardware, lawn and garden, paint, kitchens, outdoor power equipment and home fashion categories.The company serves a wide spectrum of &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; and &quot;do-it-for-me&quot; customers, including homeowners, renters and professional contractors from different construction trades.A large footprint of conveniently located stores across the U.S., an extensive range of products, a well-known brand and a diversified customer base are Lowe's key competitive advantages.The home improvement industry is also poised to grow as consumer confidence remains high, employment continues rising and home prices climb higher. This should lead to better growth prospects for the company and its dividend.Lowe's has an impeccable record of not only paying but also increasing its dividend since 1961, growing it by over 20% annually in the last five years. Lowe's price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.6 seems reasonable for a company of this quality. Honeywell International (HON)Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2%  YTD Gain:  38%Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) is a diversified global technology and manufacturing company supplying industrial products, software and services to a diversified set of customers.  Honeywell operates through four segments: aerospace; home and building technologies; performance materials and technologies and safety and productivity solutions.The company serves customers through a wide variety of products and services in aerospace, control, sensing and security. It also sells specialty chemicals and advanced materials as well as energy efficiency products.Simply put, Honeywell has invented key technologies that address some of the world's most critical challenges around energy, safety, security, productivity and urbanization. With a broad portfolio of physical products and software, the company has uniquely positioned itself to sell comprehensive solutions for homes and businesses across many industries.A broad portfolio of technology, extensive products and services, a global distribution network, and a presence in growing areas like the Internet of Things and energy efficiency are Honeywell's key strengths.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 A track record of strong financial performance and a healthy payout ratio have enabled the company to grow its dividend by 13% per year over the last five years. Honeywell has paid uninterrupted dividends for more than two decades. Apple (AAPL)Source: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.17%  YTD Gain: 67%Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the world's most valuable companies and one of the largest positions in Warren Buffett's dividend stock portfolio.Apple is the world's second-largest smartphone company, accounting for more than 10% of the global market share. The iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV are Apple's key products, with the iPhone representing over the majority of its 2018 sales. These products are globally recognized for their high quality, premium brand and ease-of-use, allowing Apple to enjoy substantial pricing power.In addition, the company also owns a portfolio of consumer and professional software such as iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems that act as key differentiators. Apple's products and solutions are known for their innovative design, user-friendly experience and seamless integration.All these innovative products have established Apple's supremacy in the mobile space, and the company invests around 5% of its revenues on R&D activities to stay ahead of competitors.Moreover, only Apple devices run iOS, which means that if customers want to remain within the Apple ecosystem, they must continue buying iOS devices. This results in sticky customer relationships. Its sales of games, music and other digital content through the iTunes store is another high-margin cash flow stream that keeps growing every year.A leading brand name, global geographical presence, impressive product portfolio and super-sticky customer relationships have helped form a huge moat around Apple's business.Apple started paying dividends again in 2012 and it has seen its payout grow by approximately 11% annually over the last three years.Given Apple's leading market share, loyal customers, innovative products and hoard of cash on the balance sheet, the company should continue raising its dividend at a strong pace in the future as well. Medtronic (MDT)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.00%  YTD Gain: 20%Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a leading medical technology, services and solutions company serving hospitals, physicians, clinicians and patients worldwide.

Some of Medtronic's key innovations include the world's smallest pacemaker and artificial pancreas.As a leader in medical technology and solutions, Medtronic stands to benefit from growing healthcare needs as the global population ages. The business also benefits from meaningful barriers to entry created by various regulations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other government agencies.Thanks to its product innovation and conservative management, the company has increased its dividend for 40 years in a row and last raised its dividend by 8% in June.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 Given the company's technology leadership and unmatched breadth and scale, Medtronic should be able to continue its dividend growth streak at a high-single-digit rate going forward.

It develops analog integrated circuits and embedded processors that are subsequently sold to electronics manufacturers.The company's product portfolio consists of tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices and managing and distributing power.Texas Instruments' focus on these segments provides a combination of stability and strong cash generation, owing to the products' long product life cycles and low capital-intensive manufacturing.Leading industry products, a diverse portfolio, unique technologies and manufacturing scale and a strong reputation enable Texas Instruments to generate stable and recurring cash flows.As a result, Texas Instruments has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1962 and it has recorded an impressive annual dividend growth rate of approximately 34.2% over the last three years.Last year marked the company's 14th consecutive year of dividend increases, wherein Texas Instruments raised its dividend by nearly 25%.Given its predictable cash flow generation, impressive dividend track record and reasonable payout ratio,, the company should be able to continue rewarding shareholders with double-digit dividend growth in the years ahead. Costco Wholesale (COST)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 0.9%  YTD Gain: 49%Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is a membership warehouse club with more than 500 U.S. store locations that provide merchandise at low prices to its members. Costco sells a wide range of products, including packaged foods, groceries, appliances, cleaning supplies, clothing and electronics.The company is the world's second-largest retailer by sales and it generates the majority of its sales in North America. Costco's membership base is growing with a renewal rate of over 90% as of its December 2018 quarter.Over its 35 years of existence, Costco has succeeded in providing a great customer experience by blending together the convenience of specialty departments and a selection of wide merchandise at affordable prices. It has become a trusted name owing to its low cost and quality merchandise.The company buys directly from many producers of national brand-name merchandise and sends products directly to its warehouses, eliminating multi-step distribution costs. High sales volumes, rapid inventory turnover, efficient distribution and self-service warehouse facilities also ensure high operational efficiency.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 A large and loyal customer base, economies of scale, a diverse mix of merchandise, and strategically-located warehouses are Costco's major competitive advantages.Analysts expect Costco's sales growth to sit in the mid-single-digits range over the long-term, which could result in 8%-9% annual earnings growth in the coming years. Costco could, therefore, continue its solid pace of dividend growth. American Tower (AMT)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.7%  YTD Gain: 33%American Tower (NYSE:AMT) is a leading owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The company was formed in 1995 as a unit of American Radio Systems and it was spun off in 1998 when that company merged with CBS Corporation.American Tower reports its results in five segments U.S. (59% of 2016 sales), Asia (14%), EMEA (9%) and Latin America (17%) property, and services (1%). It owns a portfolio of over 170,000 communications sites.American Tower leases space on its communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, government agencies and tenants in a number of industries. Its top tenants include well-known names like AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S).The real estate investment trust derives most of its revenue from tenant leases, which typically have an initial non-cancellable term of ten years with multiple renewal terms, as well as provisions for annual price increases. It is difficult for tenants to find suitable alternative sites and as such the lease renewal rates are generally high.Moreover, the incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively low and annual capital expenditures to maintain communications sites are also not high. All these factors provide high cash-flow visibility and excellent profitability for American Tower.American Tower should keep growing its earnings as demand for wireless services and data grows in the coming years. A global asset base, recession-proof demand for its sites, long-standing relationships with customers and low cash-flow volatility provide a moat around American Tower's business.Simply put, wireless tower companies possess many attractive qualities. That's probably why Crown Castle International (CCI), one of American Tower's peers, is a position in Bill Gates' dividend stock portfolio.Given American Tower's history of double-digit growth in property revenue and the near-tripling of its dividend in just the past five years, shareholders can likely expect at least 20% annual dividend growth in the years ahead. Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.23%  YTD Gain: 9%Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) is a global medical technology company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products.

Bard is also expected to create a stronger company in the future.Becton Dickinson is a dividend aristocrat with 46 years of consecutive dividend growth.

Weaker  than expected third-quarter results, reported on Aug. 1, sent SQ stock plunging. Moreover, fears about the overall economy have put further pressure on the equity.Source: Shutterstock However, amid these shorter-term struggles, SQ has shown the potential to become the most transformative company in tech since Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Netflix destroyed video stores and blunted the growth of pay-TV. In the same manner, Square's ecosystem could present a tough challenge to both traditional and newer financial-services firms.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More  SQ Stock Will Probably Suffer in the Shorter TermThe inverted yield curve has stoked fears of a recession. It has also left the market with numerous stocks that look appealing in the long-run but could also hammer investors in the shorter-term. Few equities illustrate that dynamic better than SQ stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe day after its Aug. 1 earnings report, SQ stock fell by 14% as the company delivered what some described as &quot;light earnings guidance&quot; for Q3. Before the results were issued, SQ closed at $80.98 per share.I warned investors in mid-July not to buy SQ stock until they knew that the shares could rise above the low-$80s per share level, which I believed was a potential ceiling. That upper bound held, and now  SQ stock is around $65 per share.After its recent drop, Square stock trades at a forward price-earnings (PE) ratio of about 58. From a certain point of view, it does not appear expensive. Analysts, on average, forecast profit growth for SQ of 63.8% this year and 45.5% in fiscal 2020. Numerous investors would gladly pay 58 times forward earnings for a stock that offered such growth.However, the inverted yield curve could indicate that a recession is looming,  and recessions tend to reduce investors' tolerance for such multiples. Moreover, such conditions create concerns about profit growth . Thus far, analysts' profit estimates for SQ continue to hold steady. However, in a recession, Square's  revenue growth would likely decline. For that reason, investors should probably not buy SQ stock now. Square Is Set to Transform Finance as We Know ItHowever, investors should look to buy SQ stock as those fears begin to subside. SQ is on the path to becoming a payments ecosystem. In other words, it could become the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) of the payments world.SQ began as a company that allowed any smartphone user to accept credit-card payments. The firm has ventured into multiple payments-related businesses to take advantage of the increased use of payment cards. Its innovations have presented a challenge to older payments companies such as NCR (NYSE:NCR) and Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP).Moreover, its innovation  could reach new levels if it obtains a banking license. InvestorPlace contributor Ian Bezek correctly pointed out that becoming a bank creates a heavy regulatory burden for companies. However, as we saw when Apple entered the music business, transformative companies tend to find a way around such difficulties. Due to the size and reach of Square's  ecosystem, a successful move into banking could transform the industry.I don't think SQ would drive all banks out of business if it obtains a banking licence. However, it could lead investors to question the need for entities such as Citigroup (NYSE:C) or Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). And in such a scenario, SQ would at least force banks to transform themselves to survive. Final Thoughts on SQ StockSQ stock will struggle for now, but it will eventually grow tremendously by transforming its industry. A high multiple for SQ stock,  lower profits for SQ and a recession would place further pressure on Square stock in the near-term. As a result, investors should watch Square stock, but not buy it at this time.However, the power of Square's financial ecosystem continues to grow. That leaves companies which operate in only one part of the financial-services sector vulnerable. It could also make money-oriented IT companies or even banks as we know them obsolete. Although investors should stay out of SQ stock for now, SQ looks poised to profit from its transformation of finance as we know it.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-08-06	2019-08-06 15:56:22	ADP	Automatic Data Processing, Inc.	Ackman Exits Positions in United Techologies and ADP	(Bloomberg) -- Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management has liquidated its positions in United Technologies Corp. and Automatic Data Processing Inc. as the firm builds up its cash reserves for new investments.Ackman has decided to sell his stake in industrial company United Technologies rather than fight its takeover of defense contractor Raytheon Co., according to people familiar with the matter, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. He had vowed to oppose that deal in June, saying it lacked strategic sense.Ackman has exited payroll processor ADP -- the last company where he waged a proxy fight -- because much of the low-hanging fruit has been plucked, he said in a letter Monday to co-investors in a special purpose vehicle set up to invest in the company. A copy of the letter was obtained by Bloomberg News.ADP’s shares rose as much as 2% Tuesday and were trading at $162.66 at 11:32 a.m. in New York. United Technologies’ shares were up 0.6% to $126.46.The billionaire investor will use the proceeds from the sales in the companies for other opportunities. He already has a new position. The hedge fund’s publicly traded affiliate Pershing Square Holdings Ltd. has made a new, undisclosed investment that amounted to 12% of its net asset value, the firm said in a statement Monday, confirming a Bloomberg News report. As of July 31, Pershing Square Holdings’ total assets under management amounted to $5.6 billion, according to its website, meaning its stake in the new investment would amount to at least $672 million. It did not detail how much of the new investment was held by its private funds, which could increase the value of the stake.Separately, the firm raised $400 million issuing debt last month.Representatives for United Technologies and ADP didn’t respond to requests for comment.Ackman disclosed an 8.3% stake in ADP in 2017 and sought to replace three board directors in a proxy contest at the company. ADP shareholders rejected his proposal.It was still a successful investment, returning about 50% for Pershing Square’s co-investors, according to Ackman’s letter. Pershing Square acquired its ADP stake for its co-investors i at an average cost of $114.76 a share and exited on July 31 when its share closed at roughly $167 a piece, according to the letter.Ackman took credit in the letter for at least part of those gains by shining a spotlight on the company’s growth potential and spurring on management to improve its operations.“Our activism bore significant fruit,” he said. “As a direct result of our activism, ADP made commitments to accelerate revenue growth, bolster its competitive position in the enterprise market, and improve efficiency and margins.”ADP was Ackman’s last high-profile proxy fight. After several setbacks in the previous years, including his losing bets on Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Ltd. and Herbalife Ltd., Ackman was forced to rethink his approach following a flurry of investor redemptions.Since then, Ackman has stepped back from the limelight and put a renewed focus on his investment strategy. Pershing Square’s investments have returned roughly 50% this year through July 31, according to its website.At the same time, his once-troubled investment in Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. has turned around, with its shares hitting a record high last month under the stewardship of its new chief executive officer, Brian Niccol.(Updates shares in fourth paragraph; adds Pershing Square statement in sixth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Richard Clough.To contact the reporter on this story: Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Matthew MonksFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ackman-exits-positions-united-techologies-213747989.html?.tsrc=rss

S&P 500, Dow trade at records in early action as Wall Street digests a weak ADP jobs report	U.S. stocks rose modestly on Wednesday, in a holiday-shortened trading session, but enough for the S&P 500 to notch a intraday high. Investors were reacting to a weaker-than-expected Automatic Data Processing Inc.  private-sector labor report, which showed that the U.S. added 102,000 nonfarm jobs for June, less than economists were expecting, with growth being driven by the service-producing sector and hurt by small businesses. U.S. equity markets will close at 1 p.m., three hours earlier than usual ahead of Independence Day on Thursday when markets will be closed for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 64 points, or 0.2%, at 26,850, trading above its Oct. 3 closing high, while the S&P 500 index  hit an intraday all-time peak at 2,981.66.

Meanwhile, haven assets also were gaining, partly on the back of the nomination of expected easy-money candidates International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde, who was nominated to replace Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank and a pair of nominations by President Donald Trump for the Federal Reserve board. The 10-year Treasury note yielded 1.96%, hanging around its lowest level since 2016. Bond prices rise as yields fall.

IBM Is Set to Join Exclusive Group of Dividend Aristocrats	(Bloomberg) -- Here’s some good news for beleaguered International Business Machines Corp. investors: it’s about to become an aristocrat.Dividend forecasts compiled by Bloomberg show that the technology giant is poised to join the list of so-called Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have increased their dividend in 25 consecutive years, in 2020. The ascendancy to dividend royalty comes amid a five-year slide in IBM’s stock price that has seen it pare 26% of its value.Getting added to the elite list will force funds that track Dividend Aristocrats, such as the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats exchange traded fund, to purchase shares of the Armonk, New York-based company.IBM would join Automatic Data Processing Inc. as only the second information technology firm on the 57 company list. The addition would boost the weight of the information technology sector in the group to match that of energy companies.Dividend UpdateLooking beyond the aristocrats, energy firms were the biggest contributors to dividend growth in the second quarter of 2019, according to Bloomberg specialists. Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., Diamondback Energy Inc., Kinder Morgan Inc. and EOG Resources Inc. had quarter over quarter dividend increases greater than 25% contributing to the sector’s 6% quarter over quarter growth.Key InsightsBloomberg doesn’t projects any sector to out gain its third quarter 2017 or 2018 quarterly dividend growthFinancials are expected to see the pace of growth drop to 5.5% from 12.4% in 3Q 2018.Among aristocrats, Bloomberg’s projected 12 month dividend yield is expected to reach 6.02% for AbbVie Inc. and 6.16% at AT&T Inc.The projected dividend yield on the KBW Bank Index surpassed the yield on the Dow Jones Utility Average a week ago for the first time since February 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg13 of the 24 companies in KBW’s index are expected to raise dividends or say they will consider doing so after the latest Federal Reserve stress tests&#92;--With assistance from Jessica Beatus, Christopher Rung and Zhuo Zhang.To contact the reporter on this story: Alex Tanzi in Washington at atanzi@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Tanzi at atanzi@bloomberg.net, Brandon KochkodinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-set-join-exclusive-group-174527497.html?.tsrc=rss

Square Stock Faces Short-Term Pain and Long-Term Gain	After a brief spike higher, Square (NYSE:SQ) has fallen below the levels it saw before the Feb. 27 earnings announcement. Investors have sold Square stock, as concerns about valuation and slowing profit growth weigh on the equity.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks That Deserve Your Attention in 2019 Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified) However, the &quot;slowing&quot; profit growth remains massive. Furthermore, Square's moves into cash registers, payroll processing and banking have formed a compelling ecosystem. This influence calls into question the future of many long-standing financial businesses. Considering SQ's transformational power in the finance business, I would recommend using the recent decline to look for a buy point in Square stock. As I've pointed out in previous articles, Square stock is the financial tech stock of the 2010s. Much like Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) in the 1990s and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in the early 2000s, Square carved out a financial niche that the large players could not push aside. Now, Square has built an ecosystem that has helped it to grow beyond its place as a niche player. Beware the Square EcosystemPut simply, Square has grown with the small businesses it continues to support. Admittedly, when venturing beyond phone-based platforms, both the Square Cash Register and the Cash App seem like natural extensions. As of the end of 2018, the Cash App had already grown to 15 million accounts, up from just seven million in 2017.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, now Square has moved into many other areas such as scheduling, payroll systems and even small business loans. This system has become so powerful that customers who left had Square seeking cheaper payment processing solutions, returned to the fold.These moves should also make one wonder about the future of the more traditional financial stocks. For one, Square's small-business lending threatens the type of loans made by community banks, many of whom already struggle to provide high-tech banking services.However, the power of the Square ecosystem threatens more than just community banks. Square Cash Register pressures the company formerly known as National Cash Register, NCR (NYSE:NCR). Square Payroll threatens the business of ADP (NASDAQ:ADP). Moreover, between the Cash App and Square's loan business, what need will consumers have for a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) or a Visa (NYSE:V)? Buy Square Stock… If It Pulls BackAll of these companies have time to adapt. For that reason, I will not predict their demise. However, given the power of this ecosystem, it is little wonder why Square stock has commanded such high multiples. Despite my bias toward value, even I like SQ stock long term. Still, over the past year, I have been a Square stock bear on valuation concerns. These worries remain and I would not yet buy SQ.However, even a value-based case has begun to form on SQ stock. The forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio has fallen to about 68. Also, profit growth has slowed down, but only gradually. Wall Street forecasts a 57.4% increase for this year. For next year, that will only fall to 50%. Analysts also think that SQ will maintain a 49.8% average annual growth rate over the next five years. If the forward PE drops below 60 (a point it surpassed as recently as December), I would recommend buying this stock. Final Thoughts on Square StockThe bad news in Square's numbers may create an opportunity to buy a transformational business at a comparatively low valuation. I have long held a negative view of SQ stock due to its elevated multiple. Despite a steep decline and a partial recovery, SQ still trades at a high PE ratio.However, profit growth will likely come in at about 50% per year for the foreseeable future. More importantly, the growth of its ecosystem looks positioned to transform the finance business. This could also force many of its peers to either adapt or possibly close their doors.  * 12 2018 Winners That Will Be Big Ol' Losers in 2019 The Square financial ecosystem will transform the financial industry more than any one company has in decades. This factor alone makes Square stock a buy on any significant pullback.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.
