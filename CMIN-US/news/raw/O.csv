2021-04-30	2021-04-30 14:36:32	O	Realty Income Corporation	Realty Income Inks Deal To Acquire VEREIT	Realty Income Corporation (O) has agreed to snap up Maryland-based VEREIT, a real estate operating company, in an all-stock deal, which will create a combined entity with an enterprise value of $50 billion. Following the announcement, VEREIT shares jumped 16% on April 29. Per the terms of the deal, shareholders of VEREIT (VER) will receive 0.705 shares of Realty Income stock for each share held. The transaction, which awaits both companies’ shareholder approval and certain other approvals, is likely to close in the fourth quarter of this year. Upon completion of the merger, the companies are likely to spin off all the office properties of both companies into a new, independent, publicly-traded REIT (SpinCo). Following the merger and the spin-off process, Realty Income will act as the surviving public entity. Existing VEREIT shareholders will own 30% of the combined entity and SpinCo, while the remaining 70% will be owned by shareholders of Realty Income. The deals are expected to be more than 10% accretive to Realty Income’s AFFO per share in the first year. Furthermore, on a run-rate basis, estimated annual corporate cost synergies of $45-$55 million are expected, along with an estimated $35-$40 million of annualized synergies on a cash basis. Notably, three quarters of the savings are likely to be achieved in the first year following the closure of the deal. (See Realty Income stock analysis on TipRanks) Realty Income CEO Sumit Roy said, “We believe the merger with VEREIT will generate immediate earnings accretion and value creation for Realty Income’s shareholders while enhancing our ability to execute on our ambitious growth initiatives. Together, our company will enjoy increased size, scale, and diversification, continuing to distance Realty Income as the leader in the net lease industry. VEREIT’s real estate portfolio is highly complementary to ours, which we expect to further enhance the consistency and durability of our cash flows.” Following the deal announcement, Raymond James analyst RJ Milligan maintained a Buy rating on O stock. Milligan said, “On a net basis, we view the transaction as a positive for O, believing the immediate accretion and future refinancing opportunities will more than offset the slight deterioration in portfolio quality and the increased difficulty in achieving meaningful annual earnings growth through acquisitions.” Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about the stock’s outlook. The Moderate Buy consensus rating breaks down into 2 Buy ratings versus 3 Hold ratings.

2021-03-17	2021-03-17 16:42:56	O	Realty Income Corporation	A Look Into Realty Income's Debt	Over the past three months, shares of Realty Income (NYSE:O) rose by 6.29%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Realty Income has. Realty Income's Debt According to the Realty Income's most recent balance sheet as reported on February 23, 2021, total debt is at $8.82 billion, with $549.72 million in long-term debt and $8.27 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $824.48 million in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $7.99 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Realty Income has $20.74 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.43. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Investors Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

2021-01-24	2021-01-24 19:01:18	O	Realty Income Corporation	3 Top Dividend Stocks With Growth Opportunity; Goldman Sachs Says ‘Buy’	"Investing is all about finding profits, and investors have long seen two main paths toward that goal. Growth stocks, equities that will give a return based mainly on share price appreciation, are one route. The second route lies through dividend stocks. These are stocks that pay out a percentage of profits back to shareholders – a dividend, usually sent out quarterly. The payments vary widely, from less than 1% to more than 10%, but the average, among stocks listed on the S&P 500, is about 2%. Dividends are a nice addition for a patient investor, as they provide a steady income stream. Goldman Sachs analyst Caitlin Burrows has been looking into the real estate trust segment, a group of stocks long-known for dividends that are both high and reliable – and she sees plenty of reason to expect strong growth in three stocks in particular. Running the trio through TipRanks’ database, we learned that all three have been cheered by the rest of the Street as well, as they boast a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus. Broadstone Net Lease (BNL) First up, Broadstone Net Lease, is an established REIT that went public this past September in an IPO that raised over $533 million. The company put 33.5 million shares on the market, followed by another 5 million-plus picked up by the underwriters. It was considered a successful opening, and BNL now boasts a market cap over $2.63 billion. Broadstone’s portfolio includes 628 properties across 41 US states plus the Canadian province of British Columbia. These properties host 182 tenants and are worth an aggregate of $4 billion. The best feature here is the long-term nature of the leases – the weighted average remaining lease is 10.8 years. During the third quarter, the most recent with full financials available, BNL reported a net income of $9.7 million, or 8 cents per share. The income came mainly from rents, and the company reported collecting 97.9% of rents due during the quarter. Looking ahead, the company expects $100.3 million in property acquisitions during Q4, and an increased rent collection rate of 98.8%. Broadstone’s income and high rent collections are supporting a dividend of 25 cents per common share, or $1 annually. It’s a payment affordable for the company, and offering investors a yield of 5.5%. Goldman’s Burrows sees the company’s acquisition moves as the most important factor here. ""Accretive acquisitions are the key earnings driver for Broadstone… While management halted acquisitions following COVID-induced market uncertainty (BNL did not complete any acquisitions in 1H20) and ahead of its IPO, we are confident acquisitions will ramp up in 2021, and saw the beginning of this with 4Q20 activity… We estimate that BNL achieves a positive investment spread of 1.8%, leading to 0.8% of earnings growth (on 2021E FFO) for every $100mn of acquisitions (or 4.2% on our 2021E acquisition volumes),” Burrows opined. To this end, Burrows rates BNL a Buy, and her $23 price target implies an upside of ~27% for the year ahead. (To watch Burrow’s track record, click here) Wall Street generally agrees with Burrows on Broadstone, as shown by the 3 positive reviews the stock has garnered in recent weeks. These are the only reviews on file, making the analyst consensus rating a unanimous Strong Buy. The shares are currently priced at $18.16, and the average price target of $21.33 suggests a one-year upside of ~17%. (See BNL stock analysis on TipRanks) Realty Income Corporation (O) Realty Income is a major player in the REIT field. The company holds a portfolio worth more than $20 billion, with more than 6,500 properties located in 49 states, Puerto Rico, and the UK. Annual revenue exceeded $1.48 billion in fiscal year 2019 (the last with complete data), and has kept up a monthly dividend for 12 years. Looking at current data, we find that O posted 7 cents per share income in 3Q20, along with $403 million in total revenue. The company collected 93.1% of its contracted rents in the quarter. While relatively low, a drill-down to the monthly values shows that rent collection rates have been increasing since July. As noted, O pays out a monthly dividend, and has done so regularly since listing publicly in 1994. The company raised its payout in September 2020, marking the 108th increase during that time. The current payment is 23.45 cents per common share, which annualizes to $2.81 cents – and gives a yield of 4.7%. Based on the above, Burrows put this stock on her Americas Conviction List, with a Buy rating and a $79 price target for the next 12 months. This target implies a 32% upside from current levels. Backing her stance, Burrows noted, “We estimate 5.3% FFO growth per year over 2020E-2022E, versus an average of 3.1% fo rour full REIT coverage. We expect key earnings drivers will include a continued recovery in acquisition volumes and a gradual improvement in theater rents (in 2022)."" The analyst added, ""We assume O makes $2.8 billion of acquisitions in each of 2021 and 2022, versus the consensus expectation of $2.3 billion. [We] believe our acquisition volume assumptions could in fact turn out to be conservative as, eight days into 2021, the company has already made or agreed to make $807.5 mn of acquisitions (or 29% of our estimate for 2021)."" Overall, Wall Street takes a bullish stance on Realty Income shares. 5 Buys and 1 Hold issued over the previous three months make the stock a Strong Buy. Meanwhile, the $69.80 average price target suggests ~17% upside from the current share price. (See O stock analysis on TipRanks) Essential Properties Realty Trust (EPRT) Last up, Essential Properties, owns and manages a portfolio of single-tenant commercial properties across the US. There are 214 tenants across more than 1000 properties in 16 industries, including car washes, convenience stores, medical services, and restaurants. Essential Properties boasts a high occupancy rate of 99.4% for its properties. In 3Q20, the company saw revenue increase of 18.2% year-over-year, reaching $42.9 million. Essential Properties finished the quarter with an impressive $589.4 million in available liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents, and available credit. The strong cash position and rising revenues had the company confident enough to raise the dividend in going into Q4. The new dividend payment is 24 cents per common share, up 4.3% from the previous payment. The current rate annualizes to 96 cents, and gives a yield of 4.6%. The company has been raising its dividend regularly for the past two years. In her review for Goldman, Burrows focuses on the recovery that Essential Properties has made since the height of the COVID panic last year. “When shelter in place mandates went into effect in early 2020, only 71% of EPRT’s properties were open (completely or on a limited basis). This situation has improved in the intervening months and now just 1% of EPRT’s portfolio is closed… We expect EPRT’s future earnings growth to be driven by acquisition accretion and estimate 2.8% potential earnings growth from $100 mn of acquisitions,” Burrows wrote. In line with her optimistic approach, Burrows gives EPRT shares a Buy rating, along with a $26 one-year price target, suggesting a 27% upside. All in all, EPRT has 9 recent analyst reviews, and the breakdown of 8 Buys and 1 Sell gives the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are priced at $20.46 and have an average price target of $22.89, giving ~12% upside potential from current levels.

2020-12-18	2020-12-18 16:21:54	O	Realty Income Corporation	7 of the Best Dividend Aristocrats on the Market	"Who doesn’t like stocks with dividends? As investors, we love companies that generate consistent and above-average returns for us over the long term. When we’re talking about dividend stocks to own, aristocrats are some of the best businesses on earth. A dividend aristocrat is a stock described as raising its dividend for 25 consecutive years. 
Keep in mind, that’s not only paying the dividend for the last quarter century, but raising that payout each year during that period. Income-oriented investors are looking for two things: dependability and yield. 
While it’s nice to have an above-average yield, reliability of that yield is often more important for investors. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The best part about these types of dividend stocks is that the companies tend to be quite good as well. Any sort of investor can benefit from the long-term exposure to this group, simply because they are high-quality holdings. Income investors may consider over-allocating toward these types of stocks, while growth investors may consider diversifying with them. 


					7 Growth Stocks You Don't Want to Sleep On				

Let’s look at seven dividend stocks to own now: 


Walmart (NYSE:WMT)
Clorox (NYSE:CLX)
AT&T (NYSE:T)
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD)
Realty Income (NYSE:O)
Federal Realty (NYSE:FRT)
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)


Dividend Stocks to Own: Walmart (WMT)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
	
I want to kick off this list of dividend stocks to own with Walmart. The retailer has proven a number of things to investors over the years and in 2020, least of which is its commitment to the dividend. 
Walmart has not only paid but has raised its dividend for 46 consecutive years. However, it’s the strides that Walmart is taking outside of the dividend that have my attention. 
For instance, business continues to hum along whether the country or the world is in a recession. Whether that’s the great financial crisis in 2008 or a pandemic-induced recession. In the latter, it’s clear that regulators consider Walmart an essential operation, which is also important from an investment perspective. 
The efforts the company has made to increase its online and omni-channel presence also shouldn’t be ignored. Walmart is essentially solidifying its importance in retail for decades to come. 

Clorox (CLX)

The biggest issue with Clorox? Its growth and valuation. Obviously a pandemic is going to dial up demand for Clorox’s products. However, when that growth dies down, will the stock — which is up 32.5% in the past year — go down with it? 
To an extent, it already has. 
Clorox stock peaked near $239 on Aug. 5 and has struggled since, down 15.5%. Shares are about flat for the month of December, but should it finish lower, it will mark the stock’s fifth straight monthly decline. 
I’m not saying that to discourage investors. Instead, I’m highlighting the opportunity in Clorox. With its 2.2% dividend yield and more than four decades of rising dividends, this is a safe cash-flow entity.

In a recession or in an economic boom, there will be demand for Clorox. Further, even though there is a vaccine on the way for the coronavirus, companies and consumers alike will continue to keep things sanitary. That bodes well for Clorox, although it does have other brands. Some of them include: Kingsford charcoal, Glad garbage bags, Brita filters, Hidden Valley dressing, Fresh Step kitty litter and others. 

AT&T (T)
Source: Shutterstock
	
There is a lot of controversy surrounding AT&T because of its debt situation. However, this belongs on the list of dividend stocks to own. 
With a current yield of 6.7%, this company shouldn’t not be overlooked by income-oriented investors. While the debt load may give some investors pause, let’s consider its other financials for a moment. 
Over the past decade, AT&T has turned to M&A to fuel its growth. Some of those acquisitions, like DirecTV, came at the pivoting point of cutting the cord. Thus they have been a drain on the company’s financials and a poor use of leverage. 
However, other acquisitions, like TimeWarner, were perfectly timed. This has given AT&T a cash-flow heavy asset that is benefiting from a rise in digital entertainment and streaming video via its HBO property. 
Because of the enormous boost in free cash flow, AT&T has been able to lower its free cash flow payout ratio from more than 100% down to the 60% range. At the same time, management is looking to shed its underperforming assets to cut down debt and improve its financial footing. 

McDonald’s (MCD)

The dividend from the Golden Arches is as dependable as finding a McDonald’s on a road trip. 
In all seriousness though, McDonald’s continues to deliver with its consistency. Because of its dependable business for consumers — which is affordable, attainable food at virtually any hour of the day, all over the world — its business has become dependable for investors. 
While the company works on longer term ways to improve its margins, there remains growth in the short term. In 2021, analysts expect revenue to rebound 13.7% and for earnings to jump 34%. 
Admittedly, that comes after a slump in 2020, as increased costs and temporary store closures weighed McDonald’s down.

But with strong growth in the queue for 2021 and a 2.5% dividend yield, this consistent winner is one to consider. Like Walmart, McDonald’s has raised its dividend every year since its first payout in the 1970s. 

Realty Income (O)

Called The Monthly Dividend Company, Realty Income is an instant favorite among REIT buyers. 
Realty Income has done an incredible job of building a diversified portfolio of various tenants in various industries. It’s not overly levered to any one company or any one industry. 
In short, it has taken its time over the years building a formidable portfolio that any true real estate investor would envy. In an effort to also differentiate itself, the company opted for monthly dividends over quarterly dividends. So while the payments are smaller, it’s nice receiving that payout every month. 
Just like any premium stock though, the problem with Realty — if we can even call it a problem — is that the valuation comes at a premium too. With a premium valuation comes a lower yield. 
Because REITs are out of favor, investors can snag a solid yield with Realty Income. While up notably from the lows, shares are still down about 25% from the highs, yielding 4.7%. 

Federal Realty (FRT)

Everyone loves the last REIT we talked about, as it’s a stalwart in the dividend community. However, Federal Realty deserves plenty of attention in our list of dividend stocks to own. 
Federal Realty is considered a crown jewel in the REIT space, having raised its dividend for 53 consecutive years. Think about that … five consecutive decades! 
So what’s the only problem with Federal Realty? 
The low yield. When demand is high and a stock is bid up, the dividend yield is low. The opposite is true for high-yield stocks — demand is lower. In the case of FRT, the yield has generally been between 2% and 3% for the last decade. It was more like a bond than a stock, and that’s not what investors are looking for in REITs.

Because of the coronavirus-related selloff though, Federal Realty’s yield has swelled toward 5% — and even cleared 6% at one point this year. Anytime FRT is near or above 5%, buyers will want a stake. 

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

Last but not least is Johnson & Johnson, which absolutely deserves to be on our list of dividend stocks to own. 
In April 2020 — just weeks into the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. — J&J went through with another dividend hike. The firm raised its quarterly payout by more than 6% to 95 cents per share. 
Wouldn’t it be nice to get that kind of raise each year? 
Here’s the best part: The dividend raise was Johnson & Johnson’s 58th consecutive annual increase. So much has happened in the last six decades, ranging from dot-com busts, financial crises and inflation surges. Through it all though, J&J has been there raising its payout year in and year out. 
That’s income you can depend on. Now paying out a 2.7% dividend yield, the company’s payout is about three times the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond. 
Combined with shares being just 2.5% below the all-time high, it’s clear we have a winning combination of yield and stock performance with J&J.

2020-09-18	2020-09-18 16:39:31	O	Realty Income Corporation	7 Monthly Dividend Stocks To Buy Now For Safe Payouts	"The stock market can be broadly separated into two groups -- dividend stocks and non-dividend stocks. Among stocks that pay dividends to shareholders, most do so on a quarterly basis. But there are other directions a company can take with its capital return policy. Some companies decide to pay a dividend once per year, while others pay semi-annually. There are even monthly dividend stocks.Income investors may find monthly dividend stocks to be attractive, as they pay 12 dividends per year. Monthly dividend stocks deliver more frequent income payments than stocks with other payout schedules.  * 10 Education Stocks to Buy for the Fall School Season This article will discuss our top 7 monthly dividend stocks right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Realty Income (NYSE:O)  * STAG Industrial (NYSE:STAG)  * Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR)  * TransAlta Renewables (OTCMKTS:TRSWF)  * Dream Industrial REIT (OTCMKTS:DREUF)  * Choice Properties REIT (OTCMKTS:PPRQF)  * Main Street Capital (NYSE:MAIN)As always, investors should make sure a company has a sustainable dividend backed by a strong underlying business model. Dividend safety is an important consideration for investors looking at monthly dividend stocks. Safe Monthly Dividend Stocks: Realty Income (O)Source: Shutterstock Realty Income is the safest monthly dividend stock on this list due to the company's long history of consistent dividends. The company has paid 602 consecutive monthly dividends without interruption, a track record stretching back more than 50 years. It's no surprise that Realty Income has trademarked itself as ""The Monthly Dividend Company.""Realty Income also has a long history of consistently raising its dividend over time. Realty Income has increased its dividend 107 times since its initial public offering in 1994. Realty Income qualifies as a Dividend Aristocrat, a group of 65 companies in the S&P 500 that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.Since its initial public listing in 1994, the company has increased its dividend on average by 4.5% per year. This means Realty Income has delivered consistent dividends each quarter and provided dividend growth for an extended period.Realty Income's diversified property portfolio is a big reason for its impressive dividend history. Realty Income is a triple-net lease REIT, an attractive structure for REITs to follow. Being a triple-net lease REIT means that Realty Income collects steady rent payments each month, while three major cost components -- maintenance, insurance and taxes -- are the responsibility of the tenant. Realty Income's diversified portfolio consists of over 6,500 properties spread across roughly 600 tenants, with an average remaining lease term of 9 years.The company's high-quality portfolio has served as a competitive advantage during the coronavirus crisis. Realty Income collected 93.5% of its contractual rent in August, up from 92.3% in July. Investors have some reason for hope that the worst is over for Realty Income, which has an attractive yield of 4.2% right now. STAG Industrial (STAG)Source: Shutterstock STAG Industrial is a safe dividend stock because of its advantageous business model. STAG Industrial is a REIT with a particular focus on industrial real estate properties, many of which have exposure to e-commerce activity, an especially attractive feature for long-term REIT investors.Many REITs are highly exposed to areas of brick-and-mortar real estate that are in distress, such as malls. These property types were already under pressure entering 2020 due to the rise of e-commerce retailers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic only accelerated secular e-commerce trends. As a result, STAG is an excellent stock for REIT investors looking for long-term growth potential.STAG Industrial's property portfolio included 457 buildings in 30 different states as of June 30, 2020. According to the company, approximately 43% of its property portfolio handles e-commerce activity. In fact, Amazon is its largest tenant, comprising 2.5% of annualized base rent. Other major tenants such as XPO Logistics and Packaging (NYSE:XPO) will also benefit from the continued growth of e-commerce.Importantly, STAG Industrial has a healthy balance sheet to help support the dividend. The company has a manageable leverage ratio of 4.3x, as defined by net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, down from 4.8x in 2019. It also has just 12% of outstanding debt maturing before 2022.  * 10 Education Stocks to Buy for the Fall School Season STAG Industrial collected 98% of rent in the second quarter, an excellent sign that the company is not being negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. With a 4.5% yield and a projected payout ratio of 76% for 2020, we view STAG's dividend as very safe. Shaw Communications (SJR)Source: JL IMAGES/Shutterstock.com Shaw Communications is a major communications company based out of Canada. It has become Western Canada's leading content and network provider, with over $4 billion USD in annual revenue. The company delivers wireline and wireless services to consumers and businesses in Canada. The wireless business operates under the Freedom Mobile brand.Shaw Communications is uniquely positioned to succeed in the current environment. While many industries are under heavy stress due to the coronavirus pandemic, demand for wireless, video and broadband service only continues to rise. For example, in the most recently reported quarter, Shaw Communication's consolidated revenue decreased by just 0.8%. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA increased 15.3% year-over-year, while postpaid churn rate was a record low 0.96%. Average revenue per user increased 2.6% for the quarter.Over the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, Shaw Communications grew its free cash flow by 20%. Such strong growth was due to resilient subscriber numbers and higher revenue per user, as well as lower capital expenditures and falling interest expense.Shaw Communications has a health balance sheet, with an investment-grade credit rating of BBB- from Standard & Poor's. It also has a net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2.4x, which is actually below its target range of 2.5x to 3.0x. The company also has $2.1 billion CAD in available liquidity and no debt maturities until 2023, meaning short-term liquidity is not a concern for Shaw Communications.The company's strong performance gives investors confidence that the dividend is safe, even in a prolonged recession. The stock has an attractive dividend yield of nearly 5%. TransAlta Renewables (TRSWF)Source: Shutterstock TransAlta Renewables is a top pick, as the stock not only pays a safe dividend each month, but it also provides investors with long-term growth potential.TransAlta Renewables is a renewable independent power producer based in Canada. It has a diversified portfolio of assets including interests in 23 wind facilities, 13 hydroelectric facilities, seven natural gas generation facilities, one solar facility and one natural gas pipeline.In all, the company cumulatively has an ownership interest of over 2,500 megawatts of generating capacity. Its assets are spread across the U.S., Canada and Western Australia. Therefore, TransAlta Renewables could be a particularly attractive stock for investors given its exposure to renewable energy, a long-term growth industry.TransAlta has a successful track record, as its annual Cash Available for Distribution (CAD) has more than tripled since 2014. Investors have benefited right alongside this growth. Since TransAlta's initial public offering in 2013, the company has increased its annualized dividend by 4% per year.There is a long runway of growth up ahead, as the renewable energy transformation is still in the early stages. TransAlta's future pipeline consists of 2,000 megawatts of capacity currently under evaluation. Separately, it also has 900 megawatts of additional capacity under consideration for on-site generation projects in the U.S., Canada and Australia.In the meantime, investors are rewarded with a hefty dividend currently near 6%. TransAlta has a modest net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.2x, reassuring investors that debt is not a major concern.  * 10 Education Stocks to Buy for the Fall School Season With a projected dividend payout ratio of 65% in terms of 2020 expected adjusted funds from operation, we view TransAlta Renewable's dividend as safe. Dream Industrial REIT (DREUF)Source: Shutterstock Dream Industrial REIT owns high-quality light industrial properties. The trust owns and operates a portfolio of 262 geographically diversified light industrial properties, which makes up ~26 million square feet of gross leasable area across Canada, with some operations in the United States. The trust's portfolio includes roughly 63% of its gross leasable area in multi-tenant buildings and the remaining 37% in single-tenant buildings.Dream Industrial currently has a focus on driving occupancy and rental rates, furthering its leasing operations and internal growth. Occupancy stood at 96% as of the second quarter of 2020. Further, as of September 4, Dream Industrial had collected approximately 98% of recurring contractual gross rents due for the second quarter and July 2020 after adjusting for agreed-upon deferrals and Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance.Similar to STAG Industrial, Dream Industrial is optimally positioned to benefit from emerging trends such as e-commerce, which has driven increased demand for industrial real estate properties. Approximately 43% of Dream Industrial's property portfolio consists of distribution centers, with 39% of properties in urban logistics and the remaining 18% in light industrial properties.Dream Industrials' focus on industrial properties seeing growing demand has paid off, as the company grew first-half Funds From Operation by 9.5% year-over-year, a highly impressive performance in an extremely challenging environment.One potential risk factor is the company's elevated debt level. Its net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio stood at 5.4x in the 2020 second quarter. While this is higher than investors would like to see, it represents a significant decline from 8.4x as recently as 2016.Fortunately, the company has limited maturities over the next several years, as well as an available $250 million credit facility to help shore up its liquidity.Dream Industrials stock has an attractive dividend yield above 6%. As long as FFO continues to grow due to increasing demand for e-commerce activity, the dividend appears secure. Choice Properties REIT (PPRQF)Source: Shutterstock Choice Properties invests in commercial real estate properties across Canada. The company has a high-quality real estate portfolio of over 700 properties, including retail, industrial, office, multi-family and development assets. Over 500 of Choice Properties' investments are rented to their largest tenant Loblaw, Canada's largest retailer.On July 20, Choice Properties released second-quarter results that showed resilience during a difficult operating environment. Funds From Operations, a highly crucial measure of cash flow for REITs, declined 19% from the same quarter last year. The decline in FFO per-diluted-unit was largely due to a higher weighted average number of units outstanding, as well as the disposition of a 30-property portfolio.The trust is also assisting smaller tenants with rent deferrals for 60 days as well as by participating in the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program. Still, Choice Properties collected 89% of rents in the second quarter and 94% of rents in July, indicating that they are weathering the COVID-19 conditions relatively well.On an adjusted basis excluding various one-time items from the company's financial results, Choice Properties generated FFO of $0.404 per share over the first six months of 2020. This sufficiently covered the company's per-share dividend payout. Choice Properties maintained a dividend payout ratio of 91.6% in the 2020 first half.  * 10 Education Stocks to Buy for the Fall School Season While this is a fairly high payout ratio, the dividend remained covered and if adjusted FFO continues to recover the dividend payout will decline in future periods. With a nearly 6% yield, Choice Properties is attractive for investors looking for high yields. Main Street Capital (MAIN)Source: Shutterstock Main Street Capital operates as a Business Development Company, which means it makes money by providing financing to privately-held companies. It focuses on lower middle-market companies, generally defined as those generating between $10 million and $150 million in annual revenue.As of June 30, Main Street's investment portfolio consisted of 177 companies, with no individual investment representing more than 3.7% of total investment income. Main Street's investments typically support management buyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments, refinancing and acquisitions.The over-arching business strategy for Main Street is to earn a high rate of profit on its investments and returning significant cash to its own shareholders through dividends. The company has never decreased its monthly dividend rate and in fact has grown the payout steadily over the years. For example, Main Street's monthly dividend has increased 86% from $0.11 per share in 2007 to the current level of $0.205 per share.This is a particularly challenging time for Main Street. The coronavirus crisis has had an extremely negative impact on the global economy, which has also affected many of its portfolio investments. In addition, the low interest rate environment has also resulted in lower investment yields. These twin headwinds have resulted in poor performance to begin 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, Main Street's distributable net investment income fell 19% year-over-year. On a per-share basis, distributable NII fell 22% to $0.52 per share.Over the first half of 2020, net investment income per share declined 18% from the same six-month period last year. The company paid dividends of $1.23 per share over the first half of the year, while generating NII-per-share of $1.04 in the same period. Therefore, coverage of the dividend has fallen below 100%, which poses a risk of a dividend cut.That said, there is reason to believe the worst is behind Main Street. Gradual reopening of the economy has led to significant improvement in economic conditions in recent months. And, Main Street has taken appropriate action to raise capital, such as a recent $125 million bond offering, to improve its liquidity in the near-term.Main Street's dividend safety has been weakened by the coronavirus crisis, but assuming the worst is behind us, an improvement in net investment income could once again sufficiently cover the dividend. Main Street has an attractive dividend yield of 8%. Final ThoughtsThe coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc on the global economy. While the stock market has virtually recovered all of its losses from earlier in the year, the broader economy is by no means out of the woods.

2020-05-11	2020-05-11 19:58:40	O	Realty Income Corporation	11 Monthly Dividend Stocks and Funds for Reliable Income	"Your bills generally come monthly. Your mortgage, your car payment, your utility bills ... even the gym membership and Netflix subscription come due once per month.Yet that's not how most investments typically work. Bonds tend to pay their coupon payments semiannually, and stocks tend to pay their dividends quarterly. You can get paid much more frequently, however. A number of monthly dividend stocks and funds can help you better align your investment income with your living expenses.Investors received a stark reminder of how important stable income is during the market turmoil of February and March. Not only did the stock market take a nosedive, but many seemingly reliable dividend payers were forced to cut or suspend their payouts.Furthermore, the coronavirus lockdowns have disrupted the livelihoods of millions of Americans, leaving many to dip into already depleted portfolios to pay their bills.""Income security is the single biggest concern I'm hearing from my clients,"" says Sonia Joao, a wealth manager based in Houston, Texas. ""Many of my clients are at that critical age when they become targeted for early retirement, and that's now more likely than ever with companies being forced to reduce headcount. Replacing that lost income is our top priority.""Today, we're going to take a look at 11 of the best monthly dividend stocks and funds that have so far managed the coronavirus with their payouts intact. Not all of these will be exceptionally high yielders. In this environment, it's better to take a lower but reliable yield than to reach for an unrealistically high yield, only to watch it evaporate before the next payment.

2020-03-09	2020-03-09 16:59:24	O	Realty Income Corporation	20 Dividend Stocks to Fund 20 Years of Retirement	The traditional wisdom for funding retirement used to be the &quot;4% rule.&quot; You would withdraw 4% of your savings in year one, followed by &quot;pay raises&quot; in each subsequent year to account for inflation. The theory: If you're invested in a mix of dividend stocks, bonds and even a few growth stocks, your money should last across a 30-year retirement.But today's world is different. Interest rates and bond yields have been stuck in the basement for far too long, reducing future expected returns. Compounding the problem: Americans are living longer than ever before.If you're wondering how to retire without facing the uncomfortable decision of what securities to sell, or questioning whether you are at risk of outliving your savings, wonder no more. You can lean on the cash from dividend stocks to fund a substantial portion of your retirement. In fact, Simply Safe Dividends has published an in-depth guide about living on dividends in retirement.Many companies in the market yield 4% or more. And if you rely on solid dividend stocks for that 4% annually, you won't have to worry as much about the market's unpredictable fluctuations. Better still, because you likely won't have to dig into your nest egg as much, you'll have a chance to leave your heirs with a sizable portfolio when the time comes.Here are 20 high-quality dividend stocks, yielding on average above 4%, that should fund at least 20 years of retirement, if not more. They have paid uninterrupted dividends for more than 20 consecutive years, have fundamentally secure payouts and have the potential to collectively grow their dividends to protect investors' purchasing power over time.

If you're an income investor in it for the long haul, you know that steadily rising payouts are a vital factor, too.For one, dividend increases lift the yield on an investor's original cost basis, meaning today's 1% yield might be much more in the future. They're also indicative of a firm's ability to withstand the ups and downs of the economy, as well as the stock market.Enter the Dividend Aristocrats.The Dividend Aristocrats are companies in the S&P; 500 Index that have improved their annual payouts every year for at least 25 consecutive years. It's a mix of household names as well as companies with less name recognition that nonetheless play an outsize role in the American economy, even if it's mostly behind the scenes. But all of them offer some size, longevity and familiarity, providing comfort amid market uncertainty.Here are the current 64 Dividend Aristocrats - including the newest faces that were just added in January 2020.

The best retirement stocks to buy in 2020 (or any other year), then, assuredly must be dividend-paying ones.Receiving regular dividends reduces an investor's dependence on the market's fickle price swings to make ends meet. Whether or not the market rises or falls in 2020, a portfolio of quality businesses can continue delivering predictable, growing dividend income.Compared to many fixed-income investments, dividend stocks also can generate higher current income in today's low-interest-rate environment, growing their payouts each year to help preserve one's purchasing power. Dividend stocks, like other equities, provide meaningful long-term price appreciation potential as well.Research firm Simply Safe Dividends published an in-depth guide about living on dividends in retirement here. However, a key component to this strategy is finding the best retirement stocks that can deliver safe dividends and grow in value over time.On that note, these are the 20 best retirement stocks to buy in 2020.

Frequently, market leaders will take diametrically opposed positions. As an individual investor, it can be difficult to understand what they see that you cannot.We live in an information age, but access to information isn't enough. You must be able to mine that information for insights to generate better returns. Today, we'll help you figure out how to invest in CRE by showing you how to make sense of two opposing views in late-cycle commercial real estate investing. We'll also highlight a few real estate investment trusts (REITs) to home in on for growth and dividends.

2020-01-10	2020-01-10 12:30:20	O	Realty Income Corporation	3 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy That You Can Rely On	We all have bills and expenses each and every month. However, when it comes to investing in dividend-paying stocks, there's always been a mismatch between when you get paid dividend distributions and when you cut checks or click to make your payments.This is because the vast number of U.S.-listed companies pay their dividends on a quarterly basis. And beyond the borders of the nation, many companies stretch out their distributions to bi-annual or even annual payments. The argument is that only after the company does its business and its fiscal year is wrapped up should it spread cash crumbs out to pesky shareholders.But that's not how the folks residing in C-Suites view their own renumerations. They prefer to pay themselves every so many weeks with bonuses and other perks throughout the year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut there is a collection of companies that don't see shareholders as a burden -- but rather as the rightful owners of the company. And as such, they are paid regularly each and every month, often with rising levels of distributions for attractive dividend yields. And these yields work to build up a retirement portfolio more quickly through reinvestment. Later they will provide monthly income.Moreover, the dividends paid are ample. Every one of the stocks in the following collection yields more than the average S&P 500 yield -- which is a mere 1.8%. And in many cases, the dividend yields are multiples of that average.Where do these monthly dividend stocks come from? These companies tend to be cash-cow businesses that provide dependable profits. Because when you invest for dividends, you need to own stocks from companies that you can rely on.I've assembled a nice collection of stocks to bump up your own portfolio's cash payouts with monthly dividends. Monthly Dividend Stocks: Realty Income (O)Source: Chart by Bloomberg Dividend Yield: 3.7%Mention retailers and many investors will think of the doom brought by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online behemoths. But a website can't replace all retail. In fact, one of the more pervasive members of the retail space actually benefits from the surge of online shopping. That would be FedEx (NYSE:FDX), which operates thousands of stores that facilitate all of the returns from American households' online spending sprees.Then there's another retail space that gets attention -- especially at the start of each year. Gyms are always in demand. Either for those that need or want to lose extra pounds or those that want to keep them off while staying in better health, gyms are a reliable part of the American retail space. And one of the leaders in this retail market space is LA Fitness, now owned by a private equity company called Mid-Ocean Partners.Then we have one of the major go-to retailers when it comes to picking up prescription drugs. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is one of the leaders in local pharmacies. It's also a prime place to pick up last-minute health, beauty, food and household items. Even Amazon's Amazon Now can't always compete.  * 8 of the Strangest Stocks Worth Your Time And one of the other prime retail spaces that's also a defense against online vendors belongs to the super-discounted dollar stores. These stores are found in urban, suburban and rural areas where they provide bargain buys that are made by all kinds of consumers on a regular basis. They tend to have sticky and reliable customers making for good retail space. And two of the leaders include Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR). Realty Income Is All About Retail What do the five companies all have in common? They are all long-term triple-net lease customers of Realty Income (NYSE:O). Triple-net leases are arrangements where tenants pay rent as well as taxes, general upkeep and insurance costs. This setup limits risks and expenses for the owners of the leased properties.Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT). Its top tenants are represented by the companies above, leasing thousands of properties across the American marketplace.Revenues are rising across the portfolio, with gains running on an average annual basis of 9.1% over the past three years alone.This supports a nice monthly dividend distribution, which Realty Income continues to raise at an average annual rate of 4.4% over the past five years alone. And with a current dividend yield of 3.7% it too makes for a great monthly inflation-trouncing dividend payer. O stock will round out my nice collection for your retirement portfolio right now. And to make it even better, thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, 20% of the dividend distribution income is deductible from taxable income for most individual investors. Main Street Capital (MAIN)Source: Chart by Bloomberg Dividend Yield: 6.7%Just as retail is being upended by market changes, so too is business banking. Traditional banks -- with onerous regulations and capital requirements -- are seeing more of their core lending markets taken over by a collection of companies designed to do just that.Main Street Capital (NYSE:MAIN) is set up as a business development company (BDC). BDCs are codified under the Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980. This act passed by Congress and signed by then-President Jimmy Carter came as the U.S. economy was in a pickle. Inflation was a problem and banks were reticent to lend to smaller and middle-market companies. Banks worried about the inflation risk of fixed lending facilities as well as the underlying credit risks in the business sector.The resulting legislation extended the Investment Companies Act of 1940, which enabled the formation of non-bank companies. These non-banks would be largely exempt from corporate income taxes if they made loans and equity participation investments in small and middle-market companies.These new companies functioned as pass-through securities. Investors receive the majority of profits -- and the majority isn't subject to corporate taxes. This means the companies have even more cash on hand for dividend distributions. Non-Bank Lenders Are a 'Main' Source of RevenueMain Street makes loans to companies in the $10 million to $100 million revenue range. This is exactly what the U.S. market needs. In the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, those traditional middle-market bank lenders have been largely sidelined. They face intense regulatory and capital rules stemming from post-crisis legislative and administrative responses. And while there's been a great deal of reform, many have turned to Main Street and other non-bank lenders.Main Street gets to make loans with fewer costs. The result is that its efficiency ratio (a prime measure of the cost to earn each dollar of revenue) is a fraction of those of middle-market lending banks. This means that its costs are lower, and profitability is much higher.Revenues are rising with gains running at an annual basis of 12.3% on average over the past three years.  * 7 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now The revenues and profitability fuel a rising dividend distribution which has been climbing by an average annual rate of 2.7% over the past five years. And with a monthly payout yielding an annual rate of 5.7%, Main Street is a great way to earn monthly dividend payouts. But it gets a little better. The company has been introducing regular special dividend payments including two last year. This brings the annual dividend to a yield of 6.7%. EPR Properties (EPR)Source: Chart by Bloomberg Dividend Yield: 6.4%EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) is a REIT which focuses on a very risk-controlled and efficient way to profit from real estate assets -- triple-net leases. In a triple-net lease, the tenant is also responsible for taxes, insurance and general maintenance costs, hence the term &quot;triple.&quot; Realty Income uses the same arrangements.This means that EPR acquires properties that have few additional costs over their leased lifespans. What does this mean? There are fewer management costs and less uncertainty. For EPR, there's also less risk from changes in taxes or insurance costs. Because of this, EPR can run more efficiently in its operations. This means more certainty in cash flows from its portfolio of properties. That cash in turn supports more stable revenues for dividend payouts.EPR focuses on educational properties, entertainment facilities and resort properties. It wants to both educate your children and keep them entertained on holiday. It's a profitable dynamic. Books and Movies and Water Parks, Oh MyFor eager students, educational properties include early educational centers and both charter and private schools. These provide stable, reliable tenants that commit to long-term leases. In order to retain their student populations, it is more likely that these educational tenants will renew their long-term leases.The entertainment facilities are largely leased to movie &quot;megaplex&quot; theaters from both national and international chains.Rounding out its holdings are a varied mix of resort facilities. These properties include major ski resorts like Camelback Mountain, resorts and golf courses from operator Topgolf. And EPR also owns a collection of water parks in prime locations. All of these benefit from the consumer trend of experience spending which supports longer-term commitments from the operators of the properties and facilities.All in all, the properties of EPR have been increasing revenues significantly with average annual gains running at 18.5% for the past three years alone.The triple-net leases from the properties continue to support significant dividend distributions. The distributions continue to rise by an average annual basis of 5.6% over the past five years alone. And with a current yield of 6.4%, EPR is a great monthly dividend payer. And like for other U.S. REITs, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provided a line-item tax break for individual investors with a 20% deduction in taxable income from the dividend distributions. This shows up in the 1099-DIV form in Box 5 provided by your brokerage, bank or investment company.Neil George was once an all-star bond trader, but now he works morning and night to steer readers away from traps -- and into safe, top-performing income investments.

2019-12-17	2019-12-17 20:52:41	O	Realty Income Corporation	4 Top Stock Trades for Wednesday: O, BYND, AMZN, BA	There were some interesting developments in regards to individual stocks, but as far as the overall market is concerned, Tuesday was a rather lackluster session. Let's look at a few top stock trades. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Realty Income (O)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comI'm not a REIT expert, but I do like to pick these dividend studs up when they're under pressure. I'm not sure that Realty Income (NYSE:O) is near a bottom though, even if shares are trading down into support.On O stock's current decline, shares are falling into the $72 area, which was stiff resistance earlier this year, but support in September following the stock's breakout in August. Only now, there's also the 200-day moving average in the mix.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe upside here is that, should buyers step in at support, it's a limited-risk long setup for the bulls. Either support will hold or it will fail and we'll know very soon. The downside for investors is that, should buyers not step up here, it's unclear where they will emerge. It might be at $70 or perhaps in the mid-to-upper $60s. It could be lower than that even.  * 7 'Strong Buy' Stocks to Put on Your Wish List For traders, though, this is a solid risk/reward setup, although it doesn't help that the REIT space has been under considerable pressure. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Beyond Meat (BYND)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comIt's not just REITs, as investors have seemingly lost their interest in Beyond Meat (NYSE:BYND) as well.After topping out near $240 in July, the stock has slid considerably, now down to the mid-$70s. I don't like the way downtrend resistance (blue line) is squeezing BYND against a static level of support near $72.That's the setup for a descending triangle, a bearish technical development. If support gives way, look out. Shares may tumble into the low-$60s, or even further, before buyers step in.Should bulls bid BYND up off the mat, they need to clear downtrend resistance and the 20-day moving average. If they do, the declining 50-day moving average is the first upside target, followed by the $100 level. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Amazon (AMZN)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comWhile the rest of big tech continues to grind up to new all-time highs, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) remains stuck in the doldrums.I suppose if there's any positive takeaway, it's that the stock continues to make a series of higher lows inside of a slowly rising channel (blue lines). But overall, it continues to lag the broader market, even with Tuesday's 1% bump.Keep it simple with Amazon. Dips down into channel support can be bought, while rallies into the 200-day moving average and channel resistance have been better selling points vs. buying points.On a breakout over channel resistance, $2,000 may quickly become bulls' preferred target. Below channel support, though and $1,700 is possible. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow Mo. 4: Boeing (BA)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comBoeing (NYSE:BA) shares sank over 4% on Monday on reports about a production halt for its 737 MAX line. After the close, the company confirmed the plans, sending shares lower on Tuesday morning.But interestingly, buyers stepped in, bidding the stock off its lows and pushing it back to break-even on the day. When a stock fails to fall on clearly bad news, it always catches my attention.Shares are bouncing off range support and the 23.6% retracement. Bulls can use Tuesday's low as their stop-loss if they are looking for a long trade from here. On a rebound, see if shares can fill the recent gap up to $341. Above that and its major moving averages are the next target.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-12-13	2019-12-13 12:20:30	O	Realty Income Corporation	3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: J.M. Smucker, Ralph Lauren, and UDR	U.S. stocks might be back on track. After choppy trading since Thanksgiving, two of the three major broad market indices reached new all-time closing highs on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sits just a tenth of a percentage point shy.Source: Shutterstock The catalyst was an apparent, if uncertain, truce in the U.S.-China trade war. And if that roadblock is cleared, there may be more upside ahead for equities. The Federal Reserve seems to have a constructive posture. The U.S. economy has slowed, but unemployment remains at record lows and consumer confidence is intact. It looks like smooth sailing heading into 2020.Friday's three big stock charts, however, focus on stocks for which the outlook is a bit more complicated. All three stocks trade at key levels, either hoping for support to hold or for resistance to give. Those hopes could be boosted if the market-wide rally continues as expected.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips J.M. Smucker (SJM)Source: Provided by Finviz The first of Friday's big stock charts, J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM), isn't difficult to decipher. The key question is whether support will hold:  *   Click to Enlarge Source: Provided by Finviz Technically, there's reason to argue that it will. $102 has held repeatedly, and looking to the weekly chart, similar levels served as resistance earlier this year. SJM consolidated at that point and began its rally to May highs.  * Fundamentally, the case is intriguing as well. I made the case for SJM stock last year, and while that case hasn't played out, the broad outline still holds. Smucker's pivot into pet food and coffee mimics a similar and well-received effort at General Mills (NYSE:GIS). Other names in the sector have rallied, with stocks like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and McCormick (NYSE:MKC,NYSE:MKC.V) breaking out. Yet SJM stock trades at less than 13x forward earnings.  * That said, those stocks are driving solid earnings growth. J.M. Smucker isn't. FY21 consensus earnings per share estimates are modestly below fiscal 2019 levels. Full-year guidance for FY20 was cut after the fiscal second quarter report last month. There are reasons why investor patience appears to have run out.  * From a near-term standpoint, it might be other companies that determine whether support holds. Both General Mills and Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) release earnings next week. Strong reports from those peers could drive optimism toward the sector and lead investors to take a longer look at one of the group's laggards. Weakness, however, could resurrect industry worries -- and lead SJM to bust through support. Ralph Lauren (RL)Source: Provided by Finviz For Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), the second of Friday's big stock charts, the situation is reversed. RL stock is trying to bust through resistance, and here too there's reason for optimism:  * Thursday's 3.7% gain puts RL in position for a breakout. An uptrend has held since August lows, and on decent volume. With the Relative Strength Index at 65, shy of overbought territory at 70, there's probably still some potential momentum behind the stock. If RL can break through resistance, there should be a path toward $122 and then early-year highs at $130.  * The rise in Ralph Lauren stock on Thursday, meanwhile, makes some sense. RL stock spiked 15% after fiscal second quarter earnings in early November handily beat Wall Street estimates. The key catalyst was strength on the Chinese mainland, where revenue increased 22% on a constant-currency basis. Good news on the trade front should help Ralph Lauren -- yet Ralph Lauren stock trades roughly where it did after the post-earnings spike.  * There are risks here on both fronts, however. Resistance has been firm going back to May. Apparel has been a brutally difficult sector. Revenue is guided to rise roughly 2% in constant currency this year; while performance on the Chinese mainland has been strong, protests in Hong Kong have hit sales in that market. At less than 14x forward earnings, RL stock is cheap, but for years now 'cheap' hasn't been enough for apparel stocks, and there's the chance that will be true for Ralph Lauren stock at these levels. UDR, Inc. (UDR)Source: Provided by Finviz Apartment operator UDR, Inc. (NYSE:UDR) already has breached support. The third of our big stock charts suggests the declines could continue, though there are some fundamental reasons for optimism:  * The fall through support is concerning from a near-term perspective. $47 is an obviously key level that held steadily as resistance this summer, and when UDR finally broke through it posted a nice breakout by REIT (real estate investment trust) standards. But the stock clearly has reversed, falling through not just $47 but all three moving averages.  * Thursday's trade news doesn't appear to be much help, either. Treasury yields moved higher on the news, limiting the relative attractiveness of UDR's current 2.95% dividend yield. The sell-off continued the weakness in UDR, which has occurred along with declines in other REITs. Widely held names like Realty Income (NYSE:O), Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), and Essex Property Trust (NYSE:ESS) too have pulled back. It does seem like at some point the declines will cease, though UDR's chart suggests the reversal might not be imminent.  * That said, there are some reasons for optimism. Apartment demand is expected to rise over time. A 3% dividend yield may bring in buyers. The current descending narrowing wedge often portends a bullish reversal, and if UDR can claw back into the range it might yet see a bounce. Right now, however, UDR is looking for buyers.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-12-12	2019-12-12 18:00:39	O	Realty Income Corporation	The 10 Best REITs to Buy for 2020	Real estate investment trusts (REITs) - companies that invest in a variety of properties, from office buildings to apartments and self-storage buildings - built big gains in 2019.A prominent REIT gauge, the FTSE Nareit All Equity REIT Index, gained 25.4% through Nov. 21 (including dividends), with many of the best REITs doing far better. In contrast, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (used for comparison because the majority of REITs are smaller companies) has gained 18.9%.Of course, people don't ordinarily invest in REITs to beat the stock market averages. They invest in them for income. By law, REITs must pay out at least 90% of their net earnings as dividends. The average REIT in the FTSE index delivers a dividend yield of 3.6%, compared with 1.8% for both the bellwether 10-year Treasury note and the S&P; 500&#92;. When the yield of bonds and stocks are so low, REITs become extremely popular.Real estate also provides diversification. While REITs are still stocks, they don't always move in the same direction as the broad market. And their above-average dividend yields are a nice shelter in a downturn.While you can invest in a real estate fund, such as the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ), there are plenty of good individual REITs to buy, many of which offer high yields and reasonable valuations, despite the sector's towering heights this year. &quot;REITs are not a homogenous group,&quot; says Chris Kuiper, equity analyst at CFRA Research. In just the past year, REITs have a performance difference of 160 percentage points.Which ones have the top prospects for the future? Read on as we examine the 10 best REITs to buy for 2020.

2019-12-03	2019-12-03 20:59:16	O	Realty Income Corporation	5 Top Stock Trades for Wednesday: COUP, PTON, CGC	It was another down day as traders fear that the trade war could worsen before it gets better. Let's look at a few top stock trades in the meantime. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Coupa Software (COUP)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comCoupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP) was just unlucky when it came to its earnings date. The market took a hit on Monday and Tuesday, with COUP reporting after the close on the former.It sent shares reeling at the open, but the stock has since recouped most of those losses. Okay fine, I'll show myself out after the charts, but this one is exciting.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe stock found support at the 50-day and 100-day moving average. After briefly breaking below these marks, shares reclaimed them and rallied higher. Conservative bulls who go long COUP can now use a close below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages as their stop-losses. More aggressive traders will use Tuesday's low.  * 7 Exciting Biotech Stocks to Buy Now Either way, let's see if the stock can rally up to resistance between $155 and $160. If it can, a breakout could be on deck. On the flip side, a move below Tuesday's low could put $125 and/or the 200-day moving average on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Peloton (PTON)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comFirst Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) was hated. Then it was apparently loved as momentum traders got a hold of it and ran it from the low-$20's to a high of $37 just the other day. The stock even rallied 4.5% in the face of a market-wide correction. There were only a handful of stocks showing relative strength that day.In any regard, shares were down 9% with less than one hour to go in Tuesday's trading session. It leaves PTON sitting right on the 78.6% retracement. After such a big move up, I'm not in any rush to buy Peloton on its first sign of a pullback.If the 78.6% retracement holds, let's see if PTON can erase some of these losses. If not, look for a test down into the $30 to $31 area, where Peloton will find a momentum breakout spot, as well as the 61.8% retracement and 20-day moving average. Falling below that level puts the $29 IPO price on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Canopy Growth (CGC)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comThe S&P 500 spent much of the session lower by more than 1%, yet cannabis stocks were holding up. In fact, they weren't just avoiding new lows, they were actually trading higher.Specifically regarding Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), bulls have to see two things from the stock, one of which needs to happen, the other of which can't happen. CGC needs to break above downtrend resistance and needs to avoid making new 52-week lows.Regarding the latter, the 50-day moving average has been a lid on the stock price and most recently rejected CGC amid its late-November surge. While holding up over $17.50 in the short-term is good, we need to see more before we can trust CGC on the long side. Clearing the 50-day is the first step in that process.Trading higher amid a down day in the markets could be a positive development in that regard. Let's keep an eye on this one. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Realty Income (O)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comOne of America's favorite REITs, Realty Income (NYSE:O) has been struggling lately. For those looking to buy, they may hope those struggles continue.Shares look to be setting up in a descending triangle pattern (blue lines). That's where downtrend resistance continues to squeeze a stock lower into a static level of support. If it gives way, it should usher in lower prices.I don't know that O will get down to $72, but it would make an excellent buy as it pertains to risk/reward. If its decline takes time, though, the 200-day moving average may support the stock before it gets there. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: FedEx (FDX)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comIt feels like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock has been struggling for a long time now. $150 has been support over the past year, with one slip down to $138 in October.Falling below $150 puts that sub-$140 level on watch again. Below that and even more selling can take place. Before we can really trust FDX on the long side, we need to see it reclaim downtrend resistance and the 50-week moving average.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-12-02	2019-12-02 19:01:00	O	Realty Income Corporation	10 High-Yield Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy in 2020	The typical American's life tends to be organized around monthly payments, yet somehow, monthly dividend stocks are the exception, not the norm.Your mortgage, your car payment, your phone bill ... even your Netflix payment is on a regular monthly payment plan. That's perfectly fine when you're working and are used to getting one or two paychecks every month. Budgeting is simply a matter of making sure your regular monthly income covers your monthly expenses with a little left over for emergencies.But once you retire, the situation changes. Sure, the Social Security check still comes monthly, and if you're lucky enough to still get a pension, your income generally comes in monthly as well. But the payout from the vast majority of your investments tends to be a lot more sporadic. Most stocks pay their dividends quarterly, and most bonds pay interest only semiannually.&quot;Cash flow mismatch is a common problem for recent retirees of all income levels,&quot; says Mario Randholm, founder of alternative investments specialist Randholm & Co. &quot;And the cash drag from keeping more cash on hand to compensate for erratic income reduces long-term returns.&quot;High-yield monthly dividend stocks can be part of the solution. Stocks that pay monthly dividends better align your income to your spending.You shouldn't buy a stock simply because it pays a monthly dividend, of course. That would be as ridiculous as choosing a mortgage bank based on the specific day of the month your payment would be due. Clearly, the stock needs to meet your criteria for yield, quality or growth prospects. But if a stock checks all the right boxes, why not also enjoy a monthly payout?Here, we'll look at 10 high-yield monthly dividend stocks to buy in 2020.

2019-11-21	2019-11-21 19:44:05	O	Realty Income Corporation	12 Dividend Stocks to Build a Monthly Income Calendar	Most U.S. companies that pay dividends do it quarterly, or once every 90 days or so (foreign firms usually pay but once or twice a year). If your income stocks are on the same schedule, your payments will come much less regularly than, say, your relentless gas and electric bills.That's why many retirees and other dividend fans try to arrange matters so the income arrives more frequently. You can easily assemble a set of excellent dividend stocks with staggered pay dates. That's the idea of our Dividend-a-Month portfolio, assembled by the editors of Kiplinger's Investing for Income: cash every month, without interruption. You can play the calendar without dabbling in questionable stocks or worrying about the reliability of dividends.As a practical matter, note two key dates for dividend stocks. One is the &quot;record date,&quot; the deadline to be a shareholder so you get the next payment. The record date is usually three to six weeks before the &quot;payment date,&quot; which is when the dollars should appear in your brokerage account. We're using the actual arrival of the payment to match companies with their months.

2019-10-18	2019-10-18 13:32:31	O	Realty Income Corporation	8 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy for Consistent Income	[Editor's note: &quot;8 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy for Consistent Income&quot; was previously published in July 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]With so much uncertainty weighing on key economic metrics -- most notably the U.S.-China trade war -- the idea of buying dividend stocks is an attractive one. Primarily, as passive-income generating securities, dividend-bearers are likely to weather volatility better than stocks that don't offer payouts. Plus, any capital returns are bonuses on top of the yield.Source: Shutterstock However, dividend stocks typically have one glaring weakness, especially for those who depend on stocks for income: their payouts occur on a quarterly basis. That's not particularly helpful when our society revolves around monthly cost expenditures, such as mortgages, car payments, and utility bills. And that's one of the reasons why monthly dividend stocks are so attractive.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnder this arrangement, you're receiving income 12 times a year as opposed to the usual four times. Because money has a time component to it, monthly dividend stocks allow investors much more flexibility. Also, if you like to reinvest dividends into more shares of the target asset, a monthly schedule allows you to advantage technical dynamics, such as a pricing dip.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Canopy Growth Stock That said, conservative investors should adopt the same precautions toward monthly dividend stocks as you would any income-generating investment. For instance, you should never jump aboard a company or fund merely because they pay out monthly. The key here is healthy cash flows and robust, stable sectors.At the same time, monthly dividend stocks offer speculators a reason to join in on the fun. With payouts every 30 days, sometimes risky, high-yielding names offer compelling opportunities. Of course, that depends on your personal tolerance to volatility.And with these cautionary notes out of the way, here are the eight best monthly dividend stocks to consider in 2019: LTC Properties (LTC)Source: Shutterstock When it comes to boring sectors as I mentioned above, I can't think of anything more sleep-inducing than senior care. At the same time, I can't think of anything more robust and relevant than the senior care market. That's why investors ought to take a long look at LTC Properties (NYSE:LTC) and LTC stock.As a viable name among monthly dividend stocks, LTC Properties utilizes a powerful tool as leverage: demographics. Baby Boomers are retiring in droves, which present serious challenges. But they also present opportunities. Increasingly, millennials are taking care of their aging family members, indirectly bolstering the case for LTC stock. That's because a senior may not have adequate funds, but a working millennial might.Furthermore, LTC stock has steadily trekked higher since the collapse of the 2000 tech bubble. Given the demographic tailwinds, I expect this longer-term trend to continue. Main Street Capital Corporation (MAIN)Source: Shutterstock Main Street Capital Corporation (NYSE:MAIN) is what experts refer to as a business development company. In this case, Main Street provides debt and equity financing to small and mid-tier private organizations. With a broad range of services, they're able to help scale businesses as their output expands.And supporting the case for MAIN stock is the current entrepreneurial environment. With the advent of e-commerce technologies, and the digitalization of everything, there's never been a better time than now to start a business. Moreover, the efficiencies inherent in smaller and more nimble organizations allow them to disrupt larger entities. Again, this supports the capital gains narrative for MAIN stock.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Canopy Growth Stock Just as importantly, the underlying company has a track record for delivering the goods under pressure. For instance, Main Street first offered MAIN stock to the public in 2007. While incurring volatility during the financial crisis, shares fought back. Today, it pays out a healthy dividend monthly that yields nearly 6%. Realty Income (O)Source: Shutterstock Whenever discussions about monthly dividend stocks come about, it's almost inevitable that you'll hear the name Realty Income (NYSE:O). And that's for good reason. Although a boring name, strong and consistent cash flows back up O stock. Obviously, this is critical for a company paying out monthly; after all, the money for dividends has to come from somewhere!But O stock has two reasons why it's especially relevant at this juncture. First, the Federal Reserve is likely to lower interest rates despite robust domestic economic metrics. Global economies don't necessarily share the same optimism as the U.S. Furthermore, the Fed is determined to learn the lessons that led to the disastrous 2008 financial crisis. Thus, investors seeking substantive yields will probably gravitate toward investments like O stock.Second, many of the commercial properties that Realty Income owns feature retailers who have competitive or natural moats against e-commerce threats like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). For example, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) customers like to see and test out their prospective products. You simply don't get that convenience from online channels. And this dynamic should keep the rent money flowing into O stock, which bolsters the dividend payout. Shaw Communications (SJR)Source: Shutterstock Canadian cable company Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR) is another name that frequently pops up among recommended monthly dividend stocks. It's not hard to see why. Currently, SJR stock has a dividend yield of 4.5%. Shares have also gained over 10% since January's opening price.More importantly, SJR stock should prove to be incredibly relevant in the years ahead. While cable is a dying industry due to the streaming revolution, Shaw levers a wireless subsidiary called Freedom Mobile Inc. And in April of this year, Freedom substantially expanded its wireless footprint in the Canadian market. This move improves Freedom's LTE service and lays the groundwork for the upcoming 5G rollout.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Canopy Growth Stock Finally, Shaw is a name that delivers a consistent revenue and earnings stream. As a result, it generally features reliable free cash flow -- which is key for stocks that pay out monthly. And while cord cutting hurts SJR stock in the nearer-term, I believe its spectrum coverage will outweigh these concerns. Pembina Pipeline (PBA)In years past, the oil market used to be a no-brainer: we consume energy and therefore we need energy. However, rising global supplies have depressed prices, making this sector a tough call. But infrastructural plays like Pembina Pipeline (NYSE:PBA) typically offer stability.No matter what happens in the underlying market, transportation of energy-related commodities is vital. In recent years, this dynamic supported the bullish case for PBA stock.Still, some risks cloud the narrative for PBA stock. First, shares have done well this year, moving up 21% year-to-date. But the equity has demonstrated some notable volatility in recent sessions. Thus, prospective buyers may want to wait a little before pulling the trigger.Further, Pembina doesn't have the greatest balance sheet. With a total debt to total equity ratio of 63, I wouldn't go all in on PBA stock. That said, energy remains a viable long-term play due to the uncertainties of renewable alternatives. Therefore, Pembina is among the riskier monthly dividend stocks that nonetheless deserves a careful look. Colony Credit Real Estate (CLNC)For those who are interested in higher stakes -- and of course, higher yields -- you should check out Colony Credit Real Estate (NYSE:CLNC). CLNC stock provides shareholders exposure to the world of commercial real estate credit REITs, or real estate investment trusts. Essentially, the company finances and manages commercial real estate debt.Now, I must give you some cautionary notes for CLNC stock. First, shares have not enjoyed the greatest time since its introduction in early 2018. A massive collapse in November of last year, along with the rest of the markets, has not inspired confidence.Also, as a commercial debt investor, Colony Credit faces turbulence from a possible downturn in the economy. With most folks talking about at least a correction coming up, CLNC stock is only for the risk tolerant.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Canopy Growth Stock However, shares have stabilized this year and has recently inched forward. Plus, with a yield of 12%, CLNC is one of the monthly dividend stocks that will consistently draw eyeballs. Armour Residential REIT (ARR)If you want another high-stakes REIT among monthly dividend stocks, but with a residential angle, consider Armour Residental REIT (NYSE:ARR). ARR stock gives you exposure to mortgage-backed securities which are backed by a federal entity, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.Of course, whenever anyone hears the term mortgage-backed securities, the last housing crisis comes immediately to mind. Certainly, no investment is foolproof and that should give you pause before diving into ARR stock.On the flipside, both the government and the mortgage industry have taken the lessons of the last decade to heart. Today, it's very difficult to quality for a mortgage unless you've got your financial house in order. Additionally, homeowners themselves have learned not to overextend themselves. Thus, this environment helps bring some confidence toward ARR stock.Lastly, Armour Residential has a history of consistently rich monthly payouts going back to 2015. But I wouldn't get too comfortable as the payouts have declined in value over this time. Also, ARR stock is down nearly  18% YTD. All that said, if you're willing to assume the risk, Armour is an interesting play due to the current economic resiliency. Mesa Royalty Trust (MTR)Source: Shutterstock A far riskier counterpart to Pembina Pipeline, Mesa Royalty Trust (NYSE:MTR) is truly an investment only for the hardened speculator. From the get-go, MTR stock screams caution.Let's start with the obvious. Mesa Royalty distinguishes itself from the other monthly dividend stocks on this list because the company doesn't own anything. Instead, it has an interest in oil and natural gas projects dispersed throughout the U.S. Basically, the dividend from MTR stock represents a share of the spoils from the facilities' output.This leads to my next concern about MTR stock: volatility. I'm not just talking about the share price, which historically is terrible. The payout fluctuates like mad. Needless to say, Mesa Royalty will not belong on a list of stable dividend stocks anytime soon.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Canopy Growth Stock Still, the company offers the prospect of a big payday that could arrive at any month. For instance, earlier in March, Mesa paid out nearly 19 cents for each share of MTR stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-07	2019-10-07 18:07:52	O	Realty Income Corporation	7 REITs to Buy Now for Dividend Growth	Stocks and bonds have largely rewarded market denizens since the Great Recession's market nadir in 2009, but investors great and small may be pondering how much leg the current rally has left. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) might be the asset class investors need to thread the needle in this tenuous bull market.This summer, prominent hedge-fund king Ray Dalio wrote that market paradigms are shifting, and the next decade's prospects are for slow growth and chronically soft interest rates. He believes the world's central banks, including America's Federal Reserve, &quot;doing more of this printing and buying of assets will produce more negative real and nominal returns that will lead investors to increasingly prefer alternative forms of money (e.g., gold) or other storeholds of wealth.&quot;While Dalio suggests investors might add gold to their portfolios, they might want to start researching REITs to buy, too. That's because real estate also has been a classic hedge against inflation, and it tends to benefit from low interest rates.Another upside: REITs can throw off substantial income; gold does not. By law, real estate investment trusts must distribute 90% of taxable income to shareholders through dividends. But the ultimate hedge is finding REITs that reliably (and, when possible, aggressively) increase their payouts, as that will keep the dividend from actually losing value due to inflation over time.Here are seven REITs to buy for investors who are interested in dividend growth. These real estate companies are poised to sustain and improve their cash distributions through the possibly sluggish, low-interest-rate future that some experts are predicting.

Sure, the Ferrari is a lot of fun to drive, and you look cool sitting behind the wheel. But it's also going to cost you a fortune, and high-performance cars spend a lot of time at the mechanic's shop.Now, compare that to a Honda Civic. You never really notice a Honda Civic on the road. It's utterly forgettable. But it's also just about indestructible, requires virtually no attention from you, and it quietly and efficiently does its job.Consider that mentality when you're tracking down stocks to buy. A highflying growth pick can be a lot of fun to own. You look smart owning it, and it's fun to talk about at parties. But when the market's mood swings the other way, you're often left with some nasty losses and a bruised ego. Meanwhile, that dividend-paying value stock in your portfolio might not be particularly interesting. But over the long haul, it's a lot less likely to give you problems. Like that Honda Civic, it will quietly do its job with no stress and no drama.&quot;Some of our most profitable trades over the years have been some of our most boring,&quot; explains Chase Robertson, principal of Houston-based RIA Robertson Wealth Management. &quot;We've done well for our clients by mostly avoiding the trendy sectors and focusing instead on value and income.&quot;Here are 11 boring but beautiful dividend stocks to buy now. They might not be much to look at, but they're likely to get the job done over the long term. And when you need them most - in retirement - they'll be less likely to break down on you.

2019-07-26	2019-07-26 13:30:49	O	Realty Income Corporation	6 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy	[Editor's note: &quot;6 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy&quot; was previously published in March 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]Most dividend stocks pay their shareholders quarterly, but a few dividend-yielding stocks offer monthly distributions. The group is small: less than 100, with many of the offerings being exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or closed-end actively managed funds. And so investors looking for monthly dividend stocks to buy are limiting their universe quite a bit.But there are quite a few attractive dividend-yielding stocks that pay out monthly. Several offer compelling cases for both their upside and safe dividends, with attributes that go beyond simply the timing of their distributions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now These six stocks all fit that bill, offering not only monthly dividends but potential share price appreciation and reasonable payout ratios. Realty Income (O)Realty Income (NYSE:O) is the best-known of the monthly dividend payers, to the point that it has trademarked the slogan &quot;The Monthly Dividend Company.&quot;In terms of past performance, the monthly payouts have been just the cherry on top of a delicious sundae. O stock has returned -- including dividends -- an average of 15.8% annually since 1994, according to a investor presentation. It has been one of the best-performing real estate investment trusts in the market over that stretch.O stock has become much more expensive over the past few months, bouncing more than 25% over the last year. But there's still a nice bull case at the moment. O yields nearly 4%,The portfolio looks both safe and nicely diversified, with Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) being its two largest tenants. Considering Realty Income's track record, it's worth staying long.Source: Shutterstock  LTC Properties (LTC)Like with O stock, there's still a solid bull case for senior housing and healthcare property REIT LTC Properties (NYSE:LTC).With the &quot;baby boom&quot; generation aging, demand should stay strong. Meanwhile, LTC still yields nearly 5%.  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now There are some risks here: investors are concerned that changing healthcare insurance reimbursement policies will impact LTC's tenants. The stock actually hit a five-year low earlier this year as a result. But sentiment has improved -- and should continue to do so. With LTC still trading at a reasonable 11.9 P/E, the shares could rally. Add to that its yield, paid monthly, and it's definitely worth a look.Source: Shutterstock  Shaw Communications (SJR)Canadian telecommunications company Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR) hasn't posted particularly strong performance over the past few years. SJR actually has declined 3.5% over the past year.There are some concerns about the wireless industry in Canada, much as there are in the U.S.But with a 4.34% dividend yield and an 20.04x forward price-to-earnings multiple, SJR isn't pricing in much improvement. With 5G a potential catalyst in the mid-term, there's a nice case for SJR stock at current levels.Dividends are announced in Canadian dollars, which can affect the payouts received by American investors. Still, a monthly dividend, a 4.6%-plus yield and a potential upside provide a nice combination here.Source: Marriott Select Service Hotels via Flickr (Modified) Apple Hospitality REIT (APLE)Apple Hospitality REIT (NYSE:APLE) owns 241 hotels in the U.S. -- 115 of the hotels operate under the Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) banner, with the remaining 126 flying under the Hilton (NYSE:HLT) flag.Those two strong brands underpin a strong portfolio. Geographic diversification limits downside risk as well. With an impressive 7.7% yield paid monthly, that makes APLE one of the best dividend-yielding stocks in terms of monthly income.  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now The story admittedly isn't perfect. Growth has been relatively meager, and APLE's dividend has stayed at 10 cents per share per month since a 2015 IPO. Investors would have been much better off buying either MAR or HLT, both of which have better than doubled from early 2016 lows.But for income-focused investors, APLE looks like a strong pick.Source: Shutterstock  Pembina Pipeline (PBA)Pembina Pipeline (NYSE:PBA) is the biggest company on this list and the riskiest. Pipeline companies generally are lower-risk plays in the oil and gas space, but Pembina does have some concerns. Canadian oil stocks have struggled of late, and Pembina levered up to acquire Veresen last year.That said, there's still a lot to like here. Earnings increased in the double-digits last year, largely due to the acquisition. PBA pays a solid 4.9% dividend. Valuation is relatively reasonable against U.S. rivals like Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) and Plains All American Pipeline (NYSE:PAA).If Pembina can continue to grow once the Veresen acquisition is fully integrated, there should be nice upside on top of the  nearly 5% yield.Source: Shutterstock  STAG Industrial (STAG)STAG Industrial (NYSE:STAG) isn't necessarily a spectacular stock, but it's one that can drive steady long-term returns along with monthly payouts. The company leases industrial buildings to single tenants and has a nicely diversified portfolio from both a customer and geographic standpoint. The average lease length currently is nearly five years, which should keep recent dividend growth intact.  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now Longer-term, there are minor concerns. Valuation isn't cheap, with a forward P/E of 73. An economic downturn could lead to lease cancellations or even customer bankruptcies.

2019-07-02	2019-07-02 18:25:45	O	Realty Income Corporation	25 Stocks Every Retiree Should Own	Retirement is a major life milestone, eclipsed only by marriage or the birth of your first child in terms of financial impact. For many, it's an exhilarating leap into the unknown. In your working years, you can take investing setbacks in stride, as portfolio losses can be offset by new savings or working an extra year or two.But once retired, you no longer have that luxury. Your portfolio must last for the the rest of your life, and that of your spouse as well. So, the decision of what retirement stocks you should include your portfolio is an important one.An ideal retirement stock will pay a healthy dividend. As Sonia Joao, president of Houston-based RIA Robertson Wealth Management, explains, &quot;Four out of five of our clients are in or near retirement, and essentially all of them tell us the same thing. They want safe, secure streams of income to meet their living expenses and replace their paychecks.&quot;While a good dividend is probably the most important characteristic to look for, it's certainly not the only one. Yields across most asset classes are lower today than in years past, and retirees need growth to stay ahead of inflation. So, while a retirement portfolio should have a large share of income stocks, it also will include some growth names for balance.The following are 25 stocks every retiree should own. This group of retirement stocks includes both pure income plays and growth companies, with a focus on very-long-term performance and durability.

2019-06-20	2019-06-20 17:38:06	O	Realty Income Corporation	The Best 3 Monthly Dividend Stocks for Your Retirement	Investing for retirement should always be focused on certainty of returns. And while dividend stocks might not appear to be an important part of building up a retirement portfolio, they do provide a better level of certainty in returns. By collecting dividends and reinvesting them, a portfolio can rise in value over time.Source: Shutterstock And in turn, when you're retired, dividends provide cash flows which can be used to fund your life in retirement.The vast number of U.S.-listed companies pay their dividends on a quarterly basis. And beyond the borders of the nation, many companies stretch out their distributions to bi-annual or even annual payments. Their argument is that only after the company's fiscal year is wrapped up should the cash crumbs be spread out to the pesky shareholders.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut that's not how the folks residing in the C-Suites see it when it comes to their own remunerations. They prefer to pay themselves every so many weeks with bonuses and other perks throughout the year.But there is a collection of companies that don't see shareholders as a burden, but rather as the rightful owners of the company. And as such, they are paid regularly each and every month -- often with rising levels of distributions for attractive dividend yields. And these yields work to build up a retirement portfolio more quickly through reinvestment and will later provide monthly income in the retirement years to come.  * 6 Stocks Ready to Bounce on a Trade Deal Moreover, the dividends paid are ample -- more than enough to cover the meager level of inflation in the U.S. economy. And that's a low bar. Because with the core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Index -- which measures the overall consumer spending cost changes in the U.S. economy and not just a constructed market basket like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) -- running at 1.57%, inflation is firmly at bay for now and the foreseeable future. U.S. Inflation … What Inflation?US Core PCE Source BloombergThere are varying industries that have companies paying monthly dividends. But they tend to be in businesses that are cash cow in style that provide dependable profits from which distributions can be paid. I've assembled a nice collection of companies that you can select to bump up your own portfolio's cash payouts with regular to rising monthly dividends. Main Street Comes to Wall StreetMain Street Capital Corporation (NYSE:MAIN) is set up as a business development company (BDC), which is codified under U.S. tax law under the Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980. This act passed by Congress and signed by then President Jimmy Carter came as the U.S. economy was in a pickle. Inflation was a problem and banks were reticent to lend to small-to-middle-market companies. They were concerned over the inflation risk of fixed lending facilities as well as the underlying credit risks in the business sector.The result is that the act extended the Investment Companies Act of 1940 which enabled non-bank companies to be formed that would be largely exempt from corporate income taxes if they made loans and equity participation investments in small-to-middle-market companies.Therefore, they would be passthrough securities with investors getting paid the majority of profits that could also come with passthrough tax deductions to shield their individual current income tax liabilities.Main Street makes loans with some additional equity participation to companies in the $10 million to $100 million revenue range. This is exactly what the U.S. market needs, as many of the traditional middle-market commercial bank lenders have largely been sidelined thanks to onerous regulatory and capital rules stemming from legislative and administrative responses to the post 2007-2008 financial mess. And while there has been a great deal of regulatory and legislative reform during 2018, many of the skilled lender talent has left traditional banks and in turn they've been found in Main Street and other non-bank lenders.Main Street gets to make loans with less regulatory and compliance costs. As a result, its efficiency ratio is a fraction of middle-market lending banks. This means that its costs are lower and profitability is much higher.Revenues are rising, with gains running at an annual basis of 13.49% on average over the past three years.Main Street (MAIN)The revenues and profitability fuel a rising dividend distribution which has been climbing by an average annual rate of 2.06 over the past three years. And with a monthly payout yielding an annual rate of 6%, Main Street is a great start to getting monthly dividend payouts. Triple Net WinnerEPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) which focuses on a very risk-controlled and efficient way to profit from real estate assets known as longer-term, triple-net leases. Triple-net leases are leases that are made to corporate tenants that are not only responsible for lease payments but also for taxes, insurance and general maintenance -- hence the term &quot;triple.&quot;This means that EPR acquires properties that have little additional costs over their leased lifespans. Thus, less management cost as well as less risk of uncertainty over the lease term for costs of upkeep, or higher taxes or changes in insurance costs.The benefits of this means that EPR can run more efficiently in its operations with lower provisions for cost challenges for its portfolio of properties. This means more certainty in cashflows from its portfolio of properties, which in turn supports more stable revenues for dividend payouts.EPR focuses on educational properties, entertainment facilities and resort properties and facilities.The educational properties involve locations that are contracted by early educational centers, as well as charter schools and private schools. These provide stable, reliable tenants that commit to long-term leases that are likely to be renewed to attract and keep their student populations.The entertainment facilities are largely leased to movie megaplex theaters from national and international chains with ample branding. These are in major markets with plenty of demand supporting longer-term commitments for the properties.The resorts and facilities include a variety of activities that range from major ski resorts like Camelback Mountain to golf courses and resorts, including from operator, TopGolf. And EPR also owns a collection of water parks in prime locations. All of these benefit from the consumer trend of experience spending, which supports longer-term commitments from the operators of the properties and facilities.All in all, the properties of EPR have been increasing revenues significantly with average annual gains running at 18.51% for the past three years alone.EPR Properties (EPR)The triple net leases from the properties with longer-term leases continue to support significant dividend distributions. The distributions continue to rise by an average annual basis of 6.10%. and with a current yield of 5.7%, EPR is a great monthly dividend payer. The Right Retail for Monthly Dividend StocksMention retailers and many investors will think that they are doomed by the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online behemoths. But not all retail can be replaced by a website and a few clicks. In fact, one of the more pervasive companies profiting in the retail space actually benefits from the surge of online shopping. That would be FedEx (NYSE:FDX) which operates thousands of stores where you can send back many of those returns from online spending sprees of American households.Then there's another retail space that gets special attention at the start of each year but carries interest all through the seasons. Gyms are always in demand, either for those who need or want to lose weight or those that want to keep the pounds off while staying in better health. Gyms are a reliable part of the American retail space. And one of the leaders in this retail market space is LA Fitness.Then we have one of the major go-to retailers when it comes to picking up or having prescription drugs delivered. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is a leader among local pharmacies and is also a prime place to visit to pick up last-minute items for health, beauty, food and household goods that just can't always be fulfilled by the online space -- even by Amazon Now.And one of the other prime retail spaces that's also a defense against online vendors is the super-discounted dollar stores. These stores provide bargain buys for all kinds of consumers on a regular basis. They tend to have sticky and reliable customers, making for good retail space. And two of the leaders include Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Family Dollar (NASDAQ:DLTR).What do the five companies all have in common? They are all long-term triple-net lease customers of Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O).Realty Income Corporation (O)Realty Income is set up as a real estate investment trust (REIT) and its tenants include the above companies.Revenues are rising across the portfolio, with gains running on an average annual basis of 9.07% over the past three years alone.This supports a nice monthly dividend distribution which continues to be raised by Realty Income by an average annual rate of 4.11% over the past five years alone. And with a current dividend yield of 3.7%, it makes for a great monthly inflation-trouncing dividend payer that rounds out my collection for your retirement portfolio.Now that I've presented some of my favorite monthly dividend stocks for a retirement portfolio, perhaps you might like to see more of my market research and recommendations.

2019-06-13	2019-06-13 16:56:13	O	Realty Income Corporation	5 Safe Ways to Earn 3%	It seems like forever ago, but the average 12-month certificate of deposit (CD) used to yield well more than 5%.In fact, prior to the tech wreck of 2000 - and the start of two decades of experimental monetary policy by the Federal Reserve - 5% would have been considered low. It wasn't usual to see CD yields over 10% in the 1980s. Those were the days!It's unlikely that we'll ever see 10% CD rates again in our lifetimes. Even 5% would seem like a stretch in a world in which the average 12-month CD still yields less than 1% after more than three years of Fed rate hikes.It's important to remember, though, that the high yields of the past came at a time of much higher inflation. At today's lower inflation rates, even a 3% yield allows you to stay well ahead of inflation. You're not getting rich quick at that yield, but it's respectable. And importantly, it can be done safely.Today, we're going to look at five safe ways to pocket a yield of at least 3%. While you might want to push for a higher return on your long-term investment portfolio, you can consider these as options for your cash savings that you might need in the next one to five years.

2019-05-17	2019-05-17 18:37:58	O	Realty Income Corporation	7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks)	One thing is certain. In volatile markets, income is a great alternative. And real estate investment trusts (REITs) are delivering some of the best returns in the space. What's more, that outperformance should continue for a long time to come, with the perfect blend of slow growth and low interest rates in the US.Because these REITs are U.S.-focused, it also means that they're not vulnerable to external forces for their further successes. I did some digging and found seven high-yield REITs that will pay you inflation-beating yields while they also grow their asset values. These are some of the top names in the business that are in the best sectors for growth well into the future.  * 10 Baby Boomer Stocks to Buy These picks are also smart, conservative ways to play sectors like tech, healthcare and the bond markets. And they all get top ranks from my Portfolio Grader for timeliness, as well as strength.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips High-Yield REITs That Will Pay You: Arbor (ABR)Arbor Realty Trust Inc (NYSE:ABR) is a unique REIT in that it doesn't own properties as much as it finances properties. Its specialty is multifamily and senior housing as well as healthcare and diverse commercial properties.While it only has a $1 billion market cap, this is actually a great advantage for growth investors looking for a serious income kick. Because it's relatively small, it's leveraged to growth - and the REIT sector is growing fast.For example, year to date, ABR stock is up nearly 30% and in the past 12 months it's up over 40%. But the kicker is, it's still trading at a P/E of 9.If that isn't enough for you, it's delivering a whopping 8.2% dividend, even after all that growth. Realty Income (O)Realty Income Corp (NYSE:O) is one of the founding REITs in the market, established in 1969. Another unique aspect of this tried-and-true trust is the fact that it delivers its income monthly.Usually, REITs and other dividend stocks pay out their dividends quarterly. If you're an income investor, setting up a varied income stream from your holdings is a good way to keep income flowing regularly.But beyond convenience, O is a rock-solid REIT that has some of the top names in the industry leasing its properties from coast to coast. That means its nearly 4% dividend is solid.  * Top 7 Dow Jones Stocks of 2019 -- So Far It also means, the O can build off its clients' successes. O stock is up 33% in the past 12 months and is a good choice if you're looking for a conservative consumer retail play. Blackstone Group (BX)Blackstone Group LP (NYSE:BX) isn't technically a REIT. It's an investment and fund management service that operates as a limited partnership.The reason it's in this list is because it's an excellent firm that has significant investments in real estate around the world, as well as all the other investment services it provides.What's more, it also delivers a substantial - and reliable - 5.3% dividend.BX is another firm that like the REITs, will benefit mightily from this Goldilocks economy. Up 35% year-to-date with a P/E of 16, there is still plenty of headroom and opportunity for BX to keep on running. Digital Realty (DLR)Digital Realty Trust Inc (NYSE:DLR) specializes in owning and managing properties for data centers as well as co-location services.The latter is a space where data centers are available for rental to retail customers. For example, if you're a smaller company that is ready to launch your product but you don't want to spend a ton of money on a data center until you know how much capacity you need, you use a co-location service so you can right-size your build.DLR is the leader in this fast-growing sector and has been on a tear for a while, since it's also a way to play the cloud computing trend without having to invest directly in volatile cloud stocks.As 5G ramps up in the U.S, there will be another wave of demand for data centers and server space since 5G is almost 1,000x faster than current 4G networks. That means more streaming as well as AI-driven systems and internet of things (IoT) communication (e.g., smart houses, driverless cars, etc).  * 10 Baby Boomer Stocks to Buy Because of its promise and sector leadership, DLR stock is very popular, so its dividend sits around 3.7% and its growth in the past 12 months is around 11%. It's a solid, steady way to play tech growth. WP Carey (WPC)WP Carey Inc (NYSE:WPC) is another REIT that has been around for a very long time, founded in 1973. Basically, it owns buildings and manages them for its clients. It also manages buildings for clients, as well as runs its own real estate investment business, including placements for other REITs.What makes WPC unique is its 'triple net lease' model, where its clients pay for taxes, maintenance and insurance on the buildings the lease, in addition to rent and utilities. So, WPC just owns the buildings and manages the properties. That's a pretty good deal and means WPC can run a much leaner operation since it isn't dealing with all these other aspects.And those improved margins get passed through to investors as its impressive 5.1% dividend. The stock is also up a solid 25% in the past year. This is a great choice if you're looking for a conservative play in commercial real estate stronger corporate growth. American Campus Communities (ACC)American Campus Communities Inc (NYSE:ACC) is a REIT that specializes in owning, developing and managing on- and off-campus housing for college students.Gone are the days of the rough-and-ready college dorms. Nowadays, the dorms are like nice apartments. Granted, for the money it costs to go to college these days, that may not be too surprising.But the fact is, housing is a big part of the competitive process for colleges. If a student is choosing one school over another, many times, all other things being equal, housing could be the tipping point.ACC currently has 206 communities on or around 96 campuses, with 83 on-campus developments. Plus, this model is a great feature for many schools that don't want to take on the massive efforts and costs to develop and manage these projects themselves.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before They Tank Your Portfolio ACC is up 26% in the past year and is still delivering a solid 4% dividend. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)Medical Properties Trust Inc (NYSE:MPW) rounds off the group as the featured medical and healthcare facilities REIT.Like WPC, MPW is a triple net lease company -- the tenant pays taxes, maintenance and insurance on the property as well as rent and utilities -- that also offers financing to its clients. It can provide 100% financing to companies looking to develop projects from $10 million to $1 billion. Most conventional lenders only offer 60-70% financing.Given the fact that healthcare in the US is a significant long-term issue, especially as the population ages and baby boomers begin to retire in significant numbers, MPW is in the middle of a significant megatrend.With scores of properties across the US, it also has expanded its business to Europe where it has facilities in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy.Up 40% in the past 12 months and still delivering a robust 5.5% dividend and a PE ratio of a mere 6.7, MPW is a compelling way to play the global healthcare trend in industrialized countries.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-05-10	2019-05-10 18:00:58	O	Realty Income Corporation	7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Trade War Reignites	As of midnight this morning, the U.S. boosted tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. The markets had expected this to be the week that this deal got done, but it blew up instead, and no one is sure how it ends at this point. It seems the market is still hoping for the best, while hedging for bad news. But it certainly hasn't priced in a worst-case scenario … yet.A couple positives: The tariffs don't hit until the current fleet of cargo ships that left port as of the deadline hit U.S. shores. That gives the parties a softer deadline of about 3-4 weeks to hammer something out before the tariffs take effect.And remember, regardless of the rhetoric, this is going to hit U.S. consumers and business. The companies will be paying more for goods and passing those prices on to consumers. It hits China, too, but the lion's share is out of U.S. pocketbooks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSecond, economic numbers out of China have been trending down. That means they may be more interested in cutting a deal than they were when their numbers were coming in well above average.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy on Overcast Days Regardless of how it pans out, it's a good time to add some income to your portfolio. These 7 dividend stocks to buy as the trade war reignites all get As in my Portfolio Grader for their momentum and rank high for fundamentals as well. They're great long-term foundation stocks. Best Dividend Stocks: Blackstone Group LP (BX)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5.5%Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) is a private equity firm that specializes in alternative investments (like real estate, infrastructure, etc), hedge funds and investment funds -- including closed-end funds -- for institutions and high-net-worth individuals.Set up as a limited partnership, it means investors are direct owners that participate in the company's net profits in the form of dividends. Its current dividend is a healthy 5.5% in the past year, and that's on top of a nearly 25% run for the stock in the past 12 months. That's a very respectable return on one of the world's top private equity firms that sports a $47 billion market cap.BX is built for a slow-growth economy. What's more, if a full-blown trade war does show up, this is the kind of stock that institutions will flock to for shelter from any storms. Dominion Energy (D)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5%Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) is one of the top electric utilities on the East Coast. Its primary market is Virginia, but it has reach into neighboring states and its unregulated business has prized assets like its Cove Point liquified natural gas (LNG) export facility in Maryland.Cove Point is the only LNG export facility on the East Coast at this point and one of only three import and storage facilities. This is a huge asset that grows in value for the utility every year, given the demand for natural gas in Europe, where prices are significantly higher.D also has a very good relationship with Virginia regulators, so that side of the business is strong.  * 7 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Stay Far Away From While the stock is up a solid 18% in the past 12 months, its rock-solid dividend kicks in another 5% on top of that. Its Mid-Atlantic Pipeline project has hit some snags, but the President Donald Trump administration is prepared to get the project done one way or the other. Darden Restaurants (DRI)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 2.5%Looking for restaurant dividend stocks? Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) sold its iconic Red Lobster seafood chain about 5 years ago now, and it hasn't looked back.Remember, it still owns Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains at the &quot;everyman&quot; level and high-end spots like Eddie V's and Capitol Grille. What's more, it has some mid-priced boutique restaurants like Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze and Yard House in there as well.The point is, losing Red Lobster was a great opportunity to pivot into new markets and develop new ideas. And given the fact DRI stock started way back in 1938, staying nimble and seeing the next big thing coming along is part of its DNA.Given the continued strong economy -- more money for consumers to go out for bite more often -- its 33% return is impressive, but not surprising. There's more of that to come. Its reliable 2.5% dividend isn't a bell-ringer, but it shows that the company is investor friendly and that it can deliver, come what may. Hormel Foods (HRL)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 2.1%Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) began in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota, as a meat packing business that started national expansion ahead of the competition.Not only did HRL produce the first canned ham in the U.S., but it transformed that business by the 1930s into brands that live on today like Hormel Chili, Dinty Moore Stew and SPAM. Remember, this was at the height of the Depression and HRL was actually expanding its product line downwards so that people could buy cheap, quality food products.By the late '30s, HRL had introduced profit sharing for its employees.And that sense of loyalty combined with innovation has continued at the company. It now owns natural meat brands like Columbus and Applegate, as well as ethnic brands like Chi-Chi's, Embasa and Del Fuente. It even has its Hormel fuse burger brand that's a lean protein burger with whole grains and veggies.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips This is a competitive sector, but HRL has proven it can compete and endure where others flame out. Its 2.1% dividend is as reliable as sunrise; it's a great long-term foundation stock. Realty Income (O)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4%Realty Income (NYSE:O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates properties for some of the biggest retail names in the business.Bear in mind, it doesn't operate big malls, but generally stand-alone properties. It's top 5 tenants, in order, are Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), 7 Eleven, FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and LA Fitness. Its longer list of tenants is equally impressive.What's more, O pays its dividend monthly rather than quarterly, so it's a great choice for income seekers that want to diversify their income stream. Right now, it's delivering a 4% dividend that has been rock-solid for many years.And on the growth side, O stock is up 28% in the past 12 months. Given the slow-growth economy ahead, that's just the tip of its potential. REITs are one of the hottest sectors for 2019 and beyond. Kinder Morgan (KMI)Source: Roy Luck via FlickrDividend Yield: 5.1%Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) calls itself an energy infrastructure company, but what that means in laymen's terms is it's a major midstream energy company. Boiled down further, it's a energy pipeline and storage company.And that is a very good business to be in these days.Granted, it wasn't an easy path to get here. KMI used to be one of the first master limited partnerships in the burgeoning energy industry at the turn of the 21st Century. But when energy prices tanked and supply dried up, KMI dumped its MLP structure and became a corporation. That was 2014.Now, the stock is back, along with energy demand both domestic and abroad. And KMI is once again delivering an outsized dividend, just like in the good ol' days.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Tick All the Boxes Currently KMI stock, which is up 18% for the year, is paying out a healthy and sustainable 5.1% dividend. And if this slow, steady economic growth continues, so will the returns for KMI stock and many of its fellow dividend stocks. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.9%Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) may seem like an odd stock to be in a short list of dividend stocks, but it actually makes a lot of sense.First, QCOM, one of the leading mobile chip and equipment makers and licensing companies, has paid a dividend for a pretty long time.Second, now that all its lawsuits are over, QCOM is ready for the next wave of mobility technology products.Recently, the Justice Department interceded in a case before the Federal Trade Commission about the size of QCOM's royalty payments. It recommended that the FTC go easy on the firm because the U.S. needs a reliable 5G partner that's U.S.-based.This rekindled affection for QCOM is evident in the stock's 51% return in the past 12 months. It has been a few years since the stock has been in favor, so there's plenty of headroom left.Plus, its nearly 3% dividend is a welcome kicker for this top-performing tech on the rebound.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-05-08	2019-05-08 20:08:12	O	Realty Income Corporation	5 Top Stock Trades for Thursday: Look at These Winners	The stock market gave bulls a little reprieve on Wednesday, rallying slightly on optimism over a potential trade deal. However, there have been some stocks that have shown relative strength over the past few days compared to the broader market. There are also strong names that are barely down compared to their peers. What are they? Let's look at some top stock trades that have been holding up. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Microsoft  Click to EnlargeA very orderly pullback has occurred in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). For two straight sessions, MSFT stock has tested and held the 20-day moving average. I like simple setups and this one is simple.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Big Announcements From Google I/O 2019 A break below Tuesday's low can stop short-term bulls out, who can look to get long again near $121 and/or the 50-day moving average. A bounce back to $130 could be in the cards if the 20-day holds up. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: JPMorgan  Click to EnlargeAfter a strong reaction to earnings last month, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock has been surprisingly resilient over the last few weeks and days. The pullback is very similar to MSFT, in that the 20-day moving average continues to hold as support.A break below $110 could trigger a move to fill the gap back near $107. With the 50-day and 200-day moving average in this area, as well as prior resistance near $106, I would feel comfortable nibbling JPM for a longer-term position down near this level. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Okta  Click to EnlargeNow let's look at some stocks with relative strength. That is, the ones that are outperforming at a time where the market is under pressure. Watching these names are very important, because they are usually the ones that perform the best when the market snaps back and begins to rally. Take note of that (just like you should take note of the chart for Realty Income (NYSE:O)).If you only looked at Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) this week, you probably wouldn't even know there was a selloff in the stock market. Shares continue to trend higher and so long as it maintains the 20-day moving average, it will likely continue that trend. I'm a buyer on a pullback into the 20-day.So long as it maintains $100 in the short-term, $110 is doable. As always though, know your timeframe and risk tolerance. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Starbucks  Click to EnlargeLike Okta, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is showing no signs of stress. In fact, the stock is making a brand new high on Wednesday. Eventually these trends will end, but at a time where the market is under pressure, now is not the time to bail on SBUX.Bulls can stay long against the 20-day moving average. A break below will cause short-term investors to consider locking in some gains, but over $76 and Starbucks still looks good. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Chipotle  Click to EnlargeChipotle (NYSE:CMG) pulled back a few weeks ago, but has been strong all week while the overall market has been under pressured.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips Amid its selloff, CMG just touched its 50-day and maintained uptrend support (blue line). The setup is simple here, too. A breakout over $720 triggers more gains. A break the 20-day and uptrend support likely summons another test of the 50-day.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long SBUX.

2019-05-01	2019-05-01 18:00:22	O	Realty Income Corporation	10 High-Yield Monthly Dividend Stocks and Funds to Buy	Monthly dividend stocks might seem like a gimmick, given that most American stocks pay out dividends quarterly. But they provide a very real service to income investors - especially those who have reached retirement.Capital gains can be fleeting, as we saw during last year's two brutal corrections, but a regular stream of dividends and interest can actually put the cash in your hands to pay the bills, whether the market goes up, down or sideways.Unfortunately, most income investments are designed remarkably poorly for their task. Bonds generally pay semiannually (twice per year). That made sense back in the days when &quot;coupon payments&quot; were literally based on paper coupons, but it hardly makes sense in an era in which bonds are nothing more that electronic entries. And again, most stocks pay their dividends quarterly. That's nice, but it's hardly helpful when your bills come monthly.It wouldn't be particularly prudent to make the monthly payment schedule your primary reason for buying a stock. Clearly, safety and growth prospects matter far more. But all else equal, a portfolio of monthly dividend stocks can give your portfolio a baseline of income to tide you over in those months when your bonds and regular quarterly dividend payers aren't paying.With that in mind, here are 10 solid monthly dividend stocks and funds to buy. These are also mostly high-yielding investments, ranging from 3% to 15%.

2019-04-25	2019-04-25 20:21:20	O	Realty Income Corporation	5 Top Stock Trades for Friday Morning: Facebook, 3M, Tesla and Comcast	It was another sleepy day for the major indices, but not a quiet day with individual stocks. We saw some massive moves in the market following earnings, so let's get started and see some top stock trades for Friday. Keep an eye on Realty Income (NYSE:O) as it bounces off trend support into potential moving average resistance, as well as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). JNJ put in another higher low on the chart, increasing the odds of a breakout over $140.   Finally, Ford (NYSE:F) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) report earnings tonight, two trades we laid out on Wednesday. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: FacebookShares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are popping on Thursday, up 6.4% after the company impressed with its earnings results. After consolidating over $180 for the past few weeks, FB stock is on the move once again. It pushed through that important $185 to $190 zone, the former of which also sports the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement for the 52-week range. Shares backed off $200, as profit takers unloaded a bit after the big rally this year.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years Now what? I want to see FB stock hold this $185 to $190 area as support now. Ideally, FB would give us a pullback into this area, allowing its moving averages to catch up a bit and consolidate some of this move. If it holds, it increases the odds of a move back over $200. That said, the bullish momentum could continue with a pullback too. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: 3M CoNot making such a healthy move on Thursday is 3M Co (NYSE:MMM). Disappointing earnings results drilled the stock to the tune of 13%. Will support buoy the stock and keep it from more losses? $190-ish has played a role in the past and $192 also has the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement for the 52-week range, so it's certainly possible. That said, $180 had to make a stand twice in the fourth quarter. With the 200-week at $182 and with a quarter like this, I wouldn't be surprised to see some more selling before buyers make a big stand. See how it handles $190 to $192-ish on Friday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: AltriaAltria (NYSE:MO) is also getting drilled on earnings, down 6% on the day. The stock has been making a series of lower highs and the 200-week moving average acted as resistance over the past few weeks. That doesn't bode well for intermediate term bulls out there. MO is now below all three major moving averages on the weekly chart, with no real support coming into play until $48. It's possible it finds a bottom and reverses before that point, but shares look unattractive until $52. Unless it reclaims $52, MO is in no man's land. If it does recover, see how it handles the 20-week and 50-week moving averages near $54. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: ComcastComcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) was a winner on Thursday, rallying 3% on its quarterly earnings results. It cleared $40 a few weeks ago and this week's gains only add to bulls' recent optimism. A potential deal with Disney (NYSE:DIS) over Comcast's stake in Hulu could be a win-win for both companies too.   This week's low came right at the stock's prior weekly closing high in January 2018. A grind up past $44 -- near the stock's highs -- is definitely possible. CMCSA would look interesting on a pullback though, especially down into this week's lows near $42. It's where the 10-week moving average and uptrend support come into play too.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: TeslaTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock did not decline the way many bears were hoping on Thursday. That's despite the automaker missing on earnings and revenue expectations. In any regard, the stock is showing signs of a breakdown.Shares have been building a base under the 200-week moving average and remain in a steep downtrend. Below the $242 area and TSLA will be making multi-year lows.  * 5 Hot Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Weather Heats Up From the long side, this one does not look tempting. For that to change, it needs to hold this area and get back above its 200-week moving average. On top of that, it needs to clear downtrend resistance. If it doesn't, a flush lower is more than possible.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long JNJ.

2019-04-25	2019-04-25 15:53:28	O	Realty Income Corporation	5 Big-Yield REITs to Check Out Now	Editor's note: This story was previously published in February 2019. It has since been updated and republished.No matter what state the market is in, there's always one thing investors are looking for and that's yield. During bull markets, bear markets and periods of chop, investors want to get paid. Naturally, that brings real estate stocks into the discussion. Because real estate investment trusts (REITs for short) are required to pay out 90% of their earnings to investors, these are generally big sources of yield for income investors.REITs don't just pay out attractive yields; many of these companies are terrific operators too. So not only do investors get to collect a solid dividend yield, but they also get to invest in some fantastic businesses.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Today Just like every security, some are blue-chip REITs and others we shouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. So let's avoid some of those red flags and instead go with the best real estate stocks out there, many of which recently reported earnings.  Source:  Yuriy Trubitsyn via Unsplash Realty Income (O)Of those companies that recently reported earnings, Realty Income (NYSE:O) is one of them. Realty, known as &quot;The Monthly Dividend Company,&quot; also happens to be one of the best-run REITs out there.The company recently announced its 85th consecutive dividend increase, making it one of the market's strongest income plays. Shares still yield 3.84%, despite the stock sitting near multi-year highs near $70.Now that O has pushed through $70, it could spark a larger breakout. It helps that the Fed is on hold with its rate hikes while the economy continues to chug along. That bodes well for Realty and a whole host of other REIT plays. But make no mistake about it, this one is as blue-chip as they come. Technically speaking, I wouldn't worry about O unless it fell below $62.50.  Source: Shutterstock  Digital Realty (DLR)Breaking off of the more traditional REIT path is a technology play in Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR). The &quot;young&quot; company was founded about 15 years ago, is headquartered (fittingly) in San Francisco and has quickly worked its way up to a $24 billion market cap.DLR &quot;provides data center, colocation, and interconnection solutions,&quot; with its first segment providing it a big chunk of its business. It takes one simple consideration to see why DLR is a name to be long.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years The cloud operates in data centers and with large companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others gathering an ever-growing collection of data, all of that needs to go somewhere, right? As more data is created, it needs somewhere to be stored.Further, as A.I. applications begin to grow, these programs require a massive amount of data. Data centers are where it's stored and that's why DLR has done so well.Investors need to realize this is a secular shift and companies like DLR are going to be there to soak up the dollars. The stock yields &quot;just&quot; 3.73% and has been red-hot lately. If we get can get a pullback to the backside of former downtrend resistance or even just $116 for more aggressive investors, it's worth considering on the long side.    Source: Shutterstock   Ventas (VTR)Another well-known, high-quality REIT is Ventas (NYSE:VTR).It hasnt had a great 2019, but that should change after its latest revenue beat.The &quot;transition&quot; word doesn't usually sit too well with investors, but seeing VTR return to its stronger ways must have encouraged its investor base. The fact that it still yields 5.23% even though its well below the 52-week high means there's still room for growth.This healthcare REIT is well-positioned for long-term secular growth. As the Baby Boomer population continues to age, Ventas' senior care facilities and medical office businesses should continue to churn out consistent rent checks. That bodes well for investors whether VTR is pivoting or not, and it bodes well for the yield.  Source: Shutterstock  Tanger Outlet (SKT)Click to EnlargeSo far we have retail, technology and medical REITs on the list, so why not further diversify with a mall REIT? With Tanger Factory Outlet Center (NYSE:SKT), investors are getting exposure to a well-run company and a big 7.44% dividend yield.However, unlike VTR, O and DLR, Tanger is not bumping up against a potential breakout or trading higher. I'd love to see a close over $22.50 for SKT, but it's been on a recent downtrend.This REIT has not only paid but raised its dividend for 26 consecutive years, making this a safe-play income stock for investors. So those that are looking for safe payouts, SKT is one to consider.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt While the mall is considered a dying enterprise, not all operators are created equal. With that in mind, Tanger is actually doing incredibly well. Plus it's not a traditional mall REIT in the sense that it doesn't operate department store locations. Instead, it thrives on the outlet mall concept.Finally, it has a lower valuation compared to many of its peers and a higher yield. Tough not to like that.  Source: Shutterstock  Federal Realty (FRT)We can't end the top real estate stocks to buy list without talking about Federal Realty (NYSE:FRT). Yielding &quot;just&quot; 3.04%, this payout won't get income investors tripping over each other in order to buy.But considering the quality of the dividend may be another story. Get this: FTR has not only paid, but raised its dividend for 50 straight years. Through hellish inflation, tech bubbles and the greatest recession since the depression, FTR has raised its payout for investors each and every year.If you've got time and are looking for a dependable stream of income, FTR should be one of your first considerations. Not just for REITs, but among all dividend stocks.This retail REIT is as solid as they come and the valuation has been reasonable.Shares are running into recent range resistance, which has stalled it over the past few weeks. That's good news for bulls, as it allows the stock to digest some of this big rally. I would really like a pullback into that $127 area. However, long-term investors focused solely on the income are likely not interested in timing their investment in FTR.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-04-22	2019-04-22 20:00:13	O	Realty Income Corporation	5 Top Stock Trades for Tuesday: TSLA, TWTR, TTD, O	With the market stagnating near these upper levels, but not showing a willingness to pullback in any meaningful way, trade setups are becoming harder to find. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as it gives traders a chance to wait for more opportune trades. Let's see which top stock trades are presenting themselves now. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: TeslaTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) had its Autonomy Investor Day on Monday afternoon. Enthusiasts are excited by what the company has to show off and doubters are eager to pounce on anything that suggests Tesla has no edge.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat does it mean for the stock price though?Shares were lower by about 3.5% heading into the event and near long-time support. This seemingly sets up the stock up for a bounce, particularly with earnings just around the corner on April 24th. However, some concerns are mounting on the technical front.  * 3 Stocks on Shaky Ground For starters, Tesla hasn't been able to break over its downtrend (blue line) on a closing basis for almost three months now. Further, the 200-week moving average -- which has been support many times over the past few years -- is not giving TSLA the bounce it needs. In fact, TSLA stock has closed below this mark four of the last five weeks, assuming we skip this week's candle.Needless to say, Tesla is sitting at an important juncture. Below $250 and the situation could go from bad to worse in a hurry. Back over $280+ though and the bulls will have momentum back on their side.Be aware of two situations, too: either a dump before earnings or a strong rally. Either could end up being a head fake. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Gilead SciencesDown about 2% on the day and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) isn't looking all that good. Keep this one simple.It's flirting with vital support between $60 and $62 with downtrend resistance (blue line) squeezing it lower. Below $60 and GILD is in no man's land. Above downtrend resistance and GILD will have to contend with $70. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: TwitterTwitter (NYSE:TWTR) will report earnings on Tuesday before the open, as the stock has been trading in a very tight range for the month. For now, it's holding above the 20-day and 50-day moving averages and just below stiff resistance at $36.On earnings, look for a close over $36 to signal a potential breakout to higher prices. On a pullback, see that uptrend support holds. If it does, the more quickly it can reclaim the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, the better.If uptrend support doesn't hold, $30 is in the cards and possibly $28 if that doesn't hold. Let's not get over our skis though. I want to see how TWTR trades after earnings first. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: The Trade DeskWe have been flagging The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) a lot over the past few trading sessions, either looking for a breakout or a breakdown. As it so happens, a breakout is we're getting and now investors are trying to position themselves in the name.If you missed the entry trigger over downtrend resistance, chasing may not be worth the risk. Current longs should watch $215 to see if TTD can push through. If it can, a new breakout could be underway and more upside could exist, which gives an opportunity to investors looking to get on board.Notice that TTD is not overbought according to the RSI, while its momentum via the MACD is just swinging in bulls' favor, (both measures shown via blue circles).Should we get a pullback to the backside of prior downtrend resistance (black line), it could be a buying opportunity if it holds as support. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Realty IncomeWe flagged this one about a week ago as the REITs started to come under pressure. I wasn't sure if it was a premature reaction or a savvy move, but I followed my gut and exited my REITs as this action developed.At the time, we said look for $68 to act as support in Realty Income (NYSE:O). After strong selling, it was support -- for one day. On Monday, O cratered below this mark as the stock is quickly down 9% from its highs less than a month ago. The 20-day moving average is also rolling below the 50-day moving average, which isn't a deal-breaker for bulls, but certainly isn't a great development.So what now?  * 7 Tech Stocks With Too Much Risk, Not Enough Upside Almost 10% off its highs and it's hard to be a seller at this point. But I don't know that it's fallen far enough to buy yet. One strategy? Let it shake out. A rally back up to $68 or to the 20-day/50-day that's met by sellers could be an opportunity on the short side or for bulls to unload some of their holding. If it keeps going lower without a bounce, look for an eventual buying opportunity.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-04-17	2019-04-17 19:14:50	O	Realty Income Corporation	5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees	For those investors in retirement, it all comes down to income. How can you convert your lifetime of savings into a steady stream of paychecks? There's plenty of ways to do that. But one of the best continues to dividend stocks. After all, dividend stocks generally offer higher yields than bonds and give you the ability to see your income rise through increasing dividend payouts as well as grow thanks to capital appreciation. Bonds, CDs, and other traditional fixed income products can't do that.The only problem is, not all dividend stocks are worthy for retirees.Those investors in retirement can't afford to see their payouts get cut or see their capital go up in flames. There's simply not enough time to recoup losses or balance out volatility. To this end, it takes a certain variety of dividend stocks to get you through your golden years. A focus on quality is key.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth Which dividend stocks make the grade for retirement? Here are five dividends stocks that are perfect for retirement portfolios. Snap-on (SNA)Source: Snap-On via Wikimedia (Modified)Dividend Yield: 2.43%Selling screwdrivers, wrenches and other hand tools may not seem that exciting, but this niche has helped make Snap-On Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) one of the best dividend stocks around.SNA manufactures a variety of tools, equipment, and repair information systems for various industrial markets. Many professional mechanics and assembly workers swear by Snap-on's better-made products. And with a simple socket wrench set costing north of $300, SNA isn't exactly going after DIY and weekend warriors here. You need high-performance when you're fixing a bullet train or repairing a wind turbine.This focus on the industrial market has widely insulated SNA from the whims of the consumer market. Because of this, SNA has paid dividends without interruptions or reductions since 1939. Its last increase was a strong 15.85% jump.Part of that jump comes from the reduction in corporate taxes. The other continues to be Snap-On's moves into higher-margined tech products. Modern machinery is chock-full of computers and sensors. SNA is quickly becoming the standard provider for computer-based diagnostics equipment. This has provided a supercharger to its earnings in recent years. EPS surged 12.6% year-over-year in 2018.All in all, Snap-On's continued leadership position in its niche market continues to pay benefits. That makes it one of the best dividend stocks for retirees. Becton Dickinson and Co (BDX)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.25%Admittingly, the headline yield on Becton Dickinson and Co (NYSE:BDX) isn't much to write home about. BDX's current yield of 1.25% is about what you can earn from a savings account these days. However, the story at the medical device maker is one of payout growth. This why retirees should include BDX in their portfolio of dividend stocks.BDX is one of the world's largest producers of needles, syringes, and other sharps-related devices. This catalog of products spans everything from &quot;basics&quot; like insulin needles and catheters to more advanced regional anesthesia and drug delivery products. The beauty is that the bulk of these items are designed to be single use. That means your doctor and hospital has to come back every month to get more of them. Becton's integration of rival Bard has only expanded on this catalog as well.This, plus moves into life science products and more high-tech drug delivery medical devices, has continued to make BDX a cash flow machine. The firm has used that cash flow to reward shareholders by paying down the debt used to buy Bard as well as increase its dividend and conduct buybacks. Over the last decade, Becton has managed to double its dividend based on its strong cash flows. Given its strengths, there's a good chance that BDX will keep that streak going.  * 5 Wonderful REITs to Buy Today For retirees, BDX stock offers a chance to grow their income over the long haul. Home Depot Inc. (HD)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.66%It's no secret that retail has been a blood bath. Online shopping has continued to hit many traditional brick and mortar retailers hard. Empty storefronts and dead shopping malls are quickly becoming the norm. But just don't tell that to Home Depot (NYSE:HD). The home improvement retailer is killing it and has proved that its a top dividend stock. Retirees should take notice.Much of HD's recent success comes from its moves into omnichannel retailing. Consumers these days what to buy products when and how they what them. They want them in-store, online, via mobile apps, etc. Home Depot seems to have cracked the code. Spending on technology and beefing-up its operations have worked and customers keep hitting up HD for their home improvement needs. Sales grew nearly 11% last quarter to reach a whopping $26.5 billion based on its omnichannel moves.HD has clearly gotten the message about the changing face of retail.Keeping that going into the future and helping pad its dividend is that HD has also figured out how to attract Millennial and younger customers. Thanks to new classes, videos, and DIY help, Home Depot has continued to attract the customers of tomorrow. That's a demographic that many other retailers are struggling to court.With its strong growth, HD recently was able to increase its dividend by 32% and conduct more than $15 billion in buybacks. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.25%Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is proving that old school tech can still be a fertile ground for finding dividend stocks -- especially those for retirees. The key has been CEO's Satya Nadella vision to transform Mr. Softy into a software as a service (SaaS) company and reap plenty of reoccurring/subscription revenues.Today, the cloud rules the roost at MSFT. Microsoft's Azure and Dynamics 365 platforms are quickly becoming the standards for many enterprise customers. Growing by double-digits, MSFT has been able to reap plenty of earnings/cash flows from its new cloud model. Better still, is that MSFT has been able to turn that cloud model toward regular Joes as well. Office 365, as well as its Xbox gaming/entertainment units, are also seeing plenty of growth. Total revenues for MSFT jumped by 12% last quarter on the strength of its cloud operations.All of this continues to translate into plenty of profits and growing cash balance.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm And MSFT continues to share those profits with investors. Since 2010, the tech firm has managed to grow its payout by over 253%. That's very impressive. And given its huge cash balance, strong cash flows and high margins, there's a good chance that Microsoft will keep that streak going. For retirees, that makes MSFT one of the best dividend stocks to own for the long haul. Realty Income (O)Dividend Yield: 3.80%When your corporate tag line is the &quot;Monthly Dividend Company,&quot; there's a lot of pressure to keep to live up to that promise. Luckily for Realty Income (NYSE:O) it has been able to keep that promise for over 584 consecutive months.That steadfastness of payouts comes from Realty Income's business model. O is one of the largest owners of freestanding real estate in the country -- with more than 5.700 different properties under its wing. Freestanding real state includes everything from convenience stores and restaurants to movie theaters, and automotive parts/services centers. It's the standard fare that dots our suburban landscape. With nearly 500 different tenants and its huge swath of property, O provides unmatched diversification.As if O couldn't get any better, the vast bulk of these properties are so-called triple-net leased. This means the tenants are responsible for taxes, maintenance and other costs related to the property. This allows Realty Income to keep more of its rent checks.Well, not keep. O has been rewarding shareholders for decades. It's latest increase represents its 101st monthly jump to its payout. This follows its 100th increase back in January. A monthly check that keeps growing? If that's not the perfect stock for a retiree, then I don't know what is.With a 3,8% yield, conservative balance sheet and monthly payouts, Realty Income could be a perfect dividend stock for a retirement portfolio.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the stocks mentioned.

2019-04-12	2019-04-12 10:40:15	O	Realty Income Corporation	If You Own Realty Income Stock, It’s Time to Take Your Profits	Everything you think you know about REITs? Forget it before you put Realty Income (NYSE:O) under the microscope. Realty Income stock is far less subject changes in interest rates than most investors care to believe, and much more of a sentiment-driven trading vehicle than most investors care to concede.Source:  Yuriy Trubitsyn via UnsplashTo that end, now would be a good time to take profits on Realty Income stock if you're long, and if you're daring enough, perhaps even short it.That's a counterintuitive strategy for students of what makes the market tick. Rising rates are supposed to work against real estate investment trusts by increasing the cost of capital, while falling or stagnant interest rates help make and keep money cheap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRight now the Federal Reserve seems mostly ready to let rates stand pat, with some whispers of a rate-cut circulating in the market's ether. That's supposed to be good for REITs.In the real world though, we've rarely seen that relationship hold up. In the real world, Realty Income is uncomfortably vulnerable here.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives  Right REITOn paper, it shouldn't have happened. But it did. Against a backdrop of steady rate increases over the course of last year, Realty Income stock rallied from an early-2018 low near $47 to a high-near $74 just a couple of weeks ago. That's a 57% gain.Why didn't the Fed's four rate-hikes deflate the rally? Because there's far more to the matter than mere interest rates. Many investors get the market's easy stuff. Earnings growth is good. Bear markets are bad. Diversity staves off volatility.Not all investors can fully process multi-faceted and sometimes arbitrary pressures on a stock though. Realty Income is one of those names with a lot of moving parts.Chief among them is the fact that it rents space to some of the world's most recognized and reliable companies. Its top tenants include Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Dollar General (NYSE:DG). Those companies may ebb and flow, but for the most part they're not going anyway. And, unlike 2008's subprime mortgage meltdown, the underlying assets that make up realty income aren't quite as subject to an implosion as on over-mortgaged home is.If nothing else, Realty Income has been and always will be at least reasonably dependable.There's a much bigger (albeit related) tailwind that's boosted the O stock price far more than rising rates have worked against it, however. That is, the solid economic growth that inspired last year's quartet of interest rate increases in the first place. Wrong TimeWhile the tariff war, in addition to a long-lived government shutdown, has dialed back the impressive and consistent GDP growth, it still is growth.After soaring to a pace of more than 2.0% in the latter half of 2017 and racing to annualized growth of 4.2% in the second quarter of 2018, Corporate America was humming. Corporate profits reached record levels during the third quarter of last year, prompting investment in more growth and the leasing of new profit centers.Realty Income had no trouble finding and keeping consumer-facing tenants, boasting an occupancy rate of 98.6%. It was able to raise its average rental prices as well. Economic strength mattered more than rising interest rates, pushing shares upward.The backdrop is changing now though, for fundamental as well as psychological reasons. Fundamentally, the economy may still be on a reasonably firm footing, but growth rates are undeniably slowing. International trade friction is very real, and the year-over-year comps translate into tougher comparisons.In the meantime, Q4's GDP growth was pared back to match multi-year lows near 2.2%. It's not bad, but it's certainly not red hot. There's also no particular reason to suspect growth will turn red-hot again anytime soon.Psychologically, investors may be starting to realize they got a little ahead of themselves with Realty Income last year. It's not the first time it's happened either. The weekly chart tells the tale. This REIT is really good at rallying for prolonged periods, but that rally is always unwound in a big way.The relative slowdown in the very economic growth that catapulted Realty Income stock last year, will serve as the bearish fodder the market needs now that shares are uncomfortably overextended. Bottom Line for Realty Income StockThe great irony is, none of the stock's past rises and falls nor any of its future gains and losses will actually be a full reflection of the REIT's results. Revenue, operating income and funds from operations are all quite steady, and the real estate investment trust recently announced its 101st dividend increase.It's been a picture of consistency and reliability. The big swings of the O stock price are largely prompted by traders' ever-changing perception.Nevertheless, if that's the game most investors are playing, then that's the game would-be buyers have to play too. Anyone interested may want to let some of the froth burn off first. It could take a while to gauge the true strength of the economy here anyway.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-21	2019-03-21 20:02:33	O	Realty Income Corporation	6 Must-See Stock Trades for Friday: AAPL, QRVO, GES, SQ, EA	Stocks were rocking and rolling on Thursday, with all three major U.S. indices putting up big gains on the day. After Wednesday's Fed news, that's no surprise. Let's get a look at some of today's big movers with our must-see stock trades. Must-See Stock Trades 1: AppleEarlier this month we outlined the long trade in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Then earlier this week, we said investors should consider locking in some profits after the stock's monster move. Now AAPL is erupting more than 4% on Thursday as the longs keep on cashing in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Stocks To Buy for the Happiest Employees $200 becomes an obvious magnet, even as its RSI and MACD (green circles) continue into extended territory. This setup does not favor new long positions, but the recent strength does give us a solid buy-the-dips setup going forward.If you're still long, consider trailing up those stops and locking in some gains. Must-See Stock Trades 2: GuessGuess? (NYSE:GES) picked a pretty interesting time to report earnings, with the worse-than-expected results coming on the evening before Levi (NYSE:LEVI) went public.The latter is up more than 30% on the day as investors gobble up the new IPO. On the plus side, GES stock is clinging to range support near $19. This level has been vital over the past 12 months.There are better buys out there than GES, but investors who feel compelled to go long can use Thursday's low as their stop-loss. Must-See Stock Trades 3: VentasVentas (NYSE:VTR) isn't necessarily the top stock to focus on, but its price action gives us opportunity. On Wednesday we talked about how the Fed gave bulls the green light, saying it's essentially on hold this year when it comes to rate hikes. Well, that bodes incredibly well for dividend stocks and REITs.There's a reason why names like AT&T (NYSE:T), VTR, Realty Income (NYSE:O), Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR) and others are surging on the day. Look to see if these names can give us some follow through on Friday and into next week. (Here's the setup on AT&T).For VTR specifically, it held uptrend support and is back over the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. Look to see if it can get to and breakout over $65. Must-See Stock Trades 4: QorvoShares of Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) erupted more than 7% on Thursday thanks to an upgrade from Goldman Sachs. But an earnings beat from Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and continued strong price action from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) (trade layout here) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) (trade layout here) certainly helps.The move up through $74 is significant. Not only has this level played a notable role in the past, but it's the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement for the 52-week range. Maintaining this level paves the way to $78. Should QRVO fail to hold this level, it would be encouraging to see it hold the 200-day as support.Bulls shouldn't let Qorvo get below the 20-day and uptrend support. There's still room to rally according to the MACD and RSI, despite Thursday's big move. Must-See Stock Trades 5: SquareTrending higher and peeking through resistance is Square (NYSE:SQ). The move puts SQ over the 20-day moving average and if it can close over $78, it opens up the possibility of a move to $82.50.This name tends to be volatile, but over the 200-day and SQ stock is fine. Admittedly that's a wide range from current levels but the RSI and MACD still leave plenty of room for the stock to rally. Must-See Stock Trades 6: Electronic ArtsLet's do one more really quick with Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter Up 7.5% on the day and it's breaking out of its recent range in a big way. I want to see EA stay over $100 now. My upside target is $108.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long AAPL, VTR, O, DLR and SQ.

2019-03-08	2019-03-08 17:49:38	O	Realty Income Corporation	The Kiplinger Dividend 15: Our Favorite Dividend-Paying Stocks	The Kiplinger Dividend 15, the list of our favorite dividend-paying stocks, doled out plenty of payout love in its first year, with an average yield of 3.7%. To make it into our lineup, dividend stocks had to first beat the 2% average yield of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. We then looked for firms that are leaders in their industry and that have solid prospects for expanding their sales and profits, while also generating enough cash to pay investors. And we aim to avoid dividend traps -- stocks with high yields but weak underlying businesses and poor prospects. We've recently made a change to the list, pulling CVS Health (CVS). Although the stock has performed well, it broke its streak of dividend increases, which was one reason we recommended it. We'll introduce its replacement in a minute. Here is a look at the updated Kiplinger Dividend 15, including any new information that may be important. We divide the list into three groups, for their dividend stability, briskly growing payouts or high yields. Find a dividend stock that suits your needs, or select a mix.

## Summary

  * ETFs holding this stock are seeing positive inflows but are weakening 
  * Bearish sentiment is low



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is low for O with fewer than 5% of shares on loan. The last change in the short interest score occurred more than 1 month ago and implies that there has been little change in sentiment among investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Negative

ETF activity is negative and may be weakening. The net inflows of $1.73 billion over the last one-month into ETFs that hold O are among the lowest of the last year and appear to be slowing.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Neutral

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Financials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however.

The San Diego-based real estate investment trust (REIT) just declared its 583rd monthly dividend amid ongoing revenue and profit growth. O stock certainly has stood out. Many of its peers such as Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) and Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) have struggled in recent years.

However, Wall Street has taken notice and as a result, the stock price has seen substantial increases over the last year. For this reason, prospective buyers should look past the rising dividend before buying Realty Income stock.

### Realty Income Thrives

Realty Income hit a milestone this month. In declaring its 100th hike in its monthly dividend, the payout for each month has reached 22.55 cents per share. It also marks its 583rd monthly dividend payment since the company began making payout about 50 years ago. It also stands out by paying dividends monthly.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As a retail REIT, its industry has faced some of the toughest time in its history. Faced with competition from online shopping, tenants have vacated retail spaces in droves. As a result, once thriving retail spaces have become derelict or have converted to other uses.

Fortunately for Realty Income, brick-and-mortar retail has not died, it is merely shrinking. Also, Realty Income serves tenants that sell products and services less conducive to online retailing. This includes properties such as pharmacies, movie theaters, and so-called &quot;dollar store&quot; retailers.

Moreover, most deals involve agreements known as triple-net leases. Hence, tenants take on the cost of taxes, maintenance, and insurance. The REIT has also diversified into industrial, office, and agricultural property types. These now make up about 19% of Realty Income's property holdings.

These factors should help O stock continue to thrive. Despite industry challenges, it has maintained a compound average annual return of 16.3% since 1994. With this continuing prosperity, the 100th dividend increase may just be the beginning.

### Beware the Rising O Stock Price

However, when one buys into a shrinking industry, it becomes more critical that investors buy at a low price to ensure they come out ahead. Despite serious industry challenges, this stock will not come cheap to investors.

The equity spent most of 2018 in a recovery mode. As a result, the stock now stands at $65 per share, close to its 52-week high. Even on a forward basis, this takes Realty Income stock to a price-to-earnings (PE) of around 46.

Such a multiple might appear reasonable for a high-growth company in an emerging high tech field. However, Realty Income operates in a shrinking industry that expects 8.7% profit growth for this year. Given the REIT's unlikely success, it deserves a higher multiple than its peers. Still, under those conditions, a 46 forward PE seems quite expensive.

Moreover, investors need to put the dividend in perspective. At a 4.2% yield, that comes in at almost double the S&P 500 average. However, the average dividend yield for equity REITs comes in at just under 4.4%.

Hence, O stock actually pays a below average dividend yield. While this payout also points to the company's success, it serves as another confirmation that the stock price has moved ahead of itself.

### Final Thoughts on O stock

Realty Income thrives in a declining industry. However, with the high PE and the average dividend yield, investors should consider staying away for now.

Amid falling demand for its particular type of real estate, Realty Income has continued to thrive. The REIT leases to clients less affected by online retail. It has also moved into other property types.

This has allowed the REIT to stay on a growth path. Still, Wall Street recognizes its success. As a result, the stock has become an expensive equity in a consolidating industry.

I believe Realty Income will thrive for decades to come. However, at its current earnings multiple, I would look for cheaper REITs operating in less challenged sectors.

2018-10-02	2018-10-02 17:37:27	O	Realty Income Corporation	5 Great Stocks to Buy If You’re New to Investing	The biggest challenge for many new investors is simply knowing where to start. There&apos;s no clear consensus on how to invest. Value investors will say the best stocks to buy are cheap ones and rattle off plenty of statistics to defend their stance. Growth and momentum investors will counter that investing in dominant growth stocks is the way to go. After all, you&apos;re not too likely to find an all-star like Amazon.com (AMZN) sitting in the bargain bin. What about dividends? Or share repurchases? Various studies have shown that focusing on these factors can generate solid returns. Despite all the attempts to quantify investing, it is often more art than science. No single strategy is right for all investors. Some excel at charting and other forms of technical analysis, while some fundamentalists find bargains by digging into the minutiae of the financial statements. And there&apos;s everything in between. The best way for beginning investors to learn is to try a little of everything. You don&apos;t have to get it right the first time, and you don&apos;t have to put your capital at serious risk. So today, we&apos;re going to look at five of the best stocks to buy if you&apos;re new at investing. These may or may not beat the market over the next year. It would be fantastic if they did, but that&apos;s not our point here. We&apos;re simply looking to learn the ropes.

2018-09-18	2018-09-18 18:53:01	O	Realty Income Corporation	8 REITs to Buy for Bargain Prices, Bloated Dividends	Real estate investment trusts (REITs) have been on a wild ride over the past several years. Investors couldn&apos;t get enough of this dividend-friendly sector following the 2008 meltdown. The comparatively high yields were attractive in a world where savings accounts yielded zero and longer-term bond yields scraped near all-time lows.  But the 2013 &quot;taper tantrum,&quot; Janet Yellen&apos;s move in 2015 to move the target fed funds rate above 0% and Donald Trump&apos;s election (prompting fears of inflation) all shook the bond market. That in turn shook assets, such as REITs, that were treated as &quot;bond substitutes.&quot; After each scare, REIT prices recovered their losses ... only to see them evaporate again with the next scare. REIT prices have gone nowhere since early 2015. Remarkably, they&apos;re also sitting at levels first seen in 2007, over a decade ago. No surprise, then, that many REITs are attractively priced right now. REITs also sport significantly higher yields as a sector than investment-grade corporate bonds, and - unlike bond coupon payments - their dividends tend to rise over time. REITs also trade at cheaper valuations than private equity real estate funds, which doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense given their superior liquidity. That kind of disconnect typically only happens during bear markets and panics when the baby gets thrown out with the bathwater. Let&apos;s use this disconnect to our advantage. Here are eight REITs to buy while they trade at respectable prices and pay solid dividends.

2018-09-07	2018-09-07 16:46:04	O	Realty Income Corporation	16 High-Yielding Monthly Dividend Payers	What income investor doesn&apos;t love the frequent payout and reliable cash flow that can come from owning monthly dividend stocks, trusts and other entities? The ability to offset predictable expenses such as mortgage payments and utility bills every month with income from dividends provides the ultimate convenience, timeliness and peace of mind. And there are other advantages to owning monthly dividend stocks. One plus: the accelerated compounding effect that results from more frequently reinvesting dividends over time. Over long periods, the incremental growth from monthly versus quarterly reinvesting can add up. Consider a stock purchased for $20 that yields 5%, pays quarterly dividends and grows the dividend 5% a year. Over the course of 20 years, the value of a 100-share investment would rise from $2,000 to $10,756 and produce 21.9% annual returns. That same investment, paying monthly dividends rather than quarterly, would rise in value to $11,015 over 20 years and generate 22.5% yearly returns. Another factor is the signaling power of monthly payout, which advertises the safety of the dividend. What company would commit to monthly payments if it lacked confidence in its ability to maintain and/or raise the dividend over time? Lastly, because of more frequent distributions, many monthly dividend stocks can be less volatile than their quarterly paying counterparts. Here are 16 monthly dividend stocks, trusts and even funds that offer not just generous yields, but relatively safe, reliable income.

2018-08-13	2018-08-13 19:46:11	O	Realty Income Corporation	20 Dividend Stocks to Fund 20 Years of Retirement	The conventional approach to funding retirement is to withdraw 4% of your savings in the first year, followed by &quot;pay raises&quot; in each subsequent year to adjust for inflation. Over a 30-year retirement, the thinking goes, there is little chance of running out of money if this retirement portfolio is invested in a mix of dividend stocks, a few growth stocks and bonds. Today&apos;s world is different. Interest rates and bond yields have never been this low for this long, reducing future expected returns. And Americans are living longer than ever before. Instead of facing the uncomfortable decision of what securities to sell or wondering if you are at risk of outliving your savings, you can lean on the cash from dividend stocks to fund a substantial portion of your retirement. Simply Safe Dividends published an in-depth guide about living on dividends in retirement here. Many companies in the market yield 4% or more. And unlike with the 4% withdrawal rule, if you rely on solid dividend stocks for that 4% annually, you won&apos;t have to worry as much about the market&apos;s unpredictable fluctuations. Better still, you&apos;ll have a chance to leave your heirs with a sizable portfolio when the time comes. Here&apos;s a look at 20 quality dividend stocks, yielding roughly 4% or higher, that should fund at least 20 years of retirement, if not more. They have paid uninterrupted dividends for more than 20 consecutive years, appear to have secure payouts and have the potential to collectively grow their dividends to protect investors&apos; purchasing power.

2018-06-27	2018-06-27 19:51:06	O	Realty Income Corporation	25 Stocks Every Retiree Should Own	Retirement for most Americans is a giant and often scary jump into the unknown. In your working years, you can generally take the occasional investing mistake in stride. Retirement portfolio losses can be offset by simply saving more or working a little longer. But once you&apos;ve retired, you no longer have that luxury. You need your nest egg to last throughout your life and possibly that of your spouse as well. So, as you choose your investments, choose wisely. A good retirement stock will ideally pay a healthy dividend. Sonia Joao, President of Robertson Wealth Management, a Houston-based RIA, explains, &quot;Eighty percent of our clients are in or near retirement, and virtually all of them tell us the same thing. They&apos;re looking for safe, secure streams of income to meet their living expenses and replace their paychecks.&quot; A safe dividend is arguably the most important characteristic to look for. But with inflation likely to be higher over the next decade than it was over the previous one, retirees also need growth to maintain their purchasing power. So, a good retirement portfolio will be laden with income stocks - but also a few growth plays for balance. Just remember: Not all &quot;income stocks&quot; belong in a retirement portfolio. For example, troubled industries like tobacco and telecom might have juicy yields, but they offer virtually no possibility for growth. Now, let&apos;s dig in. Here are 25 stocks every retiree should own. SEE ALSO: 53 Best Dividend Stocks for 2018 and Beyond	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-stocks-every-retiree-own-195106419.html?.tsrc=rss
