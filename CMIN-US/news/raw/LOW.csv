Lowe’s is a retail company that specializes in home improvement. The dividend is payable on August 4 to shareholders of record on July 21. Lowe’s annual dividend of $3.20 per share now reflects a dividend yield of 1.7%. On May 19, Lowe’s reported stronger-than-expected Q1 results. The company reported earnings of $3.21 per share, which outpaced the Street’s estimates of $2.62 and rose 81% year over year. Total revenues of $24.4 billion were above the consensus estimate of $23.9 billion and increased 24.1% year over year. (See Lowe’s stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the Q1 earnings announcement, Guggenheim analyst Steven Forbes reiterated a Buy rating on Lowe’s. Forbes said, “LOW’s 1Q 2021 operating results exceeded our expectations, broadly. Importantly, not only was gross margin expansionary (up ~20 basis points year-over-year) in the face of significant lumber inflation—with prices up ~45% quarter-over-quarter—but the company generated a relatively high incremental margin on the top-line beat (based on our estimates), showcasing an elevated level of expense control—resulting in a ~13.30% EBIT margin (up ~310 basis points year-over-year).” Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 17 Buys versus 4 Holds. The average analyst price target stands at $230.71 and implies upside potential of 19.1% to current levels. Shares have gained 51.2% over the past year. Lowe’s scores a 9 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Ellison, Lowe’s president and CEO said, “Our outstanding performance continued this quarter, as we delivered strong sales growth and operating margin expansion. We delivered over 30% growth in Pro, over 18% growth in all 15 U.S. regions, and growth in Canada that outpaced the U.S… Looking forward, I remain confident in our ability to accelerate our market share gains while driving further improvement in operating margin.” During the quarter, the company repurchased shares worth $3.1 billion and paid $440 million in dividends. The company’s current quarter sales are well ahead of its full-year 2021 guidance of $86 billion. In April, Lowe’s completed the acquisition of the STAINMASTER brand, one of the most recognized carpet brands in the U.S., adding to the company’s portfolio of private brands. Recently, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel assigned a Buy rating to the stock with a price target of $235, which implies 23.2% upside potential to current levels. Nagel said, “While we remain concerned with likely softening sales and earnings trends at the company, as COVID-19 tailwinds continue to abate, we now view LOW as particularly attractive versus shares of other leading hardlines chains, including Home Depot, given a discounted share valuation and still significant business model slack.” Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 17 Buys and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target stands at $229.82 and implies upside potential of 20.5% to current levels. Shares have gained 18.9% year-to-date. Lowe’s scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

Lowe's beats on profit and sales and provides upbeat outlook, but stock falls	"Lowe's Companies reported Wednesday fiscal first-quarter profit, sales and same-store sales that rose above expectations, and provided an upbeat outlook, but the home improvement retailer's stock fell 1.5% in premarket trading amid a broad market selloff. Net income for the quarter to April 30 rose to $2.32 billion, or $3.21 a share, from $1.34 billion, or $1.76 a share, in the year-ago period. That beat the FactSet consensus for earnings per share of $2.61. Sales increased 24.1% to $24.42 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $23.81 billion, as same-store sales grew 25.9% to beat expectations of 20.7% growth. Cost of sales rose 23.8%, with gross margin improving to 33.3% of sales from 33.1%. The company said it spent $3.1 billion during the quarter to repurchase 16.8 million shares. Lowe's said the ""very strong"" sales momentum it saw in the first quarter has continued in May, with fiscal 2021 sales currently ""tracking ahead"" of previous guidance of $86 billion. ""Better-than-expected year-to-date results and a supportive macroeconomic backdrop build the company's confidence in its ability to deliver strong results for the fiscal year, including continued market share gains and the achievement of a 12% operating margin,"" the company said in a statement. The stock's decline comes as S&P 500 futures slumped 0.9% ahead of the open."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b414e546-cac1-36f7-b785-7840a8d6d624/lowe%27s-beats-on-profit-and.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-16	2021-04-16 16:56:32	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Amazon Plans Furniture Assembly Service to Catch Wayfair	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is experimenting with a premium service that lets customers opt to have furniture or appliances assembled as soon they arrive at their homes, according to people familiar with the plan.The move, if adopted widely, would help the world’s largest online retailer compete more effectively with Wayfair, Best Buy, Home Depot and Lowe’s -- which all offer similar options.Amazon is planning to introduce the service in Virginia and two other markets, said one of the people, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter. The company currently offers scheduled delivery of big items -- like bunk beds and treadmills -- to a particular room in a shopper’s home. But customers are often disappointed when delivery people drop off the purchases unassembled in big boxes.Amazon declined to comment.Wayfair shares fell by almost 4% before recovering some of their losses. Amazon was mostly unchanged.The new service requires drivers to unpack and assemble the items, remove the packaging and take the item back on the spot if the customer isn’t satisfied, according to a presentation reviewed by Bloomberg. Previously, customers had to schedule a different contractor to come to their home at a different time to assemble the product, assuming the service was even offered in their location.A training video shows the delivery of a bed and mattress set, as well as a sofa and ottoman, which are fairly simple to assemble. Drivers could be trained to install appliances like washing machines, dryers and dishwashers, according to one of the people, posing a specific threat to Home Depot Inc., Lowe’s Cos Inc. and Best Buy Co., which also sell appliances with installation services.The new offering simplifies the existing Amazon Home Services, which is available in a limited number of cities and lets customers hire contractors through the website to assemble furniture or install ceiling fans and wall-mounted televisions. The new service is designed to make delivery more convenient, cheaper and easier for Amazon to manage, one of the people said.Drivers who hang out in online chat rooms are already balking at the new service. Concerns range from insufficient training to worries that Amazon will hold them to unreasonable job completion times. One driver in Virginia, who requested anonymity to avoid antagonizing his employer, said the company isn’t taking into account cluttered homes with narrow stairways, which can prolong how long it takes to make deliveries. Some colleagues fear catching Covid-19 because customers tend to hover over them when they drop off packages, he said.Demand for bigger items like desks and office chairs spiked during the pandemic as millions retreated to their homes. Shoppers also became more comfortable buying big-ticket items online that they previously preferred to purchase from a store where they can lie on beds or sit on sofas.Online sales of furniture and housewares jumped 41% in 2020 to $36.1 billion, according to Coresight Research. Sales are expected continue to grow this year, albeit more slowly, to $37.3 billion. The surge in demand for big items created delivery logjams and weeks-long delays, creating an opportunity for Amazon to bring its reputation for quick delivery to the sale of bigger items like furniture.The Seattle-based e-commerce giant has struggled to match the runaway success of Wayfair, which supplanted Amazon in 2019 as the biggest online home-goods retailer in the U.S., according to 1010Data. Amazon has its own private-label furniture brands and in 2019 launched the virtual reality shopping feature Showroom that lets shoppers see what furniture would look like at home.(Updated with company comment, drivers reaction.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-plans-furniture-assembly-catch-134255204.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-10	2021-03-10 02:43:13	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	RBA’s Lowe Pushes Back Against Market, Sending Yields Lower	(Bloomberg) -- Reserve Bank of Australia chief Philip Lowe pushed back against bond markets pricing in an earlier tightening of monetary policy, sending the currency and yields lower as he reiterated that interest rates are unlikely to rise until at least 2024.“Over the past couple of weeks market pricing has implied an expectation of possible increases in the cash rate as early as late next year and then again in 2023,” Lowe said in a speech to the Australian Financial Review Business Summit in Sydney Wednesday. “This is not an expectation that we share.”The benchmark three-year bond yield fell as low a 0.087% as it briefly dipped below the RBA’s 0.1% target for the first time this year. It settled back to be in line with the goal as investors began re-calibrating expectations for the rate outlook.What Bloomberg Economics Says...“Governor Lowe’s speech made it clear that Australian rates are set to be lower for longer. The RBA is not going to be fazed by temporary, transitory, inflation blips, with Lowe signaling a focus on the labor market, and more specifically, wages-driven inflation, as the future anchor for Australian monetary policy.”-- James McIntyre, economistAustralia’s central bank has stepped up its bond buying in recent weeks, including an unscheduled operation, as it battled rising yields fueled by a reflation trade sweeping global markets. The RBA defended its 0.10% yield target -- also the level of the cash rate -- and sought to soothe markets. Lowe said today that even the improved inflation expectations priced in by markets aren’t especially high and aren’t above central bank targets.The governor pointed again to the evolution of the RBA’s inflation-targeting regime that now requires actual -- not forecast -- inflation to be within the 2-3% target before it considers moving rates. This will likely require wages growth above 3%, Lowe said, noting it’s currently running at a record-low 1.4%.“It is a long way back to seeing wage increases consistent with the inflation target,” he said.Martin Whetton, head of fixed income and FX strategy at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said Lowe delivered a “spirited defense of their settings” and agreed with Lowe that conditions won’t be met for some time for raising rates.Westpac Banking Corp.’s fixed income research chief Damien McColough said the message was clear about the market “getting ahead of itself with regard to policy tightening expectations.”Leveraged and macro funds sold the Aussie after it failed to recover above its New York close following Lowe’s comments, according to Asia-based FX traders. It was quoted 0.4% lower at 76.82 U.S. cents at 1:33 p.m. in Sydney. The 10-year yield dropped six basis points to 1.72%, also party reflecting moved in U.S. Treasury yields overnight.Australia’s economy has experienced a V-shaped recovery as authorities managed to bring Covid-19 under control and unemployment has fallen accordingly: to 6.4% in January from a pandemic peak of 7.5%. Yet, there is still work to be done.Staying Low“Over the past decade, the estimates of the unemployment rate associated with full employment have been repeatedly lowered,” he said. Based on recent experience, “it is certainly possible that Australia can achieve and sustain an unemployment rate in the low 4s, although only time will tell.”The governor confirmed the bank’s commitment to its three-year yield target and said it’s not considering removing it or changing it.As to whether to keep April 2024 as the target three-year bond or move to November 2024, he said “the board has not yet made a decision on this question and will consider it again later in the year when it has more information about the economic recovery and the labor market.”Westpac’s McColough said that there is now a greater chance that yield-curve control gets pushed from the April 2024 to the November 2024 bond.Later in the year, the bank will also consider whether to extend its quantitative easing program, the governor said. The RBA in November announced a A$100 billion ($77 billion) program over six months targeting longer-dated securities and in February announced a further A$100 billion when the first tranche expires in mid-April.A key aim of the QE program was to keep a lid on Australia’s currency, which had surged about 40% from March last year before it eased back in recent days on a strengthening U.S. dollar. Asked about the exchange rate, the governor reiterated his recent mantra.“I’d be even more comfortable if it was lower still,” Lowe said. “Having said that, I cannot say the currency’s overvalued,” citing the strength of commodity prices. “So I understand why the currency is where it is, I’d like it to be lower.”Asked about criticism of the central bank’s policies from academic economists and others who argue it should do more QE, Lowe pointed out that between the A$200 billion total bond buying and A$200 billion in a bank lending program, it was pumping in a lot of stimulus.“We’re doing a huge amount already,” he said, noting this was occurring at a time when the economy was doing better than expected. “So we’re in watch-and-wait mode. If it turns out we need to do more then we can.”In his speech the governor, referring to strengthening house prices, said there are mechanisms to limit lending that don’t require tighter policy. He said the RBA is paying close attention to lending standards, but it does not target house prices, “nor would it make sense to do so.”(Updates with comment from Bloomberg Economics in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rba-lowe-pushes-back-against-223017673.html?.tsrc=rss

Tony Zhang's 'Iron Condor' Trade On Lowe's	"On CNBC's ""Options Action,"" Tony Zhang said the home improvement space remains one of the strongest categories of consumer spending and he sees the poor performance of Lowe's Companies Inc (NYSE: LOW), since it reported earnings, as an opportunity to play for a bounce. Lowe's Companies' fundamentals and the technical setup look fairly encouraging to Zhang, but he is just mildly bullish because of the current market conditions. He wants to use the ""iron condor"" options strategy for Lowe's. Specifically, he wants to sell the April $150/$140 put spread and the April $160/$170 call spread to collect the premium of $5.10. The premium is his maximal profit and he can maximally lose $4.90 if the stock trades above $165.10 or below $144.90 at the April expiration. For traders who want to set up this trade on Monday, Zhang suggested that they should adjust the strikes $5 higher because Lowe's bounced higher since he looked at the trade.

Investors can get bargains if they believe in yesterday. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) provides a good example of this market principle. HD stock ran up from a pandemic low of $152 last March to a high of $286 in August. They then bounced around for months before falling 11% in the last month. Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com The catalyst? Record earnings and a dividend increase. Sales for the fourth quarter were $32.3 billion, up 25% year-over-year, at scale. Net earnings per fully diluted share rose 14%, to $2.65. The dividend was hiked 10%. Speculators responded with sell orders. They were taking profits. Investors who waited out this process and walk in today, however, can get a dividend yielding 2.56% over the next year and a forward price-earnings ratio of 20.8.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Why They Sold Traders and speculators like bright shiny objects. A year ago, when we were locked inside our homes for the first time, Home Depot was a bright and shiny object. 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain Those promises have been fulfilled. As Placer.ai noted in a February report, on Home Depot and its rival Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW), Home Depot visits were up 22% year-over-year in January. They have been up by double digits for every month since last May. The stock charts tell a different story. The performance of Home Depot shares began trailing the S&P 500 average in December. That underperformance has only accelerated this year. Since the start of 2021, Home Depot is down nearly 7%. Those who took profits ran to today’s bright and shiny objects. SPACs, electric car plays, fintech, and Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) are as hot today as Home Depot is cold. Why Investors Buy This provides a great opportunity for baby boomers to secure their retirement. The pandemic has created permanent changes in housing and office patterns. Most knowledge workers are no longer interested in going back to the office. Office leases are being allowed to expire. Homes need to expand, however, to accommodate the new home office. Better use must be made of the remaining space. This means a lot of work, not just for consumers, but for builders and contractors. Projects will have to be redesigned, and existing office space repurposed. For retailers like Home Depot, meanwhile, the spring quarter is Christmas. Planting season is profit season. Projects dreamed of in the cold become reality when it gets warm, and hopefully before it gets hot. HD stock is selling for barely half the average S&P stock’s price to earnings ratio, which is over 38. The Shiller ratio, which is adjusted for inflation, is 34. While stock chartists see Home Depot stock going lower over the short, medium, and long terms, analysts at Tipranks have a more upbeat view. Nine out of 10 say buy it. Their average one-year price target of $315 is 27% ahead of where the stock trades now. The Bottom Line On HD Stock The peak of the baby boom, in the mid-1950s, is retiring over the next few years. I was born in 1955. I’m feeling a little cranky and creaky myself. Here’s how to get your kids to pay for those cruises, weekend getaways and even those long-term care homes you’ve been dreaming of. Now is the time to buy Home Depot. Take the 2.5% dividend, watch the growth from changing housing patterns, and relax. This is the difference between trying to get rich quick and getting rich slowly. Buy great companies when they’re down and let time work its magic for you. At this time five years ago Home Depot sold for $126 and sported a dividend of 69 cents. Now it’s at $248 with a dividend of $1.65. Getting rich slowly is the key to a comfortable retirement.

2021-02-10	2021-02-10 08:47:11	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Lowe's Increases Engagement, Loyalty With Bumped Fractional Share Rewards	Bumped, a fintech startup that has been piloting its software app over the past two years, released data on Tuesday that shows how customers became more engaged and more loyal to stores that offered fractional shares in their companies as rewards when they shop. What Happened: In the pilot project for Lowe's Companies Inc. (NYSE: LOW), a home improvement store, Bumped found that customers who were rewarded for their purchases with shares of the stock increased monthly spending by $47.82 and visited the store on average 0.84 times more per month. The data also showed that customers who were rewarded in fractional shares of Lowe’s stock became more loyal and shopped less at Lowe’s competitors, according to the press release. Why It Matters: Brands are always looking for ways to increase customer loyalty and steal market share from competitors. “In industries dominated by duopolies, like the Home Improvement category is, it’s critical that brands look to build long-term, lasting relationships,” says David Nelsen, founder and CEO of Bumped. What’s Next: The stock market can be intimidating and only about 55% of Americans invest in stocks, according to research by Statista. The mission of Bumped is to allow more customers to hold shares of their favorite brands to create the idea of an ownership economy. Giving customers a unique and easy way to access markets through shopping rewards benefits customers by allowing them to build ownership of the company over time and benefits the brands by helping them to increase customer loyalty.

Lowe’s (LOW) serves more than 18 million customers a week across the U.S. and Canada and has hired more than 90,000 permanent employees over the past year alone. It supports its communities through programs that are focused on creating safe, affordable housing and training and up-skilling the people it serves. “As we approach spring, I am enormously proud of the way our associates have served customers and supported each other this past year through an unprecedented health crisis,” said Marvin R. Ellison, Lowe’s president and CEO. “We are honored to be an essential business to help our customers keep their homes safe and functional during these very challenging times. We’re pleased to provide this additional bonus to support our current associates and excited to welcome these new associates so we can better serve customers across the country,” he added. (See LOW stock analysis on TipRanks) R5 Capital analyst Scott Mushkin upgraded LOW last month to a Buy from a Hold last month and set his price target at $195. This implies upside potential of around 14% from current levels. Reasons for Mushkin’s bullishness include his belief that the housing market will remain strong as the economy starts to re-open post-COVID and that LOW shares are relatively undervalued compared to the S&P 500. Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 11 Buys and 1 Hold. The average price target of $203.83 suggests upside potential of around 19% over the next 12 months. Lowe’s scores an 8 out of 10 on TipRanks Smart Score, which implies that it is likely to outperform the market moving forward.

2020-12-29	2020-12-29 12:00:20	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Retail’s Boom-and-Bust 2020, in 10 Charts	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The pandemic delivered a core-shaking shock to the consumer-goods industry, abruptly reshaping what people were buying where they were buying, and how they were buying. For some companies, it has led to deep damage that is still fully revealing itself. For others, it has created opportunity.As 2020 comes to close, it’s worth reflecting on these changes and where they have left the sector heading into 2021. Here, 10 charts tell the tale:Toilet paper on a roll. As the reality of the pandemic came into focus for consumers in mid-March, the grocery business was gripped by a wave of pantry-loading that resulted in massive spikes in sales of certain products — and eventually, empty shelves. In a single week in March, sales of liquid hand soap soared 320% from a year earlier, while purchases of frozen meat climbed 132% and sales of toilet paper surged 236%. Hand sanitizer, meanwhile, was in such demand that year-over-year sales skyrocketed more than 1,000% in each week from early May to early July. Such extraordinary jolts of buying fever scrambled the consumer products industry, with brands taking steps such as bringing on third-party manufacturing partners and dropping less popular items to focus on the production of top sellers. Although demand has retreated from the frenzy of the early days of the pandemic, sales of consumer packaged goods have still held above last year’s levels. With widespread distribution of Covid-19 vaccines months away and many people still spending a large chunk of their time at home, strong sales in this category are likely to continue.Online grocery carts fill up. Before the pandemic, grocery was something of a final frontier in e-commerce, remaining mostly untouched by retail’s digital transformation. Even though supermarkets and big-box stores were able to stay open throughout spring lockdowns, masses of shoppers decided to try online grocery shopping — include curbside pickup — for the first time or began doing more of it as a safety precaution. Some consumers will go back to their old, store-centric routine after the crisis is over, but many will stick to their new shopping habits. Years from now, this will be remembered as a tipping point for adoption, and one that significantly altered the showdown between Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Kroger Co.Big tickets. As customers adhered to social-distancing guidelines, they packed their spending into a limited number of stock-up trips and skipped the in-between, fill-in stops. This behavior is perhaps most clearly illustrated in the results of Walmart’s U.S. business, where declines in transactions, a proxy for traffic, have been more than offset by a boom in ticket, or the average amount spent per order. Relatedly, this unusual year brought changes in conversion, or the rate at which shoppers go from browsing to buying. When consumers set foot in a store in this environment, their intent to buy something was quite strong. That’s why, for example, there was such a disparity in the decrease in foot traffic recorded over Black Friday weekend — down 42% from last year, according to RetailNext — and the drop in brick-and-mortar sales, which was only 24%.Stuff Rules. Millions of Americans lost their jobs or experienced economic hardship because of the pandemic, a dynamic that threatened to decimate retailers’ sales. That’s not how things played out, though. While some consumers have moved to the sidelines amid the economic gloom, others are redirecting the dollars they might once have spent on plane tickets, hotel stays or movie tickets toward retailers, perhaps to buy a new big-screen TV or home-gym equipment. The fact that consumers have had so few options for spending on experiences has made the retail industry’s recovery easier. The tables will likely turn when vaccines are distributed widely and pent-up demand for travel and other services is unleashed. Spending Shift. Social distancing and lockdowns rearranged our lifestyles and in doing so, rechanneled our demand. The result: sales for some products froze up and caught fire for others. It was a bleak year, of course, for purchases of dressy clothes and lipstick. But there was softness in less-obvious places, too: ConAgra Brands Inc. said demand for edible seeds declined when baseball seasons were canceled, while Mondelez International Inc. said chewing-gum sales fell as social outings dwindled. At the same time, the pandemic acted as rocket fuel for sales of a wide array of products, including frozen foods, massage appliances, Crocs, printers, mattresses, snowshoes, rice cookers, bicycles and hair masks. Among the most notable beneficiaries of stay-at-home living are the twin empires of the home-improvement business, Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos., which each pulled in more than a year’s worth of sales growth in the third quarter after having achieved similarly gangbusters growth in the previous three-month period. Commerce Department data show what a banner year it was for these types of stores as consumers created home offices or splurged on palatial patios.The Zoom phenomenon. Amid the aforementioned category-level shift in spending, some consumer brands emerged as breakout stars among investors much as Zoom Video Communications Inc. did with the surge in remote working. Shares of Peloton Interactive Inc. boomed more than 436% this year as orders piled up for its connected stationary bikes and treadmills. Etsy Inc. was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index for part of this year as shoppers thronged the site in search of face masks. (Etsy ceded the top spot to Tesla Inc. when the electric-car maker joined the index this month. ) After sinking in late March, shares of Yeti Holdings Inc. have soared, now up more than 100% year to date, as investors realized its coolers and thermoses would be in high demand as people spent more time outside. It could be a challenge for these social-distance-friendly stocks to keep investors happy in 2021 as they lap the strong results delivered in 2020 and as more widely available vaccines may yet again change consumer spending patterns.Storefront shakeout. Lockdowns and capacity restrictions at physical stores created a sales convulsion from which many chains have struggled to recover. The situation hastened the journey of already-fragile retailers J. Crew Group, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney Co. into bankruptcy in the first half of the year. That was only the beginning: Others including Sur La Table and Stein Mart liquidated stores after filing for protection from creditors. Even chains not in bankruptcy court were forced to reassess, with Nordstrom Inc., for example, announcing 16 stores would be permanently shuttered after initial lockdowns. Bankruptcies and store closings reverberate throughout the industry in varied ways. They represent an opportunity for healthier competitors to pick up market share. But closings also sprinkle malls with empty storefronts that threaten to make those centers less viable over the long haul. CoStar Group estimates that more than 11,000 store closings were announced this year through Dec. 1.Rough run for workers. The arrival of the pandemic scrambled the retail industry’s large labor force. Workers at nonessential retailers were, in many cases, furloughed or out of a job, while others suddenly found themselves on the front lines of a dangerous public-health situation. Big chains offered hazard pay and bonuses in response to the circumstances, but in some cases, the measures felt insufficiently generous considering the explosive sales growth a given retailer was enjoying or the share buybacks it was undertaking. Dollar General Corp. expects to devote $2.5 billion to share repurchases this fiscal year, a figure that, according to a Brookings Institution analysis, is 14 times what it has pledged for pandemic-related compensation. Overall, despite big hiring sprees by the likes of Kroger and Walmart, retail employment has not returned to its pre-pandemic level.Dining devastation. The pandemic has taken a toll on the restaurant industry, with a staggering 110,000 restaurants closing amid capacity restrictions and increased dining at home, according to the National Restaurant Association. The pain has not been shared equally, though. Work-from-home arrangements have been hard on the likes of Starbucks Corp., whose cafes are prolific in dense urban areas that have been empty of office workers for much of the year. Casual eateries, which rely on packed dining rooms that are either disallowed by local regulation or are simply undesirable right now, remain in a deep sales hole. That contrasts with the relatively quick recovery made by the fast-food segment since the early days of the pandemic. McDonald’s Corp., for instance, returned to comparable sales growth in the U.S. by the third quarter, helped by its drive-through windows and well-established carryout options.Paying the price. This year presented retailers with unique conditions to wield pricing power. This showed up in a number of ways. For one, upscale clothing and accessories titans Ralph Lauren Corp., Capri Holdings Inc. and Tapestry Inc. were able to pad their gross margins by keeping the lid on promotions. But the clearest examples of price insensitivity were in the grocery business, where revenue exploded for reasons more complex than that people were eating more at home. In some cases, shoppers traded up to fancier labels, likely reflecting a desire to treat themselves in a lonely time. In others, stores and brands cut back on promotions and, in some cases, raised prices amid strong demand, contributing to a year of roaring sales growth. As retailers plan their businesses for 2021, their most difficult work will be figuring out which of these new patterns are likely to last beyond the pandemic. That is an exceedingly difficult task and will likely result in some instances of bloated inventory, mismatched manufacturing capacity and frustrated consumers. At least it won’t be 2020 anymore.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-12-07	2020-12-07 12:00:18	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Rick Santelli and the Dangers of Flouting Covid-19 Facts	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- On-air fisticuffs between a CNBC anchor, Andrew Ross Sorkin, and a markets commentator for the network, Rick Santelli, has given us another tragicomic Covid-19 moment to ponder.The pair had differences Friday morning about whether shopping at a big-box retail outlet run by a corporation such as Lowe’s Cos. was just as perilous as dining out amid the coronavirus pandemic.“There is actually and should be an ongoing debate as to, you know, why a parking lot for a big-box store like by my house is jam-packed — not one parking spot open. Why are those people any safer than a restaurant with plexiglass?” Santelli asked during a discussion of the efficacy of business lockdowns. “I just don’t get it, and I think there’s a million of these questions that could be asked. But I think it’s really sad that when we look at the service sector and all the discussions we’ve had about job losses that that particular dynamic isn’t studied more.”As Santelli grew progressively agitated about the dangers of errant lockdowns, Sorkin reminded him that the “particular dynamic” around relative public health risks had, indeed, already been studied.“The difference between a big-box retailer and a restaurant, or frankly even a church, are so different it’s unbelievable,” Sorkin said, as Santelli folded his arms across his chest, pursed his lips and shook his head, like a Little League umpire accused of a bad call.“I disagree, I disagree,” Santelli countered, his anger rising. “I disagree. You can have your thoughts and I can have mine. I disagree.”“It’s science. I’m sorry,” Sorkin responded. “It’s science. If you’re wearing a mask, it’s a different story.”“It’s not science,” Santelli shouted. “Five hundred people in a Lowe’s aren’t any safer than 150 people in a restaurant that holds 600. I don’t believe it. Sorry. Don’t believe it.”It went on from there, but you get the gist. One side that tries to defend the recommendations of experts such as epidemiologists while the other shouts, essentially, “Don’t tread on me!” is a hallmark of our era.Everyone has faced a steep learning curve since the onset of the pandemic, but we know some things with certainty — thanks to expertise, experience and tragic losses — about how Covid-19 spreads and how to help stem its expansion. As my colleague Faye Flam has noted, scientists generally agree that the greatest risk for contracting the coronavirus resides anywhere there is close contact, closed spaces and crowds. It follows that avoiding such places or encounters, particularly if talking, shouting, singing, sneezing or coughing are part of the mix, is sensible.In that context, visiting a Lowe’s is less risky than a restaurant. I’m not sure where Santelli typically dines, but most restaurants don’t hold 600 people. They’re far smaller and more intimate. The dining room of a restaurant with 10 tables serving 40 people might be about 600 to 800 square feet in size. One with 25 tables serving 100 people might be about 1,500 to 2,000 square feet. Even if you scaled up to 600 people, you’d have a dining room that might be about 9,000 to 12,000 square feet. The enclosed space in your average Lowe’s measures about 112,000 square feet.A bigger space with more ventilation, less close contact and less talking or shouting certainly seems safer than the alternative when considering the risk of contracting Covid-19.Santelli’s rant also highlights a phenomenon psychologists call “motivated reasoning” or “confirmation bias.” A predilection for cherry-picking facts that conform to your view of the world and ignoring those that don’t is something all of us do (except me, of course).Political differences and passions supercharge the attractions of motivated reasoning. Santelli straddles motivated reasoning and confirmation bias like a colossus.In early 2009, he famously helped give the Tea Party movement its label and its raison d’etre after calling for a rebellion against the Obama administration’s plan to provide federal relief to homeowners who couldn’t pay their mortgages. Santelli saw it as an unfair handout to irresponsible debtors and a burden on more disciplined taxpayers. That would have been all well and good, perhaps, except that Santelli skipped similar histrionics months earlier when boatloads of taxpayer dollars were used to bail out Wall Street and large banks for their epic mistakes.In March, Santelli let it be known on one CNBC broadcast that “maybe we’d be just better off if we gave” Covid-19 “to everybody.” Herd immunity would follow in “a month,” he advised, and the “mortality rate of this probably isn’t going to be any different if we did it that way.” The upside, he suggested, was that we would avoid hurting the economy.“Listen, I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor,” the former securities trader noted, just in case viewers might have been tempted to, I don’t know, follow his advice and run out to their local restaurant and hug strangers. Santelli later apologized on air for his comments, calling it the “dumbest, most ignorant, stupid thing anybody could have ever said.”Everybody thinks they’re an expert these days. And battling Covid-19 has been made harder by wildly inept and callous federal leadership and by contradictory communications from some public health specialists. Several Democratic leaders recently flouted the very guidance they’ve given their constituents — including enjoying recreational jet-setting and indoor dining at restaurants. Republican politicos, who have made public health transgressions their calling card, have been far more enthusiastic about thumbing their noses at almost every form of coronavirus guidance. President Donald Trump has all the trappings of a one-man superspreader. Flipping off facts in favor of magical thinking or frat boy bravado while thousands die daily gets you folks like Representative Anthony Sabatini, a Florida Republican, who tweeted last week: “CASES!!!!! OMG CASES!!!!! THERE ARE CASES!!! MORE CASES!!!! CASES ARE GOING UP!!!!!!!! CASESESESESESES!!!! CASES WENT UP!!!!! OMG!!!!!! THERES MORE CASES!!!!!!!! CASES!!!!!!!!!!! CASES INCREASED!!! THERE ARE CASES!!!! CASES CASES CASES — WOW CASES WENT UP!!!!!SCARY CASES! WOW.”Facts will always matter. And in the Covid-19 Era, Santelli’s prescription, “You can have your thoughts and I can have mine,” won’t get us where we need to be — or save us from ourselves.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Timothy L.

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Like just about everything else in 2020, Black Friday is not going to be normal. The annual shopping bonanza, usually typified by scenes of long lines and shoulder-to-shoulder crowds hunting for discounts, will be more restrained amid the resurgent pandemic. But sparse crowds this time shouldn’t necessarily be cause for concern for retailers – especially given a late-cresting wave of optimism about how the broader holiday season will shake out. Typically, retailers want their stores teeming with shoppers over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. This year? Not so much. To allow for social distancing, Walmart Inc., for example, has said its stores will allow 20% of their typical capacity on Black Friday, while Target Corp. will set limits on store by store. Most big chains will remain closed on Thanksgiving, a day that attracted 37.8 million in-store shoppers last year.Read more: How Retailers Should Prep for Weird Black Friday: Sarah HalzackBut a quieter Black Friday shouldn’t sting too badly if retailers’ other seasonal strategies are working out according to their plans. They began pummeling shoppers with Black Friday-like discounts ahead of the usual schedule. If that worked, then it shouldn’t be too concerning if crowds are thin this weekend. Retailers have also invested in their e-commerce operations, often by launching or building awareness of curbside pickup options, to make up for some of the lost in-store sales. Perhaps the best news for retailers ahead of this unusual Black Friday is the trail of recent breadcrumbs about consumers’ willingness to spend despite a raging pandemic and gloomy economy. Several retailers have delivered gangbusters earnings reports in recent days, including Best Buy Co., which said Tuesday that its 23% increase in third-quarter comparable sales was its best result on that measure in about 25 years. That followed similar blowout results from Target Corp. and Home Depot Inc. last week.While there had been concern about how consumers would behave when their stimulus checks ran out and supplemental unemployment benefits ended, Walmart found its sales accelerated in September and October after a slower August. Home Depot executives said sales of Halloween items were strong, suggesting that, despite fewer parties, shoppers were looking to buy items to help them get in a holiday spirit. Lowe’s Cos. and Williams-Sonoma Inc. reported strong sales, a sign that the spending on nesting that was ushered in by the pandemic has continued in full force. Read more: Amazon Prime Day Adds to Retailers’ Scary October: Sarah HalzackOf course, those earnings reports are a snapshot in time for a period that for most retailers ended around Oct. 31. Since then, cases of Covid-19 have exploded, and the CDC has advised Americans not to travel for Thanksgiving. Several months ago, I thought such volatile and frightening conditions would send shoppers to the sidelines. My logic was: Why buy gifts for people you might not be able to see? Why buy new place settings for a Christmas dinner that may not happen? It turns out, that isn’t the calculus many shoppers are making, at least so far. Instead, based on consumer surveys and recent executive remarks, it appears that a sizeable group of consumers are plowing the money they would’ve spent on air travel, theater tickets and restaurant meals into skin cream, mattresses and all sorts of goods. You might say they’re engaging in retail therapy – soothing their pandemic sorrows with stuff.  On Monday, the National Retail Federation said it expects a 3.6% to 5.2% holiday season sales increase, which, especially at the upper end of the range, would constitute quite healthy growth. The trade group’s chief economist said in a press release the upbeat figure takes into account a “psychological factor” in which shoppers decide they “owe it to themselves” to splurge. The NRF’s outlook is sunnier than forecasts that came earlier in the fall, reflecting recent flashes of shopper resilience. While retailers’ holiday season prospects look better than they did a couple of months ago, investors shouldn’t overdo it. (Sending shares of Macy’s Inc. up 15% on Monday, for example, smacked of getting carried away.)  The worsening Covid-19 situation could bring new local restrictions that force a fresh round of store closings, or could cause people to voluntarily stay at home. Certain types of retailers, especially department stores, will find it harder than others to get a piece of the spending pie. And while foot traffic is vastly better than at its trough, it is nowhere near normal. These conditions could end up dealing a devastating blow to the malls and chains teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. But shoppers will be seeking some semblance of normalcy or indulgence, and retailers will benefit if they can provide it – whether in the form of a Nerf gun, a diamond necklace or a fancy Christmas roast. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-11-18	2020-11-18 16:20:53	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Lowe’s Slumps After Missing Estimates as Expenses Pile Up	(Bloomberg) -- Lowe’s Cos Inc. slumped after reporting third-quarter earnings that narrowly missed analysts’ expectations, underscoring rising costs at home-improvement retailers that also hit rival Home Depot Inc.Earnings per share came in at $1.98 at Lowe’s, excluding some items, while analysts anticipated $2, on average. That’s the first time the company has missed on that metric since the period ended May 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The outlook for the current quarter also fell short of some estimates.The drivers for the underperformance were expenses due to store revamps and Covid-19-related expenses.At the same time, sales at Lowe’s and Home Depot have greatly benefited from being deemed essential retailers during the pandemic, buoying their stocks since the onset of the health crisis. With better-than-expected performance now a given for investors, Wall Street is focusing on costs, and, to a certain extent, a slowdown in sales growth compared with the peak of the summer season.“This will be a classic situation of very strong fundamental results, but short of investor expectations,” said Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.Lowe’s shares fell as much as 6.6% in New York trading. The stock had risen 33% this year through Tuesday’s close, one of the best performers on the S&P 500 Retailing Index this year.High DemandSame-store sales, a key retail metric, climbed 30.1% in the quarter ended Oct. 30, outpacing the 23.4% average estimate, but slower than the 35% increase in the previous quarter. By comparison, Home Depot on Tuesday reported a 24% gain in the period ended Nov. 1.Lowe’s is trying to maintain its expanded consumer base this holiday season by selling more gifts. Comparable sales are expected to gain as much as 20% in the fourth quarter, traditionally a slower time for home-improvement retailers. On a call with analysts, executives said furniture has been a strong category for the company.The downside is that adjusted operating income as a percentage of sales -- or the profit margin -- is expected to be flat, with investment in the supply chain another factor adding to expenses. And adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.10 to $1.20. The midpoint falls slightly short of analysts’ estimates, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Lowe’s is refurbishing stores partly to help customers at the pro business, which supplies professionals like contractors. It’s in the spotlight now that rival Home Depot announced plans to buy building products distributor HD Supply Holdings Inc., a big operator in the segment. Lowe’s said its pro business grew more than 20% in the most recent quarter and Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison said in an interview that the retailer still has a great service to offer them.Core BusinessBut rather than expand in adjacent markets, the chain has a multi-year plan that’s focused on improving its core business, which includes brick-and-mortar stores, its website and supply chain and technology.“Once we get past that life cycle, we’ll start to look at other more strategic investments and acquisitions, but for now we’re laser focused on the core,” Ellison said. “We think our greatest return will come from that.”Lowe’s will host an investor day on Dec. 9 to discuss future growth opportunities.(Updates share trading and adds detail from conference call in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lowe-quarterly-earnings-miss-estimates-113512025.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-18	2020-11-18 12:40:27	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Stock Wars: Home Depot Vs. Lowe's	The coronavirus pandemic has created strong demand for housing supplies as many people shift to do-it-yourself projects around the house. Two home improvement retailers have had nice returns over the last 10 years, five years and in 2020. Here's a look at how they stack up.About Home Depot: Leading home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) had 2,291 stores at the end of 2019. The stores are located in the United States, Canada and Mexico.The company offers installation services, rentals of tools and equipment and has some exclusive brands carried only in its stores.About Lowe's: Lowe's trails only Home Depot as the largest home improvement retailer in the United States. The company ended 2019 with 1,977 stores in the United States and Canada.Lowe's offers installation services and also features exclusive brands like Kobalt, Top Choice, Project Source and Garden Treasure.Related Link: Stock Wars: Ford Vs. General Motors Vs. TeslaFinancials: In fiscal 2019, Home Depot reported $110.2 billion in revenue.Sales have grown in each of the last three full fiscal years for Home Depot, with 2017 and 2018 seeing totals of $100.9 billion and $108.2 billion, respectively.Same-store sales are up 6.8%, 5.2% and 3.5%, respectively, in the last three fiscal years. Home Depot reported third-quarter revenue up 23.2% year-over-year to $33.5 billion. The company saw same-store sales increase by 24.6% in the United States.Lowe's had sales of $72.1 billion in fiscal 2019. The total has risen each of the last four years, with revenue totals of $65 billion, $68.6 billion and $71.3 billion, respectively.Lowe's second-quarter sales were up 30% year-over-year to $27.3 billion. Same-store sales grew 35.1% in the United States in the second quarter.Acquisitions: Home Depot announced it was buying HD Supply, a company it previously owned. HD Supply Holdings (NASDAQ: HDS) is a major player in the MRO -- maintenance, repair, operations -- market.DigitalCommerce360 said the deal for HD Supply comes as W.W. Grainger Inc (NYSE: GWW) is seeing gains in the MRO market. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is also becoming a key competitor in the MRO market.HD Supply had sales of $6.1 billion in the last fiscal year and has over 300,000 customers. A large portion of the company's sales are made through its websites HDSupplysolutions.com and HDSupplyHIS.com.The MRO market is highly fragmented and worth about $55 billion, according to the release. Lowe's acquired Boomerang, a retail analytics company, in 2019. The deal was done to help the company modernize technology. Boomerang has been integrated into Lowe's core retail business and helped the company with pricing strategies.Stock Performance: Home Depot and Lowe's shares have gained 28% and 35%, respectively, in 2020. Home Depot has outpaced Lowe's, with gains of 131% and 782% over the last five and 10 years. Lowe's five-year and 10-year returns for shares are 126% and 651%. Home Depot's $301-billion market capitalization is significantly higher than Lowe's $122 billion.Benzinga's Take: Home improvement could be a continuing trend, with the virus at an all-time-peak in the U.S. as of now. Home Depot reported a strong increase in same-store sales and said it's seeing an outsized demand for home improvement.Both stocks look strong going forward, but Home Depot could have the edge with its larger size and by dint of buying back HD Supply in a strong growth market. Lowe's could have more room for growth, with a market cap that's significantly lower than Home Depot despite having nearly 65% of the sales of the larger company.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Walmart, Home Depot Strong Retail Plays, Stock Falls Unwarranted: Cramer  * Bill Ackman Bets Against Market Recovery Again, Despite COVID-19 Vaccine Hopes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-18	2020-11-18 11:58:40	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	What Does Lowe's Debt Look Like?	Shares of Lowe's Companies (NYSE: LOW) moved lower by 9.59% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Lowe's Companies has.Lowe's Companies's Debt Based on Lowe's Companies's balance sheet as of August 26, 2020, long-term debt is at $20.20 billion and current debt is at $1.61 billion, amounting to $21.81 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $11.64 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $10.16 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Lowe's Companies has $51.76 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.42. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Why Debt Is Important Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

It continues to drive online traffic by providing convenient shopping options like Buy Online Pickup in Store, curbside pickup, contactless self-service pickup lockers and direct-to-home delivery.  (See LOW stock analysis on TipRanks)The company is also investing in its supply chain infrastructure and revealed its plans to open 50 cross-dock delivery terminals, seven bulk distribution centers and four e-commerce fulfillment centers over the next 18 months. It continues to enhance its merchandise offerings with additions like EGO's innovative battery-powered mowers, trimmers, chainsaws and blowers.Lowe’s aims to increase the penetration of its Pro business through several initiatives, including the multi-year nationwide roll-out of a tool rental program. It has also launched an enhanced Pro loyalty program to attract professional buyers.The company is gearing up for the crucial holiday season and plans to hire 20,000 associates across its US stores and regional distribution centers to support customer demand.In September, Loop Capital analyst Laura Champine increased her price target for Lowe's to $195 from $180 and reiterated a Buy rating. In a research note to investors, Champine stated that her updated valuation model assumes that DIY activity will continue to surge due to COVID-induced home improvement spending.Champine estimates that consumer spending on home improvement will remain above historical levels for ""many more quarters"" and noted that Lowe's tight inventory management should also limit discounting.Lowe’s is scheduled to announce its 3Q results on Nov. 14. It currently scores a Strong Buy analyst consensus with 16 Buys versus 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $185.50 indicates an upside potential of 19.1% over the coming year. Shares have advanced 30% so far this year.RH (RH)High-end home goods retailer RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) bounced back strongly in 2Q FY20 (ended Aug. 1), benefiting from the increased spending on home furnishings amid stay-at-home measures.  The company operates 68 RH retail galleries, 38 outlets and 15 Waterworks showrooms in the US and Canada.RH’s revenue increased 0.4% to $709.3 million in 2Q FY20 after declining 19.3% in 1Q FY20. However, it is notable that the revenue growth in 2Q lagged behind the rise in customer orders due to supply chain issues. RH expects its 3Q revenue to lag demand by 5 to 10 points and normalize in the fourth quarter as manufacturing and inventory receipts get in line with demand. Meanwhile, the company’s 2Q adjusted EPS surged 53% to $4.90.The increase in RH’s earnings was driven by a significant expansion in its margins as the company continues to invest in its luxury brands. Gross margin increased to 46.9% in 2Q FY20 from 41.7% in 2Q FY19 and the adjusted operating margin jumped to 21.8% from 14.9%. The company expects to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 20% in FY20 with mid-single-digit revenue growth. In the long-term, RH sees the opportunity to expand its adjusted operating margin to 25%.The company expects some level of elevated spending on home goods to continue through 2021. It anticipates gaining from strong real estate activity in second-home markets, an accelerated shift of families to larger suburban homes and the momentum in homebuilding.RH now aims for net revenue growth of 8% to 12% and an adjusted net income increase of 15% to 20% over the long-term. It plans to open new design galleries in major markets with the goal of generating revenue of between $5 billion to $6 billion in North America, and has a vision to emerge as a $20 billion global brand.To attract affluent customers, the company is creating hospitality experiences like RH Yountville restaurant, which integrates food, wine, art and design in the Napa Valley and RH3, the company’s luxury yacht, which is available for charter in the Caribbean and Mediterranean. The company continues to enhance its offerings and is also looking for growth in Europe. It is also excited about the introduction of RH Residences, which will offer furnished turnkey homes and condominiums.Last month, Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski initiated coverage of RH with a Sell rating and a $320 price target. The analyst stated that while RH has opened 24 ""architecturally inspiring locations"" with impressive lifts to physical and digital sales over the last decade, he has trouble believing the next two dozen galleries will see returns consistent with those ""initial, cherry-picked projects.""Matuszewski also notes that the Street estimates may not be focusing on potential deleverage from investments and ad spending for brand awareness that ""could mount quickly."" (See RH stock analysis on TipRanks)The Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on RH. Its Moderate Buy analyst consensus breaks down into 8 Buys, 5 Holds and 1 Sell. With shares rising 77.7% year-to-date, the average analyst price target of $408.83 implies an upside potential of about 8% in the months ahead.So the better retail stock is...Lowe’s currently appears to be a better home improvement stock than RH and has a higher upside potential ahead. Moreover, it raised its quarterly dividend by 9% to $0.06 per share following its impressive 2Q results. Lowe’s is a dividend aristocrat and has a dividend yield ratio of 1.56%. In contrast, RH does not pay any dividends.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-11-10	2020-11-10 14:35:24	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Looking Into Lowe's Companies's Return On Capital Employed	Looking at Q2, Lowe's Companies (NYSE: LOW) earned $3.96 billion, a 98.74% increase from the preceding quarter. Lowe's Companies also posted a total of $27.30 billion in sales, a 38.76% increase since Q1. Lowe's Companies earned $1.99 billion, and sales totaled $19.68 billion in Q1.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q2, Lowe's Companies posted an ROCE of 0.91%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on LOWROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Lowe's Companies is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For Lowe's Companies, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q2 Earnings Insight Lowe's Companies reported Q2 earnings per share at $3.75/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.95/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Return On Capital Employed Overview: Trxade Group  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For November 10, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-09	2020-10-09 14:55:00	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	3 Dividend Kings for Safe Yields and Dividend Growth	"The U.S. stock market has roared back from the lows of the year, but the economy is by no means out of the woods. The novel coronavirus pandemic continues to keep a lid on the potential recovery of the economy, while unemployment remains at an elevated level. In an uncertain environment, risk-averse investors looking for safe income should focus on quality dividend stocks.
Specifically, we recommend investors take a closer look at the dividend kings, a group of just 30 stocks that have each increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years. The dividend kings have stood the test of time, with the unique ability to continue raising their dividends each year, even during recessions.
7 Innovative Stocks Pushing Our World Ahead
The following three dividend kings have solid dividend yields, growth potential and most importantly, safe dividend payouts backed by strong revenue and earnings:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Altria Group (NYSE:MO)
National Fuel Gas (NYSE:NFG)
Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW)

Dividend Stocks: Altria Group (MO)
Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com
	
Altria is the top tobacco company in the U.S., with its flagship Marlboro cigarette brand that captures more than 40% retail market share. The company has a diversified business which includes various tobacco products such as cigarettes and cigars, along with smokeless tobacco, wine, and a 10% investment in beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD).
Altria is a top dividend king for many reasons. Not only has it raised its dividend for more than 50 years in a row, the stock also provides a very high dividend yield of about 8.7%. This makes it the highest-yielding dividend king.
The company should be able to continue increasing its dividend for many years, as it enjoys tremendous competitive advantages. The tobacco industry is not a capital-intensive business, which gives Altria huge free cash flow that is used in large part to pay shareholders a hefty dividend. Altria also enjoys brand loyalty, a natural benefit of selling an addictive product. Finally, tobacco is a very recession-resistant business, as demand holds up even when the economy enters a downturn.
Altria has continued to generate stable profits throughout 2020. In the second quarter, revenue of $5.06 billion fell 2.5% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings-per-share came to $1.09, up 1% year-over-year. Net revenue and adjusted EPS rose 3.9% and 8.5%, respectively, over the first half of 2020. For the full year, Altria expects its 2020 full-year adjusted diluted EPS to be in a range of $4.21 to $4.38, representing a growth rate of 0% to 4% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $4.21 in 2019.
Management has a target dividend payout ratio of 80% of annual adjusted EPS. Therefore, the current annual dividend payout of $3.44 represents a 2020 dividend payout ratio of approximately 80% using the midpoint of earnings guidance. This shows the current dividend is in-line with management’s target payout ratio.

National Fuel Gas (NFG)

National Fuel Gas is a diversified energy company. It is a high-ranking dividend king because it has a high yield of 4.3%, but it is also unique as it is the only energy stock on the list of dividend kings. This is not entirely surprising, as the energy sector is a notoriously cyclical industry. Oil and gas is a “boom-and-bust” industry, due to its reliance on underlying commodity prices, which can be volatile.
Indeed, oil prices fell from over $100 per barrel to less than $30 from 2014 to 2016. After a modest recovery, oil prices have swung below $40 again on renewed concerns over a global supply glut and weak demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This reality makes it even more impressive that National Fuel Gas has increased its dividend for more than five decades.
And yet, National Fuel Gas achieved dividend-king status. This is partly due to the company’s diversification. National Fuel Gas operates five business segments: exploration and production, pipeline and storage, gathering, utility, and energy marketing. It is a diversified business across upstream, midstream, and downstream. The company’s upstream assets located in the Marcellus and Utica shale formations have production capacity of 800 million cubic feet of gas per day. Midstream operations include pipeline infrastructure, while its downstream segment provides utility services.
This mix provides a balance between regulated, stable businesses such as pipelines and utilities with cyclical areas such as exploration and production that rely on commodity prices. Not being fully exposed to the swings of oil and gas prices has served National Fuel Gas well over the years, including 2020.
7 Innovative Stocks Pushing Our World Ahead
In the most recently reported quarter, National Fuel Gas’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) declined 6% year-over-year. While so many energy stocks are reporting steep losses due to low oil and gas prices, National Fuel Gas generated adjusted operating earnings-per-share of $0.57 for the quarter. The company’s consistent profitability, even during recessions, secures the current dividend payout while leaving flexibility for future dividend increases to continue.

Lowe’s Companies (LOW)
Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com
	
Lowe’s is the second-largest home improvement retail in the U.S., behind Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Both retailers benefit from structural tailwinds, specifically the strong housing market as well as the fact that they operate in a duopoly. The highly concentrated nature of the home improvement retail industry mean Lowe’s and Home Depot have the entire market to themselves, which provides lots of customers as well as strong margins.
Lowe’s is a growth-oriented dividend king. Many of the dividend stocks on this list operate in highly mature industries that lack growth catalysts. But Lowe’s continues to generate impressive growth, even during the coronavirus pandemic. For example, in the most recent quarter, Lowe’s adjusted earnings per share increased 74% to $3.75.
This huge level of earnings growth was due largely to 34% comparable sales growth (which measures sales growth at stores open at least one year). Comparable sales growth included 135% year-over-year growth for Lowes.com as the company benefits from explosive e-commerce growth.
From 2010 to 2019, Lowe’s grew its earnings-per-share by 18% per year, on average. This growth came as a result of the economic recovery in the aftermath of the Great Recession, and more precisely the strong performance of the U.S. housing market. This has led to high dividend growth as well. The company recently increased its dividend by 9%.
A high level of dividend growth helps make up for a somewhat disappointing current yield of 1.5%. The dividend yield is slightly below the S&P 500 average yield of 1.8%, making Lowe’s relatively unappealing for investors solely focused on high yields. But Lowe’s makes up for this with high dividend growth. For example, a dividend growth rate of 9% per year means an investor will see their dividends double every eight years. Therefore, investors with time in the market could generate higher income over time with Lowe’s than with some high-yielding stocks that cannot grow their dividend payouts.

2020-09-23	2020-09-23 13:00:33	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Aboard a Winnebago in Search of Better Angels	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In Times Square on Sept. 11, a little before 9 a.m., time seems to have stopped, and not to mark the moment of the terrorist attacks 19 years ago. It’s just another quiet morning at the crossroads of the world, with barely enough traffic to keep the tumbleweeds at bay.The giant billboards still flash, but not the desnudas. There are no Elmos or SpongeBobs, no Spidermen or Batmen, no Lady Liberty on stilts, no slow-moving crowds to dodge, no souvenir peddlers. It would be wonderful if it weren’t so awful.At the corner of Broadway and 42nd Street, a sign marks the beginning of the Lincoln Highway. I once spent an hour asking passersby if they could tell me how to get to the Lincoln Highway. The replies, from those patient enough to respond, were variations of the same refrain: Nope. Never heard of it. You mean the Lincoln Tunnel? Lincoln Center? Only one man — a South Asian immigrant — knew of it, having lived alongside it in New Jersey, he proudly told me.The Lincoln Highway was dedicated in 1913 as the first road to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, zigzagging across the country from Manhattan to San Francisco. A group of auto industry leaders conceived it as way to demonstrate that traveling long distances could be done not just by train, but by car — cars still being a new phenomenon.Calling it a highway was a stretch — the roads were mostly dirt — but the suits understood marketing, and soon they had a slogan: See America First. It was directed at well-to-do auto owners who might otherwise sail to Europe for a holiday, but it still holds meaning today as airplanes and interstates render much of America invisible to travelers, and as people buy political books to understand places in “flyover country” that they would never visit (Kansas and Appalachia, for starters).So here in Times Square, I’m beginning a journey with my wife Laurel to see America by traveling the entirety of the Lincoln Highway, with the goal of reaching San Francisco by Election Day. Since we are in the midst of a pandemic and don’t want to be dependent on roadside accommodations, particularly if outbreaks get worse, we did something we had never before considered: We bought an RV — a 25-foot Winnebago, which we decided was the biggest thing we wanted to drive and the smallest thing wanted to live in.This will be a journey of discovery centered on questions, not a polemic based on ideology. My goal is not to explain why America is the way it is, or why Democrats and Republicans think and vote the way they do. It’s simply to see America — a cross-section of it, anyway — using Lincoln as a lens, and to imagine where the road might lead from here, if we can find and follow our better angels.We cross 42nd Street with the sidewalk to ourselves, save three men sitting against a wall with two 30-packs of Keystone Light beer. At the corner of 10th Avenue, where the Westies once roamed, two ironworkers talk outside the office of Local 580. At 12th Avenue on the Hudson River, we board a ferry, as the original Lincoln Highway travelers did — the Lincoln Tunnel didn’t open until 1937. Across the river, on the bluffs of Weehawken, the highway passes the site of the first and only murder by a vice president of the U.S., before it winds around to become John F. Kennedy Boulevard, the main drag through Jersey City, one of America’s most diverse and overlooked cities.Unlike in Manhattan, where I have lived for the past 23 years, I have no basis for judging what is normal in Jersey City, or anywhere else. I’m a tourist with no clear sense of what came before — only what is here now. Some businesses are closed or closed to walk-in customers, which makes it only slightly easier to pass the White Mana Diner, a relic of the 1939 World’s Fair, where it was promoted as “the diner of the future.” If we don’t make San Francisco by Election Day, it may be because the Winnebago breaks down or we get sick, or just that we lose the strength to not stop at every burger joint and ice cream stand.Jersey City is home to a statue of Lincoln by James Earle Fraser, who also designed the buffalo nickel. Called “Mystic Lincoln,” it portrays the president sitting on a bench, gazing downward. This is the Lincoln who bore the weight of an endlessly bloody war and the loss of two young sons to disease. It is a powerful and fitting backdrop for a conversation about Sept. 11 with Mayor Steve Fulop, who quit his job at Goldman Sachs after the terrorist attacks to join the Marines.Fulop had two master’s degrees, but he didn’t enter the military as an officer, and he was glad for it: “I was exposed to a lot of people that I would never have interacted with, from different backgrounds that I would never have experienced, and I think a lot of people were introduced to somebody like myself for the first time. I mean, there were some people in my boot camp that never met a Jewish guy before.”The military is still a force for integrating young people and breaking down racial and ethnic barriers, but the two groups that most need mixing — the poor and the rich — are both underrepresented. So too are Jews and Muslims, and both are routinely targeted by those who see them as threats to America. Jersey City has seen more than its share of this fear and loathing.After the Sept. 11 attacks, rumors spread that Muslims in Jersey City celebrated — “patently false” and “totally fabricated,” says Fulop. But once accusations are hurled, suspicion lingers. The local government just to the south, in Bayonne, had long blocked a mosque from being built until a federal lawsuit finally cleared the way for its approval in 2018.“We had a similar situation,” says Fulop. “We have the largest Coptic community here in Jersey City. One of the largest ones in the United States. … And so they were building a new church, and the Coptic community is similar to let’s say the Orthodox Jewish community. They dress differently. They look differently. They were building on a property that was desolate and barren, and underutilized by any objective measure. And they had pretty fierce community pushback with regards to building it. We approved it and we pushed it through, because I thought it was on the right side.”It was the same way, Fulop says, “when the ultra-Orthodox community was moving into that part of Jersey City. A lot of the comments that you hear, and the types of things that people were saying, they weren’t anti-Semitic. But if you listen to the rhetoric, you could hear in the steady drumbeat that there was an undercurrent.” And when people get swept up in those kinds of undercurrents, no one is safe.Late last year, two Black residents in Jersey City targeted a kosher grocery store, killing four people, including a police officer. Nationally, violent hate crimes hit a new high last year, and Fulop worries that the undercurrents are being normalized in ways that will be hard to reverse.It doesn’t take long for us to get lost. I miss the turn into Newark and end up God knows where. But Laurel gets us back on course and eventually we find the Lincoln statue in front of the Essex County Courthouse. I had hoped to interview the police chief here, but the timing didn’t work out. (I later spoke with him on the phone — more on that in a future column.) My contact in the police department said she had worked in that courthouse for many years but never realized a Lincoln statue is out front — just as almost no New Yorkers ever notice the Lincoln Highway sign in Times Square.The sculptor of the Newark Lincoln was Gutzon Borglum, who also carved Mount Rushmore and Stone Mountain, the monumental paean to the confederacy that he seemed to sympathize with, having been affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan. Here at a government building where justice is dispatched, even a symbol of liberty and equality carries a reminder of subjugation and inequality.Heading south from Newark, I’m too focused on the road to realize that I’m already 10 minutes past the Edison Memorial Tower, home to the world’s largest light bulb. How did we miss that?! After a moment’s regret, I begrudgingly accept that we cannot stop at every historical site. There are too many, and the whole point of this journey is to look ahead, to see America for what it is and might become, not for what it was. We are in search of Lincoln’s living spirit, and so we must spend more time in communities than museums. But that doesn’t mean we will ignore history — far from it.At about 7 p.m., I meet Sadaf Jaffer, the mayor of Montgomery Township, New Jersey, the first female Muslim to serve as mayor of a U.S. city. She has just come from a Sept. 11 ceremony at the local firehouse.Jaffer says that when she first ran for office, “My opponents also made flyers or campaign advertisements that said that I was dangerous and extreme. [When] my opponent had a concession post on Facebook, the first comment on it was, ‘I was born in this country and some Indian is going to tell me what to do. You can’t fix stupid.’ So it is an undercurrent.”The same undercurrent that Fulop spoke of seems as likely to run through affluent neighborhoods as working-class and poor ones, and Jaffer said it has gotten much worse in recent years. I ask her why.“I attribute that to the Islamophobia industry — a whole bunch of people who basically their main goal is to demonize Islam and to scare the American public. I think in 2001, first of all, we had a president who said, ‘This is not about Islam.’ That Islam is a religion of peace, and research does show that political leadership makes a difference. And if political leaders are using hateful rhetoric, then we see a rise in hate crimes. But also I think most Americans didn’t really know much about Islam and they didn’t think they knew much about Islam. … Whereas now I think that there’s been 20 years of people spreading misinformation as fact. And so a lot of people are convinced that they know more about Islam than I do, as someone who has a Ph.D. in Islamic studies. So I think that it’s attributable to that — to a whole industry of books, shows, movies that have informed people and misinformed them, and it’s very, very hard to correct misinformation.”I had asked Jaffer to meet me at Rockingham Historic Site, a farmhouse where George Washington wrote his Farewell Address, just outside the neighboring town of Princeton. In 1862, Lincoln essentially created the first Presidents Day by declaring that Washington’s Farewell Address should be read across the nation, including to all enlisted troops. So began a tradition that is now long gone, while the holiday remains — just as it is now normal to hold Easter egg hunts without going to church. In America, all holidays, sacred and civic, get swallowed by commerce, our unifying religion.But in his farewell address, Washington spoke of religion as a crucial part of the foundation of the country: “And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.”Washington never referenced Christianity, nor — like Lincoln — was he devout, and his letter to Jews in Newport, Rhode Island, established an important precedent for religious tolerance. But he was firm in his belief that religion was important for upholding the morality necessary to sustain the nation. I ask Jaffer, was he right?“I don’t think that it necessarily has to be through houses of worship or organized religion of a certain sort, but I do think that there is a lack of ethics education and just grappling with moral questions is certainly something that I think young people ought to do because otherwise people don’t have religion and they’re not left with any mooring to hold them down in terms of what are our values, why are we here, what’s our purpose?”Jaffer says we can have ethics without religion, but what of religious organizations that play a crucial role in supporting their communities? If they disappear, who fills the hole?By this time, the sun has long set over the field of solar panels across the street from the Rockingham farmhouse, and the two of us are sitting in the dark. I tell Jaffer that this is probably the strangest interview she’s ever done. She laughs and doesn’t disagree.Laurel and I drive into Princeton, which is busier than Times Square was. Outdoor dining seems to be booming, tables look fairly tight together, and masks are hardly universal. The college students are back in session under strict safety protocols. But what about the adults?There are no campgrounds nearby. So to end the first night of our journey, we try every RVer’s plan B: the Walmart parking lot. Except the Walmart has permanently closed, the parking lot lights are out, and two guys are lingering with a bottle of something. Maybe we better move on. We find our way to a Lowe’s and get ready for bed, only to realize the refrigerator has shut down and we can’t figure out how to get it back on.To see America, we’ll have to start by looking more closely at the Winnebago owner’s manual.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Frank Barry is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion. This column is part of a series, “Looking for Lincoln: A Portrait of America at a Crossroads.” It features reports from Barry’s journey west along the Lincoln Highway, a zigzagging network of local roads running from Times Square to the Golden Gate Bridge, from Sept. 11 to Election Day.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinionSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lincoln-highway-trump-america-winnebago-120004267.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-25	2020-08-25 13:43:38	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Why Best Buy’s Pandemic Bounce Fell Short of Target’s	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Best Buy Co.’s second-quarter sales increase was not quite as booming as those of its big-box store peers. But the consumer electronics giant still belongs in the pandemic-era retail winner’s circle because its growth was, in some ways, harder fought. The retailer reported Tuesday that U.S. comparable sales rose 5% from a year earlier, a far cry from the greater-than-20% growth reported last week by Target Corp., Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos. As destinations for groceries and prescription medicines, the likes of Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. kept their doors open throughout the crisis. So, too, did the home-improvement heavyweights. Best Buy, however, moved to close brick-and-mortar stores in the early days of the pandemic, initially using them only for curbside pickup of online orders.   By the time the second quarter started, it had opened only a portion of stores, and customers had to make appointments. It gradually ramped up from there, with almost all stores open for shopping without appointments by late June. That means that for roughly six weeks of the quarter, it was relying solely on e-commerce and appointments to meet customer demand. While its digital sales soared, rising 242% from a year earlier, it makes sense that having brick-and-mortar shopping so restricted for a while kept a lid on total sales. For expensive items such as home theaters, many people are going to want to see options in-person before they buy. The company reported that in the final weeks of the second quarter, when stores had fully reopened, its sales were up 16% from a year earlier. Additionally, sales rose 20% in the first three weeks of the current quarter, though executives don’t expect growth to continue at such a blistering pace for the entire period. That detail about the slowing sales growth sent Best Buy shares down in pre-market trading from their record close on Monday. Best Buy, of course, benefited from fresh consumer needs and wants borne of stay-at-home lifestyles. As customers needed to build out work-from-home setups or remote learning stations for their children, it reported big sales of computers and tablets. The largest comparable sales growth came from its appliances category. This is a different pattern from the one in the first quarter, when a burst of video game purchases helped offset weakness in other lines of business. While the company said it experienced constrained inventory in certain categories, overall, it reflects well on Best Buy’s supply chain and inventory management strategies that it held up as demand shifted to different areas. Best Buy executives should certainly view its results with some measure of caution. Some of the sales rung up in the quarter could be attributed to demand that was just pulled forward. In other words, people who would have otherwise hung on to an old laptop until next year might have pulled the trigger on a new one this summer to work more efficiently from home. They should take comfort, though, in the fact that plenty of the increased demand is incremental business. If not for widespread work-from-home orders, people would never have bought some of the desktop computers, printers and scanners that flew off shelves this summer. If not for a dearth of events to keep them busy, they might not have sprung for a projector to watch movies. If not for extensive restaurant closings that are forcing more home cooking, they might not have purchased an extra freezer for the basement. Given that the unemployment rate is still soaring and Congress is deadlocked on additional relief for workers, it’s worth pondering how Best Buy would hold up if the economy remains weak. Matthew McClintock, an analyst with Raymond James, pointed out in a recent research note that the retailer’s assortment is much more resilient in a recession than it was in 2008 and 2009. Since then, the chain has made a big push into appliances, capturing market share that once-mighty Sears squandered. Replacing a broken dishwasher or refrigerator is not exactly a discretionary purchase, so being a bigger player in that category provides some measure of insulation for Best Buy. Plus, the categories it is better known for, such as computers, tablets and smartphones, feel less like discretionary purchases than they once did.

2020-08-20	2020-08-20 13:24:25	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Home Depot vs Lowe’s: Which Stock Looks Stronger After A Stellar Q2?	The pandemic restricted people to their homes and many made the best of this opportunity by remodeling their homes and taking up pending home improvement projects. The recent blockbuster results of home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe’s clearly indicated the shift in consumers' discretionary spending from apparel buying and restaurant dining to home goods.Using the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, we will place the two home retailers alongside each other to see which stock offers the most compelling investment opportunity right now.Home Depot (HD)Home Depot, which operates 2,293 stores, benefited immensely from the rise in demand from DIY (do-it-yourself) customers as they took up deck building, painting, and home repairs amid the pandemic. Sales to Pro customers grew double digits.The company’s sales for the fiscal second quarter (ended August 2) rose 23.4% to $38.1 billion as overall comparable sales or comps surged 23.4% with US comps growing 25%. Notably, 13 of the company’s 14 merchandising departments generated double-digit comps while the kitchen and bath department comps increased by high single-digit.Strong sales drove a 26.8% growth in the EPS to $4.02, even as the company incurred $480 million in additional expenses amid the pandemic.Strength in several big-ticket categories, like, appliances, riding lawnmowers and Patio Furniture, was partially offset by softer sales in certain indoor installation categories, like special-order kitchens and countertops.Home Depot says it will continue to enhance its online channel. Sales through digital platforms surged about 100% in the second quarter supported by facilities like buy online and pick up in-store.The company now plans to open three new distribution centers in Georgia over the next 18 months to facilitate flexible delivery and pick-up options for Pro and DIY customers.Home Depot indicated that the momentum in comparable sales growth in the first two weeks of August was at levels similar to the second quarter. The company expects increasing demand from Pro customers as markets continue to reopen.On August 19, Merrill Lynch analyst Elizabeth Suzuki upgraded Home Depot to Buy from Hold and said that it is not too late to buy the stock. Suzuki raised the price target to $330 from $290.“Although home improvement spending in the coming quarter may decelerate amidst sequentially declining government stimulus/unemployment benefits, we believe that the longer-term tailwinds for the home improvement industry are generally favorable,&quot; the analyst opined. (See HD’s stock analysis on TipRanks)Home Depot stock has risen 29.5% year-to-date and an average 12-month price target of $309.90 reflects a further upside of 9.56%. The Strong Buy consensus for Home Depot stock is based on 17 Buys and 5 Holds.Lowe’s (LOW)          Like its larger peer Home Depot, Lowe’s also experienced impressive sales growth in the fiscal second quarter, in fact at an even higher rate. Lowe’s sales grew 30.1% Y/Y to $27.3 billion. Overall comps rose 34.2% with US comps growth coming at 35.1%. Online penetration grew to 8% of the top line with sales through Lowes.com rising 135%.Lowe's experienced an unprecedented growth of 20% across all its merchandise categories as customers spent more time at their homes due to the pandemic and focused on enhancing their homes, creating work and study space, and repair and maintenance projects. Pro comps growth in the second quarter was in the mid-20s but was outpaced by DIY comps.Lowe’s second-quarter adjusted EPS grew by an impressive 74.4% Y/Y to $3.75. Higher sales and margin expansion drove the bottom-line growth. Lowe’s, which operates 1,968 stores, incurred $460 million in COVID-19 related expenses, including incremental wages in the second quarter.To address the spike in demand for home improvement goods and boost its sales, Lowe’s plans to enhance its product offerings, simplify its stores and provide better services. The company is also investing in supply chain infrastructure and prioritizing omnichannel capabilities.Indeed, LOW plans to open 50 cross-dock delivery terminals, seven bulk distribution centers and four e-commerce fulfillment centers over the next 18 months.Lowe’s has a smaller exposure to Pro customers compared to Home Depot. The company intends to deepen its relationship with Pro customers through several initiatives, including the multi-year nationwide roll-out of a tool rental program. (See LOW stock analysis on TipRanks)Lowe's did not provide any specific guidance due to the uncertain business environment but stated that the sales trends in July continued in August with strength across DIY and Pro customers.Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel reiterated his Buy rating for Lowe’s and raised the price target to $185 from $150.Nagel said, “For a while, we have highlighted Lowe’s as one of the most compelling larger cap names in our expansive coverage universe, owing to a favorable industry backdrop, limited price competition, and the efforts of new senior leadership to improve performance and ultimately narrow a long-standing operating gap between LOW and Home Depot (HD).”Following the results, all 21 analysts covering Lowe’s stock have a Buy rating, implying a unanimous Strong Buy consensus. Lowe’s stock has advanced 32% so far this year. An average price target of $166.24 reflects an upside of 5.03% over the next 12-months.Choosing between two good retailersBoth Home Depot and Lowe’s have proved their strength through their latest results. Unlike several companies who suspended dividend payments, both Home Depot and Lowe's continued to reward investors with dividends amid the crisis.Analysts expect continued strength in the home category to benefit these companies. But with the entire Street bullish on Lowe’s, it looks to be a better buy currently. Moreover, Lowe’s is trading at a lower valuation compared to Home Depot.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-08-19	2020-08-19 16:57:28	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Lowe's	Benzinga's PreMarket Prep airs every morning from 8-9 a.m. ET. During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.For those who don't have the time to tune in live or listen to the podcast, Benzinga will highlight one stock that merits further discussion. This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation.Two people can look at the exact same chart and have different opinions, and both may turn out to be right. On Wednesday's PreMarket Prep show, a possible setup on the long for Lowe's Companies (NYSE: LOW) was discussed and almost resulted in the hosts making one of their traditional lunch wagers.Lowe's Posts Q2 Beat: Before the open Wednesday, Lowe's reported second-quarter adjusted EPS of $3.75, which handsomely beat a $2.95 Street estimate.Sales of $27.3 billion beat a $24.27-billion estimate.With such a large beat on both fronts, neither of the hosts anticipated the issue replicating Home Depot (NYSE: HD), which gave up a $2-plus gain Tuesday to end the session over $3 in the red.Dick A Buyer On A Lowe's Pullback: PreMarket Prep co-host Dennis Dick wanted to buy the issue on a pullback and named $158 as an entry point, with a stop at Tuesday's low of $157.Although Lowe's was trading at $161.50, the author of this article was willing to wager that Dick would be able to reach his price.The reason: based on the trading history for Lowe's on earnings day, it is much more volatile than usual and has big spikes in either direction before reversing course.View more earnings on LOWOdds Aren't Good Enough: Just as traders are picky on price entry, they do not want to give up an edge to another trader on a wager, even a small one.As a result, the author of this article demanded 3-to-1 odds that the $158 level would come into play in Wednesday's session. Dick would have nothing of it.Lowe's Premarket Price Action: At the end of the broadcast Wednesday, Lowe's was trading at $161.50. My final wager, with 3-to-1 odds, was that Dick would execute his $158 buy if he chose to do so. He balked and no lunch bet was made.Lowe's Price Action Off The Open: After a higher open, Lowe's blasted to $162.89 and reversed course.Fortunately for Dick, he did not take the wager and decided against trying to purchase the issue at $158.If he had, he would been stopped out, as the issue breached Tuesday's low ($157), falling to $156.25. After making that low, Lowe's rebounded as high as $160.28. The stock was trading slightly positive at $157.92 at the time of publication. PreMarket Prep Is All About Scenario Analysis: While many financial gurus promise huge gains with exact entry and exit points in multiple issues -- and then highlight their winners -- that is not the way it is done on our podcast.Instead we provide the best scenario analysis based on current market factors and years of market experience, leaving traders and investors to make their own decisions.Photo courtesy of Lowe's.

Lowe’s Delivers Blowout Q2 As Online Sales Surge 135%	Lowe’s (LOW) has reported stellar earnings for the second quarter, easily beating consensus expectations on both the top and bottom line.Specifically Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of $3.75 beat Street expectations by $0.80 while GAAP EPS of $3.74 also beat by $1.06. Revenue of $27.3B sailed past estimates by $3.06B, and was up an impressive 30.1% year-over-year.Meanwhile comparable sales of 34.2% came in at more than double the consensus of 16.3%, with comparable sales for the U.S. home improvement business rising by 35.1% from 2Q19. That was with sales for Lowes.com exploding by 135% year-over-year.“We delivered very strong second quarter results, with all merchandising divisions posting comparable sales growth exceeding 20% and all U.S. geographic regions delivering comparable sales growth of at least 30%” commented Marvin R. Ellison, Lowe’s CEO.He added that sales were driven by a consumer focus on the home, core repair and maintenance activities, and wallet share shift away from other discretionary spending.Looking ahead, Ellison stated that LOW’s sales momentum continues into August, and the company is investing in the business to further its omnichannel capabilities.As of July 31, 2020, Lowe’s operated 1,968 home improvement and hardware stores in the United States and Canada.On May 20, LOW withdrew its financial guidance for fiscal year 2020 citing limited visibility into future business trends during this unprecedented operating environment, which “results in an unusually wide range of potential outcomes for 2020 financial performance.”Shares in LOW stock are up 3% in Wednesday’s pre-market trading, and have climbed 32% year-to-date. The stock scores a bullish Strong Buy Street consensus, with no less than 20 back-to-back buy ratings. However, the average analyst price target of $162 indicates limited upside potential from current levels.Following the earnings report, Wells Fargo’s Zachary Fadem reiterated his LOW buy rating, writing: “In our view, Q2 is one for the record books, and considering the outperformance relative to Home Depot (HD), we’re making the case that valuation should re-rate with LOW’s trading 5x turns below HD and a 9% discount to SPX.”And while LOW’s outperformance could moderate/reverse in coming quarters as DIY and key category tailwinds wane, Fadem still sees “2H upside from structural-COVID factors, improving sales productivity, e-commerce /Pro initiatives and a new stay-at-home lifestyle that we believe has legs.” (See LOW stock analysis on TipRanks)Meanwhile Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel reiterated his buy rating and $185 price target, writing: “Q2 results at LOW surpassed even the most optimistic forecasts.”Related News:  Walmart Delivers Earnings Triumph; E-Commerce Sales Double  Home Depot Sales Exceed Estimates As Shoppers Pile On DIY Products  Kohl’s Dips 17% As Covid-19 To Hit Back-to-School Sales More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * GFL Environment Rebukes Spruce Point’s Debt Claims; Shares Rise   * KBR To Buy Space Contractor Centauri For $800M; Shares Pop 6%   * Blackstone Set To Win Bid For Takeda’s Consumer Health Unit - Report   * Advance Auto Parts Tops 2Q Estimates Driven By Same-Store Sales	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lowe-delivers-blowout-q2-online-122511590.html?.tsrc=rss

RBA Ends 3-Month Hiatus, Offering to Buy A$500 Million of Bonds	(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s central bank is returning to the government bond market after a three-month hiatus as it aims to re-anchor yields on the three-year security that it targets through its purchasing program.The Reserve Bank of Australia offered to purchase as much as A$500 million ($359 million) of federal government securities maturing in April 2023 on Wednesday, under its program to lower yields.Governor Philip Lowe announced the resumption of bond buying in Tuesday’s policy statement, when the board kept its interest rate and yield target unchanged at 0.25%. Three-year yields have been “a little higher than 25 basis points over recent weeks,” he said, adding that “further purchases will be undertaken as necessary.”The limited size of Wednesday’s offer reflects market movements following Lowe’s announcement Tuesday, which saw three-year government bond yields drop to lows 0.252%, from 0.268% at Monday’s close. However, today’s decision seemingly disappointed markets, with the three-year yield jumping to 0.259% at 11:17 a.m. in Sydney. The Australian dollar advanced 0.2% to 71.74 U.S. cents as of 11:25 a.m. in Sydney, rising for a second day.Christopher Kent, assistant governor who oversees financial markets at the central bank, gently signaled during a question-and-answer session after a speech last week that the RBA may re-enter the secondary market.“We notice it’s been rising a little bit of late but it does move around from day to day, week to week,” he said of the three-year yield. “That’s something we’re watching closely and we said, if we need to, if it was to move too far away from 25, then we would stand ready to buy more.”The RBA last purchased bonds on May 6, and had acquired A$51.35 billion ($36.8 billion) in face value of securities of various maturities issued by federal, state and territory governments since March 20, when it began purchasing notes following an emergency meeting in order to hold down borrowing costs across the economy.The RBA halted bond buying in May as yields stabilized across the curve and money-market stresses eased. The calm in fixed-income markets allowed federal and state governments to borrow at an unprecedented pace to fund record spending aimed at countering the economic impact of the pandemic. The federal government raised A$85.6 billion last quarter, more than twice as much as the previous record for sales set in the first three months of 2017.Australia’s currency has surged over the past four months as the RBA’s success in stabilizing markets spurred foreign demand for record debt sales.Lowe said in Tuesday’s statement the yield target “will remain in place until progress is being made toward the goals for full employment and inflation.”Australia’s economy slid into its first recession in almost three decades in the first half of this year as efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19 forced a shutdown of large tracts of the economy. The RBA, under a baseline scenario, sees output falling 6% in 2020 and then expanding 5% the following year.(Updates with purchase announcement from second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/australia-resumes-bond-buying-following-001719240.html?.tsrc=rss

The most populous U.S. state reported 130 deaths Friday and has recorded a total of 366,164 positive cases since the pandemic began, the state’s Department of Public Health said.California Orders Most Schools Online (3:05 p.m. NY)California said public schools in the state’s hardest hit counties won’t be able to open for on-campus classes until the spread of the coronavirus in that area is contained.

The rate has increased to 1.11, so “each new positive case is leading to one more positive case,” Murphy said in a Twitter post imploring people to observe precautions.“Social distance. Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Stay at home if you feel sick,” the governor said.More Retailers to Require Masks (12:40 p.m. NY)Lowe’s Companies Inc., Rite Aid Corp. and video-game retailer GameStop Corp. joined chains from Walmart to Kroger in requiring masks at all locations.

The state Department of Health Services reported 91 new virus deaths, bringing the total to 2,583.The statewide positivity rate rose to 25% on Friday from 24.5% the day before.On Thursday, though, Governor Doug Ducey said Arizona is seeing its “first good news” in its coronavirus metrics since closing bars, gyms and other businesses at the end of June. Arizona’s average number of people expected to become infected by each Covid-19 case was 0.98 Thursday, down from 1.18 on June 29, he said. A number above 1 suggests the virus is spreading.The governor said the numbers are cause for cautious optimism, but there’s no end in sight. “There will be no victory laps,” he said.Masks for Republican Lawmakers (10:45 a.m. NY)House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will require fellow Republicans in Congress to wear face masks at a conference on Tuesday, according to a summary of his directive seen by Bloomberg.

Trump’s previous virus briefings had “wild ratings” because “people were tuning in.”His approval rating was better when he was at the podium, she said.Imperial College’s Vaccine to Go to Next Trial Phase (8:50 a.m. NY)Imperial College’s Covid-19 vaccine trial will progress to its next stage, the university said in a statement on its website. Some 105 participants between the ages of 18 and 75 will be randomized to receive their first shot of one of three doses of the vaccine at a west London facility, followed by a booster four weeks later.“We have had a promising start but it remains too early to speculate whether our vaccine candidate will be effective in preventing infection,” Dr Katrina Pollock, clinical lead on the Imperial COVAC1 study, said in the statement.Goldman Predicts U.S. May Have a Vaccine by End of Year (8:17 a.m. NY)The first vaccine for Covid-19 could be available in the U.S. later this year, Goldman Sachs analysts forecast. The potential for Moderna Inc. to file interim results with U.S. regulators from a 30,000-patient trial due to start by July 27 is underappreciated, analysts led by Salveen Richter said.The chances of success in 2020 are enhanced further by four other vaccine programs slated to enter into the final research phase of testing sometime this summer, according to Goldman. Those experimental inoculations expected to start large-scale testing this summer are from Pfizer Inc. in partnership with BioNtech SE; AstraZeneca Plc with University of Oxford; Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Sinovac Biotech Ltd.Barcelona Hit With New Curbs (7:51 a.m. NY)Catalan officials imposed new curbs on movement and gatherings in Barcelona after the business and tourism hub suffered an upsurge in new cases.

They could guide vaccine discovery, or validate the effectiveness of one, the researchers said.Singapore Tightens Rules for Some Travelers (7:20 a.m. NY)Singapore will tighten rules on travelers who had been in coronavirus hotspots including Japan, Hong Kong and Australia’s Victoria state, mandating quarantine in dedicated facilities from July 20.Travelers who have been in those regions in the 14 days prior to entering Singapore won’t be able to serve their quarantine at their residence, the island’s authorities said on Friday.Fewer Americans Approve of Trump’s Handling of Covid-19 (7 a.m. NY)President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak has the approval of 38% of Americans, down from 46% in May and 51% in March, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC poll.

Anyone will now be able to use public transport, Johnson said in a televised press conference, marking a change from guidance to avoid it where possible. And from Aug. 1, he said employers will have “more discretion” on bringing staff back into offices.Johnson and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak are trying to revive economic activity and stave off an expected wave of job cuts as the government tapers support for businesses and continues to ease a lockdown that began on March 23.The rate of coronavirus infection in England has leveled off, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday.Iran Cases Rise (6 a.m. NY)Cases in Iran continued to climb at a rate of 0.9%, with 2,379 new cases recorded to bring the total to 269,440 infections.

The ratings on three P&I classes were downgraded due to a decline in pool performance and higher anticipated losses driven primarily by the decline in performance and refinance concerns of the RiverTown Crossings Mall loan, representing 26% of the pool.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/46dac448-c286-37d9-be81-6b79b172343a/cfcre-commercial-mortgage.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-19	2020-06-19 15:05:25	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	7 Housing Stocks That Are Worth Your Money	There's no doubt the economy isn't going gangbusters here. But there are plenty of people -- and companies -- that have been patient and kept their money safe in the hopes of moving into the real estate market when rates and prices were very attractive. That has put housing stocks in the spotlight more recently.The proof of this renewed interest? Mortgage applications are rising and home construction is also on the rise.While you may not be ready to pick up a new home, buy some condos or pick up some commercial property, people are also upgrading their houses since they're spending a lot more time there.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd remember, there are massive firms that solely focus on &quot;alternative&quot; investments, which means non-stock investing, like real estate. They can borrow at outrageously low rates and buy entire subdivisions from developers if they wish to add certain properties or locations into their portfolios.  * 10 Robotics Stocks on the Technological Cutting Edge The seven housing stocks worth your time right now are beneficiaries of these trends in one way or another:  * RH (NYSE:RH)  * Sleep Number (NASDAQ:SNBR)  * Lowe's (NYSE:LOW)  * PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM)  * Floor & Decor Holdings (NYSE:FND)  * Home Depot (NYSE:HD)  * Cavco Industries (NASDAQ:CVCO)And they're all highly rated growth stocks in my Portfolio Grader I use to find Growth Investor plays. With that in mind, let's take a closer look at what makes each of these worthy of consderation. Housing Stocks to Buy: RH (RH)Source: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com Formerly known as Restoration Hardware, this firm revamped that catalog and storefront business into its new upscale iteration with high-end galleries, a massive catalog and outlet stores.Currently it has about 70 galleries in the U.S. and Canada, around 20 design galleries, half a dozen baby & child galleries and 3 dozen outlets. It's akin to the Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) of furnishings, with customer service being a major part of its premium experience.This is a good market to be in right now, since wealthy clients stuck at home have the disposable income to refurnish their main homes, ski homes and beach homes. And those that aspire to that lifestyle can also access this style now that there's not much else to spend on.In the past three months RH stock is up 175%, which shows that smart money sees this as a good stock for our current predicament. And it's still relatively cheap. Sleep Number (SNBR)Source: Eric Glenn/Shutterstock.com This is another company that is making waves among the housing stocks niche, as people are spending more time at home, and likely more time in bed now that they don't have their commutes to deal with.The concept of an air-filled mattress was a wild idea in 1987, when the competition was Civil War-era spring mattresses. It was a disruptor in a very conservative space.But it has become a major player and it has managed to maintain control of its own fortunes through the journey. It has its own stores and distribution network.Certainly, memory foam has made a big splash, but SNBR continues to grow its brand and has been able to make its pricing competitive to other alternative mattresses. And no one else makes a bed like SNBR. That's a nice moat in its industry, which is what I'm looking for with any of my Growth Investor recommendations.  * 10 Cash-Rich Stocks to Buy for Peace of Mind It has a $1.2 billion market cap, but that makes SNBR stock a formidable player among other housing stocks. The stock is up 68% in the past three months and still trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio below 15. Lowe's (LOW)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com The country's No. 2 home improvement store is another indirect beneficiary of the lockdown. As people are taking on DIY projects and now, feeling comfortable enough to have contractors in to do work, Lowe's is becoming a very busy place again.And in this market, the next quarter's numbers will be huge compared to the lockdown period, which will be enough to drive LOW stock even higher.Also remember that Lowe's has been around since 1946 in North Carolina, so it has seen booms and busts before and has kept on growing.It's more of pure play on U.S.-based home improvement and hardware, with some stores in Canada as well. It has tried some efforts expanding beyond U.S. shores, but has found its greatest success at home.LOW stock is up 93% in the past three months -- and remember, this stock has a $102 billion market cap -- and still trades below the average P/E for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500. PulteGroup (PHM)Source: Shutterstock Mortgage rates just hit a record low … again. And that is very good news for the No. 3 home builder in the U.S. It operates in 44 markets in 23 states and has a number of brands beyond the original Pulte brand, including Centex, John Weiland, American West, Radnor and others.All the brands appeal to all stages of life and demographic sectors in the market.By extending its brands across so many markets, it can take advantage of regional trends.But the bottom line is, it's cheap to build right now and homes are in demand, so that means PHM should see solid growth and improving margins. Plus PHM offers mortgage and title services, so the company has vertically integrated the financing into the building, which is another piece of the business the company can profit from.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks for Loyal Cannabis Bulls The stock is up 86% in the past three months and is still trading at a P/E that's less than 10. And I've got lots more great buys for you in all sorts of industries. Floor & Decor Holdings (FND)Source: Shutterstock This national flooring company got its start just 20 years ago, yet is now sporting a market cap of nearly $6 billion and doing nearly $2 billion in sales a year.That's quite a growth story compared to other housing stocks.Some of that has been its ability to move into areas where the competition was hurt during the 2008 financial crisis and take advantage of the low interest rates to grow its business.Since that era of low rates has only improved now, and there are millions of people sitting around staring out their flooring, business is booming once again. Plus, all the new construction means its commercial lines are also growing.FND stock is up 103% in the past three months, but the stock is getting a bit expensive. However, if the recovery in the U.S. stays strong, its premium will be worth it in the long run. Home Depot (HD)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com This is the largest hardware store in the world. It operates across the U.S., Canada and Mexico as well as Guam, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.Started in 1978 its disruptive concept was the big box hardware store. Remember, back then local hardware stores dotted the American landscape and they provided certain things, but there were other specialty stores where you had to go to get other items.For example, for one job you may need to hit the local hardware store, lumber yard, paint store and flooring company to get all you needed for a job. Home Depot changed all that.Today, you see this concept play out across industries and no one thinks about the big box concept or how it changed the face of American retail.And Home Depot has continually found a way to make this concept work for its shareholders. In today's economy, its ability to draw DIYers as well as contractors working on renovation projects continues to grow its revenue and margins.It also operates Interline Brands, which has over 90 distribution centers and specializes in the commercial maintenance and repair business.  * 7 A-Rated Growth Stocks That Are Loaded With Long-Term Potential HD stock is up 55% in the past three months, but delivers a reliable 2.4% dividend and is trading with a P/E that's in line with S&P 500 average. You can see why this is a mainstay of my Growth Investor Buy List and also one of the best housing stocks to consider now. Cavco Industries (CVCO)Source: Shutterstock It might not be a name that springs to mind when considering housing stocks to buy, but Cavco is one of the top builders of manufactured homes, modular homes, commercial buildings, park model RVs and vacation cabins. It has retailers in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Japan.It sells these homes under eight different brands and also has an insurance division as well as a mortgage division. Those both offer significant revenue streams moving forward since both the financing and the insurance on these homes is different than it is on standard structures.Also, new technologies have made these homes much higher quality than they were in the past and there's much broader appeal for first time home buyers that don't want to take on a huge mortgage, or older couples that don't need a lot of house but want privacy.Its vacation cabin division should also do well as people look to the great outdoors for down time and they can buy a piece of land and drop a house on it quickly.CVCO stock is up 53% in the past three months yet still trades in line with the S&P 500.Outside of the housing market, a major way to employ smart diversification is when a company is entrenched in the biggest megatrends of our time. One that I'm particularly excited about now is helping enable a major upgrade across the telecom industry, across the world. The 5G Buildout Is an Incredible Opportunity for Investors Right NowWithin two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. With 5G, we'll have cable modem speeds on any device; no need to plug in. That's a big deal for rural areas … the very same areas that are also key to President Donald Trump's reelection. So, by pushing 5G over the goal line, Trump will deliver a big win for his base -- and strike a blow against Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies.But in the big picture, 5G is about much more than trade wars and faster downloads. Because 5G is 100 times faster than 4G, it'll allow your wireless internet devices to work in real time. That advancement is a game changer for tech companies.With the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity with 5G stocks now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics … but they can't compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it's got ultra-fast 5G. That's how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I'm targeting is enjoying an influx of big money on Wall Street, and it has good fundamentals, too -- making it a &quot;Strong Buy&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system now.Click here to watch my new, free briefing on this extraordinary technology and the opportunity with 5G stocks.When you do, you'll see how to claim a free copy of my investment report, The King of 5G &quot;Turbo Button&quot; Technology, which has full details on this company -- and what makes it such a great buy now.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett. In his latest feat, Louis discovered the &quot;Master Key&quot; to profiting from the biggest tech revolution of this (or any) generation. Louis Navellier may hold some of the aforementioned securities in one or more of his newsletters.

2020-05-25	2020-05-25 19:12:01	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	The Street Deconstructs Home Depot, Lowe's Earnings	"Do-it-yourself home improvement retail rivals Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) and Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW) reported first-quarter results last week. Here's how some of the Street's top analysts reacted to the reports.The Home Depot Analysts Piper Sandler analyst Peter Keith maintained a Neutral rating on Home Depot, price target lifted from $231 to $244.BofA Securities analyst Elizabeth Suzuki maintained at Neutral, price target lifted from $238 to $250.Raymond James analyst Matthew McClintock maintained at Outperform, price target lifted from $245 to $250.Piper Sandler's Key Takeaways On Home Depot Home Depot reported a ""strong"" first-quarter report, highlighted by a comp growth beat of 6.4%, while comps accelerated to double-digits in May, Keith said in a note.The company saw some incremental expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it also showed strong underlying expense leverage, the analyst said. Looking forward, Home Depot doesn't expect to report negative comps in any quarter in 2020 as it benefits from consumers spending less money on restaurants, travel and entertainment, he said. Piper Sandler's revised $244 price target is based on expectations for the company to establish itself as a beneficiary of increasing spending on home categories, even if the U.S. remains in a recession for the rest of the year, Keith said.A Neutral stance remains in place for valuation reasons, according to Piper Sandler. BofA Says Home Depot's Strong Comps Won't Last Home Depot's comp growth of 6.4% in the first quarter exceeded expectations of 5% as average ticket rose 11%, Suzuki said in a note. The company likely benefited from consumers ""being stuck at home"" and spending money on home improvement projects, the analyst said. Some of the purchases were likely pulled forward as more consumers return to work in the second and third quarters and any stimulus benefits will ""wear off,"" she said.The expectations for momentum seen in the first quarter are not likely to last moving forward, according to BofA. Raymond James: Doing More In A 'Tough Environment'Home Depot deserves credit for shifting a business of its size to serve customer needs, such as contactless curbside pickup, McClintock said in a note. The company is also heavily focusing on digital, and this will serve as a competitive advantage moving forward, the analyst said. The retailer did a good job at managing its expenses while simultaneously investing ""aggressively"" in its One Home Depot strategic initiatives and its workers, he said. ""Bigger picture, we believe HD is well positioned to outperform in what will likely be a tough environment over the next several quarters, and has a large share gain opportunity longer-term as independents fall by the wayside.""

There was ""a lot to like"" in the report, including an EPS beat, comp growth of 11.2% versus the Street's estimate of 4.1% and operating margin expansion of 206 basis points.2\. Lowe's has superior exposure to the do-it-yourself customer, who represents 75% to 80% of total sales versus Home Depot's 40% to 45%. By comparison, the Pro market was negatively impacted by social distancing requirements.3\. The online business saw an 80% year-over-year sales growth and it has plenty of room to continue expanding off its current low base.4\. Incremental COVID-related costs won't disrupt the long-term margin story after Lowe's already eliminated underperforming assets and made other strategic moves.5\. Demand for renovation products should remain a trend for the coming years.Lowe's Has Sustainable Momentum, KeyBanc Says Lowe's first-quarter momentum sustained into May, with a double-digit comp across all regions, Thomas said in a note.The retailer did choose to withdraw its outlook, although it kept a confident tone in its ability to improve gross margins and continue SG&A leverage, the analyst said. The company is considered to be ""one of the strongest retailers"" within KeyBanc's coverage given a compelling ""self-help story"" under CEO Marvin Ellison, he said. ""We believe shares are compelling given the fundamental growth opportunity for the Company, and expect shares to see multiple expansion if execution continues to improve.""

During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.For those who don't have the time to tune in live or listen to the podcast, Benzinga will highlight one stock that merits further discussion. This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation.Price action trends sometimes develop within a particular sector during earnings season. With the shellacking that Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) took after its first-quarter beat Tuesday, traders and investors were pondering how Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW) would react to its first-quarter report, making it the PreMarket Prep Stock of the Day.Lowe's Posts Larger EPS Beat Than WalmartBefore the open, Lowe's announced a first-quarter EPS beat of 46 cents compared to Wal Mart's 1-cent beat.On the other hand, Lowe's reported a sales beat of $1.62 billion, while Walmart beat estimates by $4.39 billion.Walmart, Lowe's Show Similar Pre-Market Price ActionJust as Walmart blasted to a new all-time high in pre-market trading Tuesday, Lowe's replicated that feat Wednesday, rallying to $126.97 and surpassing its all-time high of $126.73 from January.View more earnings on LOWLowe's drifted lower into the opening bell and lost more altitude than Walmart, which was only a few dollars off its pre-market high Tuesday.Lowe's was nearly $4 off its pre-maket high ahead of the open.Nothing But Sellers For Lowe's At The Open -- And Then SomeOn Tuesday, Walmart peaked within seconds after its opening price of $131.75 at $131.99 and then sold off all day to end the session at $124.95. The song remained the same for Lowe's, and with even less of a rally off the opening print. Following its opening print of $122.61, the issue went only 8 cents higher to $122.69 and resumed its move lower.A step-down seller took the issue through Tuesday's close ($116.87) to $116.44, and the issue is not far off that low, trading down 0.21% at $116.63 at the time of publication.Lowe's Moving ForwardFrom the price action on much heavier-than-average volume, it's apparent that some institutions are unloading their large positions in Lowe's in today's session.With the primary catalyst for a rally -- an earnings beat -- gone for now, the issue may struggle to revisit the lofty $127 area for quite some time.Photo by Coolcaesar via Wikimedia.

2020-05-20	2020-05-20 18:15:27	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	The Biggest Thing in Online Shopping? A Store.	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s no surprise to hear that retailers’ online sales are surging through the coronavirus pandemic. But would you guess that for some of the biggest winners, it’s their physical stores that gave those sales a boost? Even as consumers grapple with stay-at-home orders and their own fears of contagion, a surprisingly large number are willing to pick up their digital orders at a store. Target Corp. on Wednesday said sales through its curbside drive-up option — shoppers order online, pick up at a store — increased 1,000% in April compared to a year earlier. More than 2 million customers tested out the drive-up feature for the first time, the big-box retailer said, and the volume was so strong that there were more orders collected that way in the first quarter than in all of 2019. Sales through Lowes.com were up 80% in the three months ended May 1, and more than half of those online orders were picked up in a store, the home-improvement retailer said on Wednesday. Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc., which both reported results on Tuesday, observed the same trends. “It’s time we stop referring to our Supercenter pickup and delivery capability as online grocery because it’s becoming much more,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company’s earnings call. There are a couple of takeaways from this. First, it seems that for all the hand-wringing over the lasting impact to physical retail real estate from the pandemic, stores still have a role to play, when used appropriately. As skyrocketing demand snarled logistics networks and caused huge delays in deliveries, customers were willing to be flexible to get the items they needed. Practically speaking, there’s not a huge difference risk-wise between retrieving a box from your front porch and picking one up from the curb of a store. Having that option may have helped the likes of Target, Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe’s capture sales from customers who were stumped by sold-out notices at online-only retailers or who previously did most of their shopping at a physical location. Notably, Walmart cited customers aged 50 years and older as a demographic that saw significant growth. Meanwhile, Women’s Wear Daily has reported that Amazon.com Inc. is exploring a potential deal with bankrupt retailer J.C. Penney Co. It's not exactly clear what the Internet giant's intention would be, but one possibility is that it could be a bid to add more options for online-order distribution such as curbside pickup.The nature of square footage may have to evolve; Target talked about the need to add more parking spots and storage space. And this model isn’t going to work for all retailers; those that didn’t have an effective digital strategy beforehand may be caught irreversibly flat-footed. Lowe’s Cos. CEO Marvin Ellison sounded audibly relieved that his company had invested in improving its e-commerce capabilities when it did. “What we’re seeing is that the customers simply want to shop the way that they choose to, and in the past, we couldn’t accommodate that,” Ellison said on Lowe’s earnings call on Wednesday. “When we started to get requests from customers for curbside, we put that up and going in three days. This time last year, it would have been impossible to do that because we didn't have the infrastructure.” There's reason to believe customer buy-in for curbside or in-store pickup will hold: 40% of drive-up customers at Target have made a repeat purchase. This puts the margin pressure that retailers faced in the pandemic quarter in perspective. Profitability at Target and Walmart was squeezed by both the types of items customers were ordering — food and essentials are less lucrative than more discretionary items like clothing  — and by the shift toward digital. But having the customers pick up their own orders is much more profitable than delivering the products to their homes. Online ordering may account for more than 17% of retail sales in the U.S. this year, up from 13.9% in 2019, according to GlobalData. If retailers can continue to convert a meaningful portion of that demand into pickup versus delivery, it will provide an offset to the inherently higher supply-chain operating costs of a digital model. Target customers that use its drive-up option for the first time also tend to spend more at the company overall than they did previously, the company said. Asked what kind of permanent changes he envisions in the post-pandemic world, Target CEO Brian Cornell said his “highlight and takeaway is stores are vitally important and stores will continue to play a really important role to America as we go forward.&quot; Who would have thought that a virus outbreak that's relegated so much of our lives to our homes would put such a premium on brick-and-mortar? This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-05-17	2020-05-17 11:08:23	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Billionaire Ackman Takes New Bet On Blackstone, Trims Chipotle Stake	Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management Ltd. has bought a $25 million stake in private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc. (BX) in the first quarter.Pershing Square said it built a position of almost 549,000 shares of Blackstone, according to a SEC filing. In addition, the billionaire’s portfolio disclosed a new position in Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (PK), in which it bought 678,000 shares, valued at about $5.4 million, as of March 31.Shares in Blackstone this year slumped as much as 35% as of March 23. However, since then the stock has seen a nice recovery soaring 42% and trading at $51.07 as of Friday. In the first quarter of the year, Park Hotels shares have lost as much as 81%.The hedge fund manager has also taken some profits. During the first quarter, Pershing divested about 32% of the portfolio’s stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG). The value of the burrito chain’s shares has more than doubled in the past two months. Furthermore, Ackman bumped up investments in current holdings, including Starbucks (SBUX), Agilent Technologies Inc. (A), Lowes Companies (LOW) and Restaurant Brands International (QSR).Despite strong stock market volatility triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, Pershing’s portfolio this year returned 16.5% on its investments as of May 12.At the beginning of the year, billionaire investor Ackman moved to protect the firm’s stock portfolio against coronavirus-related panic selling in markets by buying credit default swaps. Pershing Square yielded a stellar $2.6 billion from hedging its stock portfolio through the credit protection. Most of the return was invested in buying more shares of the fund’s portfolio companies including, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT) and Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A).Ackman is this year also upbeat about investment into infrastructure projects helping the U.S. economy recover from the repercussions of the coronavirus outbreak. In March, Pershing invested $500 million in Howard Hughes Corp. (HHC), one of the largest real estate development companies in the US.Last week, both Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank and Christopher Harris at Wells Fargo raised Blackstone’s price target to $47 and $63 respectively from $43 and $58 previously. Bedell has a Hold rating on the stock while Harris views it as a Buy.Overall, TipRanks data shows that Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about the shares with 8 Buys and 4 Holds adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus. The $54.10 average price target implies 5.9% upside potential over the coming year.

2020-05-16	2020-05-16 14:54:41	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	J.C. Penney Bankruptcy May Not Buy Enough Time	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When research firm GlobalData surveyed Americans on which stores they were most looking forward to visiting once the Covid-19 pandemic subsided, one household name came out near the bottom, and well below its department-store peers: J.C. Penney. That helps to explain Friday’s late news that the retailer — which began life in 1902 as a store called The Golden Rule — filed for bankruptcy protection. Pushed to the brink by the coronavirus shutdowns, J.C. Penney Co. was seemingly left with no other choice. But years of struggle and strategic missteps had laid the groundwork.After securing $900 million of financing, J.C. Penney will stay open for now, and its next steps include closing some stores, cutting its debt by several billion dollars and looking at alternatives including a sale. Despite those planned survival efforts, it’s hard to see J.C. Penney having a vibrant future.Even before the coronavirus crisis, the retailer, with just under 850 stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, had battled to be relevant to shoppers. Changing consumer tastes and incursions from online sellers wreaked havoc on its sales. And so now, unlike in the case of luxury department-store chain Neiman Marcus Group Inc., which also filed for bankruptcy this month, there may be little for a potential acquirer to pick up.The downfall of J.C. Penney — a chain that grew out of a single store opened 118 years ago in Kemmerer, Wyoming by James Cash Penney — is part and parcel with the long, slow decline of the department store. The concept had its heyday from the end of the Second World War through to the 1980s. Often starting life downtown as Americans moved to the suburbs, these venerable names followed, opening in newly built malls. They focused largely on clothing and the items needed to furnish the homes that Americans were buying. Amid the age of mass car ownership, they were more than happy to drive to these retail attractions.For many years, J.C. Penney was known as a family department store. If not somewhere Americans aspired to shop, it offered good value, and solid styles. In fact, it was a bit like Britain’s Marks & Spencer Group Plc, the sort of place you went for back-to-school gear and basics. But at least M&S sold food — because by the 1980s, the environment for department stores was already darkening. In 1988, Walmart opened its first super-center, adding groceries to its non-food selection to encourage more regular visits. At the same time Target Inc., another mass merchant that combined clothing, home furnishings and groceries, was quietly expanding across the U.S.The mid-market, which J.C. Penney had traditionally occupied, was under attack, not just from discounters, but later the internet, which was rapidly displacing department stores as the one-stop shop, and with cheaper, more transparent pricing.By 2011, in an effort to reinvent itself, J.C. Penney appointed Ron Johnson, an executive from Apple Inc. who built the tech giant’s much-admired retail network. Some of his ideas – a communal space in stores for yoga classes and coffee bars and food stands dotted throughout – were directionally right, even if they never got off the ground. Other concepts did come to fruition and were disastrous, such as ditching the coupons that had driven much of J.C. Penney’s traffic.When Johnson was ousted in 2013, the company apologized to customers in a television commercial: “We learned a very simple thing – to listen to you,” it said in the ad. “Come back to J.C. Penney.” Unfortunately, they never did to the same extent.While subsequent leaders Marvin Ellison, now chief executive of home-improvement chain Lowe’s Cos Inc., and current CEO Jill Soltau made progress, the company has yet to regain its stride. It has grappled with messy stores, and a lower proportion of online sales — around 20% — compared with 26% at Macy’s and 33% at Nordstrom.Most recently, Soltau had cut discounting and reduced the amount of stock the chain carries. She also ditched the electrical appliances that Ellison introduced and sought to strengthen Penney’s core clothing offering. But her efforts, however valiant, were no match for weeks of stores being closed. The group was also burdened with net debt of $4.5 billion, including store lease liabilities of just under 8 times Ebitda as of Feb. 1. Penney said late Friday that it owed creditors $8 billion.With the company less constricted by debt, it may be possible for Soltau to turbocharge her recovery plan, which already includes rejuvenating locations. A store in Hurst, Texas shows the way, with a much-improved layout as well as styling, cafes, a fitness center and a barber shop. Soltau insists it’s not a prototype, but with more investment freedom she may be able to inject elements into other stores. She also had already begun to pare back J.C. Penney’s store base. More locations will close, in phases. Stacey Widlitz of SW Retail Advisors estimates J.C. Penney’s footprint could shrink to just 150 stores. Even so, it’s hard to see how the retailer can stave off dwindling mall traffic if nervous shoppers stay home. Distinguishing itself from other mid-market rivals such as Macy’s Inc., which has its own plans for reinvention, will be another challenge.A financial restructuring isn’t a panacea. For retailers to make it through such a process and flourish, there must be a revival of the operating business, too. It’s far from clear whether J.C. Penney — or any new owner — can pull that off. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

Penney (NYSE:JCP) continues to fight for its life, but that doesn't mean investors have to get long on JCP stock.Source: Supannee_Hickman / Shutterstock.com The novel coronavirus has hampered the retail sector, as well as many other industries and sectors. However, retail in particular is feeling the pinch -- and perhaps that's because many in this group have already been under pressure.Neiman Marcus and J. Crew both filed for bankruptcy, and now, many assume J.C. Penney will too.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith that in mind, let's dive into JCP stock. The Rumors on JCPAccording to reports, J.C. Penney could file for bankruptcy as soon as this week. Moreover, the company is looking to secure $450 million in financing. One option under discussion includes the retailer drawing half of those funds immediately, with the rest of the $225 million coming down the road if JCP can hit certain milestones.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Have Nothing But Upside In Their Future Sounds nice, but is it really worth it?Shares caught a pop on the news, ending higher by 11% on Wednesday when the rest of the market was hit hard. That's after JCP hit a new 52-week low in the prior session. After closing at 22 cents on Wednesday, is it possible this stock doubles?It's a possibility. But with so many great retailers out there, is the one circling the drain the one you really want to bet on? Those who answer that question with a &quot;yes&quot; are gambling, in my opinion -- not investing. Breaking Down RetailBuying JCP stock because it might get lender financing or that it might survive another few months isn't investing. Unless that given investor specializes in bankruptcies and special situations, all of this hinges on what kind of deal Penney's can swing.Either way, what's the end goal? To bridge its operations until the country begins to reopen so that it can make it through the holidays? There's a reason shares have gone from a 2016 high of $12 to ending 2019 near $1. Remember, that's before the coronavirus pandemic.Sad as it is to say, the coronavirus simply accelerated the trends that were in play. While that's benefited companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the struggling retailers are going out of business. Sure, they likely would have anyway, but the process is being sped up.That said, not every retailer is hurting. Look at the stocks of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW). They are rebounding hard as consumers -- despite many being out of work temporarily -- are tackling household projects.Look at Target (NYSE:TGT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). These big-box retailers are thriving as consumers continue to buy essential (and some non-essential) supplies. They all saw initial spikes in sales as consumers bulked up their pantries and supply cabinets. But with so many stuck at home, sales should remain steady.It's easy to get carried away and look for out-sized growth from these companies. But simply not falling apart is a victory in my eyes, particularly for this sector. Of course, we can't forget about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) -- and the e-commerce giant has been as busy as ever. The Bottom Line on J.C. Penney  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comI don't know if J.C. Penney will file for bankruptcy this week or this month. What I do know is that the company and JCP stock has been on the ropes for years. Somehow the company does just enough to make it to the holidays, where a strong economy has kept them afloat for years.Obviously it's an unfortunate event for its employees and no one likes to see people lose their jobs. But from an investment perspective, this one has been under pressure for a long time; the writing has been on the wall.Let's put it this way:Sales have declined in each of the past four years, as has net income. While fiscal 2017 ended with break-even results net income, JCP lost $268 million last year. Current assets of $2.7 billion do edge out $1.9 billion in current liabilities. But with $2.1 billion of current assets (79%) coming from inventory, this current ratio is misleading. Every department store has bloated inventory and the reduces its value.The retailer has $4.6 billion in long-term debt. How is a company with a $71 million market cap supposed to survive under that kind of burden? The short answer is, it can't. It's just a matter of how long it can survive in the meantime.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

LOW Stock Is Worth Accumulating Even as More Corrections Loom	Just before the market correction driven by the coronavirus pandemic, Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) was trading at a high of $126.73. LOW stock subsequently plunged and briefly traded around $60.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com A strong relief rally has followed; driven by the $2 trillion stimulus package that has taken the stock higher. However, I believe that it's too early to assume a market bottom and further correction will be an opportunity to accumulate the stock. This column will discuss the factors that make Lowe's Companies worth considering.It's likely that the unemployment rate in the U.S. will increase to 13% by May 2020. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard predicts an unemployment rate of 30% by the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. Therefore, as the lockdown impacts businesses, the real impact will be felt in the coming quarters. This will keep the markets jittery.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, there are optimistic views as well. Michael Levitt, a Nobel laureate, is predicting a quicker coronavirus recovery. Michael Levitt has correctly predicted the end of the outbreak in China and this adds credibility to his views.  * 30 Stocks on a Deathwatch Another optimistic view comes from a research by Harvard Business Review. Research shows that, &quot;V-shapes monopolize the empirical landscape of prior shocks from an economic recovery perspective.&quot;The overall objective of this discussion is to underscore the following point: There is economic pain ahead and LOW stock can trend lower again. However, renewed growth is likely to be strong and there is no reason to panic. Instead, accumulating quality stocks should be the objective and Lowe's Companies is worth considering. Lowe's Companies Business ImpactLast week, Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison opined that &quot;As customers are sheltering in place, they're looking at that deferred list of home projects.&quot; Further, the company is still hiring for the spring season.This might indicate that there is limited initial impact of the coronavirus driven crisis on the company's revenue. This is a key positive and the management has not withdrawn or revised its earnings forecast.However, Marvin Ellison also pointed to the fact that the company is making special payments to full-time and part-time employees. Even if I assume that revenue is not impacted in an optimistic scenario, the company's margin is likely to be hit.Further, it remains to be seen if the demand from consumers remains at the same level in the coming quarters. If the unemployment rate indeed surges close to 30%, consumer spending will be impacted.It's worth noting that Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG) has guided for Q2 2020 revenue above consensus. The reason is demand for edible gardening, professional growing and pest control.Therefore, there are indications of resilient demand. This can translate into LOW stock outperforming the index. Valuation Perspective and Risk FactorFor FY2020, Low's Companies is expecting earnings per share of $6.45 at the low-end of the guidance range. Considering the current stock price of $86.98, LOW stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.5.The Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is trading at a P/E of 18.6 and Scotts Miracle-Gro is trading at a P/E of 19.6. Therefore, from a valuation perspective, the stock is not expensive. My only concern is renewed broad market correction, which can take the stock lower in the near-term. Gradual accumulation on correction is possibly the best strategy as uncertainty on the extent of slowdown sustains.stOne of the risk factors is that Lowe's Companies and Home Depot have 30% of products sourced from China. The impact of supply chain disruption will be evident in the coming months. Another risk factor is margin compression that I already discussed. It can impact the diluted EPS even if revenue guidance is on-track. My Concluding Views on LOW StockSome analysts are talking about the recent stimulus-driven More From InvestorPlace  * 25 Stocks You Should Sell Immediately   * 1 Under-the-Radar 5G Stock to Buy Now   * This Stock Picker's Latest Video Just Went Viral   * The 1 Stock All Retirees Must Own rally as a &quot;dead cat bounce.&quot; This can be potentially true and renewed broad market correction will give investors a chance to buy quality stocks at mouth-watering valuations.LOW stock is worth keeping in the investment radar with the company having a decent balance sheet and a robust free cash flow.Once the coronavirus driven economic crisis is over, the stock can deliver robust returns in addition to attractive dividends.Faisal Humayun is a senior research analyst with 12 years of industry experience in the field of credit research, equity research and financial modeling.

2020-03-25	2020-03-25 21:30:12	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Bill Ackman Puts Part of His Personal Fortune in Covid-19 Testing	(Bloomberg) -- Bill Ackman said he has invested a portion of his personal wealth to help manufacture antibody testing kits produced by Covaxx, a newly formed subsidiary of closely-held United Biomedical Inc., amid the outbreak of the coronavirus.Ackman has repeatedly called for a complete shutdown of the U.S. for 30-days to help combat the spread of the Covid-19 virus. He has also called for antibody testing, like the one Covaxx develops, across the country to determine who has been contracted the virus.“The key to a successful reopening beyond the maintenance of social distancing, hand washing, mask use and other related practices is a broad-based testing regime and tracing program,” Ackman said in a letter on Wednesday to investors in his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management.“This will enable the inevitable viral breakouts to be identified early and minimized with localized quarantines, reducing the impact on the overall U.S. economy and the need for future shutdowns,” he said.HedgesAckman made a roughly 100 times return on hedges he had put in place to protect Pershing Squares’ $6.6 billion portfolio against the impact of the virus, according to the letter.His firm paid roughly $27 million for the hedges, which were made in the form of purchases of credit protection on investment-grade and high-yield credit indices. The hedges generated $2.6 billion in proceeds by the time he exited them on March 23.He said he has since redeployed the capital by investing further in his portfolio companies, including Lowe’s Cos., Agilent Technologies Inc., Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., Restaurant Brands International Inc., and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. He also reinvested in Starbucks Corp.“The proceeds of the hedges have enabled us to become a substantially larger shareholder of a number of our portfolio companies, and to add some new investments, all at deeply discounted prices,” he said.Ackman said in an interview on CNBC on March 18 that “hell is coming” if drastic measures were not taken to combat the virus. A week later, he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV he had made a $2.5 billion “recovery bet” on a bounceback, after gaining confidence “that the president and his team are heading in the right direction.”Covaxx has already deployed over 100,000 Covid-19 tests in China, and is currently testing in San Miguel County, Colorado. The company believes it can scale the tests to hundreds of millions in “relative short order,” Ackman said. The billionaire made the investment through the Pershing Square Foundation, which manages his personal wealth. He did not disclose the size of the investment.Health officials in San Miguel County, home of the popular ski-town Telluride, teamed up with United Biomedical earlier this month to collect blood samples to test the kits and provide free screening to people in the area.The tests can determine whether a person has been infected by Covid-19 within hours, rather than the days it takes for the current, drive-thru nasal swab tests.Broader antibody based screen will give an accurate estimate of what percentage of the population is infected, Ackman said. That will allow more accurate data on the virus’s characteristics, such as how many people become critically ill and how many have only limited symptoms.“Imagine how differently and effectively we could have managed this crisis if we actually knew who was infected,” he said.United Biomedical has spent years producing vaccines for animals and working on human treatments for diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. It manufacturers its test kits on Long Island, New York.The company has been around for more than three decades. Its animal vaccines have been used to protect billions of farm animals from foot-and-mouth disease and to chemically castrate pigs. It also has developed blood-screening kits and a test for SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.“We believe it is inevitable that in order to halt the advance of the virus and preserve the ability of local, city, and state health-care systems to deal with the volume of critical care patients, nearly all states will eventually initiate strong-form, non-essential business closures and stay-at-home regulations,” Ackman said.(Updates with additional details in the final paragraph; An earlier version of this report corrected the return on Ackman’s hedges)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-ackman-puts-part-personal-130308027.html?.tsrc=rss

Coronavirus impact on supply chain will be bigger than expected: NRF	The National Retail Federation says the coronavirus outbreak will have &quot;a longer and larger impact on imports&quot; at major U.S. container ports than previously expected. Operations in China are slowly coming back online and merchandise is starting to flow out to recipients, but there is still a lot to be determined as the situation unfolds. &quot;[T]here are still issues affecting cargo movement, including the availability of truck drivers to move cargo to Chinese ports,&quot; said Jonathan Gold, NRF's vice president for supply chain and customs policy. &quot;Retailers are working with both their suppliers and transportation providers to find paths forward to minimize disruption.&quot; An NRF survey of its members found that 40% are seeing disruptions and 26% expect to see disruptions. NRF expects imports to jump 9.3% year-over-year in May as Chinese factories resume most of their production, with June up 9.6%. In the short term, Credit Suisse analysts say home improvement retailers like Home Depot Inc.  and Lowe's Cos.  are at the most short-term risk because of their China exposure and the seasonal categories like outdoor furniture that are in demand. Auto parts makers like AutoZone Inc.  and Advance Auto Parts Inc.  have less short-term risk, though late-spring shipments could see disruption. AutoZone, Advance Auto Parts, discounters like Dollar General Corp. , Walmart Inc.  and Target Corp.  are among the stocks that are up on a volatile Monday even as others sink. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF  is down 15% over the past year while the S&P 500 index  is up 3.1% for the period.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/2d7a938e-b34f-3608-a463-36549bf77cc7/coronavirus-impact-on-supply.html?.tsrc=rss

Lowe's says it will invest $1.7 billion  in its supply chain over the next five years	Lowe's Cos.  is currently undergoing a transformation that includes a $1.7 billion investment in its supply chain, according to Marvin Ellison, the home improvement retailer's chief executive. Speaking on the earnings call on Wednesday, Ellison said the investment will help with the changes being made to the e-commerce site. Growth in the online channel has been slowed in order to modernize the site, Ellison said. &quot;Getting digital right is critical if Lowe's is to generate higher growth, if only because increasing numbers of consumers start their journey by researching online and many more are now ordering online too,&quot; said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail. Lowe's reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations but guidance fell short. Among the factors, Ellison blamed marketing missteps during the shortened shopping season, including a failure to &quot;fully capitalize on demand for appliances among other key categories,&quot; according to a FactSet transcript. Appliances were an area of strength for Lowe's biggest competitor, Home Depot Inc. . &quot;We prefer Home Depot for its high level of consistency and strong execution,&quot; said Raymond James in a note.

2020-02-25	2020-02-25 15:34:15	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Home Depot Delivers But Can't Get Comfortable	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Who would have thought power tools and patio sets would be big holiday-season winners?After big-box retailers such as Walmart Inc.  and even superstar Target Corp. came up short during the 2019 holiday shopping sprint, Home Depot Inc. rebounded with a better-than-expected fourth quarter. Same-store sales rose 5.2%, ahead of consensus expectations of a 4.7% gain.The gains indicate the home-improvement chain is back on track after a third-quarter stumble. Then, same store sales were below estimates, and growth was slow enough to prompt the company to cut its full-year guidance on this measure. A strong housing market helped in the latest quarter. Consumers are more likely to renovate when prices are rising; moving to a new home also is a catalyst for spending. Meanwhile, warm weather prompted some projects to be brought forward, although this was offset by fewer winter storms, which typically drive repairs. Lumber deflation also eased. The upbeat results are also a sign that an $11 billion effort it announced in 2017 to modernize the company’s stores, upgrade digital options and enhance offerings for its key trade customers is starting to bear fruit.Home Depot is right to invest. Do-it-yourself stores can be soulless sheds if not updated regularly and managed properly. What’s more, the focus on the trade market is sensible. Many consumers, particularly young people, are shunning DIY in favor of  “do-it-for-me” – hiring a tradesman to carry out a job. But the group needs to ensure the benefits of its spending continue to filter through to its results.And there are risks. The first is from the deadly coronavirus. About 70% of the company’s products are sourced from the U.S.; the rest come from elsewhere, much from China, where supply chains are being affected by the spread of the disease. A large amount of first-quarter merchandise is already in stores, and the company is working with suppliers to ensure a continued flow of stocks.The bigger danger, however, is that the epidemic has a broader effect on global economic growth and consumer confidence. Monday’s stock market plunge will do little to make Americans feel good about their wealth, something that is essential for purchasing expensive items such as new kitchen. Meanwhile, Lowe’s Cos. — which is working on its own renovation project under new chief executive Marvin Ellison —could become a more muscular rival.Investors seem to be shrugging off these concerns right now. The shares rose almost 2 percent on Tuesday morning, and now trade on a forward price earnings ratio of about 23 times, a premium to about 18 times for Lowe’s.Home Depot may have put its rough patch behind it. But at its current valuation, the risks can’t be swept entirely under a graphic print rug.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-02-21	2020-02-21 20:31:32	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week	The earnings calendar is full next week, as some companies that report on a calendar year basis still haven't released fourth quarter results. Retail reports, though, pick up after Walmart (NYSE:WMT) released earnings this week.Overall, the roster is broad and deep, with multiple companies reporting in seemingly every major sector. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) and VMWare (NYSE:VMW) will try and drive a rally in IT stocks. Meanwhile, Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) and Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) highlight performance on opposite ends of the burger market.There's also American Tower (NYSE:AMT) and Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) in cellular infrastructure. Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ:MYL) and Mallinckrodt (NYSE:MNK) will try and maintain cautious optimism toward generic drugmakers. Media companies Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA) and AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX) have a tougher path after ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC,NASDAQ:VIACA) disappointed on Thursday.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, there are even bigger earnings reports out there this week. Not all necessarily can move the market on their own. Taken as a whole, though, they might well signal where this choppy market is heading.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy Increasing Their Dividends in 2020 With that, let's take a look at the top seven earnings reports were watching for next week. Earnings Reports to Watch: Palo Alto Networks (PANW)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Monday, Feb. 24, after market closeWe've been here before with Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW). Shares have tested current levels around $250 multiple times going back to fiscal second-quarter earnings almost a year ago.In fact, PANW stock was at basically the same price before November's Q1 release. Shares, however, promptly dropped 12% on the back of disappointing guidance.There's certainly a path to a breakout for PANW if earnings impress, as shares do trade at about 40x next year's earnings estimates. But in this market, and with the long-term opportunity for cybersecurity, that multiple no doubt can expand. Investors simply haven't quite found a way to fully trust Palo Alto.However, a big report could change that.This is an important report for the cybersecurity sector as well. After struggling with its own resistance, the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (NYSEARCA:HACK) has broken out to new highs. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) reportedly is considering an acquisition of FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), and other smaller players could be in play too.If the sector's leader can raise expectations, the news for the space will get even better. Home Depot (HD)Source: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Feb. 25, before market openWhat's interesting about fiscal fourth-quarter earnings from Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is that the news isn't likely to be good -- and investors already know that. Home Depot has cut guidance for fiscal year 2019 -- which ended last month -- twice, including after November's third-quarter report. It also delivered a surprisingly soft outlook for FY2020 in December.The market doesn't seem terribly worried, as HD stock trades at an all-time high heading into Tuesday morning's release. Shares have also gained 12% already in 2020.However, that combination seems to raise some risk for Home Depot stock next week. There's likely little room for error, as Home Depot can't miss guidance that's already disappointed. And it's hard to see how investors get more bullish. The rally in HD already prices in a return to long-term growth, so a short-term beat shouldn't necessarily get rewarded.  * 3 Wild Stocks To Wrangle In This Bullish Market Of course, in this market, it might be. So if it is, the sector and maybe even U.S. stocks more broadly might have more room to run. Salesforce.com (CRM)Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Feb. 25, after market closeI've long argued that Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is an excellent barometer for market sentiment. There's little doubt about the quality of Salesforce.com as a company. However, the argument over Salesforce.com as a stock thus largely comes down to price.The reaction to Tuesday afternoon's report looks particularly interesting in that context. Salesforce earnings almost certainly will top Street estimates, as the company hasn't missed on either line in four years. And CRM stock has broken out of late, gaining almost 20% since mid-December.After those gains, the stock isn't cheap at around 61x forward earnings.Of course, it shouldn't be cheap. But the interesting question the market will answer next week is just how expensive the stock should get. Lowe's (LOW)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Feb. 26, before market openThe fourth quarter earnings release from Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) might not have the broad effect of other reports next week. But it's certainly a key report for the company itself.Lowe's is trying to catch up with Home Depot, and is showing some progress on that front. And with Home Depot's results softer than investors hoped, Lowe's has a chance to change the narrative.A big quarter wouldn't just show that Lowe's is posting strong growth. It would suggest the gap between the two companies is narrowing. With LOW trading at 19x forward earnings and HD over 23x, the valuation gap narrows in that scenario as well.  * 5 Tech Stocks Vying to Win the AR/VR Race Lowe's stock has underperformed Home Depot stock for years now. So if that's going to change, Wednesday morning's report would be a good place to start. Square (SQ)Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Feb. 26, after market closeSquare (NYSE:SQ) is one of several stocks that will test sentiment toward growth stocks in tech. Box (NYSE:BOX) also reports Wednesday afternoon, while The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) follow the next day.Overall, it's Square's report that is the most interesting. After underperforming in 2019, SQ stock has soared in 2020, gaining 33%. Shares have moved to a 52-week high, and have their sights set on October 2018 highs right at $100.So, here, too, investor reaction should be watched closely. Payment stocks on the whole have been strong performing, and a solid report and/or a positive reaction would imply more strength ahead for the sector. But for Square stock itself, investors should focus not necessarily on fourth quarter numbers -- but guidance for Q1.Last year, Sqaure established an odd pattern of beating estimates with its results and missing with its guidance. With SQ stock up 33% YTD, a return to that pattern likely leads to a big post-earnings decline. And that decline would bring names like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) along with it. Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD)Source: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Feb. 27, before market openThere isn't a major company with earnings next week that more desperately needs a win than Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD). Investors gave BUD a second chance last year, bidding the stock up to $100 after a late 2018 dividend cut. But performance hasn't been good enough since, and BUD is threatening to return to multi-year lows.Collectively, Anheuser-Busch simply needs to show some sort of growth in Q4. The balance sheet remains overleveraged after the acquisition of SABMiller, and craft beer growth pressures brands like Budweiser. Hard seltzer represents another competitive threat, but it's privately held Mark Anthony Brands and Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) dominating that market at the moment.  * Why 5G Health Concerns Are 'Fake News' The concerns facing Anheuser-Busch are real, and the selloff into earnings makes some sense. If the company can't find a way to show it can at least survive in this environment, the fade in BUD stock will continue. Baidu (BIDU)Source: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Feb. 27, after market closeThursday's earnings for Chinese search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) would have been important in a normal environment. BIDU stock fell off a cliff in 2018, and touched a four-year low in August of last year as growth turned negative.However, shares have recovered amid hopes for a turnaround. Baidu has released preliminary numbers for the fourth quarter which show a return to revenue growth and a huge spike in earnings. There's some reason for optimism toward a stock that still is down half from early 2018 levels, and thus still has room to continue a 36% rally from those August lows.Of course, the coronavirus from China hovers over the report. And so as with some other big reports next week, it's guidance and investor reaction that will matter more than the numbers themselves.Investors have remained patient with Chinese and U.S. stocks despite the spread of the new virus. After-close reports on Thursday from both Baidu and streaming video play iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) will test that patience.After spending time at a retail brokerage, Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

It’s Time to Plug into PLUG Stock	For alternative energy outfit Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), 2020 looks increasingly like a plug-and-play situation for its investors. But to avoid the larger risks with this type of investment, buying PLUG stock today goes beyond the price chart and simply seeing things optimistically.Source: Shutterstock No doubt 2019 was a good one for Plug investors. At the nadir of late 2018's near-crippling market correction, shares traded as low as 99 cents. But bears trying to squeeze out that last bit of coin in share price have been punished.The hydrogen fueling specialist continues to make strong strides in its plans of reaching $1 billion in sales over the next couple years. And shares have reacted strongly, rocketing higher the last 14 months by nearly 350% to $4.40. It's not just wishful thinking on the part of management or investors, either.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPlug has defied skeptics by landing major deals with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) over the last couple of years. The company's hydrogen fuel cell or HFC technology enables those retail giant's forklifts to more efficiently power their commercial operations. And the buck, or should I say, the $60 million Walmart plans on sending Plug's way this year or Amazon's $70 million agreement, doesn't stop there.  * 7 Exciting Stocks to Buy for Aggressive Investors The most recent news is Plug has landed another major customer within this growing market as companies continue to look for innovative, less-costly and greener options to being competitive. The whisper is the $50 million deal could be with home improvement chain Home Depot (NYSE:HD). If that's confirmed, could Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) be far behind?Bottom-line, the chase for retailers to remain competitive with the likes of Amazon and Walmart appears to be on its way. What's more, there's also plenty of fuel in the tank for a profitable ride on the price chart. PLUG Stock Monthly Chart  Source: Charts by TradingViewIt has been a nice ride to be certain for Plug investors that looked the other way when conditions appeared to be at their worst in December 2018. Technically, though, the stock has only just begun to turn the corner on the price chart. And PLUG stock looks ready to buy today for continued big-time profits.As the monthly chart illustrates, the rally in Plug from sub $1 has just cleared a key area of price resistance. It's bullish, but there's more. Shares are now in an uptrend supported by higher highs and higher lows. Nice, right? Further, with nearly three months of testing this critically important zone before convincingly using it as technical support in February, this still small $1.3 billion stock is well-situated for a larger momentum cycle to take hold. Still, there are risks to consider.Despite the positives supporting PLUG stock, shares are still more of a risk-asset than the large capitalization customers it's serving. Also, our observation of shares being ripe for momentum can be a double-edged sword. I'd also be remiss if I didn't note the price chart already maintains some of those risks tied to Plug's stochastics and Bollinger Bands.I view Plug's prospects favorably. But as a name which also has its share of obvious and potentially larger risks, I'd suggest a collar or married put to go along with a stock purchase. Unlike simply holding shares as a standalone investment, these are two guaranteed spread strategies which can capture big-time profits while avoiding the always real possibility of a lights out situation off and on the price chart.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management own positions in Plug Power (PLUG) and its derivatives, but no other securities mentioned in this article.

2020-01-31	2020-01-31 12:00:16	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Sold-Out Coronavirus N95 Face Masks Offer a Lesson in Price Gouging	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Now that the government has confirmed the first human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in the U.S., a lot of people will be rushing out to purchase masks. That would be, specifically, the N95 air filtration mask, the one recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for blocking most airborne viruses.Oops. Too late.CVS is sold out. So are Lowe’s and Staples and everywhere else I’ve checked — even Amazon. No matter how health authorities try to assure the public that a pandemic is unlikely, the creeping panic continues to creep a little faster each week. And no matter how many experts query whether the N95 mask would even stop transmission of the virus, supply still can’t keep up with demand.What to do?Let’s begin with a thought experiment: Suppose that an entrepreneur — we’ll call him Carter — turns out to have stockpiled several thousand N95 masks a few years ago. Now, noticing the shortage, Carter opens up his storehouse and announces that he will sell N95s, in lots of 20 (as they’re commonly purchased), to the highest bidder. He even sets up a website where people can bid. Every ten minutes, until the supply is gone, the highest bidder wins 20 masks. Bids quickly run into the thousands of dollars for a package that, before the panic, could often be had for less than twenty bucks.What happens next is of course predictable.The outraged news media declares a scandal, the outraged Twitterverse tries to cancel poor Carter, and the outraged politicians stumble all over each other on their way to the nearest camera to charge him with price-gouging. Carter is hauled before the country as an example of how not to behave in a crisis. Greed run rampant. An immoral effort to profit from people’s fear.You can write the script.Carter caves. Humiliated, and worried about his business prospects, he donates his entire store of N95 masks to public health authorities, who in turn will give them out if deemed necessary (that is, if deemed necessary in their view) according to some rationing formula that will be shared with the public only if what the authorities deem to be an emergency should arise. (In China, masks are already being rationed by the government.)But this is a dreadful result.Here’s the simplest reason: Smarter, who happens to possess an even bigger cache of N95 masks than Carter did, will observe how he was treated and decide to keep hers under lock and key. After all, she might need them in an emergency. As a result of the insistence that Carter not sell his property at the price the market is willing to pay, the supply of N95 masks to the public is smaller than if nobody had intervened.College students learn in Economics 101 that a demand curve slopes downward to the right. As demand falls, price falls. As demand rises, price rises. If instead you don’t allow the price to rise — because of your concern about “price gouging” — the quantity offered for sale will fall.This isn’t complicated, and it’s true in every disaster. I’m willing to pay a lot more for a generator when I know the power is going to be out for a week than I am when the lights are on. If the price is unregulated, the difference in what I would pay in those two situations will bring more generators to market. And depending on the cost to enter the market, the rising price will lead more sellers to bring generators to the disaster site, leading to a larger supply, and eventually a lower price.What I’ve just offered is the argument offered by most economists and most libertarians (and, certainly, by all libertarian economists) about why bans on so-called price-gouging are a bad idea.To be sure, there are counter-arguments. At their heart lies the notion that if a demand spike is caused by an unanticipated emergency, allowing sellers to significantly raise prices in response will undercut the morally imperative distributional principle of equal access to necessities. If ten people with the same fatal illness need the two available doses of a life-saving drug, the argument runs, it’s immoral to award the drug to the highest bidders.This intuitively appealing distributional argument helps explain why anti-price-gouging statutes are both widely supported and strictly enforced.  But as with every regulatory regime, it’s important that we consider the cost. Suppose that our concern about equity in distributing the life-saving drug leads us to forbid the producer to raise prices. In that case, unless the government forces production at gunpoint, we’re going to get less of the drug (or the generators or the masks): the very thing we say we want.  Certainly we can decide to make that tradeoff. But let’s not pretend there’s no tradeoff to be made.* * * * * * *Coda:  Whenever I make this argument, whether in the classroom or in print, I’m accused of celebrating the morality of profit over all else. I’m doing no such thing. I’m simply insisting that we not pretend that the solution to a shortage is to insist that producers keep prices low.To contact the author of this story: Stephen L.

2019-12-07	2019-12-07 07:57:32	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	A 10% Correction Might Not Be Enough to Get Investors Into Home Depot Stock	Home Depot (NYSE:HD) had third-quarter results that were lower than expected. As a result, Home Depot stock has lost 10% of its value in the two weeks since disappointing investors. Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe question most investors ought to be asking themselves at this point is whether the 10% correction is a one-off or the beginning of something bigger?It has been a while since I've written about Home Depot, so I'll lean on my friends at InvestorPlace as I consider my answer. * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Dominated Thanksgiving Shopping The last time I wrote about HD stock was Dec. 10, 2018. Although the home improvement retailer's business was performing nicely, the HD stock price was not, falling 15% in October and hitting $167 by late November. The HD stock price finished 2018 down 6% on the year. Here's what I said about HD at the time:If you own HD stock, I wouldn't sell it because HD's business is operating at a very efficient level. If you don't own HD stock, I'd consider taking a position at these prices with cash in reserve if prices drop into the $160s. Barring obvious signs of a recession, I expect HD to bounce back in 2019.Home Depot's year to date total return is almost 24%. And that includes its recent 10% correction. I'd say that's a bounce back. Now let's consider what lies ahead in 2020. A Recession BrewingI've been saying for some time that a recession was just around the corner. The economy, however, says otherwise. While not running on all cylinders, and nowhere near the 4-6% growth Trump boasted after signing the Tax Cut and Jobs Act into law back in December 2017, it still managed to grow by 2.1% in the third quarter and the housing market has recovered thanks to lower mortgage rates. In September, Bankrate.com reported that the odds of a recession by the November 2020 presidential election were 41%, according to a survey of economists. Since then, despite the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, Bloomberg Economics now put the odds of a 2020 recession at just 26%. Although the odds of a recession in 2020 appear to have lessened, it's not beyond the realm of possibility that one could still rear its ugly head. With interest rates much lower today than in 2007, the Federal Reserve has little firepower to fight a slowing economy. InvestorPlace contributor Jonathan Berr believes that Home Depot ought to be able to weather a possible recession just as it did in 2008. In Q3 2019, Home Depot had same-store sales growth of 3.6%, 120 basis points lower than Q3 2018. That's a two-year stack of 8.4%. In Q3 2008, Home Depot's same-store sales declined 8.3%, 210 basis points worse than in Q3 2007. That's a two-year stack of -14.5%. In hindsight, we know that Home Depot weathered the storm, but those are numbers no retailer ever wants to see. That's especially true for one as successful as Big Orange. However, from a shareholder's perspective, Home Depot stock did do relatively well in the last downturn, losing 22% of its value between the end of 2007 and the March 2009 bottom. By comparison, the S&P 500 lost 37% in 2008. There's something to be said for history. The Bottom Line on Home Depot StockMy colleague believes that Home Depot's current valuation of 21.7 times trailing earnings (19.7x forward earnings) makes it a compelling buy compared to Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW), its smaller competitor. He's probably correct as it relates to the two companies. However, before I recommend HD stock in 2020, I've got to see what happens in the fourth quarter. If it continues to experience slower same-store sales growth, I could see HD retreating below $200. Home Depot reports its fourth-quarter results in late February. I would wait until then before assuming the stock's latest correction is over and done with. If you own HD stock, I wouldn't sell. If you don't, I'd wait until after earnings. However, long-term, as Berr said, you'll do well owning Big Orange. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-27	2019-11-27 12:00:29	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	The True Black Friday Experience Just Isn’t Available Online	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Black Friday is almost here, and plenty of shoppers will opt for swiping and tapping on their phones instead of bumping and elbowing their way through the mall.But the changing nature of this American-invented shopping holiday should hardly be taken as a signal that physical stores don’t matter. While consumers say they plan to spend more online than in stores, the data suggests that is not actually what will happen. The National Retail Federation estimates that holiday retail sales this year will total between $727.9 billion and $730.7 billion, and of that haul, only about 23% — between $162.6 billion and $166.9 billion — will be composed of online and other non-store sales.(1)So there’s no reason old-school chains should resign themselves to eating Amazon.com Inc.’s dust during the most important shopping stretch of the year.For a substantial group of shoppers, getting deals and checking off gift lists is not the primary goal of Black Friday shopping expeditions. Throngs of people are poised to visit stores on Thursday night just for the sport of it.For these consumers, convenience is not the point. They are seeking something social and experiential, and that’s a huge opportunity for brick-and-mortar retailers. It’s a testament to the extent to which lively displays, well-stocked shelves and strong customer service can lure people into opening their wallets.Crucially, it is younger shoppers — the most coveted demographic group for retailers — who are most likely to say that they’ll be joined by family and friends for their in-store shopping over the long holiday weekend.That may come as a surprise given the perception that members of Generation Z, in particular, have their eyes on their phones all day long. But, in fact, it’s consistent with other data that suggests even these digital natives sincerely like going to stores. Gen Z consumers do most of their shopping in physical stores, just like their older counterparts. And they like them for the reasons you might expect, including the social aspect of it and the ability touch or try items on.In other words: There simply isn’t good evidence that Generation Z is soon going to deal some sort of fatal blow to brick-and-mortar store shopping.Stores also remain important because, at this point in retail’s digital transformation, they are an essential component of a well-run e-commerce strategy. Many customers are opting to pick up online orders in stores, providing an opportunity to sell them on additional items. Store workers and inventory are crucial to fulfilling many of the online orders that show up on doorsteps. At Target Corp., for example, physical stores fulfilled almost 75% of online orders in last year’s holiday quarter. That means a well-stocked and -considered merchandise assortment, and a carefully deployed labor force,  are critical to keeping both in-store and online shoppers happy.Besides, physical store shopping is rarely a totally analog process these days anyway. You might read online reviews of a coat, but buy it in-store only you’ve had the chance to try it on. Or a 4K TV might catch your eye during a stroll through a big-box store, but you might end up buying it online later after you’ve had the chance to make sure the size is right for your family room.Black Friday will no doubt be a booming day for e-commerce, with a projected $7.5 billion in online spending. But investments in extensive store renovations (such as those by Target) or a focus on new worker-scheduling systems (such as at Lowe’s Cos.) remain vital. Physical stores will be part of the defensive strategy against Amazon for the foreseeable future — and retailers are right to go to great lengths to make them enticing.(1) Non-store sales include options such as catalog sales and door-to-door selling.To contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Newman at mnewman43@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-11-27	2019-11-27 08:58:15	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Australian Bonds Rally as RBA Lays Out Roadmap for Rate Cuts, QE	(Bloomberg) -- The road map for quantitative easing laid out by Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe is spurring a rally in the nation’s bonds as investors seize on his comments to bet on deeper interest-rate cuts.The nation’s sovereign debt rallied from the start of trade following Lowe’s speech late on Tuesday, and then extended gains when Westpac Banking Corp.’s economist Bill Evans predicted the central bank would cut borrowing costs to the 0.25% lower bound rate flagged by RBA. Three-year yields slid the most in seven months.“The curve is steepening today as people trade the 0.25% view,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. “Longer-dated bonds will also start to anticipate those cuts at some point and that QE is still on the shopping list -- just not immediately.”Lowe’s landmark speech on Tuesday, while highlighting his reluctance for quantitative easing, laid out the conditions required for the unorthodox measures as well as what the RBA would buy. While some analysts dialed back expectations for QE, others saw the road map as a sign that policy is inevitably headed that way.The speech was a “clear signal to us that the RBA will be prepared to cut the cash rate” to 0.25% by June, Westpac’s Evans wrote in a research note. The central bank will embark on QE in the second half of next year, he said.Bond traders had previously hesitated to price interest-rates falling below 0.50%, which they had assumed was the floor.The three-year bond yield dropped as much as 10 basis points, the most since April, to 0.632%, while the 10-year fell six basis points to 1.018%.Lowe made clear that the hurdle to QE is very high and “not a smooth continuum from interest-rate reductions.” If it comes, it is likely to be in the form of government-bond buying, with no appetite for purchasing private-sector assets, he said.Corporate BondsLowe’s comments on private asset purchases are expected to knock some of the wind from corporate bonds and residential mortgage-backed securities, according to Antares Capital.“At the very least, this takes away the QE bid,” said Tano Pelosi, a portfolio manager who helps oversee A$28 billion ($19 billion) in assets at the firm in Sydney.The average yield of Australian corporate bonds has tumbled 135 basis points to 1.69% this year on speculation unconventional monetary policy would boost the sector’s performance.Still, investors have reason to question whether the RBA will limit itself to government bonds if it’s forced to plunge into unconventional policy.The debt-buying programs of the European Central Bank have mutated since the initial foray in 2010, expanding to include corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. Tweaks have also been made to maturities and minimum yield levels on purchased assets.“Any bond-buying program will still benefit the wider market,” AMP’s Oliver said. “Ultimately, there’ll be some sort of bid and ripples across markets if the RBA steps in as a buyer of government debt.”To contact the reporters on this story: Ruth Carson in Singapore at rliew6@bloomberg.net;Stephen Spratt in Hong Kong at sspratt3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tan Hwee Ann at hatan@bloomberg.net, Brett Miller, Nicholas ReynoldsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/australia-signals-rally-bond-traders-111450274.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-26	2019-11-26 14:20:43	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Goldman Sachs: 3 “Strong Buy” Stocks to Snap Up Now	A recent report by investment bank Goldman Sachs lays out the risks and opportunities in the near-term markets heading into 2020. The bank’s investment strategists said that, after three rate cuts this year, they no longer see bonds as the go-to for risk-averse investors. Instead, foreseeing modest growth, they believe stocks are the better way to go for now.“We expect moderately better economic and earnings growth, and therefore decent risky asset returns,” the Goldman report stated. Going into detail, the reported noted that market prices are already taking account of the US-China tariff disputes and the ongoing Brexit drama. They advise a cautious investment stance, and move toward high-quality assets.So, with that in the background, we’ve pulled three &quot;strong buy&quot; stocks from the TipRanks' Stock Screener. All three have recent recommendations from some of Goldman’s top stock analysts. But more than that, all three are trending upward and show distinct upside potential.Brinks Company (BCO)You’re probably familiar with Brinks; the private security company’s trucks are visible in over 100 countries around the world. Brinks is best known for its armed and armored guard and courier service, provided to governments, banks, jewelers, and retailers. The company provides ATM services, too, including machine installation, replenishment, and maintenance, and money processing services, such as counting, sorting, and storage. Brinks also offers payment processing and physical safes for retailers. Brinks has positioned itself as one-stop-shop for the commercial security industry.Security is an essential service for any business dealing with cash and valuables, and Brinks' quarterly results reflected the company’s success as a service provider. Revenues came in at $924 million, 8.5% higher than the year-ago quarter, while EPS beat the forecast by 3% and showed a quarterly print of $1.05. The strong quarter, the seventh in a row that Brinks beat the estimates, was reflected in the share price: Brinks is up an impressive 37% year-to-date.Brinks's strong performance and recent share gains prompted Goldman’s George Tong, a 5-star analyst, to initiate coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and a $108 price target. Tong wrote, “Brinks has a healthy mid-to-high single digit annual organic revenue growth outlook driven by improving service quality, expanding services and the penetration of new markets. We view Brink’s strategy to develop end-to-end cash supply chain managed services targeting retail clients as capable of driving accelerating revenue growth and upward estimate revisions…” Tong’s price target suggests a 17% upside for this stock. (To watch Tong's track record, click here)Overall, Brink’s shares maintain a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus, based on 4 recent Buy ratings. Shares are selling for $92.5, and the $105 price target indicates room for a 13% upside. (See Brinks stock analysis on TipRanks)Lowe’s Companies (LOW)The second-largest home improvement superstore in the US, Lowe’s has faced a mix of hard times and optimism lately. The stock has been highly volatile in the past year as the company has worked to execute a turnaround strategy and improve profits and earnings. Volatility aside, LOW shares are up 26% since January, just outperforming the S&P 500’s 24% gain.Part of Lowe’s success is the ground-up improvement strategy executed by CEO Marvin Ellison. Ellison took over in May of 2018 and took a hands-on approach to improving the retail basics: stocking, merchandising, and customer service. Ellison has also been ruthless in cost-cutting measures, shuttering underperforming stores and laying off several thousand workers. His efforts paid off, however, and in 1H19 Lowe’s outperformed its larger competitor, Home Depot. In a statement to all Lowe’s employees last month, Ellison affirmed the company’s commitment to “…tremendous change and growth to position us toward becoming the leading home improvement retailer.”Despite the hits to company morale, management’s efforts have paid off on the fiscal bottom line. Last year, Lowe’s recorded annual revenues of $68.6 billion, up 5.5%, while net profits, at $3.4 billion, were up 1.3%. In the most recent earnings report, Q3 2019, LOW’s EPS came in at $1.41, well above the $1.35 forecast. While quarterly revenues just missed projections for the quarter, the company did increase its full-year EPS guidance to an upper limit of $5.70.5-star analyst Kate McShane, weighing in from Goldman Sachs, said, “3Q results represented a positive step in rebuilding investor conﬁdence around LOW’s execution capabilities and transformation strategy. The company demonstrated another quarter of sequential gross margin improvement, raised full-year EPS, and remains conﬁdent that strategic initiatives can help drive a comp acceleration in 4Q.” She reiterated her Buy rating and set a price target of $135, indicating confidence in a 15% upside. (To watch McShane's track record, click here)All in all, Wall Street loves the retail giant's stock, considering most voices are betting on LOW. Based on 19 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 16 rate LOW a &quot;buy,&quot; while 3 say &quot;hold.&quot; The 12-month average price target stands at $136.81, marking a 17% upside from where the stock is currently trading. (See LOW stock analysis on TipRanks)Tradeweb Markets (TW)A public company only since this past April, Tradeweb has recently gotten a lot of love from Wall Street. Tradeweb is an online marketplace for over-the-counter financial products, including municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and certificates of deposit. The company functions as an interdealer broker, connecting commercial and investment banks and trading firms with buyers and sellers in the financial markets. Essentially, Tradeweb is an digital platform for online bond and derivative trading.Tradeweb raised over $1.1 billion in it’s April IPO, making it the second largest IPO in the US this year. In an impressive performance, TW shares closed at $35 in the first day of trading, and despite high volatility, have gained 27% since. In its Q3 report, Tradeweb showed net income of $48.6 million and a diluted EPS of 20 cents. Gross revenues hit a quarterly record of $201 million, up 21% from Q2. The most important number, however, is likely the ADV, or average daily volume, for the quarter. In Q3, Tradeweb set a new quarterly record for ADV, hitting $815 billion – an increase of 53% year-over-year.After the company’s strong gains in the third quarter, Goldman analyst Alexander Blostein upgraded his stance on this stock, raising it from &quot;neutral&quot; to &quot;buy.&quot; He wrote, “We see the stock’s solid organic revenue growth and expanding operating margins collectively driving ~15% EPS growth in 2020/2021 - a critical point of differentiation versus most other Exchanges, where top-line trends are decelerating, margin expansion is becoming increasingly harder to achieve (absent of a macro-driven spike in volatility), and valuations remain expensive. We think TW is likely to sustain its growth momentum driven by: (1) Continued market share gains, particularly in Interest Rate Derivatives and Credit. (2) Favorable revenue capture trends. (3) Significant runway to EBITDA margin expansion.” Blostein’s $53 price target implies room for an 17% upside to TW. (To watch Blostein's track record, click here)With a background like that, it’s no wonder that Tradeweb has attracted bullish reviews from the analysts. TW's analyst consensus rating is a Strong Buy, with 4 analysts giving it the thumbs up and only one analyst suggesting to stay sidelined. Shares sell for $45.27, and the average price target is $49.60; this indicates a potential upside of nearly 10%.

2019-11-20	2019-11-20 20:58:41	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	4 Top Stock Trades for Thursday: LOW, URBN, SPY and AMD	Fears that the phase-one trade deal may be pushed into 2020 spooked investors on Wednesday, as equity markets stumbled lower. Let's look at a few top stock trades. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Lowe's (LOW)Above is a weekly chart for Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), which ripped to new all-time highs on Wednesday after better-than-expected earnings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe stock has been putting in a very solid series of higher lows, shown via uptrend support (blue line). Each dip to the 100-week moving average has been bought.Nowhere near that area now, though, what should investors do? Over $115 and LOW looks good on the long side. This mark has been resistance over the past year, so above it now bodes well for longs. Below and a dip to the 50-week moving average is possible. No. 2: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)The run in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) could be coming to an end.  * 7 Killer Stocks No One Knows About To be clear, the broader market may be just fine in regards to the trade situation. But AMD has been downright explosive. After shares erupted through $34.50 resistance at the start of November, new all-time highs were made over $35.55.On a pullback, this area acted as support, which is a bullish development.Since then, shares have climbed north of $40. It wouldn't be surprising to see this trade unwind at some point. A dip down to the 20-day moving average -- which is all the way down at $36.62 right now! -- would be the first step. But ultimately, a check-back down to the $34.50 to $35.50 area would be most attractive for longs.  No. 3: Urban Outfitters (URBN)Urban Outfitters (NYSE:URBN) has been climbing very steadily from its August lows, rallying from sub-$20 to more than $31 ahead of earnings. For those keeping track, that's more than a 50% gain in just a few months.To see this trade backpedal a bit comes as little surprise.Gapping below all of its major moving averages isn't good, though, and now support needs to come into play in order for bulls to have a chance. The $24 mark was resistance from June through August. On a pullback, this area acted as support in September. It helps that the 78.6% retracement for the one-year range is down at $23.89.On a rebound, see that URBN reclaims its 100-week moving average. Going above that level puts the 200-day on the table. Below $24 puts $22 on the table. No. 4: S&P 500 ETF (SPY)Earlier this week, we looked at the small-caps ETF, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM). While that one has had trouble advancing, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) sure hasn't.On Wednesday, we got the first sign of selling in a while, even though bulls bid the SPY up off the lows.Look, a pullback down to the 20-day is not only appropriate, but it's also healthy. Markets were technically overbought coming into Tuesday and a little shakeout keeps traders in check and could give longs a better opportunity.Many might agree with this, but few will like if it actually pans out. But it would be best to get a 3% to 4% correction in the SPY. Some kind of correction down into the $300-ish area could be a gift to the bulls, allowing one last buying opportunity into year-end. A decline into this area puts the SPY into its 50-day moving average and down into prior resistance near $300. The October Fed-day range is between ~$302 and $304.50. A return into this area that holds as support would be a bullish sign.Below $300 causes more uncertainty, while a 5% correction puts the SPY into uptrend support (blue line).There's no telling what kind of correction this may or may not end up being. But there are varying degrees of healthiness. A 5% dip will definitely cause some concern, but a fall into the $300 to $305 area could be very attractive, provided support holds where it should.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-11-20	2019-11-20 14:46:10	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Lowe’s Hits Record High Amid Raised Forecast, Canada Overhaul	(Bloomberg) -- Lowe’s Cos. raised its earnings outlook for the year and said it plans to reorganize in Canada, even as the home-improvement chain reported third-quarter sales that trailed analysts’ estimates. The shares rose to a record high on Wednesday.Excluding some items, profit per share will be between $5.63 to $5.70 for the fiscal year ending in January, the company said Wednesday. That’s above an earlier estimate of as much as $5.65. Same-store sales increased 2.2%, missing projections for 3.2% growth. The company also said it plans to shut 34 underperforming stores in Canada.Key InsightsThe forecast and store-closing plans show that Lowe’s is pushing hard to get back on track. Rival Home Depot Inc. disappointed investors earlier this week. Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison also told analysts on a conference call that the company is “still committed to Canada.”The company said the revamping of its web business will slow online growth in the short term.

2019-11-19	2019-11-19 16:50:07	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Don’t Read Too Much Into Home Depot’s Earnings	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Home Depot Inc.’s DIY renovation project has hit some snags. But its stumble isn’t necessarily a warning sign about either consumer spending or the housing market.The big-box giant reported Tuesday that comparable sales rose 3.6% from a year earlier in the third quarter. That’s not exactly a weak increase, but it was well below analysts’ expectations. The growth was slow enough that the retailer cut its full-year guidance on this measure, sending shares down more than 5% in morning trading.On a conference call with investors, Home Depot executives didn’t suggest the results reflected any softening in the larger economy. The housing market looked “healthy and stable,” they said, and noted that growth in big-ticket transactions, those over $1,000, was strong — a sign that shoppers are spending with confidence.That sunny portrait of the consumer is similar to what Walmart Inc. described last week when delivering robust third-quarter results. And it is consistent with other readings of consumer sentiment.Instead, Home Depot said it suffered because some elements of its long-term strategic plan are taking longer than expected to benefit the company’s results. In particular, executives said it was proving challenging to upgrade its technology systems to better support their website for home-improvement professionals. The company had already slashed its sales guidance once this year, but that was largely because of factors beyond its control, including tariffs on goods coming to the U.S. from China and lumber price deflation. Today’s guidance cut is noteworthy because it suggests that even Home Depot, a generally well-run chain that has essentially been untouched by the retail apocalypse, is finding the shift to a more digital-centric business to be a bumpy one.These results should hardly leave anyone in a state of alarm about Home Depot’s future. Many mature retailers can only dream of 3.6% comparable sales growth at a time when Amazon.com Inc. is encroaching on their turf. Home Depot saw comparable sales growth in all U.S. geographic divisions and across all product categories except lumber and electrical — indicators of balanced, diversified strength. In addition, Home Depot has been conservative about opening new stores for years now, a prudent decision many of its industry counterparts have not been smart enough to imitate.The downside surprise at Home Depot also puts sharper focus on the quarterly results of Lowe’s Cos., which are scheduled for release Wednesday morning. Under CEO Marvin Ellison, Lowe’s is looking to change the perception that is an also-ran to Home Depot. A strong showing in a quarter when Home Depot disappointed could help Ellison do that.Whatever happens with its chief rival tomorrow, however, Home Depot’s results are a reminder that digital transformations in retail are extremely hard to execute.To contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Newman at mnewman43@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-11-14	2019-11-14 19:53:31	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week	Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.The earnings calendar heats up again next week. Retail earnings reports take center stage, but next week's earnings also include other companies on the same fiscal calendar (with years ending on or around Jan. 31).For retail in particular, earnings reports look key. Increasingly, there's a &quot;now or never&quot; aspect to the more challenged categories in the industry like department stores and mall retailers. A macroeconomic expansion will reverse at some point. And the holiday season this year is six days shorter, adding a potential headwind.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor that group, it may be forward guidance rather than backward-looking numbers that drive trading. Positive outlooks despite the compressed shopping period would drive buying in a group that still looks like one of the cheapest in the market. Soft guidance, however, could be yet another negative catalyst for many stocks that trade at or near multi-year lows.Several larger retailers -- the ones that can move entire sectors on their own -- report fiscal third-quarter numbers next week as well. Meanwhile, a pair of growth stocks that have gone in different directions could give clues as to trading in a group that's been shaky despite broad market strength.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 This is a week that can shape trading for the rest of the year. With broad markets at all-time highs, next week's earnings could drive further strength or red flags. They could also support what looks like a long-awaited shift from growth to value. On both fronts, these are the seven key earnings reports to watch next week. Home Depot (HD)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 19, before market openIn terms of broad market impact, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) has the most important report on the earnings calendar this week. Home Depot's dominance in home improvement makes it a bellwether for construction spending by both consumers and professionals. That in turn means Home Depot earnings can move stocks in and around the housing industry.That impact will be amplified by recent trading in housing and construction stocks. HD stock itself is near an all-time high. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB), my pick for the Best ETF of 2019, has gained 50%, and sits barely off its own peak reached briefly in early 2018.On both fronts, there's some cause for caution. Both Home Depot stock and the sector, as measured by the exchange-traded fund, have flattened out in recent sessions. HD stock in particular seems to have a questionable valuation, as investors are treating it more as a defensive play than the cyclical stock it is. The earnings multiples assigned stocks in the rest of the industry have expanded significantly in the last eleven months.To support rising share prices, both Home Depot and the industry need a blowout report, or something close, on Tuesday morning. And given that Home Depot actually cut its guidance after its Q2 report in August, there's an obvious risk that Home Depot's Q3 can lead the group lower. TJX Companies (TJX)Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 19, before market openThere's really just one objective for TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) with its Q3 release on Tuesday morning. It's the same objective as it's been for TJX earnings reports for a couple of years now: no surprises.After all, off-price has been surprisingly immune to the challenges facing other brick-and-mortar retailers. Online penetration remains minimal. Same-store sales continue to rise at a steady clip. As a result, after sideways trading in 2016-2017, TJX stock has rallied nicely and returned to its place as one of the market's great long-term investments.  * 7 Under-the-Radar Retail Stocks to Buy Now At the moment, off-price is the one retail category that investors trust almost unconditionally. TJX needs to keep it that way. A similarly strong report from rival Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) on Thursday afternoon would help. Good numbers likely will lead to post-earnings upgrades by Wall Street -- TJX is nearing the average target, and ROST actually is above it -- and keep the rally going. Anything less, however, and the bulletproof nature of off-price may be questioned again. Lowe's (LOW)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Nov. 20, before market openLike Home Depot, Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) has an important third-quarter earnings release next week. Lowe's Q3 doesn't have quite the same potential to move the market given its smaller share relative to Home Depot. And its ongoing turnaround suggests that strength, or weakness, in Lowe's results may have more to do with operational changes within the company than broader trends affecting the industry.That said, it's precisely because of that turnaround that Q3 numbers are important. LOW stock tanked after first-quarter results undercut optimism toward the company's new strategy, and soared after second-quarter numbers resurrected bullish sentiment.From that sense, Q3 is a bit of a rubber match. Another strong result suggests the company is gaining traction. A weak report relative to Home Depot, however, confirms Lowe's second-place status. The LOW stock price is trying for the fourth time to clear $115 and hold its gains. That won't happen without good news on Wednesday morning. Target (TGT)Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Nov. 20, before market openLike Lowe's, Target (NYSE:TGT) reinvented itself to try and compete with the category leader, in its case Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Those efforts have been a roaring success so far: TGT stock has gained 64% this year thanks in large part to a 20.4% spike after a blowout second-quarter report in August.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 For Q3, Target simply needs to keep the momentum going. With the company's role in the new omni-channel world seemingly secure, and valuation reasonable at 16x forward earnings, there's room for upside if Target simply can avoid a stumble in the third quarter and give a reasonably positive outlook for the key holiday season. But after the big gains, and with investors clearly convinced Target is a legitimate rival to Walmart, anything less could lead to a significant selloff. Pinduoduo (PDD)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Nov. 20, before market openThird-quarter results from Chinese e-commerce play Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) likely will echo across the market next week. Pinduoduo provides increasingly stiff competition to JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), who reports tomorrow. A big quarter from Pinduoduo that follows any stumble from JD.com could knock JD shares from their current 52-week high.Trading in PDD stock after Wednesday's report might also highlight investor appetite for high-flying growth names. Even with a recent pullback, PDD has more than doubled since July. We've seen several similar high-quality growth stocks decline on little or no news, with Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) the two highest-profile examples. If investors are willing to pay 70x forward earnings for PDD even with China and trade war risks, that might be a sign that broader demand for growth stocks will return.And for PDD itself, this is a big report. Sales increased 228% in the first quarter and 159% in Q2. The Street is looking for growth of 124% in Q3. Obviously, there's not much room for error, particularly given the existing dominance of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com in the market. A big quarter from Pinduoduo establishes PDD stock as the country's preeminent growth play. Anything less, and the 100%-plus gains seen in the last four months can quickly, and sharply, reverse. Macy's (M)Source: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Nov. 21, before market openDepartment stores simply need some good news, and Macy's (NYSE:M) would be the best company to deliver it. It's still the best-known and most widely held stock in the group. And its struggles of late give it the most potential to improve both in terms of its operations and its stock price.After all, M stock in late August touched a nine-year low. The few bulls left often focus on the value of the company's real estate rather than its operations.It might seem like there is some hope for Macy's given a report from one of its peers. Dillard's (NYSE:DDS) gained 14% in early trading Thursday after its third-quarter earnings report beat estimates. But Dillard's same-store sales stayed flat, with profit improvement seemingly attributable more toward corporate belt-tightening than customer (and pricing) strength. The post-earnings spike may have come from a short squeeze rather than sustainable investor optimism.  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Give a Wide Berth For long-term gains, the category probably needs more than that from Macy's and from Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), who also reports next week. In this macro environment, department stores need to be able to drive some growth. If they can't do so now, investors rightly will wonder if they ever will. Splunk (SPLK)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Nov. 21, after market closeOf all the earnings reports next week, fiscal Q3 results from big-data play Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) might be the most important without seeming like it. As noted relative to PDD, growth stocks have somewhat oddly struggled despite rising broad markets. SPLK stock hasn't been immune: It's pulled back about 16% from late July highs.And as I wrote last month, this is a stock that looks like an interesting test of just what valuation investors are willing to pay. SPLK hardly looks cheap on an absolute basis at nine times revenue and 52x forward earnings. But those multiples are not out of line with those that growth stocks have received in recent years.In other words, with a strong report Splunk stock can rally -- if investors again are willing to pay up for growth. But if those same investors fade an earnings beat, that's another piece of evidence that investor preferences are shifting to value over growth. Right now, sentiment doesn't seem particularly bullish: SPLK traded down 5% on Thursday thanks to a downgrade from smaller firm Cleveland Research.A selloff in SPLK in regular trading Friday might not make headlines. But it could be important. It would bode poorly for growth names, who are increasingly likely victims of tax-loss selling over the last few weeks of 2019. In that sense, the Splunk earnings report isn't going to move markets, but it might provide a valuable clue as to where those markets are going to move for the rest of the year.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-11-14	2019-11-14 03:22:15	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Australian Unemployment Unexpectedly Climbs; Currency Drops	(Bloomberg) -- Explore what’s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast. Subscribe via Apple Podcast, Spotify or Pocket Cast.Australia’s unemployment rate increased and the economy shed jobs for the first time in 17 months, a surprise result adding to evidence that central bank interest-rate cuts are failing to gain much traction.The jobless rate advanced to 5.3% in October from 5.2%, data from the statistics bureau showed Thursday; economists had expected it to hold at 5.2%. Highlighting labor market slack, the under-utilization rate, which combines unemployment and under-employment, rose 0.3 point to 13.8%.The currency declined and money markets boosted bets on a rate cut in February as the jobless rate exceeded 5.2%, where the Reserve Bank had predicted it to remain through next year. Almost out of conventional policy ammunition to galvanize the economy, RBA Governor Philip Lowe may need to lean on a depreciating currency to bolster exporters and lift inflation.“Australia’s latest labor force figures make another rate cut a certainty,” said Callam Pickering, an economist at global jobs website Indeed Inc., who previously worked at the central bank. “To kick-start the economy we will need greater stimulus. Much more needs to be done, whether it be through further rate cuts, unconventional monetary policy or, in an ideal world, fiscal stimulus.”Unorthodox PoliciesTo date, the government has resisted Lowe’s calls for fiscal support, fueling speculation the central bank will have to turn to unorthodox policies next year. The governor is due to speak on the subject later this month.The data showed New South Wales, the most populous state, led unemployment higher, with its rate rising to 4.8% in October from 4.5% a month earlier. Victoria, the next biggest, edged up to 4.8% versus 4.7%. The northern state of Queensland led job losses, shedding 14,000 positions, with NSW losing 10,300.The RBA has cut rates three times since June seeking to boost hiring and investment, but so far the easing has shown little impact apart from the housing market. The decision to resume cutting aimed in part to prevent the Aussie dollar from rebounding in response to renewed easing by the Federal Reserve.The U.S. central bank has now signaled it’s on hold after cutting 75 basis points -- the same as the RBA -- and Lowe left rates unchanged last week.The Aussie dollar slipped to 68.01 U.S. cents at 1:48 p.m. in Sydney, from around 68.38 before the data. It has depreciated more than 16% since early last year.The central bank, in its quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy released Friday, forecast unemployment to hold around 5.2% through the end of 2020 and for wage growth to remain at 2.3% through 2021. This suggests an acceptance that its strategy of trying to push the jobless rate down to 4.5% -- estimated full employment -- to spark wage growth and return inflation to the 2%-3% target is unlikely to achieve its goals for a while yet.Data Wednesday showed annual wage growth of 2.2% in the three months through SeptemberWhat Bloomberg’s Economists Say:“The RBA’s November SMP forecasts have been tested twice in the first week after publication. Sluggish 3Q 2019 wage growth means a pickup will be needed to reach the RBA’s already downgraded wage forecasts. And momentum in jobs growth now looks to be softening at a faster pace than the RBA’s employment outlook has anticipated.”James McIntyre, economistStill, Australia’s labor market has remained remarkably resilient over the past 12 months. Hiring has held up even as the economy decelerated sharply, expanding at an annual 1.4% rate in the most recent reading, about half its estimated speed limit.Even then, the strong employment failed to translate into a lower jobless rate, as new positions were filled by new entrants to the labor market.The RBA is betting that a combination of rate cuts and government tax rebates will eventually encourage consumers to spend and keep the economy ticking. Rising house prices and the associated wealth effect are expected to help that cause.(Updates with further fall in currency in ninth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Tomoko Sato and Garfield Reynolds.To contact the reporter on this story: Michael Heath in Sydney at mheath1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nasreen Seria at nseria@bloomberg.net, Malcolm Scott, Michael S.

2019-11-13	2019-11-13 19:58:46	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	9 Super-Safe-Growth Stocks for Long-Lasting Dividends	[Editor's note: &quot;9 Super-Safe-Growth Stocks for Long-Lasting Dividends&quot; was previously published in October 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]When the stock market marches higher, it pushes the prices of many companies higher along with it. But as investors bid up good and bad businesses alike, that can make it hard to discern which companies are the best dividend stocks for long-term investors.In this income-centric world, income-starved investors face great temptation to reach for high-dividend stocks that offer juicy yields. Fortunately, Simply Safe Dividends identified the nine best dividend growth stocks that investors can rely on for secure, fast-growing income.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese companies all have very healthy Dividend Safety Scores, which measure a firm's most important financial metrics to gauge how likely it is to cut its dividend in the future.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 Let's take a look at nine of the safest dividend stocks in the market. These dividend-paying companies generate excellent free cash flow, maintain safe payout ratios, are committed to rewarding shareholders with healthy dividend increases and have bright long-term outlooks. Lowe's Companies (LOW)Dividend Yield: 2%  Year-to-Date Gain: 18.7%Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) is the world's second-largest home improvement retailer.With more than 65 years of operations, this dividend stock has gained recognition as one of the trusted national brands. Over the years, Lowe's has developed an extensive line of thousands of products for maintenance, repair, remodeling and decorating across lumber and building materials, tools and hardware, lawn and garden, paint, kitchens, outdoor power equipment and home fashion categories.The company serves a wide spectrum of &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; and &quot;do-it-for-me&quot; customers, including homeowners, renters and professional contractors from different construction trades.A large footprint of conveniently located stores across the U.S., an extensive range of products, a well-known brand and a diversified customer base are Lowe's key competitive advantages.The home improvement industry is also poised to grow as consumer confidence remains high, employment continues rising and home prices climb higher. This should lead to better growth prospects for the company and its dividend.Lowe's has an impeccable record of not only paying but also increasing its dividend since 1961, growing it by over 20% annually in the last five years. Lowe's price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.6 seems reasonable for a company of this quality. Honeywell International (HON)Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2%  YTD Gain:  38%Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) is a diversified global technology and manufacturing company supplying industrial products, software and services to a diversified set of customers.  Honeywell operates through four segments: aerospace; home and building technologies; performance materials and technologies and safety and productivity solutions.The company serves customers through a wide variety of products and services in aerospace, control, sensing and security. It also sells specialty chemicals and advanced materials as well as energy efficiency products.Simply put, Honeywell has invented key technologies that address some of the world's most critical challenges around energy, safety, security, productivity and urbanization. With a broad portfolio of physical products and software, the company has uniquely positioned itself to sell comprehensive solutions for homes and businesses across many industries.A broad portfolio of technology, extensive products and services, a global distribution network, and a presence in growing areas like the Internet of Things and energy efficiency are Honeywell's key strengths.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 A track record of strong financial performance and a healthy payout ratio have enabled the company to grow its dividend by 13% per year over the last five years. Honeywell has paid uninterrupted dividends for more than two decades. Apple (AAPL)Source: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.17%  YTD Gain: 67%Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the world's most valuable companies and one of the largest positions in Warren Buffett's dividend stock portfolio.Apple is the world's second-largest smartphone company, accounting for more than 10% of the global market share. The iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV are Apple's key products, with the iPhone representing over the majority of its 2018 sales. These products are globally recognized for their high quality, premium brand and ease-of-use, allowing Apple to enjoy substantial pricing power.In addition, the company also owns a portfolio of consumer and professional software such as iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems that act as key differentiators. Apple's products and solutions are known for their innovative design, user-friendly experience and seamless integration.All these innovative products have established Apple's supremacy in the mobile space, and the company invests around 5% of its revenues on R&D activities to stay ahead of competitors.Moreover, only Apple devices run iOS, which means that if customers want to remain within the Apple ecosystem, they must continue buying iOS devices. This results in sticky customer relationships. Its sales of games, music and other digital content through the iTunes store is another high-margin cash flow stream that keeps growing every year.A leading brand name, global geographical presence, impressive product portfolio and super-sticky customer relationships have helped form a huge moat around Apple's business.Apple started paying dividends again in 2012 and it has seen its payout grow by approximately 11% annually over the last three years.Given Apple's leading market share, loyal customers, innovative products and hoard of cash on the balance sheet, the company should continue raising its dividend at a strong pace in the future as well. Medtronic (MDT)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.00%  YTD Gain: 20%Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a leading medical technology, services and solutions company serving hospitals, physicians, clinicians and patients worldwide. It owns a portfolio of medical products, therapies and procedures for a wide range of medical disciplines.Medtronic's operating segments are classified into cardiac and vascular, minimally invasive therapies, restorative therapies and diabetes groups. The U.S. is Medtronic's largest market, followed by Western Europe, Japan and emerging markets.With nearly seven decades of existence, Medtronic has developed a strong reputation globally and claims to improve the lives of two people every second. Some of Medtronic's key innovations include the world's smallest pacemaker and artificial pancreas.As a leader in medical technology and solutions, Medtronic stands to benefit from growing healthcare needs as the global population ages. The business also benefits from meaningful barriers to entry created by various regulations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other government agencies.Thanks to its product innovation and conservative management, the company has increased its dividend for 40 years in a row and last raised its dividend by 8% in June.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 Given the company's technology leadership and unmatched breadth and scale, Medtronic should be able to continue its dividend growth streak at a high-single-digit rate going forward. Investors can learn more about Medtronic's competitive advantages and business profile here. Texas Instruments (TXN)Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3%  YTD Gain: 25%Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is one of the largest designers and sellers of semiconductors globally. It develops analog integrated circuits and embedded processors that are subsequently sold to electronics manufacturers.The company's product portfolio consists of tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices and managing and distributing power.Texas Instruments' focus on these segments provides a combination of stability and strong cash generation, owing to the products' long product life cycles and low capital-intensive manufacturing.Leading industry products, a diverse portfolio, unique technologies and manufacturing scale and a strong reputation enable Texas Instruments to generate stable and recurring cash flows.As a result, Texas Instruments has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1962 and it has recorded an impressive annual dividend growth rate of approximately 34.2% over the last three years.Last year marked the company's 14th consecutive year of dividend increases, wherein Texas Instruments raised its dividend by nearly 25%.Given its predictable cash flow generation, impressive dividend track record and reasonable payout ratio,, the company should be able to continue rewarding shareholders with double-digit dividend growth in the years ahead. Costco Wholesale (COST)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 0.9%  YTD Gain: 49%Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is a membership warehouse club with more than 500 U.S. store locations that provide merchandise at low prices to its members. Costco sells a wide range of products, including packaged foods, groceries, appliances, cleaning supplies, clothing and electronics.The company is the world's second-largest retailer by sales and it generates the majority of its sales in North America. Costco's membership base is growing with a renewal rate of over 90% as of its December 2018 quarter.Over its 35 years of existence, Costco has succeeded in providing a great customer experience by blending together the convenience of specialty departments and a selection of wide merchandise at affordable prices. It has become a trusted name owing to its low cost and quality merchandise.The company buys directly from many producers of national brand-name merchandise and sends products directly to its warehouses, eliminating multi-step distribution costs. High sales volumes, rapid inventory turnover, efficient distribution and self-service warehouse facilities also ensure high operational efficiency.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 A large and loyal customer base, economies of scale, a diverse mix of merchandise, and strategically-located warehouses are Costco's major competitive advantages.Analysts expect Costco's sales growth to sit in the mid-single-digits range over the long-term, which could result in 8%-9% annual earnings growth in the coming years. Costco could, therefore, continue its solid pace of dividend growth. American Tower (AMT)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.7%  YTD Gain: 33%American Tower (NYSE:AMT) is a leading owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The company was formed in 1995 as a unit of American Radio Systems and it was spun off in 1998 when that company merged with CBS Corporation.American Tower reports its results in five segments U.S. (59% of 2016 sales), Asia (14%), EMEA (9%) and Latin America (17%) property, and services (1%). It owns a portfolio of over 170,000 communications sites.American Tower leases space on its communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, government agencies and tenants in a number of industries. Its top tenants include well-known names like AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S).The real estate investment trust derives most of its revenue from tenant leases, which typically have an initial non-cancellable term of ten years with multiple renewal terms, as well as provisions for annual price increases. It is difficult for tenants to find suitable alternative sites and as such the lease renewal rates are generally high.Moreover, the incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively low and annual capital expenditures to maintain communications sites are also not high. All these factors provide high cash-flow visibility and excellent profitability for American Tower.American Tower should keep growing its earnings as demand for wireless services and data grows in the coming years. A global asset base, recession-proof demand for its sites, long-standing relationships with customers and low cash-flow volatility provide a moat around American Tower's business.Simply put, wireless tower companies possess many attractive qualities. That's probably why Crown Castle International (CCI), one of American Tower's peers, is a position in Bill Gates' dividend stock portfolio.Given American Tower's history of double-digit growth in property revenue and the near-tripling of its dividend in just the past five years, shareholders can likely expect at least 20% annual dividend growth in the years ahead.

Australia Cuts Rates to Record-Low 0.75% as Global Risks Mount	(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s central bank was dragged further into the global easing tide as it cut interest rates for the third time this year, even as it risks refueling excesses that Governor Philip Lowe warned against just weeks ago.The Reserve Bank reduced the cash rate by 25 basis points to a record-low 0.75% and said it may ease even further, venturing deeper into levels where unconventional measures may need to be adopted. The move is in part designed to prevent a rebound in the depreciating currency that might have been triggered if it stood pat while global counterparts eased.“The global race to the bottom is, in a sense, dragging the RBA along,” said Michael Blythe, chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. “Failure to participate could see the Australian dollar move higher.”Global risks from the U.S.-China conflict to Hong Kong riots have forced Lowe to tilt from a stubborn focus on financial stability that defined the start of his tenure three years ago. Only in August, he was warning global policy makers at the Jackson Hole symposium that easier monetary conditions will “push up asset prices, which brings its own set of risks.”Lowe’s fears were confirmed locally just hours before Tuesday’s decision, with data showing the RBA’s June and July cuts had reawakened Australia’s dormant housing market at a time households are already saddled with record debt levels. Prices rose the most since March 2017, led by hot spots Sydney and Melbourne.“The board took account of the forces leading to the trend to lower interest rates globally and the effects this trend is having on the Australian economy and inflation outcomes,” Lowe said in his statement Tuesday. It “will continue to monitor developments, including in the labor market, and is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed.”The Australian dollar declined, trading at 67.06 U.S. cents at 4:15 p.m. in Sydney, compared with 67.48 cents before the decision.What Bloomberg’s Economists Say“The RBA continued to signal willingness to ease policy further, if needed. That should continue to keep a rein on the Australian dollar, further nurturing a recovery.”&#92;--Tamara Mast Henderson, EconomistClick here for the whole reportTuesday’s cut is also designed to give maximum kick to a “gentle turning point” that Lowe says he sees in the economy following a year of weak growth. The governor is similarly trying to stem unemployment -- which climbed to 5.3% in August as a swelling labor force overwhelmed an increase in hiring -- and bolster consumer confidence in order to revive household spending.“Forward-looking indicators of labor demand indicate that employment growth is likely to slow from its recent fast rate,” Lowe said. “The economy still has spare capacity and lower interest rates will help make inroads into that.”Lowe wants to stoke the local economy hard to try to ensure its resilience. At 0.75%, the cash rate is close to the lower bound that he and Deputy Governor Guy Debelle estimate is around 0.25%-0.5%. Both have previously said they don’t expect to have to turn to bond buying and other alternative measures, as they wait and gauge the success of existing stimulus.“The Reserve Bank is likely to cut again early next year,” said Callam Pickering, economist at global jobs site Indeed. “Bank officials are reluctant to discuss quantitative easing but it becomes a real possibility the closer we come to a cash rate of 0%.”Lowe is scheduled to speak at the RBA board dinner later Tuesday, at 7.20 p.m. in Melbourne. There will be no Q&A session.(Updates with economist comments.)To contact the reporters on this story: Michael Heath in Sydney at mheath1@bloomberg.net;Chris Bourke in Sydney at cbourke4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nasreen Seria at nseria@bloomberg.net, Malcolm Scott, Chris BourkeFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/australia-cuts-rates-record-low-043644873.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-25	2019-09-25 00:55:22	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	RBA Chief Sees Australia Economy Picking Up, Fails to Signal Imminent Cut	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Reserve Bank chief Philip Lowe said Australia’s economy is at a “gentle turning point” and reiterated he’s prepared to cut interest rates if needed to support the recovery, while stopping short of flagging the imminent move markets and some economists were factoring in for next week.As a small, open economy, Lowe said he couldn’t overlook the global shift toward more monetary easing. &quot;If we did seek to ignore these shifts, our exchange rate would appreciate, which, in the current environment, would be unhelpful in terms of achieving both the inflation target and full employment,&quot; the RBA governor said in a speech Tuesday evening.The Australian dollar rose and bets on a reduction from the current 1% cash rate at the Oct. 1 meeting declined after the remarks failed to clearly signal a near-term move, as he had done in May ahead of a subsequent cut in June. Still, there was enough in his comments for both hawks and doves, setting up a line-ball decision.“At our board meeting next week, we will again take stock of the evidence,” Lowe said in the speech delivered in the regional New South Wales city of Armidale. “The board is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, make further progress towards full employment, and achieve the inflation target over time.”The RBA eased in June and July and Lowe reaffirmed Tuesday that an extended period of low rates was on the cards, as ongoing uncertainty abroad and weak household spending at home drag on the economy. The governor noted that over the past year there has been “no growth at all in consumption per person,” a result he described as unusual given hiring has remained strong.“We are now in the midst of an easing cycle and there is no need to provide explicit forward guidance ahead of any particular meeting. The RBA’s clear easing bias was reiterated” in Lowe’s speech, said Gareth Aird, senior economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. “The added emphasis that the RBA is placing on global economic developments supports our view that they will ease policy next week.”Traders are pricing in about a 70% chance of a cut at the October policy meeting, rising to 86% in November.‘Modest Pick-Up’In predicting an upturn in the economy, the RBA chief noted that GDP growth over the first half of this year was stronger than in the second half of 2018 and said the RBA is expecting “a further modest pick-up” in the quarters ahead.That’s based on his frequently mentioned combination of tailwinds: rate cuts and tax refunds, a weaker currency, and infrastructure and mining investment. Lowe estimates that the government’s cash rebate will boost aggregate household income by 0.6% this year, adding that past experience suggests that around half of the tax refunds will be spent.In addition, there hasn’t been “the same spike in the measure of policy uncertainty in Australia” seen in the world economy, he said. “There has, however, been some softening in measures of business conditions.”Reluctant CutterThe RBA’s back-to-back rate cuts have already begun to show up in a strengthening Sydney and Melbourne property market, but are likely to take longer to flow through the economy, perhaps explaining some reluctance to resume easing so soon.Still, Lowe highlighted that while Australia’s floating exchange rate gave it some policy flexibility, as a small, open economy it can’t remain impervious to what global central banks are doing. This month both the U.S. and Europe have eased in response to international volatility, from the U.S.-China confrontation to Brexit to Hong Kong to South Korea-Japan, that’s discouraging investment.Curiously, while the governor mentioned the economy’s “gentle turning point” three times in his address, reiterating a comment from August, he failed to call on the government to increase fiscal support for the first time in a while. That likely reflects a realization that with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg recommitting to a budget surplus in fiscal 2020 and maintaining the government is doing enough to support the economy, there’s little to be gained.“Regardless of the short-term outlook for monetary policy, the point about the solution to low global rates is relevant here in Australia too,” Lowe said. “We will all be better off if businesses have the confidence to expand, invest, innovate and hire people. Given Australia’s strong fundamentals, this is not out of our reach, but it does require constant effort.”(Updates with economist comment in 6th paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Michael Heath in Sydney at mheath1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nasreen Seria at nseria@bloomberg.net, Chris Bourke, Malcolm ScottFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rba-chief-sees-australia-economy-101553131.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-09-24	2019-09-24 14:36:46	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	3 Stocks with Strong Returns in Volatile Times	Are you ready for a roller coaster ride in the markets? Goldman Sachs is putting investors on notice that our current break from August’s high volatility is just a short breather – October is likely to be just as unpredictable. In fact, the firm points out that since 1928, October’s stock market volatility has averaged 25% higher. John Marshall, equity derivatives strategist for the firm, says, “We believe high October volatility is more than just a coincidence. We believe it is a critical period for many investors and companies that manage performance to calendar year-end.”The markets may be unpredictable, but you can still find stocks showing a solid record of strong returns. We’ve searched TipRanks’ database and found three stocks that are bringing in the long-term returns and dividends you need to insulate your portfolio in today’s uncertain climate. Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.Business mergers can sometimes bring the best together, Stanley Black & Decker (SWK – Get Report) is the modern incarnation of two storied names in power tools: Stanley, and Black & Decker. They merged in 2010 in a move that brought some of the most respected brands in the industry under one roof.The power tool company has had a good run in recent years. SWK’s 5-year gain is 77%, and the company is up 18% year-to-date. Shares have risen from $117 on the last day of 2018 to today’s opening price of $140. And as an added attraction for income investors, SWK pays out a 1.96% dividend, in line with the S&P’s average yield of 2.1%. The dividend pays out $2.76 per share annually.SWK’s gains, and its hefty upside potential, have attracted plenty of love from top analysts recently. Last week, KeyBanc’s Kenneth Zener upgraded his stand on this stock from neutral to buy, saying, “We see upside (tool share gains and wider portfolio outgrow market, favorable price/cost raise margins) … in line with market returns this year.” His price target of $160 suggests an upside of 13% for the stock.Michael Wood, writing from Nomura, takes an even more optimistic stance on SWK. He kept his buy rating, and raised his price target by 10%, to $180. His new target indicates his confidence in a 27% growth potential.Stanley Black & Decker keeps a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus. This is derived from 5 buys and 2 holds given the stock in the past three months. As noted, shares are selling for $140. The $168 average price target suggests a 19% upside potential in the coming year. Intuit, Inc.No one likes the tax man, and we like having to report and file taxes even less. But we do have to file, every year, and a whole industry of accountants and DIY software has grown up around the requirement. Intuit (INTU – Get Report) is the maker of TurboTax, the popular home-use tax filing software, which has become the industry standard.The success of TurboTax has pushed Intuit to ever-higher revenues. The company reported $1.99 billion in 2005, which rose to $3.40 billion in 2010, $4.19 billion in 2015, and $5.96 billion in 2018. Shares in INTU have gained also steadily gained; INTU is up an eye-catching 236% in the last five years, and has an impressive 36% year-to-date gain. For income investors, the share appreciation is the main attraction here, but the Intuit does pay out a reliable dividend. The yield is modest, at 0.79%, but the trading price high enough to put the payout at $2.12 per share annually.The analysts are impressed by Intuit’s performance. 5-star analyst Brad Zelnick, of Credit Suisse, recently boosted his price target by 13%, to $300, and said, “The company reported better than expected Q4 results. We remain constructive on QuickBooks and TurboTax Live opportunities.” His price target suggests an upside potential of 11%.Zelnick is not the only analyst raising the price target on INTU. Jefferies’ Brent Thill boosted his target 7%, to $320, indicating an 18% upside, and Argus’ Jim Kelleher, ranked 60 out of 5,500 analysts covered by TipRanks, increased his price target from $275 to $327. Kelleher’s new price target implies an upside of 20% to Intuit’s share price.The analyst consensus on INTU is a Moderate Buy, with 7 buys and 4 holds assigned in the past three months. Shares currently trade for $269, and the average price target of $296 indicates an upside potential of 10%. Lowe’s Companies, Inc.The second largest player in the home improvement superstore sector, Lowe’s (LOW – Get Report) is making a credible challenge to Home Depot’s (HD – Get Report) dominance in that space. Lowe’s is benefitting from a new CEO, Marvin Ellison, with a hands-on style and turnaround plan, and LOW shares are up 19% year-to-date. The gain is seen as a show of confidence in Ellison’s ability to streamline retail chain and improve profitability.Long-term gains for LOW are also strong – shares have appreciated 129% since the end of 2014&#92;. A robust 12% gain in the last three months shows that the stock continues to show steady momentum. The 1.99% dividend pays $2.20 per share, or 55 cents quarterly, giving investors a reliable passive income.Seth Basham, 4-star analyst with Wedbush, sees Ellison’s turnaround program as successful, and writes, “Lowe’s, he notes, has reversed its longstanding pattern of trailing Home Depot’s comparable sales in the past two quarters, thanks to better inventory, more target promotions, and company initiatives to improve productivity... increased labor efficiency could allow the company to keep operating expenses flat over the next three years, while still expanding margins.” Basham’s $135 price target on LOW indicates a potential for a 22% upside.Writing from RBC Capital, 5-star analyst Scot Ciccarelli agrees, writing, “Management continues to make the necessary improvements to generate sales activity in Lowe's Pro business, which is key to its turnaround efforts. Based on the stable home improvement environment and the company's margin expansion potential, we are positive on Lowe's shares.” Ciccarelli’s $129 price target suggests a 17% upside to the stock.LOW shares hold a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, with 13 analysts rating the stock a buy as compared to 4 holds. The average price target of $122 indicates a 10% upside potential from the $110 trading price.Visit TipRanks’ Analysts’ Top Stocks page, and see which stocks are getting noticed by the Street’s best analysts.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-strong-returns-volatile-143646799.html?.tsrc=rss

Like home improvement stores Home Depot (NYSE:HD) or Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) there's an advantage to having a big selection of supplies around when someone is ready to start a project.  * 7 Worst Stocks in the S&P 500 in 2019 Also, many folks that are on a budget get the tools and supplies they need as they need them, rather than buying them ahead of time. This kind of thinking is why same-store sales remain strong for AutoZone.It also helps to have staff present to help you make sure you're getting the right part. And when it comes to used batteries or other parts, AZO allows you to drop them off in exchange for store credit toward new parts. Going GlobalThe other piece of the equation, as I've explained in Growth Investor, is its operations outside the U.S. AZO has 576 stores in Mexico and 25 in Brazil.Both of those markets are great places for a U.S.-based firm in this sector to establish a presence. AZO knows how to do the market research, sort out supply chain challenges and manage inventory.Chains with such breadth and depth are especially valuable to customers in regions that aren't used to having such convenience available. And given the grinding recession that has been going on in Brazil, DIY work on cars is a very popular way to save some money.What's more, the fact that AZO is slowly entering Brazil shows that management is smart about targeting new markets. It can get an idea of how well the stores are doing and products are popular to better understand the customers. This in turn gives AutoZone increased confidence.It seems to have already found the model for the U.S. and Mexico. And remember AZO is not a franchise operation -- all the stores are directly owned by the company. AutoZone Stock ValuationAutoZone may all be all about vehicle components, but, unlike a car, AZO stock is worth more than the sum of its parts. AZO is up almost 38% year-to-date and 50% in the past year. While strong fundamentals are certainly contributing to that, another key factor is buying pressure from big, institutional cash on Wall Street.That's a major reason AZO stock gets an &quot;A&quot; from me (and there's a couple of other things you should be looking for in a stock at this juncture, too).With all these strengths, it's no surprise that my Portfolio Grader rates AZO as a &quot;Strong Buy.&quot; But what may be surprising is that after all the growth we've seen so far this year, AZO stock still has a trailing price-to-earnings ratio just a hair above 20.And there's a market phenomenon going on right now that works to drive these ratios even lower. How Washington Created the Biggest Investor Windfall in HistoryWith all this talk of trade wars and oil wars, let's not lose sight of what's driving the economy here in the United States. One major catalyst is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Not only will U.S. corporations save $600 billion -- even more money stashed overseas can finally return.That being said, only 13% of these tax savings will go to workers, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. So where will the rest of this massive pot of money go?I've got the full details on this trend -- and how to profit -- in this investor briefing. Long story short: Much of this money will go right back to investors, and particularly dividend investors. Yet new investors will be able to buy these stocks cheaply.From my own research, I can tell that the best way to get your slice of this pie is with a group I've started calling the Bulletproof Stocks.

2019-09-16	2019-09-16 17:17:25	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	This Is Why Home Depot Stock Bears Should Be Scared	There's always a bull market somewhere. And with Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent Home Depot (NYSE:HD), you don't have to look very far to appreciate that very fact. But is now a good time to buy Home Depot stock? Let's examine what's happening off and on the price chart to reach a stronger, risk-adjusted decision.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com It has been good year for the market, albeit a volatile one at times. The Dow Jones is up nearly 17% and less than 1% from recapturing late July's all-time-high. At the same time, Home Depot stock's gain of 36% has more than doubled the venerable blue-chip index while hitting fresh highs.Only the Dow's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and its return of nearly 39%, is larger than HD's rise through Friday's close. However, that top spot has come at a price. AAPL stock's gains have failed to match Home Depot's technical wherewithal with shares still 5.5% beneath its October all-time high.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo, what's behind the burly gains of America's largest home improvement retailer? No doubt 2019 has raised the specter of potential difficulties for Home Depot and peer Lowes (NYSE:LOW) given the ongoing U.S. China trade war and retail shelves lined with &quot;Made in China&quot; products.But so far, HD stock has managed to trump those fears.Removed from trade war concerns of what might be, a defensively positioned Home Depot has benefited from this summer's interest rate cut by the FOMC and ongoing demand for home improvement. And the good times, which showed up in August's earnings beat, aren't over either.  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy According to Citi analyst Gregory Badishkanian, HD stock enjoys &quot;still-solid underlying macro fundamentals and housing drivers,&quot; which should help with further sales and margin wins. For its part Citi reaffirmed its buy rating while lifting the price target on HD from $246 to $269 and a premium of 15% compared to Friday's closing price. Home Depot Stock Price Monthly Chart Technically speaking, Home Depot stock appears ready for a strong second-half of 2019 after dismantling a large bearish topping pattern.In August, HD produced an earnings-driven breakout from a 20-month long broadening base pattern. This type of formation is generally viewed as bearish once the fifth pivot receives price confirmation through the low of the monthly candlestick. Home Depot stock obliged bearish shorts as it traded beneath July's low of $212.39 and eventually down to $197.84 before quickly and unequivocally failing.A bullish earnings gap and follow-through in Home Depot stock took shares to new highs while also breaking out above angular pattern resistance. Now September's price action is confirming August's engulfing candlestick while being supported by a bullishly positioned stochastics indicator.With HD shares just a couple percent above the August high, it's time to embrace the bearish pattern failure as an important signal to go long shares. I'm inclined to see Citi's price target of $269 to perhaps as much as $275 in Home Depot stock as a reasonable forecast for shares.My recommendation is to simply buy Home Depot stock today and set an initial stop-loss below $219. Early Monday and with HD trading around $232.50, that works out to price exposure of 6%. That's attractive relative to the risk taken. And smartly, it pulls the plug on the position just in case the broadening pattern has a repeat and more bearish performance in store for Home Depot stock.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

Wedbush analysts led by Seth Basham also raised Lowe's price target to $135 from $115. &quot;Lowe's focus on boosting Pro sales through increased service levels, pricing and merchandising is beginning to pay off, with enormous runway ahead,&quot; the note said. &quot;Labor-efficiency drivers are starting to build, such that Lowe's might be able to hold operating expenses flat for the next three years to drive +250 basis points of margin improvement in a bull case scenario.&quot; Wedbush is still wary of Lowe's goal to reach $370 per square foot and operating margins of 12%, but analysts now see upside through 2022.

An earnings beat in its second-quarter sent Home Depot stock surging to over $232 per share an all-time high. Lower interest rates and a renewed interest in the housing market have also helped HD stock.Source: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.com However, not all headwinds for Home Depot stock have gone away. Home prices have plateaued in many major markets. Also, an inverted yield curve and the length of the current economic growth period point to a possible recession.  * 7 Discount Retail Stocks to Buy for a Recession Although HD stock remains a long-term winner, investors should not add to positions at these levels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips HD Stock Is a Long-Term Winner Facing Near-Term StrugglesTaking a negative view of Home Depot stock is a difficult decision. After all, it did not grow to almost 2,300 stores and a $250 billion-plus market cap by making poor decisions. HD has delivered massive returns to investors over the last few decades and remains a solid long-term investment now.Admittedly, bulls have many signs of optimism on which to base their call. The Fed lowered interest rates over the summer, setting up the highest level of mortgage originations since 2018. Moreover, the company announced they had beaten estimates by nine cents per share on Aug. 20. This sparked a rally that took the HD stock price from about $208 per share to the approximate $232 per share level where it trades today.Furthermore, both Home Depot stock and its main peer Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) continue to show resiliency. It continues growth even as a mature company. It also has fended off any potential threat from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), a company many feared would &quot;take over retail&quot; a few short years ago. Multiple Does Not Price in a Possible RecessionHowever, the recent rally took the forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio to about 21.2, very close to the average PE of almost 23 it has experienced over the last five years. Admittedly, a 21.2 forward multiple is not high by S&P 500 standards. However, it seems pricey when analysts predict only 2.4% profit growth this year and 8.4% in fiscal 2021.Also, many signs point to tough times coming soon. For one, the company missed its revenue estimates. Although the market has chosen to ignore that fact, it indicates some level of struggle for the home improvement giant. Moreover, investors cannot know for sure that the economy has avoided a recession. An inverted yield curve has frequently pointed to a downturn within two years in the past.Home price growth appears mixed as well. Thanks to the lower rates, analysts forecast annual price growth of 5.4% over the next year. Still, that is an average number. Many of the larger, pricier markets such as New York or Seattle continue to see a decline in prices. Since many consider Home Depot stock a proxy for the housing market, this indicates contradiction more than growth.Further, the current economic expansion is in its 11th year. This does not mean the economy will stop growing. However, it dramatically increases the chances of a downturn. It also calls into question whether investors should pay a higher multiple for Home Depot stock in such an environment. The Bottom Line on Home Depot StockHome Depot stock has become the solid equity that investors should avoid for now. In a sense, the recent run in HD stock makes sense. Interest rates have fallen in an environment where home prices have plateaued in many major markets. Without a doubt, this increases home affordability for many.Still, the current economic expansion has become long in the tooth. Moreover, an inverted yield curve has always pointed to a recession over the last 60-plus years.Although Home Depot has matured as a company, its ability to maintain growth over the last few decades is a testament to its long-term resiliency. I still believe in the future of Home Depot stock, and I do not recommend selling at these levels, except to log some profits.However, given the current circumstances, this seems like a time where investors should try to buy Home Depot stock on the cheap, not when it trades at a higher multiple.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

Check this out.Source: Shutterstock A &quot;Lehman-like&quot; market disaster could happen this week, analyst warnsSeriously?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe analyst cited negative sentiment triggered by the inversion of the yield curve and how it correlated to 2008. (Here's the article if you really want to read it.) I think he needs to be held responsible if he's wrong.I am sick of hacks trying to make names for themselves with insane and irresponsible Doomsday Calls. Do yourself a favor and ignore them. Instead of becoming fearful with these crazy calls, now is the time to set yourself up for big profits.I think we're headed for one of the greatest &quot;melt-ups&quot; (as my colleague Steve Sjuggerud accurately calls it) over the next 12-18 months. The new issue of Investment Opportunities will focus on stocks that I believe will be among the leaders of that rally, and I want to give you a preview of my analysis today. Already Moving HigherLet's dispense quickly with the idea that a recession is around the corner. I shared my full market outlook with you this weekend, but I've written before about the inverted yield curve and talked about it at length in a recent MoneyLine podcast (which you can listen to here).I'll share one stat with you now: Over the last 40 years, an inverted yield curve has actually been more of a buy signal than a recession indicator. Since 1978, the market has gained 20%+ on average one year after the inversion event when the 10-year Treasury begins to yield less than the two-year Treasury.Add in the likelihood that the Fed will lower interest rates a couple more times this year, and the odds of a major rally increase.But even if you're skeptical, please don't ignore a tried-and-true buying opportunity that so many other investors are missing amid the panic.I'm talking about housing stocks. I know. They don't sound as exciting as next-generation batteries, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, or personalized medicine. But who cares -- as long as they can make us money?Take a look at the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB). It broke above $40 last week for the first time since last June. That is a potentially major breakout going back to levels from 18 months prior. It also broke out of a consolidation phase that lasted about three months.Those are two bullish technical indicators, and I see more upside ahead with very low housing stock valuations and strong fundamentals.You may not hear much about strong fundamentals in the current environment, but they're there. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is at all-time highs, and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) is within about 6% of its peak. Both reported solid sales growth, as did consumer bellwethers Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT). This tells us that the consumer is doing pretty well, and so is the housing market.It's simple if you ignore the noise and doomsday headlines. Long-term interest rates are down, which means mortgage rates are, too. Any way you slice it, lower mortgage rates boost housing. They make homes more affordable.We already see potential home buyers on the move. Mortgage applications (the orange line below) have turned sharply higher as rates (the blue line) have fallen.Note how mortgage originations fell to their lowest level since mid-2014 earlier this year but are back on the upswing -- to their highest levels in about two years, in fact. The last time mortgage rates were this low (late 2016), mortgage originations spiked above $600 billion. What to Buy NowI look for a similar spike to occur in the next few quarters. A move from $344 billion in the first quarter to over $600 billion would be a massive 75% surge … and would light an even bigger fire under housing stocks.The opportunity is more than just low rates. There are multiple catalysts to drive housing stocks higher in the coming months, including high employment, consumers' willingness to spend, still-low valuations, and millennials buying homes as they start families. That last one is especially big and could last for years, as we are in the early stages of the greatest wealth transfer in U.S. history, from the baby boomers to the millennials.I focus a lot on cutting-edge trends and breakthroughs, like batteries that will change the way we live and communicate. That's where a lot of the life-changing gains will come from. But I don't ignore more &quot;traditional&quot; trends like housing when the time is right, like now.I'll have my full analysis on housing stocks and at least one related stock recommendation in the new Investment Opportunities issue this Thursday.

Put another way, Home Depot stock is usually a safe, reliable investment, but it is a tad on the boring side.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com However, shares have been doing something recently that they don't usually: being interesting. While the benchmark indices like the Dow Jones have been struggling to gain traction in August, the HD stock price has put on a remarkable run. Since the first of the month, shares gained nearly 7%.But at the same time, Home Depot stock is at record levels. Typically, even the strongest and most stable names experience volatility in a market-wide downturn. Therefore, it seems unreasonable to jump aboard HD, especially when headwinds like the U.S.-China trade war and rising economic fears have gripped investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOf course, I can understand the concerns here. But if you want exposure to recession-resistant companies, HD stock is among your best bets. Here are three reasons why: 1&#92;. Home Depot Stock Is Insulated from AmazonIn retrospect, the late 1990s to early 2000s was the peak of American shopping malls' cultural influence. Since then, brick-and-mortar retailers had to contend with the threat of e-commerce. And when I - or anyone - refers to e-commerce, we're talking about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now You only need to look at the technical charts for traditional retailers like Macy's (NYSE:M) or Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) to recognize the damage rendered by Amazon. Although these two names are renowned brands across high-end shopping centers, they can't escape the ecommerce onslaught. But Home Depot stock? Fortunately for stakeholders, they won't have to worry about digital disruption.The biggest reason why is that most people who shop at Home Depot do so for renovations or repairs. Neither is an exact science, which essentially insulates the HD stock price from Amazon's encroachment.From my experience with repair work done on my home, the process is a hit-or-miss affair: pipes don't quite work right, or components somehow are either too big or too small. And don't get me started on repainting the interior. I had no clue how many different shades of white existed.I say all this to illustrate a point: Home Depot's business necessitates a physical presence. In fact, going digital would be a nuisance to its millions of customers. Therefore, I'm confident that the HD stock price can hold up better than most retail names. 2&#92;. HD Stock Benefits from Secular DemandDuring bull markets, cyclical investments like tech stocks get all the love. And that's really not a surprise. When the money is flowing, people feel comfortable tacking on greater risk. If their investments fail, hey, the money is still coming in from other sources.But in recessionary markets, Home Depot stock and its rivals like Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) fare better than their high-growth counterparts. It's much easier to predict the company's revenue streams but there's not as much guesswork involved. Aside from obvious technological improvements, construction materials are construction materials.Moreover, HD stock benefits from consistent, secular demand. Yes, a recession will hurt Home Depot like it would any other company. However, consumers don't really have a choice if they the home-improvement giant's services.Again, I speak from personal experience, but I suspect your experiences aren't dissimilar: your plumbing doesn't decide to conk out based on when it's most convenient to your schedule.Plus, I actually see some potential tailwinds for Home Depot stock if we suffer a recession. For instance, home sales have been plummeting even prior to the trade war escalation. Also, the average price of homes sold has started to flatline. Understandably, people are hesitant toward exposing themselves to unnecessary financial risk.But homeowners might take advantage of this lull and focus instead on renovating their properties. Then, when housing comes back, they could reap greater returns. Invariably, such circumstances will only help bolster HD stock. 3&#92;. Mitigating China RisksTurn on the news and chances are, you'll hear various analyses about the longer-term impact of the U.S.-China trade war. And while Home Depot stock does have a secular, insular business, it too suffers from supply chain cost increases.According to Home Depot CEO Craig Menear, the tariffs on Chinese goods will have a &quot;cost impact&quot; on U.S. revenue. This amounts to 2%, or $2 billion.However, the company's suppliers have thought ahead, shifting some manufacturing outside China. These location shifts are toward friendlier nations, including Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, even back home stateside.Of course, retailers broadly have pushed these cost increases to their customers and that worries economists. But for Home Depot stock, burdening the consumer base isn't as atrocious as it is for a discretionary-spending retailer.I go back to the point about secular demand. If your home needs repair, you're going to pay the increased material costs because you have to. While it's a cynical situation, it really does favor HD stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Home Depot, Lowe's and Floor & Decor will get initial boost from Hurricane Dorian, but risks remain: analyst	Home-improvement retailers are expected to benefit from the initial sales boost caused by Hurricane Dorian, as residents of Florida buy generators, batteries and flashlights in preparation for the storm. But Home Depot Inc. , Lowe's Cos.  and Floor & Decor Holdings Inc.  also have exposure in the form of the stores that are potentially in the storm path, Jefferies analysts wrote Friday. Home Depot has 153 stores in Florida equal to 8% of its U.S. fleet, while Lowe's has 126 stores equal to 7% of its U.S., analysts led by Jonathan Matuszewski wrote in a note to clients. Floor & Decor has 18 stores, equal to 18% if its fleet. &quot;While not all stores are in communities expected to be impacted, each retailer has clear exposure,&quot; the analysts wrote. The retailers are expected to enjoy demand for flooring once the rebuild begins after any damage, and the tailwind could be big, they wrote. Hurricane Matthew in the third quarter of 2017 lead to an initial sales lift of $100 million for Home Depot, they noted, while Lowe's cited a 60 basis point lift from weather. In the third quarter of 2019, Hurricanes Irma, Nate and Harvey generated a $282 million sales lift for Home Depot and a 140 basis-point comp lift for Lowe's. Still, &quot;similar to past significant weather events, storm-related expenses will be incurred,' said the note. &quot;Recall, HD reported costs of $167M to drive $650M in hurricane-sales during F'2H18, encapsulating the months Irma/Nate/Harvey hit and the next quarter. Some degree of gross margin deterioration for home improvement centers is likely given the profitability profiles of in-demand SKUs like plywood and generators.&quot; Home Depot shares were up 0.3% Friday, while Lowe's was flat. Floor & Decor rose 1.2%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ce24b02b-8a1a-3874-934c-4458d0393767/home-depot%2C-lowe%26%2339%3Bs-and.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 19:03:55	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Home Depot Stock Might Be Getting Too Much Respect	To understand how much respect Home Depot (NYSE:HD) gets from the market, just look at the price of Home Depot stock. The stock gained last week; in fact, it touched an all-time high before a recent, modest pullback.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Those gains came after the company missed Wall Street revenue estimates and lowered its full-year same-store sales guidance.In this market, that combination for any stock -- let alone one with macro and tariff concerns -- would have sent investors fleeing for the exits. Instead, the HD stock price actually rose more than 4% after the earnings release.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere's a case that, at this point, Home Depot has earned the benefit of the doubt. It's a great American retailer, with a likely $110 billion in sales this year. Home Depot stock has been one of the best stocks in the entire market. Valuation concerns in the past -- and I've raised them as recently as April -- have proven to be short-sighted.That said, investors are giving Home Depot an awful lot of credit. In fact, they're treating HD stock like a defensive play, not a cyclical one. That seems risky in this environment, and suggests that maybe this time, the HD stock price finally has gone too far. Home Depot Stock Rises on a Guidance CutTo be sure, Home Depot's Q2 report wasn't a disaster by any means. Earnings beat consensus by 9 cents. Same-store sales still increased 3%, including a 3.1% print in the U.S. The consolidated 3% gain was just 0.2 points below analyst estimates.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond And the general take on the quarter seems to be, as one analyst put it, that it &quot;was no worse than feared&quot;. Even with modest signs of a housing slowdown (particularly in new construction) and potential impacts from the U.S.-China trade war, Home Depot is still growing sales and keeping operating margins basically flat. The lower revenue outlook is coming in part from deflationary prices in lumber (although tariffs are a factor as well).That said, the HD stock price doesn't seem to incorporate &quot;no worse than feared&quot;. A 20x+ multiple to updated fiscal 2020 (ending January) guidance doesn't sound that high. But this is a cyclical stock -- one whose sales and profits will plunge in a recession.Even that aside, the lower guidance is a concern. In late 2017, Home Depot gave a three-year target for comp growth of 4.5-6% -- it's missing that mark. Margins are nearing the low end of the company's target range. Earnings-per-share rose less than 4% year-over-year: pre-tax income actually declined.Investors are clearly betting on a stronger second half. But the issue here is that Home Depot can't drive that improvement all on its own. The Concerns About the HD Stock PriceAfter all, Home Depot needs help. It needs the economy to hold up. In many places elsewhere in the market, investors hardly seem confident on that front.Admittedly, the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB), my pick for the Best ETF of 2019, has gained 33% so far this year. But those gains have come simply from regaining some of its lost ground.ITB is up only 5% over the past year and still sits ~13% below January 2018 highs. And it's not like Home Depot stock -- a major component of that ETF -- hasn't joined in on the 2019 fun. It has risen 27% despite better performance heading into this year.Meanwhile, other macro-sensitive stocks -- think Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) or automotive stocks -- have struggled and/or seen big sell-offs amid tariff and trade war worries. Home Depot's U.S. focus gives it exposure to the still-strong U.S. economy, admittedly, but on the whole investors still see at least some kind of downturn coming in the next few years.That's one big risk. The other is competition. Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) is trying to execute a turnaround and it's having some success. Its stock soared after earnings. Its same-store sales have outpaced those of Home Depot for the last two quarters. Home Depot isn't losing its crown any time soon, to be sure, but a combination of a weaker market and lower market share -- even if both impacts are modest -- is not priced in at 20x+ FY20 EPS. A Cyclical Treated Like a DefensiveAnd yet the HD stock price keeps marching higher. What's interesting about the trading -- particularly this year -- is that Home Depot stock really hasn't been rattled much by outside forces. It posted some big declines in 2018, but the biggest dip so far this year came from late April through late May, when the stock dropped about 9%.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week That's a surprise given the fact that the market as a whole has, at times, been seized by selling amid tariff concerns or an inverted yield curve. A cyclical play like HD stock theoretically should be vulnerable to those swings, but it simply hasn't had much in the way of downside.Instead, Home Depot stock has traded more like a defensive stock. Its chart looks much more like that of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or a Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Those stocks aren't immune to macro worries, but they're generally considered &quot;safer&quot; plays for investors worried about overall growth.It certainly seems like, particularly after last week's earnings, the market is treating Home Depot stock the same way. But that would be a mistake. If a recession hits, Home Depot sales will fall. And so will the HD stock price. Investors ignore outside worries -- and guidance cuts -- at their peril.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-22	2019-08-22 14:07:14	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	2 Major Retailers Pop After Earnings	Earnings season may have wound down, but there are still a few big names reporting. Yesterday, both Lowe’s (LOW) and Target (TGT) stunned the prognosticators with quarterly earnings well above the expectations, and both stocks spiked sharply as a result. Let’s dive in, see what they reported, and find out what Wall Street’s top analysts have to say about their earnings and their outlook. Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW) Lowe’s has been struggling in recent years, suffering from fluctuations in the housing markets and in the costs of raw materials as well as from direct competition with its larger rival Home Depot (HD). Marvin Ellison, who as a Home Depot exec had been part of that chain’s turnaround, joined Lowe’s as CEO last year on a mandate to lead another turnaround. Ellison took a ground-level approach, going to Lowe’s stores personally to find out what was needed at the small scale. He also began shuttering unprofitable locations.At least in the short term, Ellison’s work is paying off. For Q2, Lowe’s reported EPS of $2.15, 7% higher than the forecast. Revenues came in at $20.99 billion, just above the $20.94 billion expected. Company-wide same-store sales were up 2.3%, well above the 1.9% estimate, and were even better in the US market, where same-store sales gained 3.2%. The US number was especially good, as it was higher than Home Depot’s equivalent.During the earnings conference call, Ellison said, “We capitalized on spring demand, strong holiday event execution and growth in paint and our pro business to deliver strong second quarter results. Despite lumber deflation and difficult weather, we are pleased that we delivered positive comparable sales in all 15 geographic regions of the U.S.”Investors were definitely thrilled, as LOW shares jumped from $97.87 to $108 during the trading session.Top Wall Street analysts were quick to weigh in on Lowe's success. Baird’s Peter Benedict described the results as “encouraging,” and pointed out the company’s excellent gross margins. He added, “The print should drive shares as comp momentum continues to showcase early traction in engaging customers.” Benedict already had a Buy rating on LOW; he reiterated that and set a price target of $127. His target suggests an upside of 18%.KeyBanc analyst Bradley Thomas gave Lowe’s a $125 price target, with an upside of 15%, after the earnings. He said, “Sales and EPS were better than expected, demonstrating improvement in gross margin issues faced in Q1 while building new momentum in its turnaround under new management. Lowe's remains a self-help story, under the leadership of new CEO Marvin Ellison. Look for numerous initiatives to ramp through 2020.”The analyst consensus gives LOW shares a Moderate Buy rating. After yesterday’s spike, LOW is trading for $108. The $116 average price target indicates an upside of 7.7%. Target Corporation (TGT)In some ways, Target’s Q2 earnings were even better. EPS was $1.82, an impressive 12.3% more than the $1.62 forecast, and quarterly revenues were $18.4 billion, a full $100 million higher than expected. Even same-store growth clobbered the estimates, coming in a 3.4% against the expected 3%.Looking ahead, company management guided to FY2019 earnings of $5.90 to $6.20 per share, well above the analysts’ expectation of $5.94. The FY EPS guidance was also a big step up from Target’s own previous estimate.Investors were duly impressed by the earnings numbers. The report came out before the opening bell on Wednesday, and in the ensuing trading session TGT saw its single best one-day gains ever and an all-time high share price. The quarterly beat propelled the stock from $85.53 to $108 in a single session, a gain of 22.47%.CEO Brian Cornell, in his statement on the earnings, said, “We’re increasing Target’s relevancy and deepening the relationship between our guests and our brand. Traffic and sales continue to grow while our earnings per share reached an all-time high, driven by the strength of our team’s execution and their focus on delivering for our guests.” He added that the quarterly gains were driven by apparel and essentials.Writing for KeyBanc, top analyst Edward Yruma bumped his price target on TGT up by 9% to $120. He said, “The company's Q2 performance points to share gains driven by merchandising and store experience, as well as ongoing improvements to e-commerce. Momentum will continue into the second half of the year.” Yruma’s price target implies an upside of 14% to TGT shares.Taking an even more optimistic note, Citigroup’s Paul Lejuez upgraded TGT on the earnings news, moving his rating from Hold to Buy. He wrote, “We want to catch the next 20% move up, which will occur as the company continues to prove it is a winner in the current retail landscape Target's investments are paying off in strong comps and positive store traffic, which will drive higher free cash flow and improving ROIC.” Lejuez’ $130 price target suggests a solid 24% upside for the stock.Overall, TGT get a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 12 recent buy ratings and only 3 holds. The stock has an average price target of $108, but since the earnings report the share price is rising swiftly and the upside is only 2.4%. Expect analysts to adjust their price targets in coming weeks if TGT continues to rally.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-major-retailers-pop-earnings-140714231.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-21	2019-08-21 19:45:51	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	5 Top Stock Trades for Thursday: WMT, BABA, LOW, XLNX, Bitcoin	Global stock markets are still trading violently but the U.S. equities are still battling close to the all-time highs. So the upside potential is still viable. Wednesday we saw strong earnings reports. This confirm that there are still stock trades to hunt in spite of the geopolitical risks and rhetoric.Our five stock trade to watch for Thursday include: Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), and Bitcoin Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: WMTInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWMT stock is near all time highs and for good reason. The company has taken the fight to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) head on and it's doing well against this formidable opponent.Investors loved the earnings report last week and WMT stock rallied 8% on the headline. From here, there could be better entry points for the short term. WMT stock is vulnerable to fade and a retest of $110 per share. Maybe even fill the gap $2 lower. But for the long term, this company will continue to deliver and adapt to the market demands. If I am long WMT already, then I stay long. Otherwise I would buy the dips for the long term.  * The 10 Best Marijuana Stocks to Buy Now Wednesday, Target (NYSE:TGT) stock soared as they reported a strong quarter. This confirms the strength of the U.S. consumer spending and operational success. Both companies are winners because of strong execution. WMT is employing technology trend to better compete with AMZN one to one and beat it. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: LOWLOW stock spiked today after a strong earnings report. The investor expectations were tepid going into the event so it made for an easy hurdle. This however is not the time to pile into LOW stock and chase this rally.The reason the expectations were low is because it has a long history of trailing its competition Home Depot (NASDAQ:HD). I believe this continues until we get several reports to prove otherwise. Case in point, HD stock is up 26% year-to-date which 60% better than LOW. This is also true for the last five year stats.So if I took in profits from the LOW stock reaction to earnings, I would book it for now. From here, it carries the risk of a fade to fill the gap below especially if markets in general correct. This is not the same as shorting the stock.So if I want to remain constructive on the segment, I would rotate my risk into HD stock instead. This one is sitting at another breakout line. Even though the LOW report shows domestic comparable sales beat those of HD, over the long term HD stock has performed better thanks to more consistent management execution. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: BABABABA stock has an interesting setup brewing. It will be tough to trigger but the reward if they do so is great. If the BABA stock bulls can break above $180, they can target $192 per share or higher. It won't be easy and there will be resistance at the neckline and at $185.For a while, BABA stock has been lurking just under this breakout level and doing it from higher lows. But this is a steep rising wedge which leaves the stock vulnerable to pullbacks. If the general markets cooperate then BABA will make this happen; it's a matter of time.This would then fill an old gap and also places it at a was prior fail. The interesting part is that was also a neckline that if bulls can break could carry it to $200 per share or higher.On pullbacks, BABA stock could fade to $170 which is just above its yearly point of control where bulls and bears loved to fight. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: XLNXXLNX stock is no stranger to headlines. The whole chip sector has been in the line of fire in the economic war between the US and China. XLNX stock moves more on headlines extrinsic to its own execution than not.But Tuesday XLNX fell on headlines of possible &quot;unpatchable&quot; security flaw in its equipment. So this is a rare dump from intrinsic problems. Nevertheless, this dip places XLNX sock at a place with it makes sense that it mounts a rally soon.XLNX stock bulls defended the $100 mark hard on the May correction and yesterday's scare didn't even come near it. So as long as the support band below holds, it is likely that XLNX makes another run at $120 per share. There will be resistance at $109 and $113, but if the general markets rally then XLNX can slice through them and reach it major accident scene from the end of July. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: BitcoinSince the love-fest with bitcoin of 2017 the interest in the digital coin has not abated. While it's not hogging the headline it is still a hot debate. Skepticism is high so Bitcoin has a questionable reputation on main street and Wall Street.Both extremes are wrong when it comes to bitcoin. It has value because people say so. This is no different than gold. Bitcoin and gold are rare and people want them so they will continue to be valuable on that assumption. Critics say that it's used for illicit activities and to that I say that so is cash. At least with bitcoin, they always leave an electronic trace. Furthermore, FIAT cash only has value because the people say so. So in essence cash and bitcoin are more similar than we think.What's the best place to buy bitcoin? This depends on time frame. If I am buying it like gold as a long term investment then timing really doesn't matter much. But there are clues on the charts to offer some guidance. Bitcoin price here is falling into support. So in theory it should bounce back up to 10,200. But it moves so fast that by the time you read this note, the landscape would have probably change a lot.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential So, it's best to get the general feel for the zones that matter and know what's at stake.

2019-08-21	2019-08-21 12:36:10	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Target’s Turnaround Approaches Mission Accomplished	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Whatever U.S.-China trade war fallout may be looming for the retail industry, Target Corp. is doing all it can to ensure that its turnaround – now nearly complete – will remain on track.The big-box giant reported on Wednesday that comparable sales rose 3.4% in the second quarter from a year earlier, powered by strong foot traffic in its stores and a 34% increase in online sales.Target also raised its full-year earnings guidance, sending a message that it sees its run of healthy growth continuing even if the consumer environment gets more challenging when tariffs get slapped on $300 billion worth of goods from China. Target shares soared more than 16% in early trading, putting the stock on track to open at an all-time high.The details of the report underscored that Target’s approach to grabbing digital business – which heavily emphasizes using its stores as fulfillment centers – is working. Nearly three-quarters of its online comparable sales growth in the quarter was driven by its same-day services such as curbside or in-store pickup. This is important, because that type of online order tends to be more profitable than those that include free shipping for customers or require Target to foot the bill for last-mile delivery.Growth in curbside and in-store pickup is a balm for Target’s gross margin, which improved to 30.6% in the quarter from 30.3% last year. Several other factors also contributed to the gains on this measure, including cost-control initiatives and pricing. The improvement is an encouraging sign for investors who have worried about the chain’s ability to pad profitability, particularly now that the liquidation of Toys R Us and Babies R Us have made Target even more of a go-to for low-margin items such as toys.Target gave us tea leaves to read earlier this week for how it plans to keep capturing more foot traffic. It announced that in September it will launch a new private grocery brand called Good & Gather. The line will eventually contain more than 2,000 products and will focus on items that don’t contain artificial flavors and sweeteners. At the same time, it will phase out stalwart private food brands Archer Farms and Simply Balanced. This game plan in food sounds a lot like what Target has done with great success in its apparel section, where it axed tired labels such as Merona and Mossimo in favor of more current, trend-focused ones. If it can replicate that in food, it bodes well for a chain that could stand to grab more market share in a category that is essential in driving store trips. Coupled with its continuing store remodeling project, which includes updates to the grocery department, the revamp may  help Target drive more customers to the food section.It’s almost eerie how similarly the quarter shaped up for Target and Walmart Inc. Both had solid comparable sales growth that was notched despite a difficult comparison to last year, a period when both retailing giants recorded their best quarterly sales results in over a decade. Both also delivered upbeat e-commerce growth that relied heavily on their brick-and-mortar fleets. And both raised their guidance for the year, showing at least near-term confidence in the health of the U.S. consumer.In fact, in a series of earnings reports over the course of the last week, the giants of retail have given us little reason to worry that the U.S. consumer is flinching in the face of trade and economic uncertainty. Lowe’s Cos. reported a solid increase in comparable sales on Wednesday, showing strength in the most important quarter of the year for the home-improvement business. While Home Depot Inc. said yesterday that part of the reason for lowering its guidance was concerns about the impact of tariffs, executives said they were doing that out of “conservatism,” not because they were currently seeing caution from consumers.Tariff pressure may change that view if it drags on for a long time. For now, though, the environment is positive one for Target and its ilk. As long as they deliver what shoppers want, there’s no reason to think customers won’t keep coming.  To contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

Lowe's tops forecast with rise in second-quarter profit	Home improvement retailer Lowe's  said its second-quarter net income rose to $1.68 billion, or $2.14 a share, from $1.52 billion, or $1.86 a share, with sales up 0.5% to $20.99 billion. Adjusted for the wind-down of the company's Mexico retail operations, Lowe's would've earned $2.15 a share, compared to the FactSet-compiled broker consensus of $2 a share. Lowe's said comparable-store sales grew 2.3% during the quarter, and that it benefited from spring demand and its Paint and Pro business. Lowe's forecast of adjusted earnings of $5.45 to $5.65 compares to a broker consensus of $5.57, and Lowe's said net sales will rise 2% and comparable-store sales will grow 3% for the year.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/aeb4c320-60a4-3e5d-a1fc-4ac39d4773cd/lowe%26%2339%3Bs-tops-forecast-with.html?.tsrc=rss

The move left behind a gap, though, and still left the index under a couple of key moving average lines that could be resistance.Source: Shutterstock Chinese stocks led the charge. Enthused about the prospect of rekindled trade between China and the United States, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) rallied nearly 8% during the regular session headed into its post-close earnings report. But, shares jumped nearly another 9% on numbers investors liked.Iqiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) was up almost 6% during yesterday's regular-hours session, but didn't see the same post-close fate as Baidu. IQ stock fell more than 9% after Monday's closing bell rang. Revenue came up short of expectations and guidance was less than thrilling as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHolding the market back was General Electric (NYSE:GE), down 1.4% as investors continue to grapple with recent accusations that its balance sheet under-reflected its true risks.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul As for names worth a closer, trading-oriented look headed into Tuesday's session, check out the stock charts of Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Here's what's most noteworthy. Twitter (TWTR)It has been incredibly erratic action, but progressive action nonetheless. That is, Twitter shares are being guided upward, squeezed toward the narrowing tip of an ascending wedge pattern. More recently, TWTR stock has been finding support at levels that suggest the buyers are working on forcing a breakout.That won't be easy, particularly given how overbought Twitter shares are since the bottom made in early 2017. But, the pattern that has taken shape thus far isn't atypical of initial public offerings. Every one has to fall apart sooner than later, but most everyone eventually shrugs it off and works its way into a bullish mode.  *   Click to EnlargeThe bigger-picture in only evident through the long-term lens of the weekly chart, framed by light blue lines. The upper boundary of that pattern currently rests at $44.70.  * Zooming into the daily chart another wedge becomes evident. Framed by red dashed lines, a rising trading range has materialized. There's still room for wide swings though.  * Since May, the gray 100-day moving average line and the purple 50-day line have both stepped up as technical support.  * Although it's not ideal, the weekly chart also suggests a pretty good cup-and-handle pattern. The brimline, of course, is the ceiling that connects all the major peaks going back to mid-2014. Lowe's (LOW)Lowe's shares haven't made a straight line to their current price since finding a bottom in 2009. In fact, there has been nothing straight about LOW stock for years. But, a well-established bullish trend line has kept the overarching advance intact. The up/down action, in fact, has been oddly reliable for years.Something has changed just within the past few weeks, however, that could finally snap the winning streak. On the other hand, that would require one final but significant technical floor to buckle. The stock could reach that inflection point sometime as early as this week.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential   *   Click to EnlargeIt's evident on both stock charts, but more perspective is seen on the weekly chart. That is, Lowe's shares brushed a long-standing floor last week, marked in yellow and tried to push up and off of it.  * Although that has been where LOW stock has bounced every pullback thus far, in July, shares made their first lower high in years. That happened the first time after Lowe's shares failed to move above a major peak. That's the horizontal ceiling around $118, marked in blue on both stock charts.  * It's subtle, but telling that each MACD peak and subsequent crossunder since the beginning of 2018 has been lower than the last. That points to fading bullish efforts. Procter & Gamble (PG)At the beginning of 2018, most investors had doubts about Procter & Gamble. Although relatively new, David Taylor was capable, but it appeared the company might be beyond anybody's help.The tide turned in a convincing way by the middle of last year though, resulting in a rebound effort that has been tightly defined by a narrow trading range. Although overbought and ripe for a pullback, until it's clear the lower boundary of that range is no longer holding up, the advance has to be respected. That's especially true given the circumstances that have taken shape of late.  *   Click to EnlargeThe rising trading range is marked with a yellow line on top and a red line on the bottom of both stock charts. It has poked above the ceiling a couple of times, and bumped it yesterday.  * The weekly chart offers some needed perspective, but it also shows us something fairly new. That is, the RSI indicator is now deep into overbought territory, thanks to an unusually persistent advance.  * Although the 70% gain since mid-2018 leaves P&G shares vulnerable to a pullback, that doesn't inherently mean one will materialize. Notice that the weekly bullish volume bars are, for the most part, on the rise.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-16	2019-08-16 16:00:03	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week	Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.The earnings calendar turns to retail next week. And that might not be a good thing for the sector.To be sure, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) did post a strong Q2 report on Thursday, with raised full-year guidance leading WMT stock to rally 6%. But that followed a disastrous report from Macy's (NYSE:M), which cut its outlook and saw its stock plunge to a post-financial crisis low.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat split isn't a surprise to anyone who has followed the retail industry in recent years. Those companies with the scale to manage through a quickly changing environment have been able to at least survive, if not thrive. (Walmart stock, for instance, has roughly doubled from late 2015 lows.) Smaller operators, with few exceptions, have taken a beating.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever Earnings reports next week seem unlikely to change that trend. But specialty retailers like Gap (NYSE:GPS) and department store operators Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) will do their best to fight the tide. Meanwhile, three more leaders in the sector will try and keep pace, while a struggling tech giant attempts a turnaround of its own. Broad markets will struggle with their own external challenges, but retailers, in particular, have a big week ahead. Home Depot (HD)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Aug. 20, before market openFiscal second-quarter earnings from Home Depot (NYSE:HD) will be closely watched. After all, Home Depot sits at the intersection of several of the fears rattling the market right now. Investors are worried that a recession is coming: Any weakness in consumer demand could be reflected in Home Depot sales.Increased -- and then delayed -- tariffs have amplified those cyclical concerns. Home Depot said after Q1 that it was working to mitigate the impact of those duties, but still forecast a potential impact of $1 billion annually.HD stock already has pulled back about 8% amid those worries. Any weakness in Tuesday morning's report could add to the declines.Meanwhile, rival Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) follows on Wednesday. If both reports disappoint, that would be a signal that even two of the country's strongest retailers aren't immune to external factors. And that would be a big problem for the rest of retail, and maybe even the rest of the market. Target (TGT)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Aug. 21, before market openFor Target (NYSE:TGT), Wednesday morning's report will help answer which side of the retail divide the company sits. Is Target a real competitor to the likes of Walmart and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)? Or is it not quite large enough, or strong enough, to completely determine its own destiny?Trading in TGT stock over the past few quarters shows that investors haven't quite figured out which side to take. Target stock touched $90 less than a year ago and was at $60 three months later. A 25% rally so far this year shows some confidence, while an ~8% drop in recent weeks (not coincidentally similar to that of HD stock) reflects the rising external risks.And so this seems like an important, and maybe even crucial, earnings report for Target. Walmart's blowout quarter sets the bar high. Target has tariff and macro issues of its own. The stock is cheap enough that it can rise if margins keep expanding. But it's expensive enough that it can fall if they don't.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On In short, the question is whether Target is a retail leader? Wednesday's report will help answer that question. VMWare (VMW)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Aug. 22, after market closeKey earnings reports next week go beyond the retail space. Software developer VMWare (NYSE:VMW) has an important report on Thursday afternoon. And it won't just impact VMW stock.VMWare earnings will move shares of Dell Technologies (NASDAQ:DELL) whose majority stake in VMWare is worth more than its current market capitalization. (Dell has earnings of its own, but VMWare numbers will be the big mover.) Meanwhile, the company's reported interest in Pivotal Software (NYSE:PVTL) could be a topic of conversation on the post-earnings conference call.But the Pivotal deal and Dell's potential plans for its VMW stake are just noise. VMWare simply has to stem the bleeding. The stock has dropped by 30% just since May. Here, too, cyclical fears are a factor, but soft fiscal first-quarter earnings in late May didn't help the cause. At 20x forward earnings, VMWare stock can rally if the company can deliver. At the moment, however, that seems like a big if.As of this writing, Vince Martin is long shares of Gap, Dell and is short call options in VMWare.

Australia's Jobs Market Keeps Defying Gravity as Hiring Soars	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Australia’s labor market surged in July, adding almost three times the forecast number of jobs, while unemployment remained stuck at 5.2% as the workforce swelled to a fresh record.The economy added 41,100 roles from the previous month, with more than three-quarters of them full-time, the statistics bureau said in Sydney Thursday. Economists had forecast a gain of just 14,000. The participation rate, which wasn’t expected to move, slightly rose to a new high of 66.1%.“The rebound in employment growth likely reflects the rebound in hiring intentions after the federal election, which temporarily disrupted firms’ hiring plans,” said Sarah Hunter, head of macroeconomics at BIS Oxford Economics in Sydney. “It also highlights that the amount of spare capacity in the market is much larger than previously thought.”Australia’s center-right government was re-elected in a surprise result in May and last month was probably the earliest the labor market could reflect the outcome. It put an end to opposition plans to scrap housing tax breaks and lift the burden on high income earners. Similarly, the Reserve Bank had cut rates in June and did so again in July, which might also have lifted confidence.The Aussie dollar rose on the data, buying 67.81 U.S. cents at 3:59 p.m. in Sydney from 67.58 prior to the report’s release.Lowe’s DilemmaFor RBA chief Philip Lowe, the jobs result prolongs his conundrum. The strength of hiring and swelling participation speak to a healthy labor market, yet the constant increase in job seekers pushes his goal of lowering unemployment ever further away. He estimates the jobless rate needs to come down to near 4.5% to reignite inflation.“Normally the employment growth we have experienced over the past two years would have led to a sizable decline in the unemployment rate. These are not normal times,” said Callam Pickering, an economist at global jobs website Indeed, who previously worked at the central bank. “High population growth and rising participation has instead put upward pressure on measures of unemployment.”That’s underscored by the underemployment and underutilization rates both increasing 0.2 percentage point to 8.4% and 13.6% respectively, suggesting stronger wage growth remains a fair way off.What Bloomberg’s Economists Say“The lack of headway keeps expectations alive for further rate cuts. Still, we don’t expect any more easing this year from the RBA, as the weaker Australian dollar should help to support exports and fiscal stimulus is in the pipeline.”&#92;-- Tamara Mast Henderson, EconomistClick here for the whole reportAustralia’s job gains were led by Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, the east coast states that have benefited most from the RBA’s record-low cash rate that helped drive a wave of apartment construction in recent years.The nation’s labor market has held up surprisingly well even as the economy slowed sharply since mid-2018. One explanation is that much of the hiring is government-related and impervious to prevailing economic conditions.The RBA’s lowering of the full-employment estimate follows in the footsteps of other developed-world counterparts, who’ve had to wait for their jobless rates to fall to exceptionally low levels to spur wage growth. Markets are predicting the RBA will have to ease further from the current 1% cash rate to keep pushing down unemployment and keep up with a wave of global easing.To contact the reporter on this story: Michael Heath in Sydney at mheath1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nasreen Seria at nseria@bloomberg.net, Chris Bourke, Victoria BatchelorFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/australian-employment-surges-past-expectations-015047476.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-14	2019-08-14 14:55:50	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Home Depot Stock Will Reach $230 Sooner Than You Think	This morning the equity markets are falling on the headline that the yield curve has inverted but that doesn't mean there aren't great stocks to buy. It is nice to know that a stock like Home Depot (NYSE:HD) only has one real competitor in the U.S., which is Lowe's (NYSE:LOW). And it's even better to know that HD stock is 30% cheaper than LOW.Source: Shutterstock And what is even more awesome than that is that HD is also performing five times better year-to-date than LOW.So if the overall equity thesis is still bullish, and stocks will be higher in the future than now, then the Home Depot stock is a buy. This is especially true if investors have a time frame longer than a few ticks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere is a temporary hitch in the logic now because Home Depot's earnings report is approaching. Such events are binary in nature. That means the short-term reaction in HD will solely depend on trader sentiment, not the facts themselves.In other words, even if Home Depot management delivers a home run earnings report, we don't know if the traders will accept it as positive. It is impossible to forecast the direction of the stock into its following open. That is why we do homework and decide on the viability of holding a stock like HD for at least the mid-term.Additionally, the fundamentals and the technicals also suggest that the upside scenario in HD stock is still more likely than the disaster scenario.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul For about 18 months, Home Depot stock has been fighting over a neckline around $205 per share. Last year, the September rally failed as the whole market crashed into Christmas.But since then, HD fans rallied the stock back up to the same neckline and beat it. They have clearly established higher-lows in HD stock attacking a long-term standing neckline. More often than not, these end in a breakout more unless management errs in a big way. Home Depot Stock Has a Big Rally Setup Looming AboveSince July, HD stock set a double top near $220 per share. But unlike most traders, I don't consider those as omens to absolute tops. As long as HD is setting higher lows, $220 then becomes a clear target to beat. And if that happens, more momentum sellers will jump into the rally and HD stock will spike at least $10 from there.For the last two years, the weekly Home Depot chart shows the stock is consolidating inside a wide range. This usually sets of a solid floor underneath, so in this case the bulls will have support to embark on their next upside scenario.Moreover, Home Depot stock is not expensive as it sells at price-to-earnings ratio of 21. This is much cheaper than LOW's and in line with most companies with similar growth. So owning the stock for the long-term, even at these levels, is not likely to be a financial disaster.Can the price go down? Sure, but as part of normal price action. The only reason Home Depot would fail completely is a story line that doesn't yet exist.The Federal Reserve is committed to keeping long-term rates low. This will encourage people to spend money on their homes. It also entices businesses to build and expand. A lot of this money will end up in Home Depot stores.Given the current geopolitical economic environment, and since all central banks are also committed to global expansion, shorting Home Depot fundamentally is wrong.We are still in headline mode where fundamentals fall hostage to tweets and state media releases. So clearly for the short-term we do have bumps in the road. The economic battle with China stalled and is a source of angst for Wall Street.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale But nothing has changed in the last year. Both countries still need to come to a truce and will eventually get to it. It is just a matter of time before investors can stop selling on knee-jerk reactions for extraneous reasons.Meanwhile, companies like Home Depot are still delivering great reports so there are no wheels falling off the hinges here. This is not last December and definitely not 1999. I consider this to be a fundamental trade with a relaxed stop below.Of course, I never risk more than I can afford to lose and most importantly, I don't enter an entire position all at once. This leaves room to adjust size in order to manage the trade.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

RBA Ready to Ease Again, But Lowe Sees ‘Gentle Turn’ in Economy	(Bloomberg) -- Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe said he’s still prepared to reduce Australia’s record-low interest rates further if needed, though signaled the economy could be through the worst of its slowdown.The central bank’s own estimates, released as Lowe spoke, pushed back expectations for faster economic growth and inflation and a lower unemployment rate. Importantly, these were based on current market pricing for two more RBA cuts that would bring the cash rate to 0.5%. Nonetheless, the RBA chief struck a note of quiet optimism.“There are signs the economy may have reached a gentle turning point,” Lowe said in his opening statement to a parliamentary panel in Canberra Friday. “Consistent with this, we are expecting the quarterly GDP growth outcomes to strengthen gradually after a run of disappointing numbers.”The RBA undertook back-to-back rate cuts in June and July to a record-low 1% as it sought to revive a decelerating expansion and drive down unemployment. It joined developed-world counterparts in easing as the U.S.-China economic confrontation deepens, damping global confidence and investment.“While we might wish it were otherwise, it is difficult to escape the fact that if global interest rates are low, they are going to be low here in Australia too,” Lowe said in his semi-annual testimony. “Our floating exchange rate gives us the ability to set our own interest rates from a cyclical perspective, but it does not insulate us from long-lasting shifts in global interest rates driven by saving/investment decisions around the world.”The Aussie dollar has declined almost 8% in the past 12 months as the economy slowed and money markets boosted bets the RBA would resume easing. The currency climbed Friday morning in Sydney as markets read into the remarks that the governor was gaining confidence that growth could be turning up.Lowe’s remarks “confirmed an easing bias and willingness to cut further to meet the RBA’s objectives, but did not appear to signal any urgency,” said Su-Lin Ong, head of economic and fixed-income strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Sydney. “Their base case appears to be a hope that monetary and fiscal stimulus will see firmer growth ahead.”Lowe also said it was prudent to be thinking about unconventional policies, though he reiterated that he believed this was unlikely in Australia.The key forecast revisions in the Statement on Monetary Policy released Friday in Sydney were as follows:Core inflation will be around 1.75% next year and reach the bottom of the RBA’s 2-3% target by June 2021, a year later than projected in MayUnemployment will be around 5.25% through 2020 and fall to 5% by June 2021, two years later than projected in MayGDP growth will be slightly lower this year, at 2.5% versus previous estimate of 2.75%Glass Half FullLowe’s gentle optimism expressed in his testimony is based on the RBA’s lower rates, recent tax cuts, a lower currency, a brighter outlook for investment in the resources sector, some stabilization of the housing market and ongoing investment in infrastructure.“It is reasonable to expect that, together, these factors will see growth in the Australian economy return to around its trend rate next year,” he said. Still, even an improving outlook won’t resolve the economy’s underlying challenges.“In the central scenario that I have sketched today, inflation will be below the target band for some time to come and the unemployment rate will remain above the level we estimate to be consistent with full employment,” Lowe said. “While this remains the case, the possibility of lower interest rates will remain on the table.”The governor also highlighted the elephant in the room: the political and economic uncertainty worldwide.“These disputes pose a significant risk to the global economy,” Lowe said. “Not only are they disrupting trade flows, but they are also generating considerable uncertainty for many businesses around the world. Worryingly, this uncertainty is leading to investment plans being postponed or reconsidered.”The RBA chief was pressed several times on the potential for unconventional policy. The cash rate is just 1%, a similar level to the Federal Reserve’s when it undertook QE, and New Zealand’s governor said this week it was possible he would have to consider alternative measures after cutting his rate to 1%.Lowe acknowledged that it was possible that the RBA would end up at the zero lower bound and spelled out the measures taken by international counterparts and some of his thoughts on their efficacy. He also provided a snapshot of his thinking about them for Australia.“I think the focus would be on trying to reduce the risk-free interest rate,” Lowe said. “If we reduced the cash rate down to a very low level, it’s possible as circumstances warranted that we could take action to lower the risk-free rates further out along the term spectrum.”(Updates with economist comment in 7th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Chris Bourke.To contact the reporter on this story: Michael Heath in Sydney at mheath1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Malcolm Scott at mscott23@bloomberg.net, ;Nasreen Seria at nseria@bloomberg.net, Edward JohnsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lowe-says-rba-prepared-ease-000529464.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-07	2019-08-07 19:29:04	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	HD Stock Worth Building Something With	The Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is the largest home improvement retailer. HD stock is viewed as an important tell on several marquee economic data points, including consumer-related and housing numbers.Source: Shutterstock Home Depot stock is the second-largest component in the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLY) behind a company called Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, Home Depot is a mature consumer cyclical name. As such, it's not as volatile nor as richly valued as some of the growth-ier names in this sector. HD stock trades for less than 19x forward earnings.Up 21.89% year-to-date, Home Depot stock has been one of the steadier members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a theme that should continue because the company is not one at the epicenter of the trade tensions between the U.S. and China.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast month, Guggenheim analyst Steven Forbes noted of HD stock price &quot;that while the shares might seem pricey after their 2019 run, he thinks that same-store sales will increase in the second half of the year, bolstered by strategic investments in the business, giving the rally fresh legs,&quot; according to Barron's.The company reports earnings on Tuesday, Aug. 20 with analysts expecting earnings of $3.09 per share, up from $3.05 a year earlier. A Winner in a Shifting Retail EnvironmentAs has been widely noted, the retail industry is experiencing a revolution, one that is likely to result in more store closures over the coming years. That doesn't mean all brick-and-mortar stores will disappear, but the trends at a play in the retail space will ensure the physical stores that remain will likely be those of stronger companies. For a variety of reasons, Home Depot will be one of the remainders (and winners) as retail undergoes a major face-lift.&quot;Other catalysts for top-line growth could come from the firm's efficient supply chain, improved merchandising technology, and penetration of adjacent customer product segments (like commercial),&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note. &quot;Expansion of both new (like textiles from the Company Store acquisition) and existing (appliances could grow post-Sears bankruptcy) categories could also drive demand.&quot;Home Depot is also a wide-moat company, meaning it poses significant barriers to entry to would-be rivals. Lowes's (NYSE:LOW) is HD stock's big primary competitor, but it hasn't been much of a competition in terms of price action. Over the past five years, Home Depot stock is up more than 150% while Lowe's is higher by just 100%, according to Bloomberg data.Over that same period, HD stock has beaten XLY by a margin of more than 2-to-1, indicating that it has been one of the best large-cap consumer discretionary names not called Amazon over that span. Bottom Line on HD StockPast performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but Home Depot stock can continue being a long-term winner because of the company's excellence in execution, pricing power, wide moat and resilience in the face of rising online retail sales.&quot;Home improvement retailers remain one of the best-insulated sectors from e-commerce threats, as the high weight/value ratio of many products prohibit cost-effective shipping and the specialized knowledge base employees offer is difficult to replicate,&quot; said Morningstar. &quot;These strengths have helped Home Depot deliver adjusted average returns on invested capital of 31% during the past five years, after the last housing downturn and focusing on its core orange box business.&quot;Yes, Home Depot stock is a tad pricey right now, but if its management can boost margins and return on invested capital, the HD stock price may grow into that valuation, muting the expensive nature of it.Todd Shriber doesn't own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-24	2019-07-24 18:36:57	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	3 Retail Home Suppliers to Trade Now	We're deep into earnings season now, and with that excitement comes heavy scrutiny from bulls and bears. Today, I'd like to look at how this hype might affect the following home improvement stocks: Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Lowes (NYSE:LOW) and Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO).It's no secret the financial media is in the business of keeping the story lines flowing and updating investors as to why Wall Street was acting gloomy or gleeful on a particular day. Uncertainty on interest rate policy and the U.S.-China trade war have been popular topics. And it's understandable why battling with China and interest rates matter to big box retail suppliers HD, LOW and TSCO stock.For one, there is a whole lot of &quot;Made in China&quot; going on in Home Depot and its peers. As well, financing and whether we're willing to even think about that latest home project goes hand-in-hand with what's happening with interest rates. But it's not the only thing making Home Depot and its peers move on any given day.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow and with earnings season in full swing, the attention has shifted to the latest and greatest or maybe less-than-great earnings reports such as Caterpillar's (NYSE:CAT) ugly earnings miss. And as with those broader uncertainties, this type of information is bound to be projected onto the likes of HD, LOW and TSCO stock. I get it.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 And as Wall Street's collective fears and cheers get priced into these retail supply stores, the price charts suggest it's time to ring the register in HD and LOW stock and continue shopping at TSCO. Here's more about each. Home Depot (HD)  Click to EnlargeHome Depot shares have enjoyed an incredible bull market since the financial crisis. As they say though, all good things must come to an end. And that could very soon be the case with HD stock.Right now Home Depot stock's monthly chart is establishing a broadening top pattern. It's bearish, but even more so given the rally in shares, as well as a fairly bearish-looking stochastics set-up that's supporting lower prices in the weeks and months ahead.HD Stock Strategy: For shorting HD stock, I'd recommend waiting until next week. The July candle in shares is shaping to complete as a doji pivot high within the broadening pattern. By waiting until August, this bearish entry can receive a bit more price confirmation than otherwise.I'd look to the pattern low near $140 for a downside target and use a breach of a fully formed July candlestick for containing upside risk. Lowes (LOW)  Click to EnlargeLowes is yet another name where investors who are long shares should take profits or consider shorting the stock. The writing isn't entirely on the wall for LOW stock. Still, a weakening monthly up-channel where shares failed at the pattern's mid-line and a canary-like stochastics set-up suggest a larger bearish correction is on its way.LOW Stock Strategy: For shorting LOW stock, I'd also suggest waiting until next week and let July run its course. With shares forming a bearish shooting star doji on the monthly chart, confirmation to short LOW is likely to occur early next month.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund I'd recommend using a stop-loss above the high of the doji to contain risk and not overstay the position in the event the up-channel isn't finished. Tractor Supply (TSCO)  Click to EnlargeNot that I'm saving the best for last, but retail improvement outfit Tractor Supply does have a lot going for it. As the smallest of the discussed supplies chains, TSCO stock logically has the largest opportunity for future out-sized growth if it can move into untapped markets or penetrate existing markets further.There are no guarantees TSCO stock will live up to this potential. Still, the basic law of large numbers does afford Tractor Supply more room to grow than HD stock or Lowes. And of the three chains, TSCO is the only price chart whose shares are powering higher out of a durable and constructive-looking corrective base.TSCO Stock Strategy: Go long TSCO stock today. With earnings slated for tomorrow, I'm estimating a solid technical catalyst already in motion. And with room to rally, it will have some of its own headline-driven assistance as support.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

Meanwhile,  the valuation of Home Depot stock remains higher than the valuation of Lowe's shares. Falling interest rates could boost the prospects of both HD stock and Lowe's stock. While I do not think current investors should sell HD stock, Lowe's appears better-positioned for the near-term.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund  Home Depot, Lowe's Battle for GrowthMuch as analysts frequently compare Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to Target (NYSE:TGT), it's difficult to discuss Home Depot stock without comparing it to Lowe's stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHD stock still appears to be outperforming Lowe's stock. The current Home Depot stock price stands at around $212 per share. That represents an increase of almost 35% from the lows of last December. During the same period,  LOW stock has climbed by about 24%.However,  Lowe's profits appear to be increasing faster than Home Depot's at this point. This year, analysts, on average,  expect HD's earnings to rise 2.3%, compared to a 9.2% increase for Lowe's. Both companies' profit growth should accelerate next year. Still, over the two-year period,  Lowe's profits are expected to rise 18.3% versus an 8.8% gain for Home Depot.Moreover, based on the stocks' forward price-earnings (PE) ratio, Home Depot stock appears slightly more expensive. Currently, HD trades at about 19.4 times analysts' average forward earnings estimate, while Lowe's forward PE ratio comes in at around 15.6. Dividends, Interest Rates Keep HD Stock a HoldStill, the dividends of Home Depot stock continue to be more attractive than those of Lowe's. The annual payout of HD stock has reached $5.44 per share, taking its yield to around 2.55%, ahead of Lowe's current 2.15% return. The dividend of HD stock has also risen for six straight years, making its dividend quite stable and dependable.HD stock's dividend may now be the best reason to own Home Depot stock as the company settles into slow-growth mode. HD operates 2,290 stores across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. While that constitutes a massive footprint, it is only six more stores than last year and 50 more than in 2008.In terms of home-improvement stores, the North American market has become saturated. Lowe's failed in its attempt to expand into Australia earlier in the decade. As a result, both HD and Lowe's seem reluctant to consider opening new stores outside of North America.Nonetheless, the market cap of HD stock has risen from just over $24 billion in October 2008 to over $234 billion today. Given this increase, I would encourage the long-term owners of HD stock to hold onto their shares. The company has managed to increase its profits and dividends without opening too many stores. Although HD's profit growth is decelerating this year, analysts think its profits will continue to rise.Moreover, interest rates have fallen substantially in recent months. That could help reignite the housing market, which has plateaued this year. It may also encourage more consumers to remodel their homes. Lower borrowing costs could also provide the needed incentive for the current owners of Home Depot stock to stay the course. The Bottom Line on Home Depot StockConsidering the valuation of HD stock and its gains since 2008, investors have little reason to either buy or sell this equity. Over the past 11 years, HD stock has risen by almost ten-fold on negligible store growth. This speaks to the strength of this company.However, archrival Lowe's profits are now growing more quickly. Moreover, on a forward basis, LOW stock trades at a discount to HD stock. In an environment of falling interest rates, I expect Home Depot stock to hold its own. However, in the near term, I do not expect Home Depot stock to outperform Lowe's stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-07-15	2019-07-15 12:36:26	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	3 Big Stock Charts for Monday: Lowe’s, Netflix and Edison International	The market logged its fourth straight day of gains on Friday, fighting its way a little deeper into record-high territory for the last three. It all feels a bit artificial, but it's not a train anybody dare risk jumping in front of.Source: Shutterstock Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) did more than its fair share of heavy lifting, up nearly 2% after the Federal Trade Commission settled its anti-privacy claim against the company for an affordable $5 billion. More importantly, the settlement puts the nagging matter in the past. Infosys (NYSE:INFY) logged the best gain for the day, however, up more than 6% in response to an impressive first quarter.Weighing the market down more than any other name was Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Shares of the healthcare company fell 4% on new accusations that it knowingly lied about the cancer risks related to its talc products. It has prompted a criminal probe.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks Driving the Market to All-Time Highs (And Why) As the new week's trading action gets going, however, its the stock charts of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) and Edison International (NYSE:EIX) that merit the closest looks. Here's what's most noteworthy about each. Edison International (EIX)Like most other utility names, Edison International investors enjoyed a fruitful June. Unlike most utility stocks, however, EIX has continued to charge higher in July, avoiding the slowdown that has adversely impacted other names in the business.Shares have finally hit a headwind at fairly well-established technical resistance. And, they're now officially overbought. If traders can pull off a miracle and continue to march higher, however, there's little left to hold the move back until much, much higher.  Click to Enlarge  * The ceiling in question is right around $71, marked in yellow on both stock charts. That's where Edison peaked in October, and where it stopped advancing last week.  * Still, the volume behind the recent rally has been abnormally high. It has been induced by headlines related to last year's wildfires in California, but there's a horde of buyers amassing all the same.  * Should EIX manage to break out, there's not another established technical ceiling in place until 2017's highs near $82. Lowe's (LOW)The recent rally from Lowe's is a rather significant, given it has only been in place since late May. Shares are up 16% in just that eight-week stretch. There's room and reason for LOW to continue moving higher, however. In fact, it's more likely to do that -- in spades -- than not.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond   Click to Enlarge  * It's apparent on the daily chart, though more so on the weekly chart, that the rebound was prompted by an encounter with a rising support line that extends back to 2017's low.  * The same weekly chart also illustrates where the most likely upside targets are. There's a horizontal ceiling near $118, marked in red, then there's the upper boundary of the rising trading channel.  * Although the past couple of months have looked and felt overly bullish, the advance is still in its infancy. We don't yet have a MACD crossover on the weekly chart, and we're nowhere near close to being stochastically overbought. Netflix (NFLX)A month and a half ago, Netflix was on the verge of a serious meltdown. A horizontal floor was crumbling, and the 200-day moving average line (plotted in white on both stock charts) was under attack as support. And, both were happening right after NFLX bumped into a horizontal ceiling, plotted as a white dashed line on both stock charts.The stock ended up evading disaster, pushing up and off the 200-day moving average line after all. But, last week, that technical ceiling once again came back into play. It not only capped the rebound effort, but appears to have rekindled the selling.  Click to Enlarge  * Friday's 1.9% slide was not only a pullback on a day the overall market tide was bullish, it took shape on a suspiciously high level of volume -- particularly for a Friday.  * The previous technical floors are still floors. That's the horizontal floor at $342.20, plotted in yellow, and the 200-day moving average line currently at $338.17.  * The narrow trading range is well established. Having been in place for a while, any break outside of it could set up a prolonged move to make up for lost time as pent-up action is unleashed.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-09	2019-07-09 14:20:38	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	China Is Short-Term Trouble for Walmart Stock, but It’s a Great Name to Hold	By all accounts, one of the biggest and most surprising winners this year is Walmart (NYSE:WMT). On the surface, a brick-and-mortars retailer should have no business doing so well in the era of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, a doubter just needs to consult the Walmart stock price. At just under $112, shares have gained over 23% year-to-date.Source: Shutterstock In doing so, Walmart proved one thing: a physical retailer can not only survive the ecommerce onslaught, but they can thrive as well. If you broaden your horizons, WMT stock is emblematic of pockets of resistance in the retail segment. For instance, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and to a lesser extent Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) have performed well over the years.Naturally, the question is, why? The easy answer (and the best one, in my opinion) is that certain retailers are insulated from ecommerce. I believe most folks buying power tools or renovation materials want to see the products in person before purchasing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLogically, the same principle applies to groceries. With WMT being the one-stop-shop, this sentiment benefits Walmart stock.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 Additionally, a convenience factor bolsters the case for WMT stock. Currently, ecommerce companies and the online channels for major retailers are battling over shipping times. For instance, a few months back, Walmart introduced free one-day shipping on orders of $35 or more. That move directly counters Amazon's robust shipping offerings, but with one major difference: Amazon requires a costly $119 annual membership, while Walmart does not.As a result, the big-box retailing giant appears poised to deliver the goods, figuratively and literally. However, an old headwind may come back to strike Walmart stock: China. Trade War and Walmart StockBefore we dive into the reasons why the U.S.-China trade war poses problems for WMT stock, let me say this: I'm confident in the company's longer-term outlook. No matter how prevalent ecommerce becomes, there likely will always be a place for the brick-and-mortars.That said, the Walmart stock price has historically gained on the big-box retailer's primary business narrative: selling tons of products at everyday low prices.Thanks to Amazon, that focus has expanded to include online retail channels. Although a smart move, it has stretched Walmart thin. Thus, a poor outcome for future U.S.-China negotiations could hurt WMT.And here's why I'm bringing up this concern. From 2007 through the end of 2015, Walmart's average net margin measured 3.44%. But from 2016 onward, profit margins slipped to 2.21%. The noticeable slip coincided with Walmart's aggressive push to compete directly with Amazon. For example, Walmart announced its intentions to acquire Jet.com on August 2016.  Click to EnlargeIn the following year, Walmart introduced free two-day shipping. It also acquired several companies to bolster its online presence. To be fair, these moves have largely served to jumpstart the Walmart stock price. However, you also can't deny that these same moves are costly; hence, the declining margins.So far, management has a freebie for the pricey strategies because Walmart is a volume king. But should the trade war drag on, management has two choices: protect margins or protect volume. They've indicated the former choice, as have most other affected companies.However, that's not an easy choice for WMT stock because Walmart's shoppers aren't exactly high-rollers. Increased prices will negatively impact volume. In turn, that could put pressure on a company unaccustomed to big threats. How to Approach WMT StockIf you're a buy-and-holder, I think you should be concerned but not alarmed. Certainly, a trade war with the world's second-largest economy is always a concern for a retail investment like Walmart stock. At the same time, you can trust this leadership team to guide the company out of trouble, similar to what they did with the ecommerce threat.On the flipside, if you're a trader, I think it makes sense to trim some holdings here. Since the beginning of June, WMT stock has gained nearly 10%. That's a pretty strong number for a blue-chip company. And it's also surprising against a major geopolitical headwind that has not yet found resolution.Because it's important to know that the U.S. and China have only agreed to a truce at the G20 summit. That means a temporary hold on ramping up additional tariffs; the respite does not involve removing existing ones.But China has recently stated that they will only go to the negotiating table once all tariffs have been removed. That's a tough statement, and if President Trump agrees to it, it's not clear how that would hold China accountable for intellectual property theft.Therefore, whatever concerns Walmart had before the G20 summit remains unfortunately valid. That's the single but biggest hold up on me going fully bullish on Walmart stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-20	2019-06-20 19:27:26	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Best ETFs for 2019: iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF Still Has a Chance	Editor's note: This article is a part of InvestorPlace.com's Best ETFs for 2019 contest. Vince Martin's pick for the contest is the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB).Heading into 2019, the case for the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB) was reasonably simple. Pretty much anything housing-related had been sold off big in 2018. In fact, ITB stock fell some 31% for the year. Yet the economy still seemed strong. Broad markets, even with a rough Q4, were in decent shape. Economically sensitive housing-related stocks were plunging despite the news simply being not that bad.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat divergence was why I named ITB as my pick for the Best ETFs of 2019 contest. So far, it has been a solid choice, with the ITB ETF gaining 29% year-to-date against a 17% rise in the S&P 500. Homebuilder stocks have risen, as have most of the industry's retailers and many of its suppliers.But at this point, the case for ITB gets a little thinner. After the first quarter, the fund had returned 16%, but that was only modestly better than low double-digit gains in most broad market indices. And so I made the case in late March that ITB still had some catching up to do.Three months later, ITB hasn't completely caught up. Since the beginning of 2018, the fund remains negative against an ~10% gain for the S&P 500. But the gap certainly has closed. As such, this ETF will need some outside help if it's going to keep rising.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever  The Case Against ITB as One of the Best ETFsUp 29% YTD, it certainly seems like the easy money has been made here. That seems particularly true looking at the fund's key holdings: 27% of assets are in the country's two largest homebuilders, D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) and Lennar (NYSE:LEN).Both stocks have rallied sharply this year (+29% for DHI, +33% for LEN), driving a good chunk of the fund's gains. Another 40% of the fund owns smaller homebuilders -- most of which have followed similar patterns. Most of the group is below their highs, but many have at least returned to 2018 trading levels.Home Depot (NYSE:HD) has gained nicely, and is threatening a new all-time high. Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) has underperformed, but is still positive. In December, ITB was a case of buying a group of stocks at or near the lows. That's not the argument anymore.Now, ITB needs at least a few components to break out from the highs -- and not just rebound off the lows. That might be tough. Tariffs are pressuring margins in the space. Trade war concerns are affecting the macroeconomic outlook. There's still a belief that a downturn in the U.S. has to be on the way at some point, as we head into year eleven of the economic expansion. Homebuilder stocks, in particular, likely would take a big hit.At this point, risks are rising and valuations aren't as cheap. That's a combination that suggests, at the least, that ITB's appreciation is going to slow in the second half. The Case for the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETFFor market and macro bulls, however, ITB still looks like a solid pick. The ETF remains about 15% below early 2018 highs. With some help from lower interest rates, which would lower mortgage costs, and economic strength, it could re-take those highs, suggesting another 20% or so in upside.From a longer-term standpoint, the ETF still sits below where it traded back in 2006. ITB started trading on May 1st of that year. The housing crisis followed, and in less than three years, 85% of its value had been wiped out. It has been a long climb back from those lows, but if the economy cooperates, that climb can continue.  * 7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for a Noisy Market That's the key point, though: if the economy cooperates. To even consider ITB at this point, an investor truly has to trust both the economy and the broad market. If trade war concerns ease and/or if strong U.S. job and macro growth continues, ITB will keep rising. And, in that scenario, the ETF likely will outperform broad markets in the second half, just as it did in the first.But this is a different argument than it was six months ago. Then, the ETF looked like it was pricing in an almost-certain recession. That's just not the case anymore. For macro bulls, the ITB ETF is a way to get leveraged upside on more good economic news ahead. But it's not as cheap, or attractive, as it was six months ago.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-16	2019-06-16 14:45:00	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Is it Time to Buy Home Depot?	The leader in the professional and DIY home renovation and repair supply niches, Home Depot, Inc. (HD), has long been considered a steady, reliable stock. In today’s market environment – with President Trump’s aggressive trade policy and the opposition Democratic Party’s increasingly anti-business and anti-wealth policy stance – those are the very traits that may make HD an ever more attractive stock.The share price has, long-term, reflected that reliability. In the last five years, it has showed a slow and steady increase, capped by a 12% gain in recent weeks after last month’s market sell-off. The Underlying StrengthsHome Depot is the largest home improvement retailer in the US, with over $108 billion in annual revenue (nearly 50% more than its closest rival, Lowe’s [LOW]). HD is widely recognized as a leader in the contract supply industry, and in recent months, the company has seen a steep increase in its tool rental business – a segment directly primarily at professional builders. According to company CEO Craig Menear, “We know 90% of pros rent tools, but several years ago, only about one out of 10 pros rented from us. Today, that number has improved to one out of four, yet there remains opportunity for further growth as we continue to invest in our tool rental experience.”Increase in tool rental helped push the company’s Q1 results to a 5.7% increase in net sales year-over-year (at $26.4 billion for the quarter), and 9.1% year-over-year increase in EPS (to $2.27). Net sales were in-line with expectations, while the EPS was a significant 4% beat of the forecast. A miss in same-store comparable sales was attributed to unusually wet weather nationwide during the quarter, which put a damper on construction activities.Financial blogger Luke Longo (Track Record & Ratings) finds additional reason for optimism in the current state of the employment and housing sectors. Specifically, he sees “record low unemployment, a healthy job participation rate, and decade-high wage growth” interacting with lower mortgage rates to create “support for a healthy housing market.” As long as these factors remain, he says, “Home Depot will continue to report solid numbers, and HD stock will trend higher.” Looking ForwardWhile HD’s management sees a solid foundation for the company now, they are preparing for the future. The company is confident enough to issue additional debt, locking in low rates in an effort to keep its large debt total affordable. While a somewhat risky move, it drew approval from five-star Guggenheim analyst Steven Forbes (Track Record & Ratings), who said, “HD raised $400 million more than we assumed, providing the company with greater near-term financial flexibility.&quot;Forbes went on to comment about the company’s overall state and performance potential: “With no change to our interest expense outlook, we are maintaining our 2019 EPS estimate of $10.12 while reiterating our BUY rating and $215 price target. Bottom line, we continue to envision share price outperformance as we move through 2019 driven mainly by our conviction in HD's &quot;Core&quot; expense (business-as-usual) leverage…” His $215 price target suggests a modest 4.5% upside to the stock.Also taking an upbeat line on HD is Stifel’s John Baugh (Track Record & Ratings). He agrees with the company on the overall business landscape, pointing out that a combination of weather and deflation artificially depressed same-store comps during Q1. For prospects going forward, Baugh says, “Management is optimistic on the macroeconomic environment and does not see any impact from SALT (state and local tax deduction changes), home price appreciation slowing, or weak housing turnover.” In other words, no matter what happens, people still need to maintain their homes. Baugh raised his price target on HD by 5%, to $210. At the time he set that target, on May 22, it indicated a potential 22% upside. The Bottom LineHome Depot offers investors a firm business model in a niche that customers will always need. The company has a growing professional customer base, and a comfortable lead over its competition. The situation is neatly summed up by another financial blogger, Matthew Cochrane (Track Record & Ratings), who writes, “When one takes a longer view, though, it becomes clear that this home-improvement retail giant is on the correct side of several trends and has made the right investments to stay on top of potential e-commerce competitive threats as well as its primary rival, Lowe's Companies.”A look at HD’s analyst consensus confirms the general view: the stock has a ‘Moderate Buy’ ratings, based on 10 buys and 4 holds assigned over the past three months. The average price target, $207, suggests a 1% upside to the current share price of $205. Given the company’s solid quarterly results, expect that upside to adjust slightly higher in coming weeks.View HD Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-buy-home-depot-144500918.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-06-16	2019-06-16 10:17:45	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	5 Top Stocks to Protect Your Portfolio	The voices are growing louder that the US economy is starting to sputter. From Morgan Stanley, stock strategist Michael Wilson said last month, “Recent data points suggest US earnings and economic risk is greater than most investors may think,” and the May jobs report, released on June 7, backed him up. The numbers were grim, with only 75,000 new jobs reported for the month, and the previous two months revised down by an equal amount. Other data has shown a slowdown in the services sector, and a nine-year low in manufacturing activity.The data is starting to point towards trouble, but the real problem with protecting your portfolio in a downturn lies in the lagging definition of a recession: two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. Given that growth data is typically reported one month after the fact, this means that investors will always be 4 to 7 months late in taking protective measures. So, let’s be proactive about this, and take a look at TipRanks’ database to find some reliable stocks for defensive investing. These are not necessarily “classic” defensive stocks; rather, these companies have shown by recent performance that they can deliver profits even in a downturn.  Apple, Inc. (AAPL)First on our list today is Apple, partly because these days it seems you just can’t build a portfolio without a tech giant but mostly because Apple has proven both its long-term reliability and its short-term resiliency. For the long term, Apple is up 130% in the last five years, while in the short haul the company recovered well from the Q4 2018 downturn and has already made up more than half the losses from last month’s market swoon.More importantly, Apple has also shown that it can adapt and change. Steve Jobs’ unique vision underlay his company’s growth in the early 2000s, and his death in 2011 prompted fears that his successor, Tim Cook, would not fill his shoes and the company would stagnate. It is fair to say that events of the past three quarters have laid that fear to rest. While Cook is not Jobs, he hasn’t needed to be – he took over a mature company with established niches and a growing customer base. He has shown himself fully capable of meeting the challenges the market has posed.Cook met last year’s market dip head-on. He admitted that Apple’s core iPhone sales were not going to fully recover, and orchestrated a plan to meet the changing conditions by shifting the sales focus to Services, reconciling iPhone to a longer replacement cycle, and promoting the iPad, iMac, and Macbook lines. Under all of this, helping to ensure success, is the near-billion strong loyal customer base that the company has built over the past decade.So, Apple has the solid foundation that every defensive stock needs. Looking forward, the company made a favorable impression on market analysts earlier this month at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Kathryn Huberty (Track Record & Ratings) of Morgan Stanley said after Apple’s presentation, “After (Monday’s) announcements, we believe Apple Watch and Mac will more meaningfully contribute to App Store growth, while further solidifying Apple as the most attractive platform for app developers.” Noting the company’s commitment to increasing its Services sector, she added, “Apple's top growth opportunity is driving increased user engagement with apps.” Huberty gives Apple a buy rating with a $231 price target, seeing an upside of 19%.Piper Jaffray’s Michael Olson (Track Record & Ratings) also gives Apple high ratings. Peering into the future of iPhone, he notes that 20% of current owners are interested in upgrading to 5G, and says, “Interest in 5G will only grow from here, so this is a favorable early sign that 5G is viewed as a key feature… we believe that as long as services revenue continues to perform well, it will tide many investors over until anticipation for 5G iPhones intensifies.” His price target on AAPL, $230, also suggests an 19% upside.The analyst consensus on AAPL shares is a ‘Moderate Buy,’ based on 19 buy ratings, 16 holds, 2 sells given over the last three months. Shares are trading at $192, so the $212 average price target indicates an upside of 10%.View AAPL Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)This one is a traditional defensive stock, and it has a reputation for being a bit staid, but don’t let that fool you: Johnson & Johnson offers real value, consistently delivering on both dividend and long-term equity growth. Both are markers of a strong defensive play.The company’s current dividend yield is 2.72%, which may seem small, but at current share prices it equates to an annual payout of $3.80. Better than the actual dividend payment, however, is JNJ’s dividend history. The company has been paying, and steadily increasing, its dividend since the early 1970s. This policy of consistently rewarding shareholders provides a steady source of income for investors, and also encourages them to reinvest that income in the company. It’s a win-win policy.As a long-term investment, JNJ has, like Apple, proven its worth. The stock has gained 56% in the last 5 years, and shows a 9% gain over the past 12 months. And also like Apple, JNJ has proven resilient in the face of adversity: last December, the stock took a hard hit from bad press related to the widely reported talcum powder recall, but has since regained most of that loss. In another example of corporate resiliency, JNJ was recently given a buy rating with a $157 price target by five-star analyst Joanne Wuensch (Track Record & Ratings) of BMO Capital, after she reviewed the status of current legal action the company faced in the state of Oklahoma in regard to the opioid abuse epidemic. Wuensch notes that the case will likely be resolved quickly, and points out, “Litigation is a common occurrence in the health care sector that takes significant time to resolve, and often headlines are worse than reality.” Her price target indicates confidence in the stock, and a 12% upside.Johnson & Johnson’s success rests on two separate bases. The first, and most widely recognized, is the company’s array of popular consumer brands. JNJ is the producer of Band-Aids, Listerine, and Tylenol, to name just a few. Consumer products provide a respectable 16.7% of annual revenue (nearly $14 billion), but the real money for JNJ lies in pharmaceuticals. To put it in perspective, two drugs – Remicade and Simponi – account for 11.3% of the company’s total revenues, two-thirds as much as all of the consumer products.Unlike many large-scale drug producers, Johnson & Johnson is not deeply exposed to payment issues with the Medicare and Medicaid systems. This is important for investors, as both programs have reputations for underpaying, and with an election year coming up both programs are likely to become political footballs as candidates promise ever more benefits. This is a key point noted by Terence Flynn (Track Record & Ratings). Writing for Goldman Sachs, Flynn says, “The company has the lowest exposure to Medicare/Medicaid within the group. As a result, the stock will be less impacted by potential drug pricing headlines/policy proposals ahead of the 2020 presidential election.” Flynn sets a price target of $163 for JNJ, suggesting an upside of 16%.JNJ’s consensus rating of ‘Moderate Buy’ is derived from 7 buy and 5 hold reviews. The stock’s $149 average price target and $140 share price equate to an upside potential of 7%.View JNJ Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail McDonald’s Corporation (MCD)Fast food burgers might not come immediately to mind when you hear the phrase ‘Return on Investment,’ but McDonald’s has been delivering more than just quick eats. The company has gained an impressive 16% so far this year, rising from $176 on January 2 to a closing price of $205 on June 14. Even more impressive, between May 3 and June 3, while the S&P 500 was slipping 6.8%, MCD shares were gaining 1.2%.It’s all part of a steady-growth story going back to May of 2015, when current CEO Steve Easterbrook took over. McD’s had just posted its first sales decline in more than a decade, and the new chief’s mandate was simple: refresh a stale brand. His ‘Turnaround Plan’ got the company back to basics, emphasizing fresher, higher quality ingredients; a streamlined menu; and physical rebuilding efforts in the company’s aging franchise locations. Through it all, McDonald’s has maintained its high dividend; the payout is now $4.64 annually, for a yield of 2.26%.The market’s analysts agree that MCD is on a stable upward path. Writing at BTIG, Peter Saleh (Track Record & Ratings) says, “The company's menu strategy shift has boosted comps. Expect the increased menu focus on bundles and full price items – and away from deep discounts - to drive higher U.S. average check for the next couple of quarters.” Saleh boosted his price target to $220 on MCD, suggesting an upside of 7%.Saleh’s not alone. Weighing in from Merrill Lynch last week, Gregory Francfort (Track Record & Ratings) sees “2Q-4Q same-store sales (including 3.9%-4.2% for the U.S.) looking conservative with more upside potential than downside risk.” Like Saleh, he gives MCD a $220 price target.Overall, MCD has a ‘Moderate Buy’ consensus based on 19 analyst ratings given in the last three months, including 14 buys and 5 holds. The stock sells for $205 as of June 14, and the average price target of $216 indicates an upside potential of 5.5%.View MCD Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW)If the US economy does turn down to recession, Lowe’s is in an excellent position to take advantage of the changed conditions. The do-it-yourself home improvement supplier operates on the big-box model, using bulk to offer discounts on the products and services that, in bad times, homeowners are more likely to handle as DIY.This puts Lowe’s strength as a defensive play is in its niche – the stores offer products that most people need, at discounts that grow more attractive in a downturn. Home maintenance won’t stop for a recession, and DIY really is a good way to save money. In addition, Lowe’s has maintained its lucrative contractor business.And now we get to the weakness in this stock. Lowe’s is the second largest home improvement superstore, after Home Depot (HD), and the company is having trouble boosting revenues and earnings against its larger competition. LOW shares have been on a roller coaster ride for the last 18 months, although they are up nearly 8% year-to-date. On an operational level, Lowe’s has had difficulty executing online sales strategy and home delivery, and managing inventory control. Both are putting serious drag on the bottom line, and holding down revenue growth.Pushing back is CEO Marvin Ellison, who took over in July of last year. He has marked both online sales and inventory control as key parts of a turnaround effort to improve the company’s sales and revenue growth. Early assessments of Ellison’s success are guardedly optimistic; LOW did beat sales and revenue expectations in its most recent quarterly report, although EPS missed by 8%. As Keith Hughes (Track Record & Ratings), of SunTrust Robinson points out, “The recovery will not be a &quot;quick story&quot;, even though we are positive on the re-set of expectations and maintain that the 10% projected earnings growth this year still tops Home Depot's (HD) expected flat growth.” Hughes sets a $120 price target on LOW, suggesting an upside of 20%.UBS analyst Michael Lasser (Track Record & Ratings) also sets a buy rating on LOW, with an upbeat $115 target and 15% upside. He writes, “The risk-reward ration on the stock is attractive.”On consensus, Lowe’s keeps a ‘Strong Buy’ rating, based on the 14 buys and 4 holds given in the past three months. While the company faces headwinds, it holds a strong position in a valuable niche, and is widely perceived as facing its difficulties effectively. Of the stocks in this article, LOW offers the best upside potential, at 16%, based on the $99 share price and $115 average price target.View LOW Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Walmart, Inc. (WMT)Like Lowe’s, Walmart gains its defensive-stock status from its business model. The king of brick-and-mortar retailers offers discount customers the ultimate in one-stop shopping, putting everything that consumers could want or need under one roof, from baby diapers to daily groceries to minor car repairs. Really, there’s nothing you can’t get at Walmart and that fact has made it the world’s largest company by revenue and the world’s largest private employer.Walmart’s biggest competition comes from Amazon.com (AMZN), but it is more of a whale and elephant story than a cage match. Each company is dominant in its own domain, and each has faced challenges trying to expand on the other’s territory. Walmart may have found a way to leverage its existing stores for an online advantage – rather than offer home delivery (an area in which Amazon already excels), Walmart offers online purchasers an option to pick up their merchandise at the nearest Walmart location. This is a viable alternative, since according to some estimates everyone in the US lives within 10 miles of a Walmart store.As a defensive play, Walmart’s greatest advantage is the pedestrian nature of its business. Everyone needs the products they offer, and in hard times, Walmart’s famously low prices will simply look more attractive. Writing after WMT reported FY20 Q1 earnings, Raymond James’ Budd Bugatch (Track Record & Ratings) said, “Investors should be most encouraged by the U.S. segment, which showed a 5.5 percent year-over-year increase in operating income to $4.1 billion. The business saw strength from a favorable sales mix while e-commerce margins came in better than management's own expectations.” While he believes the company is on firm footing, his price target, at $110, suggests only a modest 1% upside.Guggenheim’s Robert Drbul (Track Record & Ratings) sums up Walmart’s case quite well in his recent research note: “We believe the business remains quite healthy, with solid physical/digital results in recent quarters… We continue to believe WMT’s resources uniquely position it to successfully evolve in an ever-changing retail environment. While trade concerns/tariffs may create quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, we believe the management team will astutely navigate any changes.” Drbul maintained a $115, which indicates a 5.5% upside from current levels.On average, WMT shares have a price target of $113, which gives an upside of 4.5% from the share price of $109. The analyst consensus of ‘Moderate Buy’ is based on 8 buys, 2 holds, and 1 sell set in the last three months.View WMT Price Target & Analyst Ratings DetailYou can learn more about these stocks using TipRanks Stock Comparison tool.

2019-06-13	2019-06-13 11:50:14	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Nelson Peltz Likes the Look of American Plumbing	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Nelson Peltz’s latest investment target is a big, slow-moving target with a massive bullseye on its back. The renowned U.S. activist has zoned in on Ferguson Plc, a plumbers’ merchant formerly known as Wolseley. His gripe is that the company trades at a stubborn discount to American peers. The snag is that remedies aren’t easy to administer.Ferguson is among the handful of U.K.-domiciled, London-listed blue-chips that aren’t really British companies. Some – such as BTG Plc or Firstgroup Plc – have already attracted takeover or activist interest. North America generates 87% of Ferguson’s revenue; the company recently changed its name to that of its U.S. subsidiary; it reports in dollars.The one un-American characteristic is the valuation. Ferguson has traded at a consistent discount to U.S. peers such as Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos Inc. The obvious explanation is that the company is listed on the wrong exchange, which makes it harder to attract its natural investor base. But that’s not the only interpretation. The valuation may also reflect a lack of faith in Ferguson’s strategy or management, or some challenges unique to its business. Either way, the discount slightly narrowed on Thursday after the disclosure that various Peltz funds had amassed a 6% stake. This pushed the stock up 6%, valuing the group at 13 billion pounds ($16 billion).It is hard to know whether Ferguson would get a higher valuation if it just moved its listing. Markets may not be 100% efficient, but capital is global and location can’t be the only explanation for the lack of investor love here. True, some funds are restricted geographically in where they can put money but that’s unlikely to be a huge factor in holding back demand for Ferguson shares.Such restrictions on funds might, though, be an obstacle to engineering a move for Ferguson. Unilever Plc’s plan to simplify its Anglo-Dutch structure into a single Netherlands company would have seen it lose its spot on the FTSE 100. That irked index investors and those with mandates to hold U.K. stocks who would have been forced to sell their shares. The plan foundered.Unilever wasn’t a one-off. Re-domiciling headquarters or listings has long been controversial. The textbook case is the thwarted migration of car parts maker LucasVarity back in the late 1990s from the U.K. to the U.S. For these changes, existing investors generally demand a premium. The cleanest way to achieve a move is to take the company private, then relist it.More pertinent are worries about the company’s resilience in the face of a U.S. slowdown. U.S. organic growth is slowing from a recent high single-digit percentage clip, while margins have barely improved since 2015, UBS analysts point out. The share price seems to be assuming that Ferguson’s long-run sustainable operating margin is just 5%, according to independent research provider Willis Welby, which argues that this is overly pessimistic.Peltz’s pitch is that he likes to engage with the management of his portfolio companies. Ferguson has responded diplomatically that it looks forward to dialogue, as it does with all shareholders. The mere presence of such a big name has got people excited. The tougher job will be convincing investors that the company’s equity story – twinning organic growth with a strategy of acquiring competitors – is still a winner. That case has yet to be made.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

2019-06-10	2019-06-10 15:55:17	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	3 Stocks That Can’t Escape the Bears’ Crosshairs	With stocks flying high on the heels of a Mexico-U.S. trade deal, bullish picks are likely multiplying across the web. But we're going to take the road less traveled with today's gallery by focusing on stocks to sell. The reasons are simple.First, active traders who desire to increase their quantity of trades must of necessity play the bullish and bearish side of the market. Otherwise, you end up with way too much exposure creating large fluctuations in your account value. Just think about someone who was swinging 15 bearish trades and no bullish ones last week when the market rallied five-days in a row. Ouch! By diversifying strategies you can trade more but have less risk.Second, last week's runup may have turned some trends higher but many remain bearish. The rally simply returned them to resistance creating compelling short setups.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy Under $10 Let's take a closer look at three stocks to sell. Canopy Growth Corp (CGC)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Pot stocks lost their mojo last month, and Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) wasn't immune to the fall. CGC fell below its 200-day moving average for the first time in six months. Its descent has been long enough to reverse the 20-day and 50-day moving averages lower. Last week's rebound returned CGC stock to potential resistance, setting up a classic swing sell pattern.The only question is whether it will trigger. This morning's 3.7% rally is extending last week's gains, so I suggest waiting until the stock breaks a prior day's low before deploying bear trades.For now, I like using today's low of $42.61 as the trigger. If we take it out, then consider buying Aug $45 puts. A break above $46 would cause me to change my tune. Lyft (LYFT)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim The Uber (NYSE:UBER) IPO breathed new life into LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) shares last month. Since bottoming at $47.17, LYFT stock has rebounded 27%. And while I'm open to the possibility of continued strength in the stock, overhead resistance at $63 has me eyeing a bearish trade here.The risk, if wrong, is minimal. And the potential reward is substantial if LYFT rolls over. For the first target, you can use the closest support pivot at $54. After that, $50 comes into play. Consider using a break of Friday's low at $59.21 as your trigger.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets For strategy selection, I like the Oct $60/$50 bear put spread, which currently costs $5.30. Lowes (LOW)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Out of today's selection of stocks to sell, Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) has the cleanest swing sell setup. Its share price was slammed after disappointing the Street with last month's earnings announcement. The high volume swoon carried LOW stock to a fresh three-month low. Since then, we've seen an oversold bounce returning LOW to a horizontal resistance zone and its descending 20-day moving average.While the rebound may continue for a day or two yet, this price zone is an area to watch closely for sellers to emerge. For now, use Friday's low ($96.70) as the trigger for bearish plays.The Oct $95/$90 bear put spread costs $1.80 and offers a low risk way to capitalize on the next downswing.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-29	2019-05-29 16:40:15	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	7 Stocks to Sell After Earnings Destroyed Their Long-Term Stories	Investors sometimes complain about quarterly earnings. The argument is that the short-term focus on three-month periods forces publicly traded companies to lose their long-term focus. Decision-making is impaired as companies try to beat Wall Street estimates for each quarter instead of taking the long view. This can turn once-solid companies into stocks to sell over time.In this market, the &quot;short-termism&quot; argument falls a bit flat. The likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been rewarded by investors for investing in the near term to increase long-term profits.Still, it's true that investors can overreact to a single quarter. A modest earnings beat or a few million dollars in extra sale don't always change the long-term investment case. At the same time, sometimes a quarter matters. Sometimes, performance over three months can change the story for years to come.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June For these seven companies, recent earnings reports mattered -- and that's not good news. These aren't necessarily the seven stocks that fell the most after earnings. But among mid-caps and large-caps, they're the seven whose stories took the biggest hit and they're the seven stocks to sell now. Each of these stocks fell sharply during earnings season, and each of these stocks may have a difficult time bouncing back any time soon. Stamps.com (STMP)Online postage provider Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) hasn't just seen its story change after earnings. Its story has broken.For some time, short sellers had argued that STMP was due for a precipitous fall once its exclusive contract with the United States Postal Service was inevitably altered. They've been proven absolutely right. STMP lost its contract in February, news which sent the stock down by more than 50%.Three months later, in its first quarter report, Stamps.com slashed full-year EPS guidance from $5.15 to $6.15 to $3.35 to $4.85. STMP dropped another 56%, far and away the worst post-earnings decline of any widely held stock. The stock has continued to fall since. It's now down 86% over the last year, and has lost 78% of its value in 2019 alone. According to data cited by Bloomberg, STMP is the first stock since at least 2001 to fall 50% after earnings following two consecutive quarters.STMP stock does look cheap, at a little over 10x the low end of 2019 EPS guidance. But with the business model in upheaval, profits plunging, and investor confidence shattered, it should be cheap. And it will likely stay that way for some time until it can right the ship. 3M (MMM)Source: Shutterstock 3M (NYSE:MMM) is not the kind of company that makes this list very often, if ever. The diversified industrial manufacturer generally has been a stable grower. It's a Dow Jones component. Economic cycles have their say, but the century-old company has made its way through plenty of booms and busts.But the company's Q1 report does put 3M on this list -- and near the top. MMM stock fell some 13% after missing estimates and cutting its full-year outlook. The decline was so steep it took nearly 200 points off the Dow Jones Index. The response wasn't based just on the fundamentals, either.3M's CEO admitted that &quot;we're behind the curve&quot; in responding to lower volumes. An aggressive layoff plan suggests that management -- looking forward -- might not see demand returning. Meanwhile, weakness was concentrated in two key markets -- automotive and China -- which may not be on the way back soon. (In the case of automotive, there are long-running worries that demand may have peaked for good.)On this site, both Will Healy and Josh Enomoto have recommended that investors buy the dip. Both authors make intriguing cases. But MMM has kept falling after the earnings report: it's now down about 25% from pre-earnings levels. Analysts, including Stephen Tusa, who was dead on in forecasting the long fall of General Electric (NYSE:GE), remain bearish. Trade war impacts could add further pressure. To me, it's a stock to sell, not buy.  * 4 Consumer Staples Stocks for Both Income and Growth This isn't a case of investors reacting to a single quarter. They're reacting to what the quarter means. And what it means is that 3M has fallen behind and has roadblocks in its path toward catching up. Nordstrom (JWN)Source: Shutterstock Retailer Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) only fell about 9% after disappointing Q1 earnings this week. In terms of the one-day decline, JWN is hardly one of the worst performers after earnings.But the Q1 report is more problematic for JWN than the market's single-day response might suggest. First, JWN shares had steadily drifted downward heading into the report. In fact, save for a very brief dip in 2016, the stock already was at an eight-year low. Expectations were modest heading into the report -- and Nordstrom still couldn't deliver.The second, broader, issue is that Nordstrom now looks like a business headed for a decline. Mall stocks in general have had a rough go of it lately, but even by those standards, JWN has underperformed. And once the narrative around a stock turns to whether earnings are done for good, it becomes a stock to sell. We've seen that with retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), Tuesday Morning (NASDAQ:TUES) and Pier 1 Imports (NYSE:PIR).Investors might retort that Nordstrom isn't part of that group -- but that's the point. The bull case for JWN -- and the reason it cleared $65 as recently as early November -- was that its brand kept it immune from some of the challenges facing physical retailers. What's clear at the moment is that investors no longer believe that to be the case. Once that narrative takes hold, in the days of Amazon, it's very difficult for retailers to convince investors otherwise. Lowe's Companies (LOW)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)To be clear, all is not lost for Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW), even after a disappointing first quarter report. A 12% post-earnings decline certainly wasn't welcomed by shareholders. But LOW stock still is positive YTD. Same-store sales still rose 3.5% year-over-year in Q1. The midpoint of fiscal 2019 (ending January 2020) EPS guidance implies adjusted EPS should rise about 9% this year.But the first quarter report is a big hit to the narrative behind LOW. As James Brumley pointed out in early March, LOW had outperformed Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stock over the past year -- a notable reversal from LOW's historic second-place status. A new CEO, new strategies, and a rationalized footprint seemed set to make Lowe's a more viable competitor to its larger rival.Lowe's did take some share from Home Depot in the quarter: its 3.5% comp outpaced HD's 3% print. But a huge compression in gross margin suggests that Lowe's bought some of those extra revenues. And a substantial earnings miss suggests Lowe's paid too much in the process.  * 4 Drug and Health Stocks Pushing Higher  Again, LOW isn't headed to the list of retailers facing bankruptcy risk. But the rally in LOW stock over the past year-plus was based on the idea that it had room for improvement, and the ability to narrow the gap with Home Depot. Q1 numbers and FY19 guidance both undercut that narrative -- which is why Lowe's stock has fallen so hard. Tesla (TSLA)Source: Shutterstock For Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the earnings report itself wasn't really the biggest problem of earnings season. Certainly, the headline numbers missed badly, though CEO Elon Musk already had warned that the quarter would be tough. TSLA stock, however, didn't fall that far after the report, with investors giving the company the benefit of the doubt.The step-down in US tax credits and the demand spike that accompanied the initial launch of the Model 3 both benefited results in the second half of 2018 -- and likely provided headwinds to sales in Q1. Tesla reaffirmed full-year guidance for deliveries, and that seemed to settle investors' nerves.It didn't last, though, for one key reason. Any investor willing to give Tesla a pass for the first quarter had to have some level of trust in the company. Over the last few weeks, that trust has eroded. And what originally looked like a one-quarter problem increasingly looks like a harbinger of permanently lower demand.Analysts have turned sharply negative. Musk's claims that a &quot;robotaxi&quot; service would make Tesla cars worth $250,000 each -- and make Tesla a $500 billion company -- have been dismissed. As Wayne Duggan wrote, investors now are ignoring Elon Musk. In that context, the reaffirmed guidance isn't evidence that demand will return. Instead, it looks more like yet another broken promise.TSLA stocks continue to slide, touching another new low on Friday. The narrative here clearly has reversed dramatically since earnings, and I wouldn't bet on Musk to fix that problem. In fact, I continue to bet that he won't. Even if you don't want to make a bearish bet, Tesla is still one of the stocks to sell now. Overstock.com (OSTK)Source: Shutterstock For Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK), too, the actual earnings report wasn't the biggest reason OSTK is on this list of stocks to sell. In fact, Overstock's Q1 actually wasn't that bad. OSTK stock jumped after revenue beat estimates and the company raised Adjusted EBITDA guidance for its retail business.The gains didn't hold: OSTK sits near a three-year low. And like with TSLA, the problem is clear: trust. As I wrote in early March, Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne had lost the faith of investors. An investment from GSR Capital, announced back in August, was supposed to be $400 million; per the Q1 conference call, GSR is putting in just $5 million. The retail business was going to be sold, so Overstock could focus on its blockchain businesses. That hasn't happened. tZERO tokens issued by Overstock's subsidiary are trading at a fraction of their value.It was Q4 earnings last year that turned me solidly against the bull case for OSTK. Q1 earnings -- while above expectations -- don't change that problem. The retail business still is unprofitable, with little sign for improvement. The blockchain efforts seem to be fizzling out. And on top of it all, Byrne went and sold 500,00 shares of stock at an average price around $13. That sale -- near the lows -- sent OSTK shares down another 15%. The CEO followed up with a somewhat angry statement to shareholders defending his sale and vowing not &quot;to ever give such an explanation again&quot;.  * Marijuana Stocks: Catch the Next Hot Pot Stock Before It 'Jumps' Without Byrne as a visionary, and without progress in blockchain, Overstock.com is just a struggling and unprofitable online retailer. That's not enough, even at a multi-year low. This one is solidly on our list of stocks to sell. Aphria (APHA)Source: Shutterstock Cannabis stocks like Aphria (NYSE:APHA) are going to see quite a bit of volatility, so a bounce back wouldn't be a surprise. Indeed, APHA shares are up 9% in early trading Friday following an upgrade from Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).But Aphria's fiscal Q3 report last month was concerning. APHA shares dropped 12% and kept falling. Before Friday's bounce, they were trading near 2019 lows -- and dramatically underperforming other pot plays like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Hexo (NYSEAMERICAN:HEXO).As I wrote at the time, the declines made some sense. Aphria took a quick writedown of assets in Latin America -- assets a short seller report had said were largely worthless. Aphria has disputed that contention, but admitted that key executives hadn't disclosed conflicts of interest. Growth looked impressive, but came largely from the acquisition of a lower-margin distribution business. The legacy business actually had a disappointing quarter, the key reason why results missed Street estimates.To be sure, there's still a bull case for APHA, as I wrote this week. If new management hits new targets, Aphria stock is going to rise. But like so many stocks on the list, the earnings report broke investors' trust. And in the market, as in life, it's difficult to get that back.As of this writing, Vince Martin has a bearish options position in TSLA. He has no positions in any other securities mentioned.

2019-05-23	2019-05-23 13:41:14	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Thursday’s Vital Data: Lowe’s, Target and Freeport-McMoRan	Another salvo from China in the ongoing trade war is sinking U.S. stock futures this morning. This time it was comments from Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng calling for the U.S. to &quot;adjust its wrong actions&quot; that sent stocks skidding.Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.91%, and S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.86%. Nasdaq-100 futures have lost 1.14%.In the options pits, put volume almost eclipsed calls yesterday while overall volume settled near average levels. Specifically, about 15.4 million calls and 15.2 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe pop in put demand made a big impact over at the CBOE. The single-session equity put/call volume ratio rocketed back to 0.72. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average inched back up to 0.72.Options traders zeroed in on earnings announcements yesterday. Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) shares cratered after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered forward guidance. Target (NYSE:TGT) took the opposite route, rallying almost 8% after smashing expectations. Finally, Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) fell to a five-month low amid continued selling pressure in metal stocks.Let's take a closer look: Lowe's (LOW)Lowe's stepped up to the earnings plate yesterday morning and whiffed. The home construction giant reported earnings-per-share of $1.22 on $17.74 billion in revenue. Analysts were forecasting earnings of $1.34 on $17.7 billion revenue. Forward guidance was also disappointing with the company cutting fiscal year earnings guidance from over $6 to $5.45 - $5.65.  * 10 Names That Are Screaming Stocks to Buy LOW stock fell as low as 14% before battling back to close the day down 11.8%. Over 22.7 million shares changed hands on the session marking the highest volume day since last August. The down gap has completely upended the stock's uptrend, driving it from above all major moving averages to below in a single session. Bears now control the chart so consider all future rallies suspect.On the options trading front, calls and puts proved equally popular on the day. Total activity zoomed to 1,212% of the average daily volume, with 116,402 contracts traded. Calls accounted for 51% of the tally.Heading into the report, premiums were forecasting a move of $4.93 or 4.4%. That makes the actual gap a massive outlier bringing untold pain to traders swinging short volatility trades like iron condors into the number. By day's end, implied volatility fell to 26% landing it at the 29th percentile of its one-year range. Target (TGT)Target shared the spotlight with Lowe's Wednesday morning. Unlike the latter, though, Target was able to deliver. For the first quarter, the company earned $1.53 per share, handily beating analyst calls for $1.43. Revenue also came in ahead of expectations at $17.62 billion versus $17.5 billion.Both measures marked robust growth from the same quarter last year. While sales jumped 5%, earnings grew by 15.9%. Yesterday's buying binge erased much of what was lost during the stock's recent slide. TGT stock closed the session up 7.8% amid heavy volume. Overhead resistance at $78.50 ultimately halted the rally. I suggest waiting for a break above this level before deploying bullish trades.On the options trading front, traders aggressively chased calls all day. Activity swelled to 458% of the average daily volume, with 129,630 total contracts traded; 69% of the trading came from call options alone.Traders were looking for a move of $3.94 or 5.5% ahead of the report, so chalk up the 7.8% pop as a win for volatility buyers. Implied volatility sank to 24% or the 19th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of $1.18 or 1.5%. Freeport-McMoran (FCX)Metal and mining stocks have been sinking like a stone, and Freeport-McMoran might as well be the poster child. Since peaking last month at $14.68, FCX stock has cratered 31%, placing it a stone's throw from multi-year lows. The news was light this week, but that didn't prevent a surge in options activity landing the company on the leaderboard.Here's a quick technical analysis take. Its price trend is ugly and sits beneath all moving averages. With multiple resistance zones overhead, rallies are suspect. Volume patterns favor sellers with multiple distribution days over the past month showing institutions are net sellers. The next major support zone looms at $9.70, so consider that the first downside target.  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy On the options trading front, traders favored calls despite the day's thrashing. Activity ramped to 172% of the average daily volume, with 81,899 contracts traded. Calls claimed 83% of the total.The uptick in demand drove implied volatility higher on the day to 45%, placing it at the 32nd percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of 29 cents or 2.9%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Dow ends with triple-digit loss as weak retailer earnings offset Fed minutes	U.S. stocks ended lower at the closing bell on Wednesday after a raft of weaker-than-expected earnings from retailers overshadowed the Federal Reserve&apos;s minutes where it reiterated the central bank&apos;s patient stance. The S&P 500  fell 0.3% to finish around 2,856. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  retreated 101 points, or 0.4%, to end near 25,776. The Nasdaq Composite  was down 0.4% to finish around 7,751.

Net sales rose to $17.74 billion from $17.36 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $17.64 billion, and same-store sales growth of 3.5% beat expectations of a 3.0% increase. Gross margin fell to 31.46% of sales from 33.11%. For fiscal 2019, the company cut its adjusted EPS guidance range to $5.45 to $5.65 from $6.00 to $6.10, but affirmed its net sales and same-store sales outlooks. Chief Executive Marvin Ellison said that while the same-store sales performance showed that the consumer is healthy, &quot;the unanticipated impact of the convergence of cost pressure, significant transition in our merchandising organization, and ineffective legacy pricing tools and processes led to gross margin contraction in the quarter which impacted earnings.&quot; The stock has rallied 20.3% year to date through Tuesday, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  has gained 5.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has advanced 10.9%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0c515175-22da-3907-9010-c98d7b0e8741/lowe%26apos%3Bs-stock-tumbles.html?.tsrc=rss

The two home improvement leaders rely upon many of the same factors for their respective trajectories, such as home prices, housing market data, weather, macro impacts, and consumer trends.  Foremost among the concerns will be comparable sales, which clearly could erode as weather impacts, which were blamed for Home Depot's flagging sales, will likely be cited much the same way by new Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison for any weakness.

Australia to Consider Cutting Rates Next Month, Lowe Says	“A lower cash rate would support employment growth and bring forward the time when inflation is consistent with the target,” Governor Philip Lowe said in a speech in Brisbane Tuesday.  Lowe’s confirmation of an easing bias followed the release of minutes of the Reserve Bank’s May policy meeting where it said recently downgraded growth forecasts would’ve been even lower if they hadn’t incorporated current market forecasts for two rate cuts.  A concession that easier policy is required reflects persistent labor market slack and mounting evidence of households reining in spending and slowing the economy.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lowe-says-rba-consider-case-031526275.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-04-05	2019-04-05 15:21:48	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Home Depot Stock Could Be Headed for Some Hard Times	It would appear foolish to argue against Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Home Depot clearly is one of the best retailers in the world - and the dominant force in U.S. home improvement. Annual revenue recently eclipsed $100 billion. And HD stock has been a star performer since the financial crisis: Home Depot stock has gained over 400% since late 2011.Source: Shutterstock But I've argued for close to eighteen months now that HD stock is too expensive, as I wrote in December 2017. The stock admittedly has gained about 6% since then, and paid another 3%+ in dividends. But that performance has been worse than that of the market as a whole and includes a 15% gain so far this year.Indeed, looking at the chart, Home Depot stock seems to have a clear path toward retaking all-time highs, reached last September, of $215. But looking at the business, there are concerns here. The housing market isn't exactly strong. The economy is in year ten of an expansion, which may reverse. Home Depot's top competitor is retooling, and Home Depot stock isn't exactly cheap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Medical Marijuana Stocks to Cure Your Portfolio To be sure, Home Depot is a wonderful company; that's not in dispute. The question is at what price investors should be willing to invest in that wonderful company. HD Stock Underperforms?Like a number of housing stocks, HD stock has benefited from the reversal in market sentiment in 2019. The reversal isn't necessarily surprising: in December, I called out the iShares US Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB) as my choice for the Best ETF of 2019.Home Depot stock is a significant holding of that ETF, though the two largest positions are homebuilders Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI).And in fact, the ETF has outperformed HD stock, returning 19% YTD. As I wrote in December, the problem for trying to time the lows in Home Depot stock was that other housing plays looked much more attractive.That's been the case so far this year, and it's still the case. LEN and DHI still trade a single-digit multiples to earnings per share. Construction suppliers like American Woodmark (NASDAQ:AMWD) and Jeld-Wen (NYSE:JELD) have rebounded this year - but remain cheap, and well off 2018 highs.The issue with HD stock thus remains. To own it, an investor has to have some faith in the mid-term housing market (and the economy) staying strong enough to drive renovation spending. If the market does stay strong, however, there are better choices out there. If it doesn't, investors won't keep paying nearly 20x earnings for a cyclical retailer like Home Depot. Home Depot Stock Has Stalled out BeforeMeanwhile, it might seem like HD stock simply outperforms the market no matter what. Over time, that has been true. But HD also has had long periods of not just underperformance but negative performance.Between the beginning of 2000 and the beginning of 2010, a ten-year stretch, Home Depot stock lost nearly half its value. Obviously, there's some cherry-picking there: the start of the decade saw the dot-com boom (which boosted stocks outside of tech) and the end of the decade came just months after the worst moments of the financial crisis. Still, for about twelve years, HD stock was dead money.That's not to say that HD is going to lose half of its value this decade or even that it will stall out for the next few years. Rather, the point is that valuation and timing matter, even for a quality company. That's doubly true for a cyclical play like Home Depot.And at this point in the cycle, almost 20x earnings simply isn't cheap. In fact, the stock is just a few dollars from the average analyst target price. That's exactly where it sat in late 2017. A year later, HD was down 15%. Is Lowe's on the Way?In addition, Home Depot's biggest competitor, Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW), is affecting a turnaround. And as James Brumley wrote last month, Lowe's &quot;is finally starting to close the gap&quot;.It's not quite a zero-sum game between Home Depot and Lowe's. Better sales at Lowe's may not come from its larger rival, but from independent stores and those that operate under the Ace Hardware and True Value banners.Still, a stronger Lowe's means tougher competition for Home Depot. And with investors expecting 4-6% same-store sales growth going forward, and the stock not cheap (again, due to cyclical exposure), it doesn't take much to change the narrative here. Be Careful with HDNone of this is to say that Home Depot is a short. But, at these prices, it's not a slam dunk, either. Any housing hiccups could end the recent rally. Macro concerns tanked the stock in the fourth quarter, and may return again soon. If the external environment stays benign, investors might benefit more from other housing plays.It does seem from my perspective like the rally is due to stall out. There's at least a case for taking profits - or hoping for a better price.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Since Marvin started in July, he has assembled a new leadership team of seasoned executives, many of whom previously worked with him at Home Depot.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-ackman-comments-lowes-companies-214740628.html?.tsrc=rss

Homebuilders ETF falls despite appearance of 1st bullish &apos;golden cross&apos; pattern in more than 2 years	The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF  fell 0.5% in afternoon trade Tuesday, in the wake of disappointing housing data, ironically on the same day that a bullish &quot;golden cross&quot; chart pattern is set to appear. Of the ETF&apos;s 35 equity components, 25 were trading lower. Earlier, data showed that February housing starts dropped a more-than-expected 9% and home price growth slowed in January, to the slowest pace in 6 1/2 years. Meanwhile, a &quot;golden cross&quot; is when the 50-day moving average, a short-term trend guide, crosses above the 200-day moving average (DMA), a longer-term trend tracker. Many chart watcher believe the crosses mark the spot a short-term rally transforms into a longer-term uptrend. The homebuilders ETF&apos;s (XHB) 50-DMA currently extended to $37.377 while 200-DMA was at $37.370, according to FactSet. That would mark the first time the XHB&apos;s 50-DMA was above the 200-DMA since April 20, 2018, and be the first &quot;golden cross&quot; since Jan. 23, 2017.

2019-03-22	2019-03-22 11:43:28	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: AT&T, Morgan Stanley and Lowe’s Companies	Dancing with a fairly significant stumble after losing ground on Tuesday and Wednesday, the bulls opted to renew their bullishness on Thursday. The S&P 500 gained 1.09% in yesterday's action, leading the index to its best close since early October.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) offered the biggest helping hand, gaining 3.7% as investors wade in before Monday's event that will unveil its new on-demand video platform. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) actually logged the bigger gain, however, advancing nearly 10% after posting second-quarter numbers that hinted at a turnaround taking shape in the second half of the year.They weren't all winners though. Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) plunged nearly 30% after the biopharma company decided to cancel the development of Alzheimer's drug aducanumab due to its ineffectiveness.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNone of those names are well suited for speculation as Friday's trading action kicks off, however. Rather, it's the stock charts of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) and AT&T (NYSE:T) that hold the most promise, as each is only on the cusp of moving past catalytic levels. Morgan Stanley (MS)This week has been an especially tough one for banking and finance stocks. News that the Federal Reserve was going to put the brakes on its rate-hike plans upended these names, as the higher interest rates on the radar had led investors to believe bank earnings would also grow. Now they're not going to.  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter Curiously though, Morgan Stanley shares bounced on Thursday while most other financial names continued to lose ground. In context though, not only does the rebound make sense, it sets the stage for a major breakout thrust.  Click to Enlarge • The big line in the sand now is around $45, plotted in yellow on the daily chart. That's where Morgan Stanley topped out the last two times it peaked.• MS shares have also already made their way above the upper edge of a falling trading range that has guided shares lower since early 2018.• Yesterday's reversal took shape right as the purple 50-day and gray 100-day moving average lines were revisited. This is the ideal spot to stage rekindled bullishness. Lowe's Companies (LOW)It has likely got more to do with the perceived rebound of the home-construction market and an encouraging outlook for remodeling spending this year. But whatever the reason, Lowe's Companies shares have largely confirmed that the uptrend put into motions in January is the real deal.  Click to Enlarge • In December and January, the white 200-day moving average line acted as resistance. Once it was clearly in February though, it turned into support that prodded the current surge.• We're also nearing a so-called golden cross, where the purple 50-day moving average line moves above the 200-day average. This is often a sign of the beginning of a big bullish move.• Zooming out to a daily chart of LOW, we can see the path is cleared for a move to the $125 area, where the upper boundary of the trading range in place since late 2017 awaits. AT&T (T)The past two and a half years have been miserable ones for AT&T shareholders. From a peak near $43 in late 2016 to a low of less than $27 in December of last year, this blue chip has been very un-blue-chip-like. It's not like the past few weeks have offered any decisive hints that things are finally on the mend.There are a handful of very subtle but very telling clues, however, that point to real bullishness ahead if T shares can work past one important technical ceiling.  Click to Enlarge • That ceiling is right around $31.40, where the stock peaked a couple of different times this year, and where the white 200-day line waits. The 200-day line has been a big problem for AT&T for a few months now.• Backing out to a weekly chart we can see T shares have already made a move above the falling resistance line -- plotted in yellow -- that's been guiding it lower since early 2018.• Still, this is a stock that has given us bullish headfakes before.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-21	2019-03-21 19:21:42	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	7 Retail Stocks That Will Continue to Rebound in 2019	Retail stocks were hammered in late 2018 amid concerns that the global economy was slowing and that the global consumer was consequently losing confidence. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) dropped 30% from early September 2018, to late December.Then, the post-Christmas rally happened. Retail stocks, and the market in general, staged a huge turnaround the day after Christmas. They have stayed on a solid uptrend ever since because global economic fundamentals have started to stabilize and improve, while the global consumer has regained confidence in 2019.All in all, the S&P Retail ETF is up 15% since Christmas Eve.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor the most part, this rebound in retail stocks should continue because the fundamentals continue to improve. Trade and FX headwinds are becoming less severe. The rate hiking headwind has turned into a accommodating monetary policy tailwind. Consumer confidence metrics across the globe, and in particular the U.S., are bouncing back. Job markets globally remain healthy. Wages globally are heading higher.Overall, the economic fundamentals today continue to support a strong retail environment for the foreseeable future. Consequently, the early 2019 rebound in retail stocks should continue over the next several months.  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter Which retail stocks will lead this continued rebound? Let's take a deeper look. Nike (NKE)Source:  rodrigofranca via Flickr  Category: Athletic Apparel % Gain Since Dec. 24: 28%Shares of global athletic apparel giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) have been on a tear in 2019. Since bottoming out in late 2018, Nike stock is up nearly 30%, and now trades at fresh all-time highs.Why the big rally? Nike has continued to expand its dominance in the athletic-apparel category using faster-than-peer product innovation -- an enhanced direct retail strategy -- and unique marketing campaigns that have energized the core customer base. As Nike has done this, North America sales growth has come back into solidly positive territory. International growth has remained hot. Margins have recovered. And the whole company is back to firing on all cylinders.This rally in Nike stock will continue because this dominance is nothing new. Nike has dominated the athletic-apparel scene for over twenty years now. Time and time again, competitors arise and threaten Nike's dominance. Time and time again, Nike responds effectively, crushes the competition and only expands its dominance. This will continue to happen for the foreseeable future, and it will keep Nike stock on a long-term upward path. Home Depot (HD)Source: Shutterstock  Category: Home Improvement % Gain Since Dec. 24: 17%Shares of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) dropped big in late 2018 amid concerns that the U.S. housing market was finally cooling after years of red-hot growth. But as financial markets have rebounded in 2019, so has Home Depot stock. It's up nearly 20% since late 2018.Why the big turnaround? U.S. housing market fundamentals have stabilized and improved in 2019. Specifically, the Fed went from hawkish to dovish, and stopped hiking rates. That caused mortgage rates, which had been on a sharp run up in late 2018, to fall big in early 2019. Also, consumer confidence has bounced back, wages have continued to rise, the unemployment rate remains low, housing starts have come roaring back and home-improvement-related retail sales rose over 8% year-over-year in January 2019.  * 5 Stocks To Buy for the Happiest Employees All these improvements will continue so long as U.S. economic fundamentals remain solid, which they should. Americans will keep buying and remodeling homes. And Home Depot's sales and profits will continue to rise. As such, so long as the U.S. economy remains on solid footing, the rebound in Home Depot stock should persist. Lowe's (LOW)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)  Category: Home Improvement % Gain Since Dec. 24: 20%The story at Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) parallels the story at Home Depot. The stock was killed in late 2018 on slowing U.S. housing market concerns. It's rebounded in a big way in 2019 as housing market fundamentals have stabilized and improved.Importantly, though, Lowe's appears to finally be gaining share against Home Depot for the first time in a long time. For the past several years, Home Depot has consistently out-comped Lowe's in a sign that Home Depot was gaining market share and Lowe's was losing market share. But to end 2018, the gap between Lowe's and Home Depot's comparable sales growth was the narrowest it's been in two years. In January 2019, Lowe's actually out-comped Home Depot.The implication? For the first time in a long time, Lowe's is leveling the playing field with Home Depot and actually gaining share in the home improvement market. Lowe's stock is still materially cheaper than Home Depot stock. As such, as home improvement stocks continue to rebound, Lowe's stock could be the big winner. Target (TGT)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)  Category: General Merchandise % Gain Since Dec. 24: 26%In late 2018, shares of Target (NYSE:TGT) fell off a cliff as investors were spooked by slowing comparable sales growth and compressing margins against the backdrop of a slowing U.S. economy. Target stock dropped big. But it's also rebounded big since then, staging a 26% rally since Christmas Eve.The turnaround in Target stock was powered by a few things. First, the U.S. economy stopped slowing and started stabilizing. Second, the U.S. consumer regained confidence in early 2019 and general merchandise retail sales rose 2.2% in January 2019. Third, Target reported solid holiday-quarter numbers that underscored that Target remains a healthy growth company with a red-hot digital business and stable margins.  * 3 Out-of-Favor Consumer Stocks to Buy This turnaround in Target stock will continue because the fundamentals remain favorable and the stock remains cheap. Given stable U.S. economic fundamentals and Target's newly developed omni-channel retail presence, this company projects as a stable low single-digit revenue grower and high single-digit profit grower over the next several years. Yet, Target stock trades at just 13x forward earnings. That's too cheap for that level of growth, meaning this rally in Target stock will persist. Ulta (ULTA)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr  Category: Health & Personal Care % Gain Since Dec. 24: 46%Shares of Ulta (NASDAQ:ULTA) have been on a roller coaster ride over the past several months. In late 2018, Ulta stock dropped nearly 30% in just over a month. In 2019, however, Ulta stock has rebounded by nearly 50% in just over two months.The big selloff in late 2018 was the result of a below-consensus holiday-quarter guide converging on a rich valuation. The big rebound has been the result of the company blowing the lid off that below-consensus guide and reporting very strong holiday-quarter numbers. It also helps that comparable sales growth accelerated, margins expanded and the forward guide was strong -- all against the backdrop of a resurgent U.S. consumer. Now, Ulta stock is now making new highs.Ulta stock will continue to make new highs for the foreseeable future because this company is getting its groove back. New product launches in late 2018 helped reinvigorate comparable sales growth back to the near 10% range. These new product launches will continue to drive healthy customer enthusiasm and traffic gains through 2019. As they do, Ulta's revenues and profits will continue to impress, and Ulta stock will stay on an uptrend. Foot Locker (FL)Source: Shutterstock  Category: Athletic Apparel % Gain Since Dec. 24: 22%Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) stock dropped big in late 2018 amid slowing U.S. economy concerns. But as the U.S. economy has stabilized, Foot Locker stock has rebounded.The rebound in Foot Locker stock has been especially large (over 20% since Christmas Eve) because of a strong holiday-quarter earnings report that underscored healthy operating fundamentals for the company. Comps rose 10%. Margins expanded in a big way. Inventories fell. The guide was healthy. Investors cheered. Foot Locker stock popped.  * 3 Bank Stocks Whacked Down by the Fed In the big picture, Foot Locker's numbers have been getting better for a long time now. Now, they are finally good again, and this tells me that the worst is in the rearview mirror for FL. Going forward, Foot Locker will remain an important and stable player in the athletic-apparel retail landscape. FL's growth profile, coupled with the current 11x forward earnings multiple, should be enough to keep Foot Locker stock on a winning path. Best Buy (BBY)Source: Best Buy  Category: Electronics % Gain Since Dec. 24: 43%In late 2018, there was a rumor flying around that the consumer electronics space was rapidly slowing. Consequently, shares of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) dropped nearly 50% in a matter of three months.That rumor was a bunch of hot air. In early 2019, Best Buy reported strong holiday-quarter numbers that included positive comparable sales growth, big digital sales growth, margin expansion and an above-consensus full-year guide. Those numbers were proof that Best Buy remains the leader in the still-growing consumer electronics space. Consequently, Best Buy stock rallied.Still, Best Buy stock is pretty cheap at just 12x forward earnings. That's too cheap for Best Buy, a company which should report positive comps and healthy margins for the foreseeable future thanks to secular tailwinds (the widespread emergence of IoT and AI technologies). As such, a cheap valuation and favorable growth fundamentals should keep BBY stock on an upward trend for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long NKE, HD, TGT, FL, and BBY.

2019-03-15	2019-03-15 12:28:27	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Now Is One of the Best Opportunities to Buy Home Depot Stock	After reporting a less-than-stellar quarter on Feb. 26, investors began selling shares of Home Depot (NYSE:HD). It hasn't been catastrophic for Home Depot stock, but shares have been under pressure since the report.Source: Shutterstock The numbers of Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) are likely having an effect too. After initially rallying on the report, the stock fell for seven straight sessions. That's caused a lot of investors to ask whether these stocks are worth owning at this point. Spring SeasonInvestors are seemingly overlooking the spring season. When the holidays roll around, of course Home Depot, Lowe's and others do well in sales. Every family's handyman or DIY member is eligible for a home improvement gift, right? Right.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs But that hardly compares to the numbers that HD stock will put up in the second quarter as homeowners and contractors get to work fixing up houses, cleaning up yards and renovating kitchens and bathrooms. As such, Home Depot will bring on 80,000 new workers to account for the increase in demand.The downside to all this? These results show up in Q2, not Q1, which HD is in right now. That said, the silver lining here is that investors have an opportunity to buy or accumulate Home Depot stock while it's under pressure. That's better than buying a stock red-hot into its best numbers. Valuing Home Depot StockHome Depot is a high-quality company, but it's seen better years when it comes to growth. For the current year, estimates call for earnings growth of just 2.2%, despite expectations for 3.2% revenue growth.Estimates for next year improve, where analysts expect 9.3% earnings growth on 4.6% sales growth. Although, it's hard to put too much weight into next fiscal year when we've only just begun this one.So where does that leave HD stock? Shares trade at about 18 times this year's earnings, which isn't necessarily cheap but is also far from expensive. Investors also need to consider the Home Depot's 3% dividend yield down near these levels.Over the last six years, Home Depot has traded with a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 20 on the low end and 25 on the high end. So below this mark now, it's technically undervalued vs. its recent five-year history.Further, assuming one overlooks the December selloff, they'd have to go all the way back to 2011 to find HD stock paying out a higher dividend yield. That's following the company's 32% boost last month.Home Depot is making the investments necessary to makes its online game stand tall against companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), has a below-average valuation vs. its historical range and is paying out a 3% dividend yield. I'll admit that the growth is somewhat stagnant for the year, but there's a lot to like about HD stock for the patient investor. Trading HD Stock  Click to EnlargeHome Depot has fallen about $10 from its pre-earnings levels, but that ~5% loss isn't too hard for most investors to stomach. For now, the 50-day moving average is propping up HD, while the 61.8% and 38.2% Fibonacci retracements are keeping it range bound.A break of either one of those Fib levels will likely send that stock in the continued direction. Meaning, a break below the 38.2% Fib will likely send HD stock lower and a breakout over the 61.8% Fib will likely send Home Depot higher.At this point though, with the lack of a real catalyst, the risk is to the downside. Should Home Depot stock lose the 50-day and subsequently Fib support, the stock could see $170 again.In that sense, investors who want to trade HD stock can go long near current levels, with a stop-loss on a close below this key area. Long-term investors though may consider this an advantageous spot to add to their position.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-03-01	2019-03-01 18:10:27	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Is Lowe’s Stock Better Than Home Depot Stock?	Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stock dropped 4% after missing analysts' consensus estimates, leading some to wonder whether Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) stock might now be a better investment than HD stock.Home Depot's earnings per share of $2.09 on $26.5 billion of sales, against analysts' average EPS outlook of $2.16, and its same-store sales growth of only 3.2%, against the consunsus outlook of 4.5%, was enough to get tongues wagging.After all, the bears growled, Lowe's now has a hot new leader in Marvin Ellison, and Home Depot's management couldn't be picked out of a lineup. Ellison is a &quot;superstar,&quot; as one TV pundit put it.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 March Madness Stocks to Consider for the Big Dance  The Case for Lowe's StockPersonally, I'm a fan of Marvin Ellison.  I thought he could save JC Penney (NYSE:JCP). He couldn't. Maybe no one can. His knowledge of store logistics is a better fit for Lowe's, but does that make the stock better than the long-time category leader, HD stock?HD stock and LOW stock tends to move in tandem. Home Depot stock and LOW stock have doubled in value over the last five years. Neither stock has been a bad investment.Over five years, HD stock has only done slightly better than LOW stock. Over the last year, and especially since Ellison was recruited, HD stock has underperformed LOW stock.In Q4, Lowe's EPS came in at 80 cents excluding certain charges,  The adjusted EPS of 80 cents met the consensus outlook. But its revenue of $15.6 billion (about 70% that of Home Depot's) came up short of the $15.7 billion consensus outlook. Lowe's Q4 loss per share, including the charges, was $1.03. The company's annual EPS of $2.84 per share, however, justified a hike in the quarterly dividend, from 41 cents to 48 cents. The point here being, there's still cleanup to do on aisle three. Ellison admitted as much in his earnings call, saying the company's computer infrastructure still needs to be transformed, and it needs to do a better job of selling to contractors. The Case for HD StockHome Depot's miss was a miss only when compared with expectations.Home Depot's sales have been steadily increasing 7%-9% for years, and the growth of its net income accelerated in fiscal 2019, compared with the year before. Its earnings miss was the result of cold weather and a slowing real estate market. Smart investment groups seeking long-term returns are stepping in on the stock's weakness, and they're bragging about it. Home Depot's balance sheet is still stronger than that of Lowe's, its cash flow is more robust, and HD hiked the dividend on HD stock 32% to a fat $1.36 per share. Thus, today's yield on Home Depot stock is 2.96%, despite the  continuing rise of HD stock. To an aging income investor, this is music to the ears.Contractors are the secret to Home Depot's success. Contractors get discounts and their own entrance at my Home Depot store. Small contractors, the folks who might put an addition on your house or replace your kitchen, are especially prized by Home Depot, one reason it's backing an outsourced delivery start-up called Roadie, which can make same-day deliveries to job sites for the same prices that HD charges.Ellison can narrow the gap betwee LOW and HD, in other words, but there's still a gap between them. The Bottom Line on HD Stock and LOW StockWhether you choose to buy HD stock or LOW stock depends on your time horizon.If you're looking for a quick return on your investment, Lowe's stock might indeed be better because Marvin Ellison is a good manager and there's still room for improvement. at LOW But if you're looking for a long-term holding, and/or if you're an income investor, HD stock is a better call. Just remember, however, that both HD stock and LOW stock are so strong that you can't really go wrong.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-01	2019-03-01 15:09:54	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	This Lowe’s Stock Turnaround Looks Real Enough	It's official. After years of falling behind rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD) on several fronts, Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) is finally starting to close the gap. By some measures it's even outperforming its bigger competitor, including the one most important to investors; Lowe's stock is leading Home Depot stock by leaps and bounds for the past year.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)There's still more work to be done, to be sure. And despite the usual post-earnings optimism the company was sporting following Wednesday morning's Q4 report, the housing market is undeniably facing a headwind. The question is one of degrees.Regardless, it's increasingly difficult to not replace HD with LOW stock as the go-to name within the home improvement arena.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 March Madness Stocks to Consider for the Big Dance  New CEO and Lowe's StockThe credit largely goes to CEO Marvin Ellison. After only seven months on the job, the former Home Depot executive has Lowe's humming again. Its stores have the right and adequate inventory to meet the needs of contractors as well as DIYers. Meanwhile, his renewed focus on customer service has made a trip to its stores a pleasant experience again.Much of Ellison's work, though, has been largely out of sight of customers, even if they've been a beneficiary of those improvements.One of Ellison's first missions after taking the helm in July of last year was a top-down overhaul of Lowe's technologies. This included a rethinking of inventory management solutions, but most of all it was a means of connecting with more shoppers on the web. While only about 5% of the company's sales are done online, that figure is growing fast.Also noteworthy is that 60% of online orders are retrieved in its stores, setting up another opportunity to make an add-on sale. Lowe's Stock and Q4The fruits of Ellison's labor are starting to bloom. Last quarter's same-store sales growth of 1.7% may have fallen short of the 2.1% improvement analysts were modeling, but income of 80 cents per share of Lowe's stock was better than the 79 cents the pros had estimated, and up 8.1 year-over-year despite flat revenues.The wider margins are the result of shedding poor businesses. Ellison has been closing unprofitable stores in North America, and has completely shuttered its struggling Orchard Supply unit.Last quarter's same-store sales growth of 2.4% in the U.S. still doesn't match up with Home Depot's 3.7% comparable sales growth for the quarter ending in January. But, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel notes that the 1.3 percentage point difference is &quot;the narrowest it has been in a while.&quot;The difference may even be narrower for the quarter currently underway. In January alone, Lowe's same-store sales growth of 5.8% outpaced Home Depot's figure of 4.1%.It was enough to prompt Joe Feldman, senior managing director at Telsey Advisory Group, to say that &quot;Lowe's has an opportunity to close that gap. We don't expect them to completely close it, but we expect them to narrow it. And if they can narrow it and bring up their profitability over the next year or two, that will certainly help the stock.&quot; Looking Ahead for Lowe's StockIf Lowe's is to close that gap though, it's going to need continued growth from an uncertain housing market.Ellison feels good about the foreseeable future on that front, commenting: &quot;U.S. macroeconomic fundamentals remain sound for 2019, and we will continue to implement process and technology improvements to capitalize on the immediate opportunity to improve results.&quot;Ellison added during the conference call &quot;As home prices are increasing, consumers are staying in their homes longer and because of their improved financial position, they are investing in their homes.&quot;The data more or less jibes with Ellison's feel for the home improvement and remodel market. The Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University expects spending on remodels to grow 5.1% this year.As for new construction, however, the jury is still out. January's new home sales in the United States fell 8% year-over-year, and December's housing starts fell 10.2% year-over-year to a two-year low rate of 1.08 million.Still, the company is optimistic, offering 2019 profit guidance of between $6.00 and $6.10 per share of Lowe's stock, versus analyst estimates of $6.04. Lowe's is looking for total revenue growth of 2% on same-store sales growth of 3%.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-28	2019-02-28 17:12:43	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	Build Something With These 5 Homebuilder ETFs	Last year, homebuilder ETFs and stocks were stymied by rising interest rates -- among other factors. The Federal Reserve boosted interest rates four times, leading to higher mortgage rates, which chased some would-be homebuyers from the market.Housing affordability concerns in some of the marquee U.S. real estate markets, including California and New York, also plagued homebuilder ETFs in 2018. While the housing affordability issue is far from being reconciled, the good news for investors considering homebuilder ETFs is that the Federal Reserve is likely to slow its pace of rate hikes or not even raise rates at all this year.The Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index, one of the most widely followed gauges of homebuilder and home improvement equities, is higher by nearly 18% this year. Recent housing data has been encouraging, but analysts are advising a cautious approach.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIndustry analysts are &quot;arguing that the Fed's recent pivot toward dovish interest-rate policy, the tempered pace of the housing recovery since the financial crisis, and demographic factors would combine to help support the housing market in the long term,&quot; reports MarketWatch.  * 9 Best Stocks to Buy on U.S.-China Trade Optimism In other words, investing mulling homebuilder ETFs have a lot to consider. Here are some of the top homebuilder ETFs that could extend their already sizable gains this year. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB) Expense ratio: 0.43% per year, or $43 on a $10,000 investment.The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (CBOE:ITB) is the largest homebuilder ETF and tracks the aforementioned Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index. As such, the $1.18 billion ITB is one of the purest plays among homebuilder ETFs.This is a cap-weighted homebuilder ETF, so it is dominated by the largest stocks in this group. For instance, Lennar Corp. (NYSE:LEN) and D.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE: DHI) combine for over 27% of ITB's weight. The fund's top 10 holdings combine for over 61% of its weight. ITB has some exposure to the retail side of residential real estate, but just to the tune of 13%.Remembering that homebuilder ETFs and stocks notched their worst annual performances in 2018 since 2008 could be interpreted as a sign that the group has more room to run. While ITB is up 17.74% this year, it is still more than 15% below its 52-week high. Invesco Dynamic Building & Construction ETF (PKB)Expense ratio: 0.58% per year, or $58 on a $10,000 investment.The Invesco Dynamic Building & Construction ETF (NYSEARCA:PKB) is an example of a homebuilder ETF with a unique weighting methodology that offers investors the potential to generate returns above those offered by more traditional homebuilder funds.PKB, which is more than 13 years old, follows the Dynamic Building & Construction Intellidex Index. That index &quot;thoroughly evaluates companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including: price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action, and value,&quot; according to Invesco.  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 In general, homebuilder ETFs tilt toward the lower end of the large-cap spectrum and/or include plenty of mid-cap stocks. PKB's 30 holdings have an average market value of $19.76 billion and just 15.44% of the fund's holdings are classified as large caps. Growth investors will like this homebuilder ETF because almost 40% of its holdings are considered growth stocks. VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH)Expense ratio: 0.35% per year, or $35 on a $10,000 investment.As it name implies, the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:RTH) is a retail fund, not a dedicated homebuilder ETF, but this product does have ample exposure to the retail side of residential real estate. Dow component Home Depot (NYSE:HD), the largest home improvement retailer, is the second-largest holding in RTH at nearly 11%.Of the 220 ETFs with exposure to Home Depot, RTH has the largest weight to that stock. Home Depot rival Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) is also a top 10 RTH holding at a weight of 4.63%. Of the 190 ETFs with exposure to Lowe's, RTH has the second-largest weight to that home improvement retailer.Several of RTH's other holdings also sell home improvement products and the ETF is a fine way of getting exposure to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) as that stock represents over 20% of RTH's weight. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB)Expense ratio: 0.35% per year, or $35 on a $10,000 investment.Next to ITB, the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSEARCA:XHB) is the most widely followed homebuilder ETF, although the SPDR offering is not as pure as its iShares rival.XHB's equal-weight index provides exposure to the following groups: Building Products, Home Furnishings, Home Improvement Retail, Homefurnishing Retail and Household Appliances, according to State Street.  * 7 Consumer Stocks to Buy and Hold for Years Pure homebuilders represent 31.64% of XHB's weight, the fund's second-largest industry weight. This homebuilder ETF also has significant consumer discretionary exposure as household appliances manufacturers, home improvement retailers and home furnishings retailers combine for over 26% of the fund's roster. Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Supplies Bull 3X Shares (NAIL)Expense ratio: 1.12% per year, of $112 on a $10,000 investment.The Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Supplies Bull 3X Shares (NYSEARCA:NAIL) is the only leveraged homebuilder ETF on the market and this fund looks to deliver triple the daily returns of the aforementioned Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index.As is the case with any leveraged ETF, NAIL should be used with care by risk-tolerant, short-term traders, not buy-and-hold investors. Good times to consider NAIL include days when housing data is released and earnings days for stocks such as D.R. Horton, Lennar and other marquee homebuilders.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

For that matter, blame the calendar too. Like its rival Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW), Home Depot's quarter ended in late January, meaning it suffered the entirety of the record-breaking government shutdown in one single quarter.All of these are factors that impact the industry's top and bottom line to be sure. And, some analysts believe that's what happened.  * 7 Cheap Stocks That Make the Grade &quot;Home Depot and Lowe's face tough year-over-year comparisons in Q4 that included hurricane-related sales and a strong year ago December that was negatively impacted by weather in 2018,&quot; explained Wells Fargo in front of the fourth quarter print adding &quot;January (which is a smaller month) could also see impacts from the lengthy government shutdown (and associated lower consumer confidence), and less favorable weather that may have resulted in traffic/sales shifting to Q1.&quot;And yet, the analyst community hasn't exactly dialed back its collective outlook. As of the most recent look, the pros are calling for revenue growth of 11.3% to push its top line up to $26.6 billion, driving per-share profits up from a year-ago figure of $1.69 to $2.16 per share of HD stock for the recently-completed quarter.Same-store sales should be up on the order of 5%, in line with the past couple of quarters.Perhaps factors like the weather and the government shutdown aren't as hard-hitting as presumed. Indeed, despite demonstrable headwinds, Stifel believes &quot;There was some softness in late 2018 with the stock market decline, higher rates, tariff talks,&quot; but still acknowledges &quot;overall demand appears intact&quot; for Home Depot's goods. Rebound in the Works?The mixed, confusing message isn't a new one.Even before the government shutdown stopped official reports of new home sale activity from being posted, their growth pace was slowing, and by some measures shrinking. The slowdown has persisted too. In January of this year, according to data from Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN), sales of new houses fell 8% year-over-year. Sales of existing homes, which isn't published by the federal government and continued to be tracked through the shutdown, fell 1.2% last month to also extend a period of lethargic interest.Housing starts are also leveling off, suggesting waning demand, and crimping supply even if demand had remained firm.The flipside: A recent report jointly pieced together by Wells Fargo and L.E.K. Consulting suggested &quot;Concerns of a 2019 downturn in housing screen as overblown, with housing starts likely to show steady growth in the intermediate term.&quot; The Joint Center of Housing Studies at Harvard University also recently opined that remodeling spending would grow to the tune of 5.1% in 2019.As for the potential impact of higher interest rates, JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers recently penned &quot;Given the importance of rates to housing, this policy change [less hawkishness, more dovishness] certainly cannot be dismissed. Indeed, mortgage rates are 50 basis points off highs, which could lead to housing turnover and pricing better than previously feared and let the category grow longer.&quot;Another noteworthy development that bodes well for HD stock is January's stunning 25% increase in lumber prices, largely erasing last year's tumble.On balance, the data points to a turnaround. The brewing turnaround, however, will do little to help Home Depot's pressured fourth quarter. Investors, however, will likely struggle to rectify all the disparate ideas. Looking Ahead for HD StockIt's possible, and even likely, that investors have already conceded Home Depot's fourth quarter numbers are a coin toss at best, and will be a relative disappointment at worst. They've been buying HD stock anyway, looking at what lies ahead for the full year.To that end, analysts are calling for full-year sales of $108.4 billion, up 7.4% from 2018's projected sales, and per-share profits of $9.80, up from 2018's anticipated $7.46. Tuesday's full-year report should also be accompanied by its first 2019 outlook.Guidance that comes up short of current estimates could do more damage to the recent rally from HD stock than missing Q4 estimates might.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-08	2019-02-08 15:35:17	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months	After a disappointing final quarter in 2018, investors have looked to the new year for a fresh start. So far, we've witnessed robust movements, with the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing more than 9% since the beginning of January. Yet slow trades following the State of the Union Address proves one thing: dividend stocks are still relevant.As someone who appreciates the speculative components of the markets, I know exactly what you're thinking. Over the past few years and prior to the October meltdown, equities represented tremendous growth potential. At the height of the bull market, even the vanilla exchange-traded fund SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) enticed onlookers.But right now, I can confidently state that the best stocks are dividend stocks. True, the Dow has clawed back most of its October losses. However, it has so far alarmingly failed to eclipse prior highs. In other words, the index is charting a bearish trend channel.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, I'm not sure how economic and geopolitical events will play out. As I write this, Washington hosts furious debates about border security. Without an agreement, the nation could suffer another embarrassing and painful government shutdown.Also, President Trump has high-stake talks or negotiations coming up with China and North Korea. Both have significant implications for our economy, foreign policy and national interests. A victory here is absolutely crucial for the administration.Given this framework, I'm placing my bets on dividend stocks. Below, I've listed out top companies to consider based on their risk/reward structure: three of each of reliable, reasonable and risky names. To top it off, I've added a super-risky dividend stock to invest in.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond Without further hesitation, here are my picks for the ten best dividend stocks to buy for the next ten months:Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Hormel Foods (HRL)Several religions endorse fasting as a means to grow spiritually as a person. This is accomplished through the denial of the self. Being somewhat of the adventurous type, I decided to give it a go. Upon completing my journey, I discovered something: I love food.It's not that I didn't receive benefits from fasting, which I did. However, a man has got to eat, which brings me to Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL). The best dividend stocks are typically no-brainers, featuring industries that benefit from indispensable demand. It doesn't get more indispensable than nutrition.That said, the key drawback for HRL is that its 2% dividend doesn't draw the &quot;wow&quot; factor. But if you're looking for steady-as-she-goes gains, Hormel is one of the best stocks to buy.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified) Lowe's (LOW)A good friend of mine from the trade business told me that most people under 40 don't own basic tools. A recent survey suggested that indeed, millennials exaggerate their practical know-how around the house. Theoretically, this bodes poorly for an organization like Lowe's (NYSE:LOW).Yet the survey also goes on to demonstrate that millennials are more likely to attempt their own home repairs than older generations. This naturally lifts growth potential for Lowe's and rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD). And even if other young folks call a repair person, someone has to buy the tools and equipment.  * 10 Dividend Growth Stocks You Can't Miss The bottom line is that LOW stock benefits from perpetual demand. In addition, the company has a long history of dividend payouts. Of course, with a 2% yield, LOW won't make you rich. But if you're seeking protection, you can't go wrong here.Source: Shutterstock  Walmart (WMT)With Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) largely sparking the e-commerce revolution, the concept of brick-and-mortar stores appears obsolete. Indeed, we've seen more than a few companies implode from the broader pressure, with Sears (OTCMKTS:SHLDQ) coming immediately to mind.Despite this enormous challenge, big-box retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has learned to thrive in the Amazon era. Because WMT places an emphasis on massive selection, convenient checkouts and everyday-low pricing, it has stayed relevant against overwhelming odds. Not even the comfort of home purchases can beat receiving a product right away, especially for essential goods.Better yet, Wall Street has witnessed several quarters of impressive growth in Walmart's e-commerce channels. Essentially, the disrupted is becoming the disruptor. And while its 2.2% dividend yield won't raise your pulse, it's still something substantive to bank on.Source: Coca-Cola Coca-Cola (KO)If you're looking for one of the best dividend stocks with a reasonable mix between passive growth and capital gains, put Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) on your radar. An iconic, global brand, management has for years depended on consumer familiarity. When that didn't work, KO ramped up its product and marketing game.Last November, I declared that you can trust Coca-Cola. In an awfully volatile year, I'm glad I was right about this one. In the final quarter of 2018, KO was actually one of the best stocks in the markets, gaining over 3%. That doesn't sound like much until you consider that several high-flyers lost double digits over the same period.  * 7 Cloud Stocks To Buy Now In the beverage sector, millennials usually gravitate toward healthier options. Therefore, I'm impressed that sugary-soda specialist KO managed to convert folks. Finally, the company's 3.2% dividend yield should give wary investors plenty to think about.Source: GothamNurse Via Flickr Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Armed with nearly a 3.4% dividend yield, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) initially appears qualified as one of the best dividend stocks available. However, ADM represents a direct play on the farming and agriculture business. Thanks to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, ADM is risky.But here too, initial appearances may be deceiving. While I'm not dismissing the risks -- Archer Daniels recently reported disappointing earnings results -- opportunities also exist. Specifically, I'm citing the age-old aphorism of buying into weakness and selling into strength. It's a gamble, but because the trade war has gone on for quite some time, we may see a resolution.Certainly, I'm not alone in this thinking process. According to The Wall Street Journal, Archer Daniels CEO Juan Luciano also sees light at the end of the tunnel.Source: Shutterstock  Consolidated Edison (ED)Where I am, we don't usually suffer electrical blackouts. But when we do, it's like the apocalypse. I still distinctly remember the 2011 power outage that impacted millions across California and Arizona. Transitioning toward a fully digitalized society, we all received a rude awakening that technology doesn't occur in a vacuum.This fundamental reality makes Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) one of the best dividend stocks around. People go crazy when they can't turn on the lights: I've witnessed this dynamic firsthand. Also, ED stock benefits from the nature of the utility business. Without much competition, current players essentially have a free moat.  * 7 Reasons You Want Boeing Stock in Your Portfolio In this capital-gains challenged environment, Consolidated Edison's 3.8% dividend yield entices. Like the other best stocks on this list, you can't go wrong with ED. However, the company's slow growth means you're sacrificing upside potential for relative certainty.Source: Shutterstock  Exxon Mobil (XOM)Ever since the energy markets collapsed back in 2014 and 2015, oil companies presented both contrarian opportunities and incredible risk. For instance, the international benchmark Brent Crude Oil enjoyed a solid year in 2017. &quot;Black gold&quot; was also on pace for strong returns in 2018 until October happened.However, some experts believe that we might see a rebound in the new year. If so, that benefits big oil firms like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). In years past, analysts frequently added XOM to their list of best dividend stocks due to broad oil market exposure. Particularly, rising prices boost the company's upstream efforts.At a time when investors struggle for profits, Exxon Mobil's 4.4% dividend yield tempts almost everyone. That said, oil is a nasty mother, so watch out for potential geopolitical rumblings.Source: Shutterstock  Philip Morris International (PM)If you really want to dial up your passive-income potential, check out Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). Historically, big tobacco has offered some of the best dividend stocks, and it's not hard to see why. Thanks to the highly addictive nicotine, Philip Morris customers often can't say no.&quot;Better&quot; yet, PM has shifted its focus for future revenues on its e-cigarette or vaporizer division. Known as IQOS, this product allows users many of the benefits of traditional smoking, but without the harsh residuals -- such as carbon monoxide -- associated with the practice.  * 10 Dividend Growth Stocks You Can't Miss Levering a 5.9% dividend yield, indeed, it's hard to say no to PM stock. But before you make the leap, you should know that smoking trends have fallen off a cliff. While vaporizers have soared in popularity, anti-tobacco advocates are increasingly eyeballing e-cigarette manufacturers.Source: Shutterstock  AT&T (T)Just recently, I wrote extensively about one of the best stocks for dividend investors: telecommunications giant AT&T (NYSE:T). Due in part to some awful volatility in the markets, T stock now offers a 6.9% dividend yield. It's simply outrageous, which is why I personally took the dive.In my write-up, I discussed the many positives that AT&T offers. Primarily, the company features a massive network, which is simply too big to overcome. On top of that, this incredible resource allows AT&T to fully harness the power and potential of the 5G rollout. As well, management could possibly advantage its newfound content umbrella.But at the end of the day, what really mattered for me was something much more basic. AT&T is simply a powerhouse. Even with its unsightly debt load and other business challenges, the company is not going anywhere. You're probably not going to find an outfit this reputable giving a payout this high.Source: Shutterstock  GameStop (GME)At first glance, the notion of investing in GameStop (NYSE:GME) appears amazingly foolish. With the push toward digital deliveries and cloud gaming, GME is on the path to becoming the next Blockbuster. While admittedly worrisome, this comparison isn't accurate.For one thing, this is a very old argument. But more importantly, this is an apples-to-oranges comparison. Streaming movies and TV programs isn't exactly network-intensive because the data is predetermined. Such content doesn't change based on user inputs.However, you cannot say the same about video games. The user constantly transmits data through his/her controller, directly impacting the game's narrative. That requires intense data streams that I've argued are not practically feasible.I appreciate that game developers are pushing the boundaries of the cloud. But neither Sony (NYSE:SNE) nor Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) will give up their console businesses. Why? It's all about science.With 5G, you could potentially have a cloud-gaming platform with little to no latency, and the same graphical capacities as a current-generation PlayStation. But with a physical console, you can have superior performance and capacity metrics on all fronts.  * 7 of the Best Emerging Markets Stocks to Buy In other words, it's much easier to upgrade a console than it is to upgrade a network. That being the case, physical games will still be around, and perhaps, so will GME.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long T stock and SNE stock.

2019-01-30	2019-01-30 18:27:54	LOW	Lowe's Companies, Inc.	The Owners of Wayfair Stock Want to Know a Secret	"Wayfair (NYSE:W) stock has a secret, and Wall Street is trying to guess what it is.

The secret is: How much business did Wayfair do during the holiday-shopping season? The answer won't be revealed until Feb, 22, but analysts' current consensus estimates are $1.96 billion, with a loss of about $100 million or $1.70 per share.of Wayfair stock. 

Wayfair bet big on Christmas, perhaps bigger than any other online retailer. The company blanketed the airwaves with commercials, trying to lure women into its virtual store to buy furniture and other home products.

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



Many women did log onto Wayfair.com, and many of them bought Wayfair's products. But how many customers did Wayfair have? Were they happy afterward, like the women in the commercials? Will they come back?

Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju says most of Wayfair's customers were pleased with their purchases, and he recently upgraded Wayfair stock, saying it could rise 30%. Other analysts are also upbeat on Wayfair stock. Wayfair stock price has risen from $80 to $104 so far in 2019.

### Wayfair's Tough 2018

Before Christmas, Wayfair had a tough 2018. One of its problems was the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in South Dakota vs. Wayfair that, when substantial purchases are made from an online store, a &quot;nexus&quot; exists, and sales tax must be paid. Previously, online merchants didn't have to pay sales taxes on purchases within a state if they did not have a physical store, warehouse, or office in that state. Now, if online businesses sell as little as $100,000 to customers in a state, with as few as 200 transactions, they may owe as much as $10,000 of tax.

That has created a mess for online merchants because sales taxes aren't uniform. States, counties and cities may impose separate sales taxes. Some charge tax on gross sales, others on gross revenues, still others on retail sales, gross receipts, or taxable sales.

After Wayfair stock fell starting in September, from a high of almost $150 to a December low of about $80, owners of Wayfair stock began suing the company. They allege that Wayfair misstated its third- quarter earnings, which ended up featuring a large loss, so that insiders could sell their shares

### The Bigger Questions About W Stock

Owners of Wayfair stock should be worrying about Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which now generates $4 billion of revenue per year from selling home furniture, against $6.5 billion for Wayfair. AMZN also now has its own home-furniture brands.

Investors should also be asking where the furniture business is going. The investment roadside is littered with companies that have tried to sell furniture and found that many Americans will make-do with what amounts to garage-sale merchandise. (I'm guilty as charged.)

Companies like Heritage Home, Gump's, Breuner's, and Mattress Firm have all been frog-marched to bankruptcy recently. And do I have to mention Sears (OTC:SHLDQ)?

Home furnishings are a tough business to be in. Young consumers rush to privately-held Ikea, middle-aged consumers inherit pieces from their parents, and once families are established they focus more on goods that can be found at Home Depot (NYSE:HD) or Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW).

### The Bottom Line on Wayfair Stock

Right now, as Wayfair totals sales from its spectacular &quot;four day clearance&quot; sale, when some goods were marked down as much as 75%, more analysts have &quot;hold&quot; ratings on Wayfair stock than have &quot;buy&quot; ratings on it.

Wayfair was among the first big online merchants to utilize TV ads, and its ad budget has risen to about $550 million, against that $6.5 billion in sales.

This is a company that is racing hard to stay in place. I would rather relax on an old couch.

Lowe's CEO Takes Medicine Now to Get Retailer on Firmer Footing	In his first earnings report as chief executive officer of Lowe’s Cos., Marvin Ellison won investors’ approval as he laid out a path to simplify the retailing giant’s operations -- even if means some short-term pain.  As the start of a broader overhaul at the company, Lowe’s will focus on improving customer service and boosting stores’ productivity.  To that end, Ellison said the retailer would liquidate a division of smaller stores and eliminate $500 million in capital projects -- the cash will instead be returned to shareholders.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ddb12e74-3e4a-39c6-8da2-68765f2aee8c/lowe%27s-ceo-takes-medicine-now.html?.tsrc=rss

Lowe’s Has the Right Man for Its Fix-Up Job	In his first quarterly earnings call with investors since becoming CEO of the home-improvement giant, the retailing veteran held forth Wednesday on his vision for shoring up a chain that, while in good shape, has been outmaneuvered lately by Home Depot Inc. Essentially, Ellison said he’d be pushing the company to be a better operator and to fix its “self-inflicted” wounds.  A key focus will be doing a better job of managing Lowe’s inventory and supply chain, including making sure key items don’t run out of stock, an issue that’s likely costing the chain sales and dampening customer satisfaction.  In the past, Ellison said, the chain has had a tendency to “throw payroll at problems,” meaning it just adds more employees to stores indiscriminately in order to boost sales.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ec1d2198-71bd-31e3-b3b1-05853d7b5a46/lowe%E2%80%99s-has-the-right-man-for.html?.tsrc=rss

A big reason Apple initiated its capital allocation program in the first place was to appease investors who felt its growth was slowing and it wasn’t returning enough money to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-growth-stocks-buy-190058790.html?.tsrc=rss

As of August 6, Home Depot was trading at a stock price of $195.69.  On the same day, analysts set an average price target of $212.55, which represents a return potential of 8.6% from its current stock price.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/952d8dad-269e-3ce0-8b25-29d597db2c66/most-analysts-suggest-a-%E2%80%98buy%E2%80%99.html?.tsrc=rss

Of all the valuation multiples, we have opted for the forward PE (price-to-earnings) multiple due to high visibility in Home Depot’s (HD) future earnings.  The forward PE multiple is computed by dividing the company’s stock price by analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters.  The improvement in macroeconomic factors such as an increase in home prices, a lower unemployment rate, increasing wages, and the expectation of strong second-quarter sales have led to a rise in Home Depot’s stock price and its valuation multiple.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/2797fa1d-6990-34d7-b843-43fd12e96806/how-does-home-depot%E2%80%99s.html?.tsrc=rss

Analysts anticipate Home Depot (HD) will post EPS (earnings per share) of $2.84, which represents a rise of 26.2% from $2.25 in the second quarter of 2017.  The EPS growth is expected to be driven by revenue growth, a lower effective tax rate, and share repurchases.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/c68f6d5b-901d-3124-bb07-c32c8caf254c/will-home-depot%E2%80%99s-q2-eps.html?.tsrc=rss

The revenue growth would likely be driven by positive SSSG (same-store sales growth), the addition of new stores, and the implementation of new accounting standards.  The extreme winter weather in the first quarter negatively impacted Home Depot’s sales.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/2664742a-08ee-3c1f-bb8a-6e9cb6caa95d/why-analysts-are-expecting.html?.tsrc=rss

(LOW) announced that it was hiring J C Penny Company Inc.’s (JCP) CEO Marvin R. Ellison as its President and CEO, effective July 2.  While many investors may immediately write this hire off, since JC Penney is running neck and neck with Sears (SHLD) for least favorite retail stock, this is actually a very good hire for Lowe’s, because before Mr. Ellison decided to try and save JC Penney from late 2014 until now, he worked for Home Depot Inc. (HD) for 12 years from 2002 to 2014.  Frankly, I am not sure anyone could have saved JC Penney.  The highest position Mr. Ellison held at Home Depot was Executive Vice President of U.S. Stores, and he was one of the frontrunners to take over as CEO following Frank Blake’s retirement, but Craig Menear ended up getting the job.  So we view this as a positive for Lowe’s, despite the negative reaction in the stock (down 1% after being up).	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a88cf767-f051-3bca-80e0-f7100f6538d4/lowe%E2%80%99s-makes-a-good-ceo-hire%2C.html?.tsrc=rss

Removing the sales contribution from the one extra week of operation in 4Q16, analysts expect Lowe’s 4Q17 revenue to rise 3.3%—which is expected to be driven by the addition of new stores, positive SSSG (same-store sales growth), and incremental sales from the acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters.

First, valuation, as Lowe's is trading near its 10-year low, and the gap between it and Home Depot has widened.  Not all of that is good news--the difference in valuation is due to a gap between the two companies' comparable sales, as well as Home Depot's 'survivor' status, but Sigman sees that as an opportunity for Lowe's. Secondly, he writes that housing's ongoing strenght is good news for Lowe's, and third his research shows that about half of the sales and margin gap between Lowe's and Home Depot is fixable.	http://finance.yahoo.com/r/f0f302d6-0df9-3900-bac5-41dcc294a05a/lowes-its-not-home-depot-but-maybe-it-doesnt-need-to-be-1516130755?mod=yahoobarrons&ru=yahoo&yptr=yahoo&.tsrc=rss
