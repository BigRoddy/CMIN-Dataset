2021-04-09	2021-04-09 04:01:14	UL	Unilever PLC	Beyond Burgers: China Plant-Based Protein Market Growing Up	(Bloomberg) -- China is driving growth in Asia’s plant-based protein market as health-conscious consumers embrace an array of new products, according to Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., one of the world’s biggest agricultural traders.The uptake of locally-sourced plant-based protein has generally been faster in China than in other parts of the world and the industry there is moving quickly beyond burger analogues, according to ADM Asia Pacific President Leo Liu. Alternatives to shrimp and shellfish, plant-based cheeses and ready-to-eat protein snacks are all becoming more popular, he said.“Awareness and interest in plant-based proteins as an alternative to meat is growing,” the Shanghai-based Liu said in an interview. Chinese people are experimenting with plant-based options as they look for protein-rich diets that are sustainable, convenient and meet food safety standards, he said.ADM -- one of the big four agricultural traders along with Cargill Inc., Bunge Ltd., and Louis Dreyfus Co. -- already has extensive operations throughout China and will be investing more in alternative proteins there, Liu said. The company forecasts China’s plant-based protein market will grow to $14.5 billion in 2025 from under $10 billion in 2018.The rising interest in plant-based protein dovetails with Beijing’s increasing focus on the environment and food security. Self-sufficiency featured strongly in China’s latest five-year plan that came after the country’s hog herd had been devastated by African swine fever and the trade war with the U.S. as well as the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the fragility of global supply chains.Diversifying protein intake to plant-based sources could help China cope with future meat shortages, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Alvin Tai and Ashley Kim said in a report released in February. Reducing meat consumption is also part of China’s strategy to reduce its carbon intensity by more than 65% from 2005 levels by 2030, they said.The growing number of Chinese flexitarians -- people who are mostly vegetarian but occasionally eat meat or fish -- is helping to spur alternative food startups across the country, Liu said. “Consumers are moving away from an obsession with calorie counts to focusing on food’s intrinsic value.”Many China-based companies will continue to increase production capabilities as the popularity of plant-based meat continues to rise, Fitch Solutions said in a March 31 note.OmniFoods is distributing a ground pork substitute in Hong Kong, and mainland company Whole Perfect Food sells vegan bacon. Chinese startups Zhenmeat and Starfield Food & Science Technology, meanwhile, have sought funding to develop their own meat substitutes.Global InterestA bevy of global food titans are also seeking to get in on the action. Cargill started a plant-based meat products brand called PlantEver that’s sold directly to Chinese consumers last year, while industry pioneer Beyond Meat Inc. opened its first manufacturing facility outside the U.S. near Shanghai this week. Livekindly Collective, a group of alternative protein brands steered by a former Unilever Plc executive, also has plans to expand in China.ADM, which says it’s now the largest plant-based protein provider in the world, has for years been diversifying away from trading bulk crops and into higher-margin food manufacturing. The company expects its nutrition unit, which contains its plant-based protein business, to become as large or even larger than its legacy business of buying and shipping crops by 2050.See also: Beyond Meat Has an Ancient Foe in China -- Tofu: David FicklingOne of the biggest potential hurdles for the industry in China is competition from long-existing and cheaper soy-based products such as tofu, Liu said.“While it might take some time to educate consumers about the new generation of plant-based food, the demand for plant-based foods in China will have a huge market potential once perception starts to shift and the taste and flavor of plant-based foods continue to improve,” he said.(Updates with comment from Fitch Solutions in 8th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beyond-burgers-china-plant-based-210000770.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-12	2021-03-12 20:52:04	UL	Unilever PLC	Slumping Naked Brands Is Nearing the Point of No Return	Way back there in 2017, Naked Brand Group Inc. (NASDAQ:NAKD) traded in territory worthy of a mega-buff body builder. If I have my figures right, NAKD stock topped $1,400 per share on Feb. 10, 2017. It was a heady time for a company that, in its own words, “focused on enhancing the architecture of the body.” Source: Shutterstock Fast forward to 2021, and “architecture of the body” might as well be an Ostrogoth ruin. NAKD stock trades at around $1 per share. That means you’d have to sell in excess of 20 shares to buy a four-pack of the company’s Bendon Move With Me Boyleg Briefs. Huh. Just where are those boylegs moving to if they’re joined at the hip to a company whose new tagline might as well be “the Naked and the dead”? Sadly, there was hope for NAKD stock as recently as late January, when its share price shot up more than 300% in three days. For that you can credit the same redditors and the members of r/Wallstreetbets who picked GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) as one of their underdog stocks to back. In fact, the two rocket rides paralleled each other on the calendar.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips But now? It’s a case of whether the intimate apparel company is cliff diving into a lingerie swan song. NAKD Stock and the Danger of Delisting Poor NAKD stock. We could at this point pause to ask what the analysts think. That is, if we could find a single analyst who cares, because apparently none do. It’s the same sort of sad feeling when I visit the order page for those Move With Me Boyleg Briefs and see that not a single customer has left a comment. 7 OTC Stocks That Could Still Run with the Big Boys Even the rebels of Reddit apparently got bored with Naked Brands sometime around Feb. 1. Since then, NAKD stock has dropped some 40%. Nor does the skid show any signs of stopping. Now below that psychologically important dollar-per-share level, this investment simply reeks of inevitable failure. Last July, the company had to beg the Nasdaq for more time to avoid delisting. Shares traded for 63 cents. Extrapolating the current rate of decline since Feb. 1, NAKD stock will hit that same rude landing before the end of April. You have no idea how much I hate writing this. It’s difficult at best to find any evidence of impropriety, corruption or mass incompetence to rival Bear Stearns here. Out of Fashion, from Wall Street to the Runway To the contrary, NAKD stock may be a victim of its sector. Fashion is notoriously fickle. Tastes change. Brands get blackballed or relegated to thrift shop clearance for no rational reason. But if Beyonce, Justin Timberlake or even a mitten-clad Bernie Sanders sport your stuff, it’s a license to print money. Turns out Wall Street and the fashion runway aren’t so different after all. Far be it from me to advise Naked Brand Group. But if they tapped my content marketing experience, I’d suggest they seek the endorsement of history’s most famous underdogs. This would get attention, raise awareness, generate some amusing press and maybe give the company a new lease on life. Come on. Can’t you just picture a Frederick’s of Hollywood Alexia Love Mesh Teddy grafted onto a lithograph of Vincent “I never sold one of my paintings” Van Gogh? Or: maybe get someone as universally detested as the My Pillow guy to model one of their teeny-weeny men’s bathing suits. As PR moves go, everybody wins. Look. What else will help NAKD stock at this point if even the likes of Roaring Kitty have walked away? Unless … Next to Nothing Left, Or Left to Lose With nothing to lose, you might as well go for it. That kind of thinking launched Dollar Shave Club, where a video by a frustrated improv comic named Michael Dubin scored more than 15 million views. It cost $5,000 to shoot. It helped him raise $190 million in venture capital. Dubin sold the company for $1 billion to Unilever (NYSE:UL) and stepped down in January. Naked Brands should be so lucky: $1 billion is more than double what the company is currently worth. And with its back to wall, it will have to make its own luck. Where NAKD stock is concerned, the turnaround needs to begin now. Without it, delisting once again becomes a distinct possibility. Where the company goes from there is deeper into penny-stock territory until it literally finds itself stripped naked. For me to recommend that you avoid NAKD stock seems beyond stating the obvious. Suffice to say that this stands as a cautionary tale about the hazards of buy and hold; certain stocks never recover from a losing streak. You need to know when to cut your losses. But that shouldn’t be your concern if you avoid investing even one thin dime on this slumping penny stock. Focus instead on enhancing the architecture of your portfolio’s body.

2021-03-09	2021-03-09 18:02:19	UL	Unilever PLC	Unilever, Citing Inclusion Advocacy, Drops 'Normal' From Product Packaging And Marketing	Unilever (NYSE:UL) announced it's removing the word “normal” from the packaging and marketing of its beauty and personal care brands as part of a new “Positive Beauty” campaign to advocate for diversity and inclusion. What Happened: The London-headquartered company – whose brands Dove, Lifebuoy, Axe and Sunsilk – said the removal of “normal” was based on a survey that polled 10,000 people across nine countries (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the U.K. and the U.S.). The survey found 56% of respondents stating the beauty and personal care industry has the power to make people feel excluded, with 74% saying they want the industry to focus “more on making people feel better than just looking better.” Seven in 10 respondents felt the word “normal” had a negative impact when used in product packaging and marketing, while more than half said they considered stance on societal issues before buying its products. See Also: Megan Rapinoe Talks Cannabis, Feminism: 'Everyone Needs To Have A Seat At The Table' What's Next: “With one billion people using our beauty and personal care products every day, and even more seeing our advertising, our brands have the power to make a real difference to people’s lives,” said Sunny Jain, Unilever’s president for beauty and personal care. “As part of this, we are committed to tackling harmful norms and stereotypes and shaping a broader, far more inclusive definition of beauty. “We know that removing ‘normal’ from our products and packaging will not fix the problem alone, but it is an important step forward,” Jain added. “It’s just one of a number of actions we are taking as part of our Positive Beauty vision, which aims not only to do less harm, but more good for both people and the planet.” In addition to retiring the word “normal” from its promotional vocabulary, Unilever also pledged not digitally alter a person’s body shape, size and skin color in its brand advertising while increasing the number of advertisements portraying people from diverse groups who have been traditionally underrepresented in marketing campaigns.

2021-02-12	2021-02-12 14:40:41	UL	Unilever PLC	Jumia Shows Some Great Potential, but JMIA Stock Is Really Stretched	Jumia Technologies (NYSE:JMIA), which operates an e-commerce platform and mobile payments system in Africa, has suddenly become a darling on Wall Street. Note that JMIA stock has gone from $8 in September to about $65. The market capitalization is roughly $5.8 billion. Source: Christopher Penler / Shutterstock.com The company was smart to capitalize on this run-up. In early December, Jumia pulled off an “at the market” offering of shares, raising $243.2 million. This was certainly critical as the balance sheet needed a boost. About eight years ago, Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec started Jumia. They both had extensive experience working a McKinsey, such as for clients on areas like e-commerce and packaged goods.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This proved to be spot-on for developing Jumia, and the founder had little trouble raising money. While growth was strong in the early years, the company would ultimately get overextend forcing Jumia had to leave various countries as well as cut back on costs. 8 Cheap Stocks Under $20 That Could Double But despite all this, the platform is still robust. Jumia has 6.7 million annual active consumers and 110,000 active sellers. The platform also has a wide array of top brands like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Unilever (NYSE:UL), HP (NYSE:HPQ), Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). This has been key for generating engagement. For the most part, the African market has been neglected by the large e-commerce players. Instead, the focus has been more on India and parts of South America. Yet Africa is certainly an attractive opportunity. The population is 1.3 billion and there are 523 million Internet users. Consumer spending is over $4 trillion. There are also 17 million small and medium-sized businesses. The Jumia Stock Growth Story Growth has been choppy for Jumia. During the latest quarter, the GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) was actually down 28% on a year-over-year basis to 187.3 million euros, but it is important to keep a few things in mind. First of all, Jumia has been changing the mix of its product line towards higher-margin items and has streamlined the business model. Next, the company has been taking steps to realize efficiencies. In fact, a big part of this has been the leveraging of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In other words, the strategy is to pursue profitable growth. And for the most part, the company is getting results. In the quarter, there was a 22% improvement in gross profits on a year-over-year basis. Something else to note: The mobile payments business is showing lots of momentum. As seen with the companies like Square (NYSE:SQ) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), this can be a lucrative category – and can be big in terms of driving shareholder value. In the quarter, Jumia reported its payments platform grew by 50% to 48 million euros. Bottom Line on JMIA stock The hope is that Jumia will become the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Africa. Yet this is probably too optimistic. If anything, as the African market starts to show more progress, e-commerce giants like Amazon and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) will probably target the opportunity. Such companies do not necessarily need to be first-movers to get a big share of the market. Besides, when it comes to JMIA stock, it looks as if the valuation is stretched. Of course, we’ve recently seen speculative activity come into the markets, such as with GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC (NYSE:AMC). JMIA stock is trading at a nose-bleed 26 times revenues, so it’s probably best to hold off and wait for a more reasonable valuation for the time being.

2021-02-05	2021-02-05 00:01:00	UL	Unilever PLC	Unified Unilever Looks to Make Larger Deals in Break With Past	(Bloomberg) -- For a company born almost a century ago out of a cross-border merger, Unilever Plc has remained reluctant to embrace transformational deals. Relative to its size and sprawling portfolio spanning Axe deodorant and Knorr stock cubes, Unilever was long satisfied with rounding-error acquisitions that filled a niche.After unifying its headquarters in London late last year and shedding a cumbersome legal structure that hampered its ability to carry out major takeovers, the company is now rethinking that approach. Two years into his term as chief executive officer, Alan Jope is starting to game-plan bigger and bolder deals that have the potential to dramatically change the world of personal-care, nutrition and convenience-food conglomerates.“Our day job is driving value from the portfolio that we have today, but of course unification opens up opportunities that wouldn’t have been there before,” Jope said in an interview. “You need the stars to align on strategy, value creation and timing for any big deal to go ahead — so we’re not going to force the pace, but of course we’re constantly looking at transformational opportunities.”The global consumer-goods industry is at an inflection point. While the pandemic and its soaring demand for mass-market hygiene and comfort food has been kind to owners of old-line brands, pressure is building from agile disruptors. Seemingly spawned overnight on Instagram, their marketing message of premium, organic and local resonates with younger shoppers averse to big business. And as spending gradually shifts away from staple workhorse brands, consolidation stands to become a more common feature in an industry seeking efficiencies by combining purchasing, manufacturing and distribution power.Premium BrandsA Unilever lifer, Jope has made his mark as a dealmaker. While running the Beauty and Personal Care division, the company’s largest, he acquired high-end skincare brands including Ren, Dermalogica and Murad under a subsidiary called Prestige, which now generates about 700 million euros ($840 million) in annual sales.At Nestle SA, Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider has been quicker to reshape the Swiss conglomerate by strengthening its coffee business with a $7 billion licensing accord involving Starbucks Corp.; spending billions on assets for its health push; and moving to divest parts of the water business.Larger deals for Unilever would mark a departure from a tamer portfolio pruning under Jope predecessor Paul Polman. Near the end of his 10-year tenure, Polman had earmarked between 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) and 3 billion euros annually for upstarts such as Dollar Shave Club and a roster of health-focused brands. But it remained small fry for a company with annual revenue in excess of 50 billion euros.Polman also long resisted calls to cull laggard subsidiaries. Then an unsolicited takeover bid in 2017 from Kraft Heinz Co. shocked Unilever into action. It sold its perennially struggling spreads business to private equity a year later.Positive ForceUnilever was among the first major consumer-goods companies expressing a mission to be a positive force in society, arguing that more than a better corporate image, the approach ultimately enhances the value of its products. As part of this drive Unilever aims to achieve 1 billion euros in sales by 2025 from plant-based foods alone. In a presentation to investors on Feb. 4, Jope outlined this area as a key growth driver, giving a hint of where purchases may occur.But before any major deal is struck, Unilever will need to improve the performance at the hundreds of brands critical to its future, including more than a dozen that generate in excess of 1 billion euros in annual sales, such as Dove soap. Then there are higher costs to contend with for ingredients such as tea and palm oil, as well as restructuring expenses weighing on profitability.Only by achieving a more consistent rate of return will Unilever have the support from investors to carry out major buyout plans, said Warren Ackerman, an analyst at Barclays who leads the bank’s consumer staples coverage in Europe. Still, consolidating the previously unwieldy structure in the U.K. gives the company more room to maneuver, he said.“The way I view unification is much more about optionality around bolder portfolio change,” Ackermann said. “In the event that bigger things come up, they should be a lot more nimble and agile.”Slow MoversSelling slow-moving brands, a process also facilitated with a single headquarters in London, has become a priority for Unilever. The company had maintained twin bases since the 1930 merger of Margarine Unie of the Netherlands and U.K. soap maker Lever Brothers which prevented some options, such as initial public offerings, to dispose of assets. An IPO of the tea division, which has historically generated about $3 billion in sales from brands including Lipton and PG Tips, is a “highly likely outcome,” Jope said.Unilever is also working with Credit Suisse on a potential disposal of some beauty brands in the U.S. and Europe with combined revenue of about $600 million, people familiar with the matter said in January.Continuing with his predecessor’s credo, Jope wants each brand to identify its social or environmental purpose to increase its appeal. In turn, he’s pledged to consider selling lines that can’t find a higher calling than purely earning a profit. Unilever says its purposeful labels now grow at more than twice the pace of those that have yet to find their footing with eco-conscious shoppers.“There’s so much value trapped in our current, beautiful portfolio,” Jope said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unified-unilever-looks-larger-deals-000100662.html?.tsrc=rss

Jope, a 36-year company veteran, argues that the politically sensitive unification will make Unilever, one of the world’s largest consumer goods makers, a nimbler player in mergers and acquisitions markets so it can chase higher growth.  Unilever has spent the past few months releasing ambitious climate and social targets, from net zero emissions in its supply chain by 2039 to ensuring all workers supplying the company receive a living wage by 2030.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/273c8d7f-2a80-332c-bf04-c6ec1ccb34e4/the-shackles-are-off%3A.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-04	2021-02-04 09:47:19	UL	Unilever PLC	Unilever Struggles to Keep Rising Costs From Spoiling Rebound	(Bloomberg) -- Unilever Plc rode out Covid as consumers kept buying staples like shampoo and food seasonings during lockdowns. Now higher costs threaten to tarnish the Tresemme and Knorr brand owner’s exit from the pandemic.Raw material prices will probably rise more in 2021, Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said on a conference call with reporters. The shares fell as much as 4.4%.Concern about higher costs overshadowed the return of a previous sales target for annual underlying growth of 3% to 5%. Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope’s job has gotten harder after the pandemic led to the weakest revenue growth in almost two decades last year.The results were “underwhelming” and Unilever’s margins missed estimates on restructuring charges, wrote Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.The company also anticipates a weakening of currencies in emerging markets that have been worst hit by Covid-19, further crimping revenue growth, CFO Pitkethly said.“We’re going to have to be at the top of our game on pricing going into 2021,” Pitkethly said.Unilever also forecast 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in restructuring costs this year and next.Still, Unilever is becoming more optimistic on improving prospects for the U.S., China and India -- three countries that account for a third of its sales. To tap demand from higher-spending millennial shoppers, Jope is also defining new priorities, including more focus on plant-based foods and high-end beauty.The results are Unilever’s first since the company consolidated its headquarters in London, ending its longstanding Anglo-Dutch structure.Jope said an initial public offering for its tea business is a “highly likely outcome,” though Unilever is open to talks with private-equity companies that may be interested in buying it. Unilever management said in October the company aims to separate the unit, which includes brands such as PG Tips, by the end of this year.Jope is also prioritizing the company’s e-commerce business, where revenue rose 60% last year on initiatives such as adding Magnum and Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream brands to orders from pizza partners such as Domino’s.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unilever-restores-revenue-forecast-even-084015502.html?.tsrc=rss

What Happened: Unilever's decision to resume advertising on Facebook and its platforms is the result of the Menlo Park, California-based company making enough progress on harmful content, agreeing to common definitions for harmful content areas, consistently reporting the prevalence of such content, and independent auditing, according to the Journal.Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), which too had halted advertising in July reportedly returned to advertising on Facebook's network on Oct. 15.""We are encouraged by the commitments the platforms are making to build healthier environments for consumers, brands and society in alignment with the principles of the Global Alliance for Responsible Media,' said, Luis Di Como, Unilever's executive vice president for global media.Both Unilever and Coca-Cola are members of the Global Alliance for Responsible Media.Di Como said Unilever  plans to return advertising on the platforms in the United States in January -- adding it would ""continue to reassess our position as necessary.""Why It Matters: The ""Stop Hate for Profit"" campaign called on businesses to temporarily halt advertising on platforms run by the Mark Zuckerberg-led company and made a series of demands from Facebook revolving around stopping hate, violence, antisemitism, and violence this summer.Anglo-Dutch multinational Unilever did not formally sign up for the campaign but withdrew advertising spending on social media platforms run by Facebook and Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) nevertheless, according to the Wall Street Journal.See Also: Starbucks Pauses All Social Media Advertising In Tandem With Growing BoycottIt's worth noting that Unilever subsidiary Ben & Jerry's issued a statement saying it was joining the Stop Hate for Profit campaign in June and suspended its advertising on Facebook's platforms on July 1.Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ) has yet to lift its advertising embargo on Facebook, which it announced this July, the Journal reported.In October, it was reported that social media rival Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) gained from the advertising boycott aimed at Facebook.Price Action: On Thursday Unilever Plc (UN) shares closed 1.03% lower at $60.50, while Unilever Plc (UL) shares closed 0.2% lower at $59.26.

2020-12-09	2020-12-09 19:41:42	UL	Unilever PLC	Microsoft, Unilever Join Amazon Vow to Fight Climate Change	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. has added a competitor to its year-old coalition of companies pledging to reduce their contribution to climate change: Microsoft Corp.The two technology giants, neighbors in the Seattle area and rivals in cloud computing and business software, have each spent much of the last two years announcing increasingly aggressive climate targets, including dueling umbrella organizations for companies willing to do their part to avert the catastrophic warming of the planet. On Wednesday, Microsoft said it had signed onto Amazon’s pact, alongside consumer products giant Unilever Plc and several other new signatories.Amazon, long a laggard among its peers in publicly addressing its impact on the environment, reversed course in recent years, bolstering an internal sustainability team and vowing to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. The company also invited others interested in matching that commitment to sign on to what it calls the Climate Pledge, a forum for comparing notes on best practices and climate-friendly investment opportunities.Microsoft, meanwhile, has said it hopes to use new technologies to remove from the atmosphere all of the greenhouse gases the company was responsible for generating during its entire existence.Lucas Joppa, Microsoft’s Chief Environmental Officer, said the software maker’s previous pledges already more than meet the Climate Pledge standard, but it’s important to send a signal with participation in Amazon’s effort, particularly because less than 5% of Fortune 500 companies have promised to get to net-zero emissions.“There’s been this false perception that there is this kind of climate race,” he said. “There is a climate race, but it’s not between tech companies, it’s between every company and society and time.”The other new Climate Pledgers make for an eclectic mix. Coca-Cola European Partners, the largest Coca-Cola bottler by revenue, joined. So did Harbour Air Ltd., a tour and charter float plane company based near Vancouver, Canada. (Business boosters have long pushed for more frequent routes between Vancouver and Seattle.)And Neste Oyj, a Finnish state-backed oil refiner making a push into renewable energy, became the first signatory that does the bulk of its business in the fossil fuels industry.(Updates with renewable fuels push in the eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-unilever-join-amazon-pledge-150000938.html?.tsrc=rss

Flutter’s Dublin-listed stock will be added to the gauge.Unilever drops out of the index after deciding to eliminate dual legal structures, a move that will result in one class of shares and a single pool of liquidity, providing more flexibility for stock-based dealmaking. Its replacement, Flutter, has rallied 45% year-to-date, partly driven by the completion of the firm’s takeover of PokerStars-owner The Stars Group Inc.Unilever remains part of the wider European benchmarks, yet the step will also affect the Stoxx Europe 600 and Stoxx Europe 50 Index where both the U.K. entity as well as the Dutch shares were included. The latter will be removed from both benchmarks with another lockdown winner, online drug retailer Zur Rose Group AG, taking the place in the larger Stoxx Europe 600, while tech investor Prosus NV will join the Stoxx Europe 50 gauge.Inclusion in widely followed indexes is becoming more important for companies in a world increasingly dominated by passive investment funds. Bank of America Corp. strategists predict that equity assets in index-tracking funds will surpass actively managed portfolios in August 2021.All index changes announced on Thursday will become effective Nov. 30.

2020-11-19	2020-11-19 14:58:51	UL	Unilever PLC	Price Over Earnings Overview: Unilever	Looking into the current session, Unilever Inc. (NYSE: UL) is trading at $59.10, after a 0.61% drop. Over the past month, the stock fell by 4.01%, but over the past year, it actually increased by 1.53%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 7.50%.  The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings. View more earnings on ULDepending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.

The growth, a fivefold increase on this year’s €200 million sales estimate, will be fueled by the expansion of its Vegetarian Butcher meat-free label, as well as increasing vegan alternatives from brands including Hellmann’s, Magnum and Wall’s, Unilever  (UL)(UK:ULVR) said in a statement on Wednesday.  The Anglo-Dutch company has taken steps in recent years to capitalize on the booming demand in meat alternatives.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/7831b68e-552f-3e80-8c4e-d4b217df721d/ben-%26-jerry%E2%80%99s%2C-breyers-and.html?.tsrc=rss

Investing in overseas stocks carries its own set of risks, including the impact of currency exchange and geopolitical turmoil.

2020-09-24	2020-09-24 19:50:37	UL	Unilever PLC	Unilever Stock Isn’t Just an Anti-Recession Play Anymore	"As a household goods company well known for beauty products along with food and beverages, Unilever (NYSE:UL) is a great idea to incorporate in a recession-resistant portfolio. However, due to the mundane nature of its business, Unilever stock doesn't really generate headlines. But that has changed over the last few weeks, necessitating a deeper look into the organization.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com Most prominently, Dutch UL shareholders have overwhelmingly supported a proposal to transfer the Anglo-Dutch company into a sole London-based entity. Perhaps not a commonly known fact, Unilever is quite the complicated beast given its multinational structure.By moving the organization under one national umbrella, management can greatly simplify its tax structure.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFurthermore, FT.com reports that ""The company has said a successful move to simplify its corporate structure would make equity-based acquisitions or disposals easier and faster."" Theoretically, this should be a positive for Unilever stock due to the inherent fiscal efficiencies. However, there's a major hurdle: in Dutch politics, support has increased for hitting multinational corporations leaving the Netherlands with billions of euros in exit taxes.Not surprisingly, then, Unilever stock has been choppy recently, with investors unsure how to digest the latest developments. Adding to the confusion, UL management has stated it would reconsider the initiative if it were to be impacted by the proposed Dutch tax.  * 7 High-Potential Undervalued Stocks to Buy Nicknamed ""Hotel California"" after the Eagles' song lyric, ""you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave,"" Unilever stock faces a penalty of 11 billion euros if the underlying company heads exclusively for English pastures.I must say that the Dutch have a twisted sense of humor. Fortunately, that's not the only newsmaker for Unilever stock. ESG Catalysts Could Lift Unilever Stock Over the Long RunOn Wednesday, Sept. 23, Cosmopolitan released a much more interesting (at least to me, anyways) headline. Unilever has made a significant step toward advancing its United for America initiative. According to Cosmo contributor Mariah Schlossmann, this is a program that: ""seeks to help struggling communities in major U.S. cities tackle the current challenges facing Americans due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the initiative was launched in March, Unilever has partnered with a number of retailers to raise over $20 million for affected communities, with a new commitment to donate an additional $5 million before the end of the year.""In the second phase of the program, Unilever will support 10 U.S. communities. Specifically, the company will address ""issues of the education gap, limited access to food and other essential supplies, and the support of women-owned businesses."" Clearly, the company's actions will position Unilever stock as an environmental, social and governance (ESG) play. Not only that, the timing couldn't have been better.Although it's an ugly topic that is frequently trolled by far-right groups and the blissfully ignorant, the novel coronavirus pandemic has disproportionately impacted communities of color. And that means presently, we have two racial demographics in the U.S.: white and non-white.  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart by Josh Enomoto Since 2000, the unemployment gap between white workers and people of color has significantly declined. Although it increased unfavorably to communities of color following the 2008 financial crisis, the gap declined noticeably during the first three years of the Trump administration. So, let's give credit where it's due.However, in this year, the unemployment gap has accelerated, with white workers enjoying a much more robust recovery than people of color. Until this gap improves to where it was during Trump's administration pre-pandemic, we may see increased tensions in this country. Covid-19 Has Also Set Back WomenAnother reason why Unilever's initiative is so critical is because women have also been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Because female consumers make up a significant core of Unilever's marketing efforts, the company's equality program is a win-win.Plus, it's just the right thing to do. During the 1950s through 1970s, the unemployment gap between men and women was 31% favoring the gents. But thanks to progressive politics and the empowerment of women in the workplace, that gap narrowed to less than 2% in the 1980s. From the 1990s to the end of last decade, the gap was 4% in favor of women.  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart by Josh Enomoto But this year, all that progress has been reversed, with the unemployment gap up 6.6% favoring men.Now, the typical conservative pushback is that women mostly occupy ""soft"" jobs while men occupy ""hard"" jobs. But that dynamic doesn't quite explain economic utility. For instance, how many apps do we really need?More importantly, women outperformed men in terms of unemployment, with the gap of 15% favoring female workers between 2008 and 2011. Those were very difficult years. So, what happened this time around that men are now back on top?Well, the beauty of Unilever stock is that the underlying company isn't sitting around shrugging its shoulders. Management is actively promoting programs to help rebalance this economy, something that our elected officials should be doing more of. Great Story, Great CompanyFrequently, when discussing recession-resistant companies, I've picked out UL stock because of secular demand. No matter how bad things get, you're going to need to eat and drink. Further, as the economy improves, the company offers several brands that should perform well as discretionary purchasing power increases.But Unilever is now an organization that's taking corporate governance very seriously. It's not just talking the talk but walking the walk. And what a great time it is to get some fresh air.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

2020-09-17	2020-09-17 14:10:51	UL	Unilever PLC	Facebook Focuses on Small Businesses, Ignores Celebrity Pause	(Bloomberg) -- Civil rights groups escalated their campaign to encourage boycotts of Facebook Inc. this week. Their StopHateForProfit initiative, which already convinced scores of top-tier companies to pull advertising in July, rallied celebrities to stop posting on Facebook-owned Instagram on Wednesday.But Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, appears unfazed. She’s been spending the last few months worrying about a bigger advertising problem: the Covid-19 crisis, and how it threatens to shutter small businesses.The majority of Facebook’s advertising revenue doesn’t come from the major brands, like Verizon Communications Inc. and Unilever NV that joined the summer boycott and grabbed headlines. Instead, it’s driven by smaller companies -- the hair salons, bakeries and gyms most severely affected by public health restrictions around the world.Facebook didn’t make any major changes to satisfy the StopHateForProfit brands. “We agreed with their premise,” Sandberg said. “We don’t want hate on our platform.” Meanwhile, the company was scrambling to come up with solutions for more vulnerable companies. Facebook, with more than 3 billion users on its properties around the world, isn’t immune to global economic swings.In the early days of the pandemic, Facebook quickly built ways for small businesses to solicit donations to continue paying their employees, to distribute gift cards and to build online storefronts with e-commerce tools. On Thursday, the company announced Facebook Business Suite, which makes it possible to post, see notifications and receive messages from Facebook and Instagram accounts at the same time. The tool will be available only to small businesses first, before expanding to larger companies next year.“The more businesses or small businesses thrive online, the more small businesses become advertisers,” Sandberg said.The choice to focus on small businesses, instead of appeasing the big guys, is working out for Facebook so far. The StopHateForProfit campaign continued, with celebrities Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry, Naomi Campbell and others pausing their Instagram posts for a day. But among major brands, “most of our advertisers are back,” Sandberg said. “Most of them who had paused have unpaused.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-focuses-small-businesses-ignores-141051538.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-08	2020-09-08 13:53:32	UL	Unilever PLC	Unusual Options Activity Insight: Unilever	"Shares of Unilever (NYSE: UN) saw some unusual options activity on Tuesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $58.18.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-16  * Strike Price: $60.00  * Volume: 1649  * Open Interest: 2678Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally high. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Analyzing Cinemark Hldgs's Unusual Options Activity  * Analyzing STMicroelectronics's Unusual Options Activity  * Understanding Tesla's Unusual Options Activity(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-18	2020-08-18 07:33:47	UL	Unilever PLC	Ben and Jerry’s Maker Uses Phones to Track Sustainable Palm Oil	(Bloomberg) -- Unilever is planning to use new geo-location technology to make its palm oil supply chains more transparent and tackle a farm-to-table traceability problem that has plagued the industry for decades.The maker of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Dove soap will use cell phone geo-location data to track palm oil moving across thousands of supply chains and to achieve the elusive “first-mile” traceability. After a pilot test in Indonesia, Unilever is scaling up that approach to cover all palm facilities in Southeast Asia, including farms, refineries and processing plants, and is looking into whether the technology can be applied to other regions.“With a clearer picture, it’s easier to estimate the risk of issues, such as deforestation,” says Marc Engel, chief supply chain officer at Unilever. “We want to be the first to know, and the first to act.”The technology is another step toward making the controversial industry more transparent as growers face increasing scrutiny over production of the oil used in everything from chocolate to lipstick and shampoo. Rapid expansion of plantations in past decades, fueled by surging demand for a cheap and versatile edible oil, has been linked to the burning of tropical rainforests, destruction of wildlife and land conflicts with local communities.Environmental concerns have spurred the adoption of sustainable palm oil, but complex supply chains that begin with estates spanning millions of hectares make it difficult for the industry to be fully traceable. What’s more, the credibility of certified-sustainable palm oil, like that of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, has been questioned by environmental groups who say greenwashing and bad practices still take place, albeit hidden from the public.Palm oil is one of the most important raw ingredients in Unilever’s products. The consumer goods giant purchases about 1 million tons of palm oil, palm kernel oil and derivatives annually for use in products such as ice cream, cosmetics and soaps, making it one of the world’s largest buyers. It aims to make all its supply chains deforestation-free by 2023.First MileThe first mile, which oversees palm oil from estates to mills, is a “particularly unique challenge for sustainable sourcing,” Engel said. “Crops such as palm oil fruit or soy can be harvested from lots of different areas of land, belonging to several farmers, and mixed with raw material from other farms or plantations several times before reaching the mill,” he said.Providing granular visibility into Unilever’s palm-supply chains is Orbital Insight, a California-based Big Data company that uses geo-location data, satellites, drones and balloons to track what’s happening on the planet. Orbital will use a combination of geo-fencing, anonymous mobile data and satellite imagery to monitor movement of trucks and their deliveries, and to identify any deforestation that has taken place in the past, or recently, at suppliers’ sites. For example, it’ll be able to track if a virgin rainforest was leveled to plant oil palm or to build roads and buildings.“This is the first time we’re dealing with palm oil this way, and it’s the first time we’re using cell-phone pings to uncover the structure of the supply chain,” James Crawford, founder and chief executive officer at Orbital said in an interview. “We’re looking at what’s actually happening everyday on the ground and tracing materials all the way back to the first mile -- which farms are linked to which mills, which mills are linked to which refineries, and which refineries are linked to which warehouses.”It’s consumers that are driving manufacturers to seek better visibility into where raw materials are sourced from, especially if it involves commodities associated with farming practices that aren’t sustainable, Crawford said.“All these companies are being pushed by their end-customers who are buying in the grocery stores based on the ability of these different products to be certified as sustainably developed,” he said. After developing the tracking technique for palm, Orbital is now getting interest ranging from chocolate manufacturers to furniture makers trying to understand where their goods are sourced from, and if the coronavirus is causing any supply disruptions.“One way to ensure that the products people choose to buy are sustainable, is by becoming more transparent, and that’s something everyone wants to see, including consumers and investors,” Unilever’s Engel said. Besides palm, the company’s running a pilot test on soy mills in Brazil, and looking into how the technology can be applied to other raw materials like cocoa and wood fiber.Orbital has received funding in the past from Bloomberg Beta, a venture-capital unit of Bloomberg LP.(Updates to add comment in penultimate paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ben-jerry-maker-uses-phones-210000058.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-31	2020-07-31 23:45:53	UL	Unilever PLC	GM Halts Facebook Ads in Push to Prod Action on Hate Content	(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co. is unhappy with Facebook Inc.’s efforts to keep hateful and disparaging content away from the automaker’s brands and has joined peer Ford Motor Co. and other companies that have stopped advertising with the social-media company.GM said Friday it has paused placing ads on Facebook in recent weeks and is in talks with the company about improving efforts to eliminate harmful content on its popular platform.GM’s move is a sign that the pressure on Facebook will continue in August and potentially longer. Ford and Honda Motor Co.’s U.S. subsidiary also said Friday they have no plans to resume spending on Facebook. On Thursday, Unilever NV-owned ice-cream brand Ben & Jerry’s extended through the end of the year its halt of paid social-media advertising.“We are not satisfied with the progress Facebook has taken to date and therefore have paused our media investment with the platform,” GM said in a statement. “We are encouraging them to move faster to implement meaningful change so that we can quickly return to a safer digital space that mirrors our brand values.”Ford Reloads YouTubeFord said it is evaluating efforts to curb hate speech on social media operated by Facebook and its unit Instagram Inc., as well as by Snap Inc., Twitter Inc. and TikTok Inc. platforms. However the automaker announced it will resume ads on Alphabet Inc. unit YouTube and Pinterest Inc. after a 30-day pause.“This is an ongoing evaluation and we will continue to monitor all platforms with checkpoints on progress towards our ad accountability agenda,” Ford spokesman Said Deep said in an email. “We will continue to be actively engaged with industry initiatives led by the Association of National Advertisers to drive more accountability, transparency and trusted measurement to clean up the digital and social-media ecosystem.”A month ago, when the StopHateForProfit campaign started, many big corporations said they would stop advertising for the month of July. At that time, GM said it was reviewing its marketing.The automaker qualified its Friday announcement by saying it already had cut its advertising during the pandemic, reflecting lower production and less traffic in showrooms. Its budget for Facebook advertising did not involve a large sum of money, said GM spokesman Jim Cain.(Updates with Ford and Honda keeping ads off Facebook in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-pauses-facebook-ads-push-203459692.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-28	2020-07-28 05:30:15	UL	Unilever PLC	Working From Home Is Terrible News for Landlords	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Early on in the pandemic, reports of the death of the office appeared greatly exaggerated. But as Covid-19 lingers, and second infection spikes dot the global map, something is changing in how employees and employers view the workplace: It’s being seen as an option rather than a necessity for many white-collar workers.Once we get the pandemic under control, this shift will be welcomed by cost-cutting companies and staff who dread the daily commute. But for the owners of commercial property — already reeling from the move away from brick-and-mortar retail — the consequences may be severe. The market values of commercial real-estate companies, such as Land Securities Group Plc and British Land Co. Plc, have plummeted.This isn’t just a question of tech workers at Alphabet Inc., Twitter Inc. or Facebook Inc. taking the relatively straightforward step of doing their stuff from home. All kinds of companies are making the same calculation. Alan Jope, boss of consumer goods giant Unilever, doesn’t see workers ever returning to offices 100%. Swiss bank UBS Group AG says a third of its employees could keep operating from home.With property being a big business cost, employers would love to cut their space. Burberry Group Plc, a British luxury company, is exploring whether it can save money on its offices outside the U.K.Analysts at UBS assume that, on average, working one or two days a week at home could become the norm. That would have big implications for office vacancy rates, which have a close correlation to rents. In London’s West End commercial district, for example, more home working — together with an impending recession — could mean the vacancy rate rising from 3.3% in the first quarter of 2020 to just over 10% at the end of the year, according to UBS. It might still be 11.5% in 2022, the bank said.The real crunch won’t come immediately. Susan Munden, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, notes that commercial tenants are tied into leases, and there are heavy costs in exiting rental agreements early. At the biggest European real-estate firms, average leases are four to eight years.Better news for the property industry is that it will be able to reuse commercial space as residential developments assuming people still want to live in cities once the pandemic ebbs. By cutting supply in this way, UBS estimates that the West End office vacancy rate could stabilize at 5.1% by 2025.And the office won’t disappear altogether. While Zoom does well enough for the more transactional elements of work, there’s no substitute for face-to-face interaction when collaborating on a creative project, building trust with clients or mentoring staff. Yet landlords will have to work harder. Tenants already wanted modern, environmentally friendly buildings with good quality air, outside terraces and facilities such as bicycle storage. Covid will accelerate this trend.Real-estate providers like Derwent London Plc — known for stylish buildings including the White Collar Factory in Shoreditch, which boasts a rooftop running track — may be better placed. British Land has taken note of the change, refurbishing parts of the flagship Broadgate estate it manages in London. Gecina SA, a Paris property specialist whose mission is to “design, build and manage living spaces to enrich the experience of our customers,” saw its net-asset value rise in the first half of this year.Even as offices lose staff to home-working, they may need to retain space to make sure desks can be kept the right distance apart. Given more stringent hygiene requirements, hot-desking might be less desirable. Meanwhile, if the office is used for more collaborative work, more room might be set aside for meeting areas. British Land is already seeing demand from companies seeking short-term overspill space.Tenants' greater desire for flexibility — whether that’s through shorter leases or monthly rent payments — will nevertheless be a challenge for landlords, who need some certainty to service their own extensive borrowings. In the Covid era, such long-term guarantees are in short supply. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

The Anglo-Dutch company has been forming partnerships with the likes of Domino’s Pizza and Deliveroo to build a wide network of e-commerce avenues. As heat waves spurred demand in recent months, Unilever could quickly adapt to changing consumer behavior because it had the online ice-cream business ready.That helped Unilever defy analysts’ expectations for a slump in second-quarter revenue because of lockdowns. Growth in at-home consumption offset a 35% drop in on-the-go sales of ice cream. Online sales helped because they typically command prices higher than at supermarkets.The shares rose 7.9% in London, making Unilever the biggest member of the benchmark FTSE 100 Index with a market value of 121.8 billion pounds ($155 billion).“One of the things we’re observing is e-everything,” Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “A lot of the growth that we’ve seen in ice cream is people enjoying ice cream at the end of a meal as part of a home-delivery service.

2020-07-21	2020-07-21 18:59:36	UL	Unilever PLC	Microsoft Makes First Climate Fund Investment, Joins Green Group	(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. said the first investment for its $1 billion climate fund will be in venture capital firm Energy Impact Partners. The software maker also joined with Nike Inc., Starbucks Corp., Unilever NV and Danone SA in a new consortium devoted to sharing resources and tactics for slashing carbon emissions, bringing together the efforts of some of the biggest global companies that have pledged to take action against climate change. The software giant’s $50 million investment will bolster the VC firm's backing of new technologies for greener energy and transportation systems. New York-based EIP, a utility-company backed fund with $1.2 billion in assets under management, has invested in companies that make software for improving underlying energy networks and in Urbint, an artificial intelligence company that has a technology for preventing methane leaks. Microsoft announced in January that it plans to be carbon negative — removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it emits — by 2030, and the software maker allocated $1 billion to a climate-innovation fund to invest in ways to reduce and remove carbon emissions, one of the most aggressive corporate plans. By 2050, the company plans to remove the equivalent of all of its emissions since Microsoft’s founding in 1975. Amazon.com Inc. has also made a carbon-neutral pledge and recruited other companies to join. Both technology giants have come under fire from climate activists for continuing to provide cloud-computing services to large oil and gas producers. The company’s funding isn’t enough — more players and investments are needed, said Chief Environmental Officer Lucas Joppa in a speech Tuesday at a Bloomberg Green event. “We need additional applied research funding,” he said. Microsoft, which is looking to remove 1 million metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere in the 12 months that began July 1, is most interested in techniques that are permanent or long-lasting. It’s less interested in methods that require complicated accounting, Joppa said. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft also said it will partner with Sol Systems, a renewable energy developer and investor, on 500 megawatts of solar energy, Microsoft’s biggest renewable-energy portfolio investment. That will include at least $50 million in investments in parts of the U.S. most impacted by environmental issues— regions hurt by pollution, for example. Projects will prioritize businesses owned by women and minorities and will include money for jobs and skills training and habitat restoration. That amount of solar energy is enough to power about 95,000 homes, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.The group, called Transform to Net Zero, also includes automaker Mercedes-Benz AG; Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S; Indian information-tech firm Wipro Ltd; and Natura & Co., the Brazilian cosmetics firm that owns Avon. The alliance, which plans to recruit other members, will work with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund and will share information on cutting emissions, investing in carbon-reduction technology and coordinating on public policy goals.In addition, Microsoft will stop using diesel in its data centers by 2030. The fuel is typically used as a backup power source for cloud data centers.(Updates with Microsoft comments in the fourth paragraph.

2020-07-13	2020-07-13 08:00:00	UL	Unilever PLC	Trump Outpaces Biden in Zeroing In on Voters With Facebook Tools	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump uses Facebook like a Swiss Army knife -- to raise money, amplify his message, and mobilize voters. His rival, Joe Biden, uses the increasingly controversial social platform primarily to stick his hand out for donations.As he did in 2016, Trump is taking advantage of the social media giant’s granular knowledge of its users’ interests to target specific ads to specific people, and is doing so much more often than Biden. This “micro-targeting” allows Trump to tap into Facebook’s unique ability to rally his base of voters, who he needs to motivate as he trails Biden in most election polls.Since entering the presidential contest in April 2019, Biden has spent $21 million on Facebook ads compared to $33 million for Trump over the same period, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. But the two campaigns are spending the money very differently.On Friday, people familiar with the company’s thinking said Facebook was considering banning political ads ahead of the U.S. election, but for now it still allows candidates to narrowly target voters using its data.Micro-targeting is using all the data social networks have on a user, from location to political leaning to what brands they buy, to generate the perfect ad.Twitter Ad BanGoogle has limited how political campaigns can target voters using its digital ad sales platform, and Twitter has banned campaign ads altogether. Twitter said it did so because of the potential for ads to spread misleading information, while Google said its policy means ads are more widely viewed and available for public discussion like ones airing on television and radio are.Facebook has also taken only limited steps to ban hate speech that infiltrates some users feeds, which has led some large companies like Unilever NV, Coca-Cola Co. and Starbucks Corp. to temporarily pull their ad dollars from the site.Users can be targeted based on all kinds of information, including search and travel history. And the ads can be tweaked over time to make them more effective. The Trump campaign does constant testing of its ads and makes small changes on a daily basis.Through the morning of July 8 Biden’s campaign had bought about 23,000 distinct ads on the platform compared to more than 489,000 for Trump, according to a Bloomberg analysis of data made available by Facebook. About 68% of the president’s ads are seen fewer than 1,000 times compared to 34% for Biden, suggesting much more specific micro-targeting by Trump’s campaign.Petition DrivesBiden’s campaign is focused on raising money and attacking Trump. So far he hasn’t used Facebook to hone his message or mobilize supporters, but he’s included appeals to sign petitions, which help him build up his list of email contacts, and to donate. Recent pitches asked for 2.5 million supporters to take a stand against Trump’s “hatred, division and calls for violence” by signing an online petition.Offering less variation in his Facebook ads could hurt Biden’s efforts to reach the voters he needs, said Damon McCoy, director of the Online Political Ads Transparency Project and a professor at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering. “It’s probably causing them to be less effective,” he said, because the campaign isn’t getting the same level of audience feedback.Trump’s campaign used Facebook in February to motivate voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, even as he was virtually unopposed in those state’s Republican nominating contests. The campaign put out almost 1,200 ads, which included links to find caucus or polling locations, that were seen between 1.4 million and 2.8 million times.Voter TurnoutTrump ran away with both contests, getting support of 97% of caucus-goers in Iowa and turning out 2.6 times more voters in New Hampshire than Barack Obama, another incumbent without a serious primary challenger, did in 2012. Trump used the outcome as evidence of the strength of his support.According to Facebook, which provides data on impressions, cost and other metrics in broad ranges, the total cost of the messaging was between $18,800 and $139,406.The focus on targeted ads likely helped Trump gain a big lead in early fund-raising, according to Will Bunnett, a principal at the progressive digital ad agency Clarify. But Trump may have another advantage over Biden in using the platform, he said, because of the way Facebook’s algorithm puts ads in front of people who’ll interact with them, often by getting riled up.“The easiest way to get people to interact with your ads is to get them mad about something,” Bunnett said. “Facebook is a pretty natural fit for him in a way that it might not be for Joe Biden.”Trump’s PreoccupationsA senior Trump campaign official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the campaign was constantly testing “thousands upon thousands” of ads so voters “are hearing the facts about this president.”The Biden campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment.Some of Trump’s Facebook ads reflect his rhetoric and preoccupations.There are more than 50,000 ads mentioning “impeachment,” preceded by the word “bogus” more than 1,000 times, followed by “witch hunt” more than 4,000 times. About 40,000 ads refer to “fake news.”Old campaign themes like “build the wall” and “drain the swamp” mingle with concerns about Antifa, a loosely-defined left-wing movement Trump said was involved in the June street protests, and which appears in more than 2,000 ads. Attacks on calls to “defund the police” have been in 715 ads so far, since the term made its debut in a June 19 fund-raising pitch.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-outpaces-biden-zeroing-voters-080000022.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-10	2020-07-10 14:00:19	UL	Unilever PLC	Unilever Weighs Scaling Back Scope of Tea Business Sale	(Bloomberg) -- Unilever is considering substantially scaling back the potential disposal of its tea business and may keep some operations in emerging markets, people with knowledge of the matter said.The multinational consumer group is debating whether to hold on to its tea business in India and Indonesia, according to the people. Unilever is also considering excluding its stake in a PepsiCo Inc. venture that makes Lipton bottled drinks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.Removing these assets from the sale could reduce the eventual proceeds by as much as several billion pounds and make the portfolio less attractive to some potential bidders, the people said. The remaining parts of the business could fetch about 4 billion pounds ($5 billion) to 5 billion pounds, according to the people.Details on the sale process could be announced as soon as this month, the people said. Unilever is scheduled to announce its half-year results on July 23, according to its website.Shifting TastesUnilever has been seeking to reshape its portfolio as consumers’ tastes change. Deliberations are ongoing, and details of the potential divestment are still subject to change, the people said. A representative for Unilever declined to comment.Sales in Unilever’s tea business declined by a low-single digit percentage in the first quarter of this year, mainly due to especially weak demand in India and restaurant closures globally. Tea demand has suffered in recent years amid a shift to artisan coffee, though in some markets it’s become associated with trends toward healthier living.Unilever said in January it’s starting a strategic review of the tea business that could result in a partial or full sale. While a bidding process has yet to formally kick off, major buyout firms from KKR & Co. to Cinven are already considering making offers for the assets, Bloomberg News reported last month.The division has also attracted preliminary interest from Advent International, Bain Capital, Blackstone Group Inc., Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Swiss investment firm Jacobs Holding AG, people with knowledge of the matter said at the time.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unilever-weighs-scaling-back-scope-140019994.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-07	2020-07-07 21:53:33	UL	Unilever PLC	Facebook Scorned by Advocacy Groups After Zuckerberg Meeting	(Bloomberg) -- Civil rights organizations criticized Facebook Inc. following a meeting with top executives Tuesday, claiming the company hasn’t taken seriously demands to better police its service from hate speech and misinformation.“Facebook approached our meeting today like it was nothing more than a PR exercise,” Jessica González, co-chief executive officer of Free Press, a non-profit media advocacy group, said in a statement following the meeting. “I’m deeply disappointed that Facebook still refuses to hold itself accountable to its users, its advertisers and society at large.”Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg also met with members of the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League and Color of Change, who have organized a boycott of the company’s advertising products in seeking to prompt change. The executives didn’t “commit to a timeline” to remove disinformation and hate speech, Gonzalez said, but instead “delivered the same old talking points to try to placate us without meeting our demands.”“The meeting we just left was a disappointment,” said Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, on a call with reporters.The forum, which lasted about an hour and was held over video conference, was intended to be a venue to discuss proposed solutions to making the Facebook platform less toxic, such as adding executives with civil rights experience to its top ranks and fact-checking political speech, among other changes.“Today we saw little and heard just about nothing,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, who was in the meeting. “The company is functionally flawed.”Since the groups called for the boycott, hundreds of advertisers, including well-known brands such as Unilever NV, Verizon Communications Inc., and Coca-Cola Co., have announced plans to pull advertising from Facebook’s properties over criticism the company doesn’t do enough to police user content. As the boycott grew, Facebook approached the civil rights organizations about a meeting, though the groups refused to meet without Zuckerberg in attendance.“They want Facebook to be free of hate speech and so do we,” Facebook said in a statement following the meeting. The company pointed to efforts it has made in recent years, including a mention of an audit of its policies and practices and noting that it has spent billions of dollars building systems to police its service. “We know we will be judged by our actions not by our words and are grateful to these groups and many others for their continued engagement.”Facebook has defended its attempts to fight hate speech and voter suppression in emails and phone calls with advertisers, talking up the company’s automated systems which find and remove these kinds of posts automatically. The company has also highlighted a voter registration initiative through which it hopes to register 4 million voters before the 2020 election.Greenblatt described Facebook’s claim that it catches 89% of hate speech automatically as an unacceptable number. “The Ford Motor Co. can’t say that 89% of our fleet has seatbelts that work,” he said, adding that it would require a recall. “Maybe it’s time we recall Facebook Groups? Maybe it’s time we recall the News Feed?”Another topic of discussion on the call was the civil rights audit of Facebook’s policies, which the company first started in mid-2018. Facebook, which has said it will publish the full report Wednesday, previewed some of the results with the civil rights groups during the meeting. The audit was carried out by a third party, meaning the results are independent of Facebook, but also that they are less likely to lead to change, Robinson said.“What we get is recommendations that they end up not implementing,” he added. Facebook will make some changes to add “long term civil rights infrastructure” to the company, but Robinson said the details were still “unclear.”What was clear from the outset was that the two sides wouldn’t likely come to a resolution on Tuesday. In a post before the meeting started, Sandberg acknowledged that Facebook needs to do more to fight hate speech, but also said that the company is unlikely to implement all the recommendations from the civil rights audit.The civil rights groups said that their fight with Facebook is far from over. “I believe this campaign will continue to grow,” Greenblatt said. “It will get more global, it will get more intense until we get the answers that I think we are looking for.”(Updates with more details from meeting starting from sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-denounced-civil-rights-group-195812723.html?.tsrc=rss

The firm sells products that help companies manage supply chains, sales and operations.Its 103% rise this year makes it the fourth-best performing stock on the S&P/TSX Composite Index. The Covid-19 crisis has helped the business as global supply chains have been disrupted: Kinaxis has seen a 20% increase in user activity since January, Chief Executive Officer John Sicard said in an interview.“There’s never been a time where we’re more relevant, and especially under this particular crisis where all supply chains are experiencing a tremendous amount of volatility and disruption,” Sicard said, describing his company as “Canada’s best-kept secret.”The firm seized on Rubikloud to fill a gap in its product lineup. The target company, co-founded in 2013 by Kerry Liu, serves the enterprise retail industry, which Kinaxis did not.“Retail is not a vertical they’re currently in, but one that obviously, if you want to be a global leader in supply chain, you can’t ignore,” Liu said.Machine LearningThe Toronto startup has also made more advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning than Kinaxis has, Sicard said. These include helping clients predict the demand for an item so that they can determine appropriate pricing, according to Liu.The $60 million cash deal, announced June 15, had been in the making for a few months. Although the two companies had known each other for years, it was only earlier this year when talks started to heat up. At a dinner at Sicard’s home in Kanata, an Ottawa suburb, the two men found themselves “nearly finishing each other’s sentences,” Sicard said.Soon after, they decided to join forces.“In the world of acquisitions you usually find out it’s someone south of the border buying up Canadian technology. It’s not as common to see a Canadian company creating a union with another Canadian company,” he added.Liu will lead strategic innovation at the company. “I see myself continuing to be an evangelist in the space,” he said. “I think it’s as much about understanding and making sure that I’m a subject matter expert where available and then working closely on figuring out what do we need to do in the supply chain together now in this new world.”Rubikloud is Kinaxis’s second acquisition since going public in 2014. In February, it bought Indian firm Prana Consulting Services Pvt. Ltd. for an undisclosed sum.The stock is well-liked by analysts with 10 buy ratings, two hold recommendations and no sells, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.(Adds more CEO comments in tenth paragraph and analyst data in last paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/software-firm-2020-rally-exceeds-204031559.html?.tsrc=rss

The rest of the world is following China's lead. As the world economy restarts, international stocks will fare the best. Its geographic diversity will work in its favor as strong growth in re-opened countries offsets a temporary shutdown in other places.Savvy investors may build a geographically diversified portfolio, but that is not easy. There are currency exchange rate risks to consider. So, buying worldwide conglomerates may pay off in the long-run. Plus, investors get the benefit of spreading out risks.There are seven international stocks to buy as the world economy restarts:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips* The Unilever Group (NYSE:UL)* The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)* Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)* Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)* Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM)* Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB)* AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN)  * 7 Utilities Stocks to Buy With Reassuring Dividends Together, these international stocks give investors exposure to a wide variety of sectors. Consumer goods, e-commerce, automotive, and drug manufacturing all have their growth potential. Plus, a re-start will accelerate the near-term growth of companies in their respective markets. Unilever Group (UL)Source: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.com First up on this list of international stocks is Unilever. The Unilever Group is in the news after joining other firms in boycotting ad spending on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for the rest of the year. This is an unfortunate decision and does signal some risks in holding UL stock. The company reported flat sales growth in the first quarter due to the stay-at-home order. But stockpiling last quarter and the re-opening should lift results.In Q1, Unilever signaled its confidence in its cash flow growth by keeping its dividend levels. As consumers return to stores, Unilever's sales should recover. Still, the company must adjust to the ever-lasting impact of people staying at home. So, instead of relying on ice cream and food that restaurants and cafes buy, the company needs to pivot.Unilever stock has a strong overall rating. As a bonus, the stock offers a good dividend for income investors.Source: Data courtesy of Stock Rover Increasing its focus on laundry detergents, hand sanitizers, and soap products should give profit margins a lift. In the near-term, expect a better entry point approaching. Analysts have a $48.42 price target (according to Tipranks). And if more restaurants are open, Unilever's sales should bounce back in the next quarter. The Procter & Gamble Company (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Procter & Gamble's priority of ensuring the health and safety of everyone around the world already makes the company a recession-proof holding. Looking ahead, family demands for maintaining health, hygiene, and cleaning will only grow. The devastating virulence of the coronavirus will only increase such needs.In the first quarter, P&G increased its dividend by 6% to about 79 cents a share. And as consumers choose their brands first, sales will increase as people slowly return to their normal lives. From fiscal 2012 to Fiscal 2016, P&G created $10 billion worth of growth and value. It will repeat that feat from the fiscal year 2017 to 2021.By disrupting the market, the company comes out ahead in a variety of sectors. This includes beauty, grooming, family care, and health care.According to Stock Rover, PG stock is worth $160.53. It scores well on quality.PG Industry S&P 500 Quality Score 87 61 79 Gross Margin 49.90% 38.50% 29.10% Operating Margin 21.90% 18.60% 13.20% Net Margin 7.10% 10.10% 8.70% Data courtesy of Stock Rover  * 9 Florida Stocks to Avoid as Coronavirus Rates Spike Expect P&G to expand its operating margin as the economic rebound unfolds. Its net margin could exceed that of the industry next. Alibaba (BABA)Source: Colin Hui / Shutterstock.com Alibaba still trades at a discount. The strong growth in e-commerce every quarter suggests that markets continue to underestimate their potential. With China leading the economy's reopening, Alibaba's digital economy business will expand. In the fourth quarter, Alibaba's digital economy gross merchant volume exceeded $1 trillion (slide 3). It now has 960 million global annual active customers (AAC).Investors may forecast Alibaba's revenue growing by at least 17% or higher in the next five years annually. With the following input, Alibaba stock has a fair value of $265.42.Source: Data courtesy of finbox At 780 million China and 180 million international AAC, Alibaba is in a strong position to grow its market share. Plus, consumers will spend more time buying things online. Furthermore, the e-commerce giant has a chance to increase its food and grocery business as customers grow accustomed to buying these goods online.In the cloud computing space, Alibaba Cloud continues to benefit from the increasing demand for video content consumption. Remote working and learning also lifted demand.At a price-to-earnings (P/E) below 30 times, BABA stock has an excellent growth profile against its deep value. Coca-Cola Company (KO)Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com Just as Unilever cut its ad spending, Coca-Cola said it would do the same. The pop drink supplier is pausing all social media ad spending for July. Again, this suggests that the company's revenue growth is slowing and that its ads are not effective in reversing that decline.KO stock lost nearly one-third of its value in the last five years:Chart courtesy of Stock RoverAccording to Tipranks, analysts have a $51.40 price target. At an 8% discount rate, a 5-year discounted cash flow model would arrive at a similar fair value.Source: Data courtesy of finbox The economy's restart should put KO stock in firmer territory as it cuts unnecessary spending. And as sales recover, profits will expand at a better pace than ever. Collectively, beverage companies &quot;spent over a billion dollars to advertise sugary drinks and energy drinks in 2018.&quot; So, strong brand recognition should lead to continued double-digit sales of Coca-Cola products despite the ad spending freeze.  * 10 Value Stocks to Keep on Your Short List At a price-to-earnings below 20 times, Coca-Cola shares are too cheap to ignore, especially as international markets reopen. Toyota Motor (TM)Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Automotive companies faced slumping sales at the height of the pandemic-driven lockdown. The easing should lead to a rebound in sales. International stocks like Toyota Motor not only trade at favorable valuations of around 10 times earnings, but have a good performance record.Toyota makes reliable cars that require minimal maintenance. Those who have to go to work and want to avoid public transportation will want to buy a Toyota.Still, Toyota's sales rebound will not happen until after July at the earliest. The company forecasts a 10% drop in production volume in July. This is a solid improvement from the 40% decrease in June.  As global demand recovers, domestic production will bounce back. Toyota forecasts sales will recover to last year's levels by the end of 2020. Kimberly-Clark (KMB)Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.com In a long-term trading range of $130 - $145, Kimberly-Clark stock is ready to break out to the upside. In the first quarter, the company posted non-GAAP earnings of $2.13 a share. Revenue grew 8.2% from last year.KMB stock held up well because of the crazed demand for toilet paper in the last quarter. Looking ahead, the company has a few priorities that will sustain its growth. In addition to protecting the health and safety of its employees and customers, it will manage its global supply chain and manage the business for volatility.For instance, CEO Mike Hsu said: &quot;Like other companies, we haven't significantly pared back our SKU count, and that we've done that in partnership with our customers, who have been very supportive along that journey. And that has increased our theoretical capacity because we have fewer changeovers and less complexity in the plants.&quot;  * 5 Penny Stocks Under $10 to Buy in June By running efficiently, KMB shares could bounce higher as demand patterns recover in places like Asia, Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. AstraZeneca (AZN)Source: Shutterstock Last on this list of international stocks is AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca is not only an international stock idea but it is also a coronavirus vaccine play. The company signed a $127 million deal to produce an experimental vaccine for the Brazilian government. The country will receive material to produce 30.4 million doses later this year. The deal will bring 100 million vaccines. This accounts for nearly half of Brazil's residents. AstraZeneca will transfer the technology if the vaccine works.Brazil is one of the hardest-hit countries of the virus and has more than a million confirmed cases.The company's AZD1222 vaccine is a co-development with the University of Oxford. Italy's pharma giant, Catalent, will manufacture the drug starting in August 2020.AstraZeneca shared its data on three cancer studies. Tagrisso, which treats adjuvant lung cancer, is in Phase III. Imfinzi is in Phase III and treats extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. And Enhertu is in Phase II trials in gastric, lung, and colorectal cancers.On Stock Rover, AZN stock has an 87/100 score on quality. Its gross margin is 49.9% and may potentially rise as the economy re-opens.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-07-01	2020-07-01 13:45:39	UL	Unilever PLC	Facebook Boycott Adds to an Already Bleak Year for Advertising	(Bloomberg) -- Long before an uproar over online hate speech prompted hundreds of marketers to cut summer social media budgets, 2020 was turning out to be a dismal year for the global advertising industry.Total ad spending will fall 12% this year, compared with a 6.2% gain in 2019, according to GroupM, a division of advertising giant WPP Plc. That’s the biggest contraction in at least a decade. As the global pandemic spread around the world and consumer spending slowed to a trickle, many corporations targeted marketing as a fast, early way to cut costs.One ad agency executive said third-quarter buying would be down 20% to 30%. New deals were being struck with “force majeure” clauses that would allow advertisers to pull out if a second wave of the virus caused new shutdowns, said the executive, who requested anonymity discussing internal financial figures. In the U.S., hopes that the virus would slow by summer are fading as states that had begun opening up move to shut down again because of a jump in cases.Against this backdrop, advertisers are making another shift. Big companies around the world have said they’ll pause spending on social media, several of them singling out Facebook Inc., because they don’t want marketing messages appearing alongside the vitriol and disinformation. Many are heeding the call from a consortium of civil rights and other advocacy groups, including Color of Change and the Anti-Defamation League, to stop spending on Facebook for July to protest the company’s failure to police harmful content.The pause creates a way for many companies to take a public stance against hate while at the same time providing a concrete reason to trim marketing budgets or, in some cases, experiment with alternatives to traditional social media, such as Amazon.com Inc. or ByteDance’s TikTok. “While many brands were planning on pulling back ad spend anyways, a portion of Facebook-allocated dollars may end up on Snapchat, Pinterest, Amazon, Walmart, etc.,” Mark Shmulik, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a recent research note.Ad budgets are an indicator of corporate sentiment toward the world economy. Confidence and growth leads to bigger budgets and higher ad prices. Ad spending cratered in March and April as businesses shut and people stayed home to comply with lockdown orders.In interviews earlier in the year, ad execs were mostly hopeful that the pain would end once quarantines lifted and the economy rebounded. But behind the scenes, the picture was more bleak. Ad agencies, which choose how and when to spend the money companies entrust to them, have cut thousands of jobs. Ad executives who had spent money on spots meant to run during now-canceled sports events tried to recoup the money and find new outlets for it, according to people interviewed by Bloomberg who asked not to be identified discussing private negotiations.Despite the larger advertising pullback, a pause for social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter Inc. and YouTube creates an opening for ad upstarts on the digital side. Packaged foods company Conagra Brands Inc. pulled Facebook advertisements, redirecting the money to search and e-commerce ads, a category most likely to benefit online rivals Google and Amazon.Ben & Jerry’s, a division of Unilever, was one of the early brands to join the StopHateForProfit campaign. “The marketing dollars that would have been spent on Facebook will be spent on other channels, including possibly some Black-owned media outlets,” said Chris Miller, the activism manager at Ben & Jerry’s.Even if the boycotts gain momentum and persist for more than a month, Google and Facebook are still likely to benefit in the long-term from the disruption wrought by the pandemic. That’s because these companies offer advertisers the most flexible and direct way to reach consumers; spending can be paused or ramped up on a moment’s notice. The tech giants also benefit from the millions of small businesses that rely heavily on them for day-to-day business and don’t necessarily need to take a public stand on moral issues. “They may grab an even greater market share post COVID-19 than the strong gains we are currently projecting,” Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC, said of Facebook and Google.The more traditional parts of the ad ecosystem, which still account for around half of advertising spending, are in a riskier position.For the TV industry, the advertising outlook for the rest of 2020 will depend on two still-unanswered questions. One is how much the pandemic-driven recession will accelerate cable-TV cord-cutting. With unemployment high, more people are expected to cancel their TV subscriptions as they tighten their household budgets. That would hurt viewership and the advertising dollars that go with it. The bigger audiences as a result of people being confined to their homes has already started to fall for just about all programming except news as more people venture outdoors again.The other big question is the return of sports. As long as professional and college football starts up again this fall, media companies like Fox Corp., Comcast Corp., Walt Disney Co. and ViacomCBS will likely see a rebound in advertising revenue, analysts say. Brands spent over $4 billion on TV commercials during NFL games last year.Still, some big TV advertisers could be less willing to jump back this year at all. Carmakers like General Motors and Ford, for instance, have been among the top buyers of TV commercials. The global pandemic has disrupted their supply chains and raised doubts about consumers making big purchases like cars.Media companies and TV networks are now under pressure to make their contracts more flexible. TV networks typically prevent advertisers from pulling all of their money out on short notice. That frustrated many advertisers this spring when the pandemic first kicked off the recession. Now, advertisers are pushing for the right to pull more of their money out of a TV network with fewer days notice in case the coronavirus worsens the economic picture. They will, however, likely pay a higher price for that flexibility, according to one TV executive.That could send them back to the digital platforms, regardless of all the commitments to boycott Facebook.“Brands can stop TV ads but they can’t stop things being on social,” said Arron Shepherd, co-founder of global social media and influencer marketing agency Goat.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-boycott-adds-already-bleak-134539388.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-30	2020-06-30 23:34:03	UL	Unilever PLC	Facebook Critics Target One Thing CEO Won’t Cede: Control	(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg took the unusual step on Friday of publicly broadcasting a weekly Q&A with employees. Over a live video feed, the CEO announced a series of updates to Facebook’s policies around hate speech -- the central topic fueling a growing boycott of Facebook advertising.But the new policies, like labeling posts from public figures who break its terms of service, didn’t assuage critics. The coalition of civil rights groups organizing the boycott called the announcement “a small number of small changes.” Demands like adding a high-ranking executive focused on civil rights, providing face-to-face customer service for hate speech victims and removing extra protections for elected leaders were still unmet.And, though it wasn’t officially included on their public list of proposed changes, the boycott organizers also have a more fundamental complaint: Zuckerberg has too much control.“Mark Zuckerberg has way too much power for a company of this size and reach,” said Arisha Hatch, vice president and chief of campaigns at Color of Change, one of the boycott’s organizers. “He is the one that is blocking progress in this moment.”Zuckerberg, who famously co-founded Facebook as a student before dropping out of Harvard University, has always been the most important person at the company, partly thanks to his out-sized control of its board. Recently, he has consolidated even more power. Since 2018 the founders of Facebook’s other properties, like Instagram and WhatsApp, have left the company, giving Zuckerberg more say over its product empire. And a number of board members -- including former Gates Foundation CEO Susan Desmond-Hellmann and former American Express Co. CEO Kenneth Chenault -- departed in the past two years, many of them over frustrations with Facebook’s corporate governance, according to the Wall Street Journal.For some, the lack of dissenting voices within and around Facebook is worrying. “This behemoth of a company, that’s operating more as a public utility, must be more accountable,” said NAACP CEO and boycott organizer Derrick Johnson.Zuckerberg is not the only important executive at the company. He has long relied on Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to run Facebook’s business and policy divisions, and he has a number of top executives who advise him. But unlike Twitter Inc., which goes out of its way to say that CEO Jack Dorsey does not make content decisions, Zuckerberg is clearly the final say on all things Facebook.“The way decisions escalate in Facebook are very much what you’d expect in any complex organization where there was a hierarchy,” Nick Clegg, the company’s vice president for global affairs and communications, told reporters earlier this month. “For the most difficult decisions, there’s one ultimate decision maker, our CEO and Chair and Founder, Mark Zuckerberg.”As Facebook’s advertising boycott has grown to include household names like Starbucks Corp., Coca-Cola Co. and Unilever, the social network has fought back with an information campaign intended to demonstrate how much the company already does to fight hate online. Facebook has repeated a series of statistics in interviews and in emails to advertising partners, including that the company detects 90% of the hate speech it removes from the platform before any user even flags it.The company has also been touting a voting information campaign announced earlier this month with the goal of registering 4 million new U.S. voters before the 2020 presidential election. On Friday, Facebook said it would arrange a third-party audit of its quarterly report detailing how much content it takes down for rules violations.But so far, the piecemeal changes have done little to placate the company’s critics. “It’s unclear what the perfect solution is,” said Mark Shmulik, an analyst at Bernstein Securities. “There’s no kind of silver bullet here to fix it -- it’s a very broad, ambiguous problem.”On the larger issues, Facebook has shown little sign of relenting. Diminishing Zuckerberg’s control over the company is almost entirely out of the question. Repeated shareholder proposals to change Facebook’s voting structure or replace Zuckerberg as chairman have failed to clear the company’s board because Zuckerberg himself has voted against them -- the CEO has almost 60% of the vote thanks to a special class of shares unavailable to public investors. The arrangement has raised the question of who, specifically, Zuckerberg is accountable to.“This is where you have a runaway train,” the NAACP’s Johnson said on Monday on Bloomberg Television. “And that runaway train is causing harm to the public and it’s causing harm to our democracy.”The group calling for a Facebook boycott has several demands around removing hateful content that could prove difficult for the company to adhere to. Facebook said it’s already doing the best it can to find and remove posts promoting hate. In an interview on Bloomberg Television Monday, Clegg said Facebook does not profit off hate speech, and that it had an “industry-leading record” when it came to dealing with issues related to the “dark side of the internet.”But Clegg added: “I don’t want to pretend this is an easy straightforward task, that there is a switch we can flick and all hate speech suddenly disappears.”Hate has always been a problem for open platforms, in part because it’s difficult to define. In some cases, a post that clearly appears to be a rules violation to some people, is considered allowable by others. This dynamic played out late last month after a series of posts from President Trump struck many as a clear threat of violence. However, Zuckerberg said the posts were not actually a violation of Facebook’s policies. The posts remained up and untouched, even though Twitter flagged the same language.At Color of Change, Hatch understands that the social network, with more than 2 billion monthly users, probably cannot remove hate speech entirely, but she believes Facebook can do more within its current structure. “Certainly when things are flagged they need to be removed, and certainly when things are coming from the current president or an elected official, it needs to be removed,” Hatch said.Even though the boycott has trimmed billions off Facebook’s market capitalization, it’s not clear how much influence advertisers will have over the company’s processes. Some of the participating companies are heavy spenders, including Starbucks and Unilever, who together spent more than $30 million on Facebook ads during the first six months of the year, according to Pathmatics, a digital marketing analytics company. However, that’s a small amount compared with the almost $35 billion in sales Facebook is projected to report for the same six-month period.The vast majority of the company’s advertisers are small businesses, not name-brand marketers. Smaller companies rely on Facebook’s direct response ads, which drive specific outcomes like a website visit or an app install. Facebook’s top 100 advertisers accounted for roughly $4.2 billion in sales revenue last year, Pathmatics estimates, or just 6% of all Facebook revenue. So far, only a handful of the company’s 100 top-spending advertisers from 2019 are pulling money from Facebook ads.“As important as these advertisers are to Facebook, it would likely take a far broader advertising boycott over a longer period of time to materially impact Facebook’s ad revenue,” Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analysts wrote Monday in a note to investors. Facebook stock ended the day Monday up 2.1% despite the new additions to the ad holdout.Facebook will have more opportunities to try to alleviate concern this week in a series of meetings, including a round table discussion with advertisers and Facebook executives on Tuesday. Color of Change would also like to meet with Facebook this week -- but the group is holding out unless Zuckerberg also attends, a spokesperson said. It’s possible that the boycott, which is formally running through July, could extend further depending on how Facebook responds, Hatch said.“It’s definitely a live, dynamic campaign,” she said. “We’re hopeful we won’t have to make any further adjustments or asks.

2020-06-30	2020-06-30 20:00:35	UL	Unilever PLC	Facebook Bans ‘Boogaloo’ Groups Seeking to Commit Violence	(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. banned the violent faction of the so-called “boogaloo” movement -- an anti-government group who believe in a coming civil war -- amid mounting pressure from the private sector and lawmakers to take a more aggressive stance on hate speech as protests over racial inequality have swept the country.“Today we are designating a violent U.S.-based anti-government network as a dangerous organization and banning it from our platform,” Facebook said in a blog post published Tuesday, as hundreds of accounts, groups and pages affiliated with the boogaloo movement were removed from Facebook and Instagram.Members of the movement, which Facebook described as encompassing “a range of anti-government activists who generally believe civil conflict in the U.S. is inevitable,” have recently been identified by government officials as “those responsible for several attacks over the past few months,” the post said. “These acts of real-world violence and our investigations into them are what led us to identify and designate this distinct network.”On Monday, an Air Force sergeant who prosecutors have connected to the movement, Steven Carrillo, was indicted for allegedly killing a federal security guard in Oakland and later ambushing a Santa Cruz County sheriff’s deputy, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.Facebook’s announcement coincides with a wide-ranging advertiser boycott, in which hundreds of marketers, including well-known brands like Starbucks Corp. and Unilever, have sworn off Facebook advertising for the month of July in protest of the company’s policies. Organizers of the boycott have specifically called out “hate speech” as an area where Facebook needs to better police its services.The social media giant has also come under increasing criticism by lawmakers, who are pressuring the platform to take more active responsibility for problematic content and disinformation. In a Tuesday letter, three U.S. Senators, Mark Warner, Mazie Hirono and Bob Menendez, all of them Democrats, wrote to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg that the company’s “failure to address the hate spreading on its platform reveals significant gaps between Facebook’s professed commitment to racial justice and the company’s actions and business interests.”Facebook acted to ban violent boogaloo content on Tuesday under its policy against dangerous individuals and organizations -- removing 220 Facebook accounts, 28 Facebook pages, 95 Instagram accounts and 106 Facebook groups that were part of a boogaloo network. It also removed 400 additional groups and 100 pages that “hosted similar content as the violent network” but were not technically part of it, according to the post.The boogaloo movement, which Facebook dates back to 2012, contains internal divisions, including over “the goal of a civil conflict, racism and anti-Semitism, and whether to instigate violent conflict or be prepared to react when it occurs,” according to the blog post. Facebook banned the part of the movement that “actively seeks to commit violence” rather than the “loosely affiliated movement” as a whole, according to the post.In the first three months of the year, Facebook removed 6 million pieces of terrorist content -- including posts by white supremacists -- and 4 million pieces of content tied to hate groups, according to a Facebook representative who spoke on a call with reporters under the condition of anonymity due to safety concerns. Even so, the platform remains concerned about the other white supremacist content that it hasn’t yet found, the person said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-bans-boogaloo-groups-seeking-200035228.html?.tsrc=rss

Over the past month, the stock went up by 2.04%, but over the past year, it actually decreased by 14.37%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio.The stock is currently above from its 52 week low by 26.61%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Household & Personal Products stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 25.73 in the Household & Personal Products industry, Unilever Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 22.37. Shareholders might be inclined to think that they might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.price to earnings ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance.

2020-06-29	2020-06-29 20:52:47	UL	Unilever PLC	Facebook Sales at Risk as Starbucks Bails, GM Plans Review	(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. fielded criticism from a growing number of consumer companies over harmful content on its sites, with Starbucks Corp. and Diageo Plc pulling back on ad spending and General Motors Co. planning to review its social media marketing strategy.Starbucks and Diageo followed Unilever, Coca-Cola Co. and several other companies in saying they will cut ad spending, part of an exodus aimed at pushing Facebook and its peers to limit hate speech and posts that divide and misinform. Microsoft Corp., which was Facebook’s third-largest advertiser last year, has paused global ad spending on the site because of concerns about ads appearing next to inappropriate content, according to a person familiar with the matter. The list of companies taking similar action lengthened on Monday. Britvic Plc, which supplies a wide range of soft drinks, Patreon Inc. and The Clorox Co. all said they will stop advertising on Facebook while GM said it’s “reviewing and reinforcing” its marketing guidelines.Read more: How to Go Cold Turkey on $77 Billion of Facebook Ads: Alex WebbWhile a single advertiser can do little to hurt a company that generated $17.7 billion in revenue last quarter, the rising tally creates peer pressure on other brands, and civil rights groups say they expect more corporations to join a boycott. Combined with a pandemic-fueled economic slowdown, the threat to Facebook is deepening.“Given the amount of noise this is drawing, this will have significant impact to Facebook’s business,” Wedbush Securities analyst Bradley Gastwirth wrote in a research note. “Facebook needs to address this issue quickly and effectively in order to stop advertising exits from potentially spiraling out of control.”Shares gained 2.1% Monday to close at $220.64 in New York, after dropping 8.3% on Friday. Unilever, one of the world’s largest advertisers, said it would cease spending on Facebook properties this year, eliminating $56 billion in market value and shaving the net worth of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg by more than $7 billion.Facebook was already bracing for weakness in the second quarter, which ends this week. Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner said in an April earnings call that he saw the “potential for an even more severe advertising industry contraction.”The number of coronavirus cases has surged in the intervening months, prompting many parts of the country to slow or roll back reopening efforts and giving advertisers added justification to rein in spending. Facebook’s sales will rise 1% in the June period, followed by a 7% increase in the third quarter, analysts predict, by far the smallest quarterly growth increases since the company went public.Advertiser boycotts in July could cost Facebook more than $250 million in the third quarter if 25% of its top 100 buyers pause spending, and as much as $500 million if 50% of the top advertisers stop, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jitendra Waral.Zuckerberg announced changes Friday designed to appease critics, but the Anti-Defamation League, one of the groups calling for the boycott, called the amendments “small.”Some analysts have said the financial impact of recent exits will be limited, citing past advertiser revolts. Even so, this exodus is distinct in key ways, Bernstein Securities analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a research note Saturday. There’s heightened pressure to publicly demonstrate that brands stand with civil-rights groups, he said.“The current environment is very different,” Shmulik wrote. “It is very visible who is and isn’t participating in the boycott where brand silence [equals] being complicit.”(Updates to add Microsoft withdrawl in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-shares-poised-fall-starbucks-084522495.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-06-29	2020-06-29 19:47:22	UL	Unilever PLC	It's Zuckerberg and Facebook's Time to Bend	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Mark Zuckerberg has a problem, and he can fix it.Public furor over Facebook Inc.’s content policies has led some of its biggest advertisers to take action, with brands from Starbucks Corp. to Unilever, Coca-Cola Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. all vowing to pull ads from the social media giant’s namesake Facebook platform as well as Instagram for at least the month of July. The move was initially spurred by a campaign led by a coalition of civil rights groups — including the Anti-Defamation League and NAACP — to force Facebook to do more to curb hate speech and language promoting violence. As the effort has gained traction, the numbers joining the boycott are increasing on a daily basis. On Monday afternoon alone, Best Buy Co. said it would pause its ad spending on Facebook, while Axios reported that Microsoft Corp. had suspended its advertising as well.Facebook has come in for criticism about its practices before and got past it largely by riding out the negative publicity while offering some incremental fixes. For example, Facebook already survived the Cambridge Analytica data-privacy scandal a couple years ago without serious long-term ramifications. And so, Zuckerberg may be tempted to hunker down this time as well.On a purely short-term financial basis, it would make sense. According to Pathmatics data, the top 50 advertisers on Facebook accounted for just 4% of the company’s sales last year. The vast majority of the rest comes from millions of small- and medium-sized businesses that are less affected by any public shaming from activists, and arguably more reliant on the exposure they get from buying ads on Facebook and Instagram. But a decision based purely on dollars and cents would be short-sighted in this instance, and bad for business.More and more, it’s becoming clear that the recent wave of protests over racial injustice isn’t a short-lived phenomenon, but one that appears to reflect a sea-change in perception and beliefs, and — like the MeToo movement before it — demands a change in behavior. The backlash that started at the grassroots level and moved on to corporate action is likely to move next to the political and regulatory sphere. Wouldn’t it be better for Facebook, already in the public glare, to bend and make its own meaningful policy changes instead of being forced to accept more punitive prescriptions and further potential damage to its reputation and business?Facebook is already facing increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. Politicians from both sides of the aisle have made proposals to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields internet companies from legal liability over user-generated content. For now, Republicans and the Department of Justice are focused on issues of conservative speech censorship, while Democrats have asked for the faster removal of misinformation and false claims inside political ads.The disparate points of emphasis likely means nothing will happen in Congress before the November election. However, if one party controls both houses of Congress and the White House next year, the probability of regulation will rise considerably.In the near term, the risk for Facebook may be greater from Europe than the U.S. The region’s authorities have identified antitrust as the more effective way to tackle Silicon Valley’s shortcomings than regulation, whose limits have been exposed by the General Data Protection Regulation that kicked in two years ago. GDPR has done little either to change the business practices of Google or Facebook, or to reduce their market power. And discussions about data or content are always questions of regulation, rather than antitrust.But antitrust is far more of an existential threat to Facebook than is regulation. That’s not simply because it could, in the most extreme circumstances, result in a breakup of the company. It’s because antitrust by definition seeks to tackle its business practices.Just last week, Germany’s highest civil court ruled that Facebook must stop logging browsing activity outside of its platforms without users’ explicit permission, and that such permission couldn’t be a condition of using its other services. Crucially, though, the decision was based not on data protection but antitrust laws. It said Facebook was abusing its market power to force users to accept the terms because it is the dominant social network. And the ruling fundamentally attacked the company’s business model, which is built on using such data to target ads effectively. An effort by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority is even less ambiguous: It’s carrying out a study into online platforms and digital advertising.While the U.K. is no longer a member of the European Union, the bloc’s regulators are following the findings of the study closely. After years of tackling Google, Facebook is now high on the European agenda. The two firms’ dominance of digital advertising is fueled by their low incremental costs. Tackle their business models, and you might resolve the harmful content problem, runs the argument. The EU plans new rules by the end of the year on content regulation and platform liability, while Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s antitrust and tech chief, is seeking new powers to break companies up. And the European Commission has more power than U.S. regulators: It can impose decisions unilaterally, which companies can then challenge in court. In the U.S., regulators generally need court approval first before any ruling is imposed.So, Zuckerberg needs to acknowledge the growing uproar is symptomatic of new and lasting societal, political and regulatory crosscurrents. While he has long been adamant it is not Facebook’s job to be the “arbiter of truth,” there is no better climate, in the face of pressure from advertisers, politicians and civil rights groups alike, to alter that stance — he can change tack without losing as much face.Serious changes are needed — from being more effective in taking down hate speech quickly  to clamping down on false claims and disinformation from all users. Such moves would help the company get ahead of future actions from regulators. That would be wise as government regulation will likely be far more punitive – whether it be from the European Union or a potentially new American administration.Simply, Facebook’s traditional hands-off approach isn’t good enough anymore. It’s time for Zuckerberg to show some real leadership.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-06-29	2020-06-29 14:11:11	UL	Unilever PLC	Companies Use Pandemic to Look Into Shedding Laggard Brands	(Bloomberg) -- From black tea to bottled water, European companies are taking a hard look at underperforming businesses at a time when investors’ profit expectations are already low because of the coronavirus pandemic.With economies reeling and Covid-19 still spreading across swathes of the globe, top executives are hiring investment bankers or launching internal reviews to sort through portfolios and sell unwanted businesses.“Investors are writing off 2020 completely but expect a tight, impeccable story for 2021 and 2022,” said Adam Young, the global head of capital markets at advisory firm Rothschild. “Those companies that don’t have one need to look for it pretty quickly.”Private equity firms from KKR & Co. to Blackstone Group Inc. are lining up bids for Unilever Plc’s tea unit, which could fetch more than 5 billion pounds ($6.2 billion), people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News last week.Lipton TeaThe consumer-goods giant launched a strategic review of the unit in January, as the coronavirus was rampaging through China’s Hubei province. At the time, Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope described the business, which includes well-known brands like Lipton and PG Tips, as “a structural drag on Unilever’s growth.”In a similar vein, Nestle SA is considering a sale of its U.S. mass-market bottled water business, which includes the Poland Spring and Pure Life brands. The division globally had its worst performance in a decade last year and the North American unit, in particular, has seen competition from discount brands, as well as consumer resistance to plastic packaging.While Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider hasn’t hesitated to shed underperforming businesses since he took over in 2017, the pandemic could force more boards to follow suit.“If there’s a business in a company’s portfolio that isn’t performing in line with ambitions, the next two to three years aren’t a great environment to put it back together,” Young said.Time to ActIt’s not only big consumer companies looking to act. Total SA and Solvay SA are each pursuing sales of chemical businesses, people familiar with the plans have said. AMS AG may be positioning Osram Licht AG’s automotive unit for a sale once its takeover of the German lighting company is complete, according to a worker’s representative and an internal presentation.Such carveouts may pick up in the second half as companies seek to bolster balance sheets, as well as share prices, in the wake of the pandemic.Some companies are turning to investors to replenish cash. Budget airline EasyJet Plc raised about 419 million pounds in a share sale last week, while carmaker Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings Plc tapped investors for around 150 million pounds.“The general thought among boards now is that inaction is not an option,” said Rich Mills, global head of divestments at Ernst & Young.PE Cash PileNearly a third of companies undertaking sales are willing to increase the assets on offer to get the proceeds they need to re-invest, said Mills. He co-authored the consulting firm’s 2020 report on global corporate divestments, which was based on online surveys of more than 1,000 executives before and after the pandemic’s onset.Many sales are attracting strong interest from private equity buyers sitting on an unprecedented $1.5 trillion in cash, the survey found.BP Plc agreed to sell its chemicals business to Ineos Group for $5 billion on Monday, in a move to transition away from being a traditional oil company and strengthen its finances as the industry faces increased pressure from the coronavirus crisis.The twin black swans of the virus and an energy crisis with collapsing oil prices created a supply and demand shock for businesses this year, said Romain Boscher, London-based chief investment officer at Fil Investment Management Ltd. which oversees $190 billion in equities globally.“Companies realize they have to brace for tough times, and that means you need a stronger balance sheet,” Boscher said. “Much more than asset sales, there is a necessity for them to revise strategy.”(Updates with details of BP disposal, investor quote from 15th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-pandemic-look-shedding-laggard-040000675.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-28	2020-06-28 17:58:19	UL	Unilever PLC	Facebook’s Growing Ad Exodus Means More Risks to Revenue Growth	(Bloomberg) -- A growing list of Facebook Inc.’s advertisers is set to halt spending on social media, undermining the company’s sales outlook and putting its stock price under further pressure.Starbucks Corp., Levi Strauss & Co., PepsiCo Inc. and Diageo Plc were among the most recent companies to say they’re curtailing ad spending, part of an exodus aimed at pushing Facebook and its peers to suppress posts that glorify violence, divide and disinform the public, and promote racism and discrimination.No single company can significantly dent growth at Facebook, which generated $17.7 billion in revenue last quarter alone. But a rising tally adds to pressure on other brands to follow suit, and when combined with a pandemic-fueled economic slowdown, the threat to Facebook deepens.“Given the amount of noise this is drawing, this will have significant impact to Facebook’s business,” Wedbush Securities analyst Bradley Gastwirth wrote in a research note. “Facebook needs to address this issue quickly and effectively in order to stop advertising exits from potentially spiraling out of control.”As more brands publicize plans to join boycotts or otherwise rein in ad spending, Facebook shares remain under pressure. The stock tumbled 8.3% Friday after Unilever, one of the world’s largest advertisers, said it would halt spending on Facebook properties this year, eliminating $56 billion in market value and shaving the net worth of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg by more than $7 billion. Shares closed at $216.08 Friday after reaching a record $242.24 the preceding Tuesday.Facebook was already bracing for weakness in the second quarter, which ends this week. Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner noted in an April earnings call the “potential for an even more severe advertising industry contraction.”The number of coronavirus cases has surged in the intervening months, prompting many parts of the country to slow or roll-back reopening efforts and giving advertisers added justification to rein in marketing spending. Facebook will eke out 1% revenue growth in the June period, followed by a 7% increase in the third quarter, according to analysts’ current projections, by far the smallest quarterly growth increases since the company went public.Starbucks said Sunday that it would pause spending on all social media platforms while it carries out talks internally, with media partners and civil rights groups “in the effort to stop the spread of hate speech.”Trump PostsWhile some companies are targeting social media generally, including Twitter Inc., many are singling out Facebook specifically. Zuckerberg has been more reticent to put limits on discourse, notably controversial posts by U.S. President Donald Trump, saying that he doesn’t want Facebook to be an arbiter of what’s true.That’s prompted a consortium of civil rights and other advocacy groups, including Color of Change and the Anti-Defamation League, to urge advertisers to stop spending on Facebook-owned platforms for July to protest the company’s policies.Zuckerberg responded Friday to the growing criticism, saying that Facebook would label all voting-related posts with a link encouraging users to look at its new voter information hub. The social network also expanded its definition of prohibited hate speech for advertising.“We understand people want to put pressure on Facebook to do more,” Facebook vice president Nick Clegg said Sunday on CNN’s Reliable Sources. “That’s why we made those additional announcements in Friday. That’s why we’ll continue to redouble our efforts, because, you know, we have a zero tolerance approach to hate speech.”The Anti-Defamation League called the changes “small.”The stampede of advertisers, combined with lobbying from civil rights groups, leaves Zuckerberg in a bind. He could take further steps to curtail harmful content, but that risks alienating free-speech advocates and supporters of Trump who have argued that Facebook is censoring political discourse and suppressing conservative voices.Distinct ExodusHe could also stand pat on a bet that this advertising pause will be short-lived, as have social media ad boycotts in the past. But this exodus as distinct, Bernstein Securities analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a research note Saturday. There’s heightened pressure to publicly demonstrate that brands stand with civil rights groups, he said. “The current environment is very different,” Shmulik wrote. “It is very visible who is and isn’t participating in the boycott where brand silence [equals] being complicit.”Will Zuckerberg budge? While major brands like Unilever and Coca-Cola have garnered most of the headlines, the vast majority of Facebook’s 8 million advertisers are small businesses, many of which rely heavily on Facebook advertising for sales. Some in the ad industry don’t believe that these businesses, particularly those in commerce and direct-to-consumer sales, can actually afford to halt spending.“Pulling off for a whole month would really hurt their business,” Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley said earlier this week. “It’s a lot to ask for.”In its outreach to advertisers last week, Facebook has said it doesn’t intend to make decisions based on sales. “We have been consistent that we do not make policy changes tied to revenue pressure,” Facebook said on Wednesday in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. “We set our policies based on principles rather than business interests.”Whatever additional moves Facebook makes, there’s reason to believe the departure of advertisers won’t end soon. “Advertisers who have seen their own ads published against hateful, horrible content on Facebook -- racist, anti-Semitic poison -- they are finally saying ‘enough’,” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Our phones have been ringing off the hook with advertisers.

2020-06-27	2020-06-27 00:59:00	UL	Unilever PLC	Facebook Ad Boycott Sinks Stock, Raises Pressure on Zuckerberg	(Bloomberg) -- Critics of Facebook Inc. who have assailed the social network as failing to adequately police hateful and misleading content on its service found a powerful ally Friday: Unilever, one of the world’s largest advertisers, said it would stop spending money with Facebook’s properties this year.The decision by the maker of major consumer goods like Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise to follow other brands in an advertising boycott, prompted a rare reaction from Facebook’s investors. Shares plunged 8.3% on the news, eliminating $56 billion in market value. Unilever’s pledge applies immediate pressure on other big companies and presents a risk to Facebook’s dominant business. Later Friday, Coca-Cola Co. said it would pause ads on all social media platforms for at least 30 days, while Honda Motor Co.’s U.S. unit, Hershey Co. and several smaller brands said they would join the boycott.Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg attempted to address advertiser concerns in a live question-and-answer session with employees Friday, announcing a handful of minor changes to the company’s ad and content policies. But his remarks didn’t go far enough for critics.The Anti-Defamation League, among the collection of civil rights groups that organized the July ad boycott, called the changes announced by Zuckerberg “small.”“We have been down this road before with Facebook,” the group said in a statement. “They have made apologies in the past. They have taken meager steps after each catastrophe where their platform played a part. But this has to end now.”The social network has been less aggressive than competitors Twitter Inc. and Snap Inc. in responding to what employees and advertisers say are harmful posts from U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as incendiary content that goes viral. Facebook, of these companies, is also the most susceptible to regulatory risk, and is already facing antitrust investigations from the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.“You can continuously see the challenge of them trying to have these kinds of broad principles around free expression and stopping harm, and then that mixing with the realpolitik of trying to keep the executive branch happy, which happens to have a half dozen investigations open of Silicon Valley companies for a variety of reasons,” Alex Stamos, a former Facebook security executive, said this week at the virtual Collision Conference.The regulatory threats have historically seemed to loom larger for Facebook than advertiser concerns. The company accounts for about 23% of the entire U.S. digital advertising market, according to EMarketer. And it dominates social media with more than 3 billion users of all its properties.For years, Facebook has weathered scandals with its business intact and growing rapidly. The company’s advertising revenue gained 27% in 2019 to more than $69.7 billion despite threats of regulation, previous calls for advertising boycotts and a user movement encouraging people around the world to delete their accounts. But just four months before the U.S. election, and amid nationwide protests about race and policing in society, Facebook finds itself at the cultural center of a divided country, balancing regulatory pressures with societal ones.Facebook already warned that advertisers are spending less as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, businesses are under pressure to cut costs and respond to the public’s concerns about racial injustice in society. When the civil rights groups organized the ad boycott to push Facebook to better combat hate speech, companies saw a way to make a political statement at an economically convenient time.“It is clear that Facebook and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, are no longer simply negligent, but in fact, complacent in the spread of misinformation, despite the irreversible damage to our democracy,” Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP said in a statement last week.Facebook has tried to quell the boycott behind the scenes, and has reached out to advertisers to push back on the narrative that it doesn’t care about fighting hate and misinformation. In an email to advertising partners, the company highlighted the software it uses to detect hate speech, which has improved over the years, and its efforts to circulate verified information around the elections with a new informational hub and a goal to register 4 million new voters.During the Q&A with employees, Zuckerberg went a step further. He said the company will put a link to the voting hub on all posts related to voting, and will also start marking posts that violate Facebook’s rules, although the posts will remain up if they’re newsworthy.Those rules give Facebook cover to take an action without making a decision on the nature of the content. For instance, several weeks ago when Trump tweeted that mail-in voting would lead to fraud, Twitter labeled the post to fact-check it. Zuckerberg left the same post alone on Facebook. But now, if all voting-related posts have a context link on them, the CEO won’t have to make controversial decisions about their accuracy.Facebook, which already prohibits advertising that discriminates, also sharpened those policies Friday with a clause saying no ads will be allowed if they label another demographic as dangerous, or if they portray immigrants, migrant groups or refugees as inferior and worthy of disgust. “There are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I’m announcing here today,” Zuckerberg said.In a follow-up email to advertisers late Friday, Carolyn Everson, vice president of global marketing solutions, summarized the announcements Zuckerberg made and outlined many of the steps the company already takes to find and remove hate speech. Everson added that Facebook will seek an audit for its quarterly report outlining how it enforces its community standards.“Hate is an insidious feature of every society, and that is reflected across all platforms,” she wrote. “But we also believe in our responsibility to help change the trajectory of hate speech -- and while we know we can’t eradicate it, we will continue to do everything in our power to shatter its presence on our platform.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-ad-boycott-sinks-stock-005900302.html?.tsrc=rss

The stock had dropped 4.6% earlier Friday, then fell 8.3% to $216.08 at the close. Twitter shares dropped 7.4% to $29.05.Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg responded Friday to the growing criticism about misinformation on the site, announcing the company would label all voting-related posts with a link encouraging users to look at its new voter information hub, and expanded its definition of prohibited hate speech for in advertising.Unilever’s decision follows similar moves by a growing list of high-profile consumer companies, including outdoor gear company Patagonia and Verizon Communications Inc., which claim that technology platforms -- particularly Facebook -- profit off user posts that promote hate and spread misinformation.A consortium of civil rights and other advocacy groups, including Color of Change and the Anti-Defamation League, have called on advertisers to stop spending on Facebook-owned platforms for the month of July to protest the company’s policies. Honda Motor Co.’s U.S. unit said Friday that it would join the boycott and halt advertising on Facebook and Instagram in July. Unilever’s commitment extends that pledge through 2020, and adds rival social network Twitter to the mix, which has also struggled to deal with offensive posts but has recently taken a more active stance than Facebook in some cases related to U.S. President Donald Trump.More brands joined the fray as the day wore on. Coca-Cola Co. said it will pause paid advertising on all social media for at least 30 days. Hershey Co. intends to halt Facebook spending in July, according to Business Insider.So far, the boycott organizers say that more than 100 companies are participating.“We invest billions of dollars each year to keep our community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update our policies,” a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement, adding that the company has banned 250 White supremacist organizations from its platforms. “We know we have more work to do, and we’ll continue to work with civil rights groups, GARM, and other experts to develop even more tools, technology and policies to continue this fight.”Facebook has had a rocky relationship with civil rights groups for years, which have fought to diversify Facebook’s board of directors, accused the company of enabling voter suppression tactics, and took issue with Facebook’s decision to name the Daily Caller, a right-wing news outlet with ties to white nationalism, as one of its formal fact-checking partners in 2019.Frustrations were renewed after Zuckerberg said that a series of posts from Trump about race-related protests were not a violation of the company’s rules. In one last month, Trump said that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a post that was flagged on Twitter as a violation but not on Facebook. A number of unhappy Facebook employees staged a walkout to protest the decision.As the boycott has grown over the past week, Facebook has been reaching out to advertisers to share details about the company’s existing policies, and its efforts to automate the flagging and removal of hate speech on its service.

2020-06-26	2020-06-26 18:56:51	UL	Unilever PLC	Facebook to Label All Voting-Related Posts, Not Just Trump’s	(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. will begin labeling all posts that include information about voting with a link encouraging users to get facts from the company’s new voting hub, and expanded its prohibition on hate speech in advertising.The new policy on voting announced Friday by Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg means Facebook will label future posts from U.S President Donald Trump, and everyone else, about mail-in ballots or other voting-related issues, regardless of whether they contain misleading information. Facebook will funnel users to a voting information hub meant to provide facts from state authorities. Users will also be able to register to vote using this hub. Facebook has set a goal of helping register 4 million new voters before the 2020 U.S. election in November.“There are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I’m announcing here today,” Zuckerberg said.The social network has been criticized in recent weeks for allowing false or misleading voting information, including posts from Trump about mail-in ballots that Twitter Inc. flagged as inaccurate. Zuckerberg has said repeatedly that he doesn’t want to remove posts from elected officials, but would rather let users to make up their minds about the content.A number of civil rights groups, including the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League, are among those unhappy with Facebook’s history of allowing posts they say encourage voter suppression. Those groups have organized a Facebook advertising boycott for the month of July, and a number of well-known consumer brands are participating, including outdoor gear company Patagonia, Verizon Communications Inc. and Unilever.Facebook will now prohibit ads that paint anyone from a certain race, ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation as dangerous. The company will expand those policies to better protect immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers from ads that say these groups of people are inferior.The company will also label posts that it keeps up even though they violate policies, if they come from a newsworthy source, such as the president. “We’ll allow people to share this content to condemn it, just like we do with other problematic content, because this is an important part of how we discuss what’s acceptable in our society -- but we’ll add a prompt to tell people that the content they’re sharing may violate our policies,” Zuckerberg said.(Updates with hate speech policy in the sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-label-voting-related-posts-183629268.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-26	2020-06-26 16:44:15	UL	Unilever PLC	How to Go Cold Turkey on $77 Billion of Facebook Ads	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s good that big brands like Verizon Communications Inc. and Unilever NV are pulling ads from Facebook Inc.As my colleague Sarah Halzack has written, the way to make the adtech giant change its approach to tackling hate speech and misinformation is to target how it makes money. (A similar effort worked at Google’s YouTube unit.) But Mark Zuckerberg and co. will still make $77 billion this year from advertisers. If brands really believe in this crusade, they should get off Facebook entirely.On Thursday, Verizon became one of the biggest brands to announce it will pull ads from Facebook in July, joining the likes of Patagonia Inc. and Recreational Equipment Inc. in a month-long campaign called Stop Hate For Profit. The movement is being led by groups such as the Anti-Defamation League and Color of Change, and is channeling momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement to realize real change. On Friday, Ben & Jerry’s, Hellman’s and Dove parent Unilever announced it would halt ads on Facebook and Twitter Inc. in the U.S. for the rest of 2020.It’s a commendable effort to force Facebook to remodel its practices, but there’s a business incentive too: An ad appearing alongside a conspiracy theory is not a good look, particularly if a slice of the revenue goes to the maker of the video. A group of brands with a combined advertising budget of $97 billion is already pushing for better controls. More of them should follow Verizon’s lead, not least the handful of other telecoms operators in the U.S.Arguably, the main reason Verizon even needs to advertise on Facebook is because its rivals AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile U.S. Inc. are both doing so too. Since competitive intensity has been significantly reduced by pandemic lockdowns, now seems a particularly good time for mobile operators to cut marketing spend.If firms are serious about upping the pressure on Zuckerberg, however, they should abandon their presence on the social network completely by deleting their Facebook pages. That might seem like a brand cutting off its nose to spite its face, but as long as it has a Facebook page, then the advertising boycott looks like an empty threat.That’s because the ad spend will ultimately return after the boycott. There’s little point in maintaining a corporate Facebook presence without paying to promote content, due to the limitations of what’s known as organic reach, or how many users see a post without a company or individual paying to get it in front of them. Without paid promotion, just 1% of a page’s followers are likely to see a given post, according to digital agency Jellyfish. It wasn’t always this way. In the early days, Facebook lured brands by showing how many customers they could reach by setting up a page. Then the Menlo Park, California-based firm changed its algorithm so that very few people would see a company’s posts if it didn’t pay for promotion. It was the classic Silicon Valley bait-and-switch. UniCredit SpA, Italy’s biggest bank, bit the bullet and ditched its Facebook presence a year ago. It had already stopped paying for Facebook ads, which meant that very few of the 546,000 followers of its UniCredit Italia page actually saw its content — perhaps just 5,500. Its resolve is so far holding: It hasn’t returned to the social network yet.Being on Facebook can also present more of a risk than an opportunity, especially for an incumbent brand like a bank or telecoms giant. UniCredit’s followers probably represented a significant cross-section of its consumer banking customers, which therefore served as a handy list of people for challenger banks like N26 or Revolut to target with ads and try to steal away. Plus, if a company has a Facebook page, it still has to regularly post new content and interact with customers — both of which cost money. If it doesn’t, the page will likely fill up with customer complaints, which would show up at the top of online search results. The business reasons for big-spending incumbents to leave Facebook might be almost as good as the ethical ones.Zuckerberg needs financial incentives to be more proactive about managing content effectively, partially because his lodestar has long been user engagement. And more polarizing content drives more user engagement. The Wall Street Journal reported in May that a report commissioned by Facebook in 2018 found the platform often did aggravate polarization and tribal behavior, yet the firm decided not to tackle the issue.Regulating content directly often means impinging on thorny free speech issues. It’s a troublesome affair. Far better to find market-based, commercial incentives that mean the issue must be taken seriously. Will enough brands use these to make a meaningful difference? Probably not, but they have the opportunity to give Facebook the firmer poke it needs.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2020-06-24	2020-06-24 07:24:26	UL	Unilever PLC	KKR, Cinven Among Firms Weighing Unilever Tea Bids	(Bloomberg) -- Some of the world’s top buyout firms, from KKR & Co. to Cinven, are among potential suitors weighing bids for Unilever’s tea business, people familiar with the matter said.Advent International, Bain Capital and Blackstone Group Inc. are also considering making offers for the unit, which controls brands including century-old Lipton, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Unilever could fetch more than 5 billion pounds ($6.3 billion) from the divestment, depending on which assets are included in a transaction, the people said.The Unilever division has separately attracted interest from Swiss investment firm Jacobs Holding AG, the owner of chocolate maker Barry Callebaut AG, as well as private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, the people said. Some suitors are in talks to hire advisers as they prepare for the auction to kick off, according to the people. Unilever is considering starting the bidding process after the summer holidays, the people said.Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope has been seeking to reshape the operations of Unilever, which sells Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, as consumers turn away from the traditional big brands. The potential sale is poised to rank as one of company’s largest-ever disposals and would follow the $8 billion sale of its margarine and spreads business to KKR in 2017.Fierce CompetitionCinven is discussing the possibility of a joint offer for the tea business with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, according to one of the people. It teamed up with the sovereign wealth fund on some of its most high-profile purchases, including its proposed $19 billion acquisition of Thyssenkrupp AG’s elevator unit and its multibillion-dollar purchase of British scientific measurement company LGC Group this year.Shares of Unilever fell 1.2% in London trading at 8:23 a.m. Wednesday in the U.K., giving the company a market value of about $146 billion. Any transaction will add to the $345.7 billion of consumer deals announced this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Unilever said in January it’s starting a strategic review of the tea business that could result in a partial or full sale. Deliberations are at an early stage, and there’s no certainty the suitors will proceed with bids, the people said. Representatives for Unilever and the potential bidders declined to comment.Private equity firms flush with cash have been fiercely competing for assets being carved out of large corporates. Nestle SA agreed to sell its $10 billion skincare business last year to an investor group led by EQT AB. KKR reached a deal in March to buy Pennon Group Plc’s waste-management business for 4.2 billion pounds.Unilever said this month it plans to combine its U.K. and Dutch arms under a single British headquarters to boost dealmaking flexibility. Eliminating the dual legal structure will result in one class of shares and a single pool of liquidity, providing more flexibility for stock-based acquisitions and divestments, the company said.(Updates with share movement in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kkr-cinven-among-firms-weighing-165513243.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-23	2020-06-23 23:34:09	UL	Unilever PLC	Facebook Ad Boycott Gains Steam, But Small Business Can't Quit So Easily	(Bloomberg) -- A number of major apparel brands have promised to pull advertising money from Facebook Inc. as part of a coordinated campaign to pressure the social-media giant to crack down on hate speech and misinformation amid nationwide civil-rights protests and the lead-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election.Civil rights groups, including the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League and Color of Change, launched the campaign last week, asking marketers to boycott Facebook ads for the month of July, an effort they’re calling Stop Hate for Profit. The group says that Facebook, which brings in almost all of its revenue from advertising, makes money off user posts that include hate speech, racism and misinformation.A few large marketers were quick to jump on board. Outdoor apparel brand The North Face, owned by CF Corp., on June 19 tweeted “we’re out,” and confirmed to Bloomberg that it has pulled ad spending for both the main Facebook social network and its photo-sharing app Instagram until August. Recreational Equipment Inc., known as REI, which also sells sporting gear, and Upwork Inc., an online marketplace for freelancers, joined the boycott that afternoon. On June 21, Patagonia Inc. also pledged an advertising pause. On Tuesday, outdoor outfitter Arc’teryx said it would halt Facebook spending at least until the end of July, followed closely by popular ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc., part of Unilever NV.The six companies have more than 19 million combined Facebook followers, and more than 13 million on Instagram. Still, many small businesses, which make up the bulk of Facebook’s advertisers, likely can’t afford to pause spending on the social network, their main online outpost for reaching local customers—a sign of the company’s strength in the digital ad market.“We deeply respect any brand’s decision, and remain focused on the important work of removing hate speech and providing critical voting information,” said Carolyn Everson, vice president of Facebook’s Global Business Group.For years, Facebook has been the target of politicians and nonprofit groups seeking to challenge the company’s power over user data and speech content. Despite previous ad boycott efforts, and a deletefacebook trend online in early 2018, Facebook’s revenue and user growth numbers have never been seriously impacted by user or advertiser protests. Since 2016, when Facebook’s policies became the center of debate following foreign interference efforts during the U.S. election, the social network’s revenue has jumped by 150% to more than $70 billion in 2019.It’s possible the latest boycott will be the first to gain any real traction. Civil rights protests erupted in hundreds of cities across the country last month following the death of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. Many companies, including Facebook, have donated money and issued statements of support for racial justice groups. Juneteenth, the holiday celebrating the formal end of slavery in the U.S., was adopted widely as a corporate holiday by many companies for the first time this year.“It’s obviously a cultural moment of pain,” said Steve Lesnard, VP of marketing at The North Face, who said the company made the decision in “hopes that Facebook will provide stricter rules.” But support of the boycott also signals support for groups that started it, like the NAACP. “We believe that normal is not good enough and we all need to drive positive change immediately,” Lesnard added.Civil Rights groups have taken issue with Facebook for years. The Menlo Park, California-based social network enabled voter suppression efforts against African Americans in 2016, they say, and then named The Daily Caller, a right-wing outlet with ties to white nationalism, as one of its formal fact-checking partners. Most recently, Facebook left up posts from President Donald Trump threatening protesters that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a phrase with ties to a pro-segregation presidential candidate.Employees at Color of Change, a civil rights nonprofit helping lead the boycott, have phone calls set up with advertisers throughout this week in hopes of encouraging them to halt spending. “It’s not the time for statements of support that are just ‘Black Lives Matter’ and don’t come with real change,” said Jade Magnus Ogunnaike, the group’s senior campaigns director. “Now it’s time to change rules and behaviors.”It’s unclear how much money any of the brands that committed to the boycott actually spend on Facebook advertising —  for many national brands, Facebook ads are just a fraction of their overall marketing budgets — or if others will join them in holding back. While more large companies may pause spending, many small businesses, which make up the majority of Facebook advertisers, may not have that luxury. Shutting down Facebook advertising for a month, even for a cause they believe in, would pose a serious threat to online commerce brands in particular, many of which rely on Facebook ads to drive the bulk of their sales, according to multiple ad buyers. Almost 76% of Facebook’s advertising revenue comes from small- and medium-sized businesses — the kind that are unlikely to be in a position to spend a month off the platform — according to research from Deutsche Bank. “They’re in the trenches, and they’re trying to hit their numbers,” said Terry Whalen, president of the digital marketing agency Sum Digital, which works with smaller e-commerce and direct-to-consumer brands. “If you talk about boycotting Facebook, to me that sounds like a fantastic idea to send a message. But for a whole month? That’s just too ambitious.”Many smaller media buyers like Whalen – the kind who spend tens of millions of dollars per year on Facebook ads instead of hundreds of millions — first heard about the boycott from Facebook itself. The company sent its media partners an email last week acknowledging the boycott, and highlighting much of the work Facebook is doing around identifying hate speech using algorithms and defending election integrity, including a new goal to register 4 million voters ahead of the 2020 U.S. general election. “We remain open to meeting with any of these organizations and welcome feedback on the issues they have raised,” the email read.Barry Hott, VP of growth at a software company for driving website sales called Thesis, manages over $4 million in Facebook ad spending per month. He agrees that for many of his clients, Facebook is too valuable to give up. “A huge stream of their revenue is unfortunately tied directly to [Facebook] ads,” he said. “None of these clients can afford to do that.”The dependence on Facebook has been part of a broader industry discussion in recent years about the immense power of major technology companies. Facebook alone accounts for 23.4% of the entire U.S. digital advertising market, according to EMarketer, and more than 50% of the market is controlled by Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Not coincidentally, numerous U.S. regulators are investigating the tech industry’s largest companies for antitrust reasons.Facebook investors, meanwhile, don’t seem concerned that some big brands are throwing their names and their dollars behind the boycott. Deutsche Bank’s Lloyd Walmsley, an analyst covering Facebook, said that while he’s heard from many advertisers worried about marketing on social media given the current environment surrounding the protests, he doesn’t anticipate Facebook suffering any kind of long-term business harm. “Looking beyond the very short term, I think this will end up being a speed bump,” he says. Facebook stock closed Tuesday at $242.24 a share, an all-time high.“I don’t suspect that a month-long call to boycott is going to be successful,” said Whalen. “Facebook is too important.”(Updates to include boycott announcement from Ben and Jerry’s in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-ad-boycott-gains-steam-204231085.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-15	2020-06-15 15:10:09	UL	Unilever PLC	Unilever’s New Climate Plan Puts Carbon Labels on 70,000 Products	(Bloomberg) -- Unilever NV is releasing a new set of climate goals that make it the most ambitious of any consumer goods company tackling carbon emissions. The maker of Dove skincare, Colman’s mustard, and Q-tips cotton swabs now aims to zero out all emissions from its own operations and those of its suppliers by 2039.More than that, it’s going to show its work: each of the company’s 70,000 products will show on their labels how much greenhouse gas was emitted in the process of manufacturing and shipping them to consumers. The company is also committing to invest €1 billion ($1.1 billion) in climate-friendly initiatives over the next decade.The global carbon disclosure nonprofit CDP already ranks Unilever highly for climate-friendly corporate governance and prioritizing emissions reduction in its supply chain. The conglomerate set its first science-based climate target back in 2010, when it committed to cutting all the emissions associated with its products by half by 2030. Unilever’s emissions continued to rise until 2016, but they’ve been falling ever since. The company’s biggest rivals, Kraft Heinz Co. and Procter & Gamble Co., fare far worse on CDP’s scale. “While the world is dealing with the devastating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, and grappling with serious issues of inequality, we can’t let ourselves forget that the climate crisis is still a threat to all of us,” said Unilever Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope in a statement.To accomplish its new goals, Unilever will aim to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions as far as possible before leaning carbon offsets. While in theory these offsets balance out emissions by funding activities such as tree planting, landscape restoration, and regenerative farming—all of which can to suck carbon out of the air and put it back in the ground—in practice serious questions remain about the carbon accounting used by many companies offering offsets. “We could announce that we are carbon neutral today by just spending money on offsets,” says Marc Engel, Unilever’s global head of supply chain. “But we have deliberately decided not to do that.”The company emits about 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, Engel says. About 3 million metric tons of those emissions fall under Scope 1 and Scope 2, meaning the emissions are produced by Unilever burning fossil fuels to heat its offices and power its factories. Those emissions will be cut to zero by 2039 under the new plan.Unilever is further committing to eliminate 30 million metric tons of emissions produced on its behalf in the furnishing of raw materials or shipping finished products to supermarket shelves. The suppliers who create these emissions, known as Scope 3, will have nine months to adopt science-based climate targets that lead to cuts. The company’s remaining 65 million metric tons of emissions under Scope 3 are produced in the use of Unilever products—whenever someone boils water, say, for a cup of Lipton tea. Unilever will try to cut these in half by 2030. “That’s the part we least control,” Engel says. Cuts “will rely on governments greening the grid, replacing natural gas with hydrogen, etc.” But product innovation can help, such as producing detergents that can be used in washing machines with water at room temperature, rather than at high temperatures as is typical today.As part of the same climate plan, Unilever is committing to go “deforestation-free” throughout the supply chains for the five raw ingredients most associated with tree loss: palm oil, soybeans, tea, paper, and cocoa. For now the company relies on certification done by third parties, but it’s moving to a verification process that will use satellite imagery and blockchain technology.“It makes certification obsolete because you literally have real-time verification,” says Engel. That data will be made available for anyone to verify for themselves. As impressive as that seems, the deadline to get there has been pushed forward. “In 2010, Unilever committed to end deforestation for commodities by 2020,” said Greenpeace U.K. Executive Director John Sauven in a press release. “It failed and has now kicked the can even further down the road to 2023.”The most challenging task will be carbon labeling all its products. Some companies, such as oat milk-maker Oatly Inc., have started to print on their packaging how many kilograms of carbon dioxide were released in the making of products. Engel is aiming to do that for Unilever’s entire inventory, from shampoo to coffee to mayonnaise to deodorants.Currently there are no standards or third-party verification available, which means that consumers will have to take the company’s word for it. But Engel says he hopes Unilever’s competitors will follow suit, and that soon there will be an independent standard for carbon labeling just as there is for nutritional labels on foodstuffs.“It’s a very big commitment,” he says. “But we are clearly seeing that consumers want to know how the products they buy contribute to their own carbon footprint.”(Adds chief executive comment in 4th paragraph.

Jope has been criticized for failing to work as quickly as rival Nestle SA to sell flagging brands and energize others. Today he blamed the company’s two-pronged structure for getting in the way. Why is he likely to succeed where Polman failed? In 2018, the plan to unify Unilever into a single Dutch company was abandoned after opposition from some British shareholders, angry the entity probably wouldn’t have qualified for inclusion in the FTSE-100 Index. Trackers and active funds with a blue-chip mandate would likely have had to sell, effectively giving up their holdings for no premium.The new proposal, from Jope, a Brit, and Danish chairman Nils Andersen, should get around this problem. Of course, it could face opposition from Dutch investors. But the company is confident the shares will be able to remain a constituent of the Dutch AEX Index too. Some funds tracking the Euro Stoxx 50 may have to sell, but this proportion is expected to be small.Meanwhile, Unilever looks to have headed off any possible political fallout in the Netherlands. It has already engaged with the Dutch government, agreeing that if the company were ever to list the foods and refreshment business as an independent company, it would do so in the Netherlands.This acquiescence is not surprising. Unilever has strong roots in the Netherlands and will be keen to minimize the chance of an ugly row. The country also has a more protective takeover regime. The arrangement is a compromise that enables Unilever to achieve its simplification, while giving the Netherlands influence over any future Dutch foods business were it to be separated as a result.Just the mention of a possible separation of foods and refreshments is significant.Unilever says the question of a demerger is relevant for its tea business.

This division could have a market capitalization of 45 billion euros ($51 billion) on its own, Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo estimated in January. It was surprising that Unilever really missed out during the pandemic-induced panic buying and work-from-home shift in consumer demand.

Unilever said the move will make it easier for the company to do share-based acquisitions, remove complexity and further strengthen its corporate governance. Unilever said it will maintain its listings on the Amsterdam, London and New York stock exchanges and there will be no change to the operations, locations, activities or staffing levels in either the United Kingdom or The Netherlands as a result of unification. Unilever said a demerger of the tea business is one potential outcome of a portfolio review and, as was previously the case with the disposal of the company's spreads business, would be significantly more challenging under the current legal structure than under a single parent structure.

2020-06-09	2020-06-09 07:04:53	UL	Unilever PLC	What Do You Prefer, Nosecco or Prosecco?	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Fancy a glass of Nosecco?The alcohol-free sparkling wine might not be to everyone’s taste, but its catchy name caused a fight between a French group and the Italian producers of Prosecco. The outcome could have implications for companies looking to ride the trend toward alcohol-free alternatives to traditional drinks and vegan offerings that strive to look and taste like meat and dairy products.While familiar packaged-food brands, such as Kraft macaroni and cheese and Nestle’s Hot Pockets, enjoyed a revival during the pandemic, the long-term prospects remain brighter for products that are perceived as healthier. Just look at the rise of the vegan sausage roll sold at Greggs Plc. Its arrival prompted the U.K. baker to upgrade its profit forecasts several times in 2019.In fact, with the unprecedented focus on health precipitated by the novel coronavirus outbreak, the opportunities for categories such as fake meat, fish and eggs may be even bigger. What happens in the Nosecco case could be a lesson for the upstarts.Nosecco has been sold in the U.K. since 2017, and Les Grands Chais de France, the country’s largest independent wine producer responsible for J.P. Chenet and Chemin des Papes wines, wanted to establish a trademark for it. It was challenged in 2018 by a consortium representing the northeast Italian region where Prosecco is produced, which said the name brought to mind the Italian wine, which is protected by European rules on origin.The French company argued the name was never meant to rival Prosecco in the U.K. Instead, it was chosen to capture the drink’s alcohol-free quality while playing on the fact that it wasn’t “sec,” or dry, like the Italian wine, but rather sweet. But the U.K.’s Intellectual Property Office found in favor of the Italian producers, deciding that in the minds of consumers the name Nosecco evoked the hugely popular Prosecco. There was a serious risk, it said, that consumers would believe the drink was in fact non-alcoholic Prosecco. Les Grands Chais de France is now appealing the decision in the High Court.The company is not alone in facing delicate marketing issues when it comes to new food categories. It has long been debated whether dairy alternatives can be classed as milk. In Sweden, that’s culminated in a “milk war” between the country’s dairy industry and Oatly, a Swedish manufacturer of oat milk. There’s no clear winner, but the skirmish doesn’t seem to have done Oatly any harm: Oat milk is hot around the world right now. In what could be a challenge to the rise of meat substitutes, some U.S. states, including Arkansas and Mississippi, have sought to restrict the use of terms such as burgers and dogs. (Mississippi now allows plant-based food makers to use some terms so long as they carry modifiers such as meat-free.)Naming battles will likely crop up between competing alternative-food makers, too. Just last week, Nestle SA, the world’s biggest food company, said it would rename its Incredible plant-based patties as the Sensational burger. The move came after a Dutch court upheld an injunction filed by Impossible Foods Inc., citing a trademark infringement. Nestle said it will appeal the ruling.What is clear is that producers of everything from lupin burgers to non-alcoholic gin must work hard to stand out. While there is huge growth to be had, the competition will be stiff. Traditional food companies and brewers are piling in, too. Drinks giant Diageo Plc last year acquired a majority stake in Seedlip, the non-alcoholic spirit maker.There is no doubt that Nosecco was a stroke of marketing genius. But it has ended up in a protracted legal wrangle. Amid the shifting landscape for alternatives, producers will need to be innovative and creative with their branding. The Vegetarian Butcher, the meat-substitute maker acquired by Unilever Plc in December 2018, is perhaps a good example. It’s not always easy to get the message across that a dish or drink is a vegan or non-alcoholic version of an old favorite, and in an appealing way, but marketers will need to dig deep.  Otherwise, as Nosecco has shown, they could have a fight on their hands, and that’s not very appetizing for anyone.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-06-08	2020-06-08 23:00:22	UL	Unilever PLC	Economic Nationalism Is a Wrong Turn for Covid-Hit India	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants all 1.3 billion Indians to be “vocal for local” — meaning, to not just use domestically made products but also to promote them. As an overseas citizen living in Hong Kong, I’m doing my bit by very vocally demanding Indian mangoes on every trip to the grocery. But half the summer is gone, and not a single slice so far.My loss is due to India’s Covid-19 lockdown, which has severely pinched logistics, a perennial challenge in the huge, infrastructure-starved country. But more worrying than the disruption is the fruity political response to it. Rather than being a wake-up call for fixing supply chains, the pandemic seems to be putting India on an isolationist course. Why? Granted that the liberal view that trade is good and autarky bad isn’t exactly fashionable anywhere right now. What makes India’s lurch troublesome is that the pace and direction of economic nationalism may be set by domestic business interests. The Indian liberals, many of whom are Western-trained academics, authors and — at least until a few years ago — policy makers, want a more competitive economy. They will be powerless to prevent the slide.Modi’s call for a self-reliant India has been echoed by Home Minister Amit Shah, the cabinet’s unofficial No. 2, in a television interview. If Indians don’t buy foreign-made goods, the economy will see a jump, he said. The strategy — although it’s too nebulous yet to call it that — has a geopolitical element. A military standoff with China is under way, apparently triggered by India’s completion of a road and bridge near the common border in the tense Himalayan region of Ladakh. It’s very expensive to fight even a limited war there. With India’s economy flattened by Covid, New Delhi may be looking for ways to restore the status quo and send Beijing a signal.Economic boycotts, such as Chinese consumers’ rejection of Japanese goods over territorial disputes in the East China Sea, are well understood as statecraft. In these times, it’s not even necessary to name an enemy. An undercurrent of popular anger against China, the source of both the virus and India’s biggest bilateral trade deficit, is supposed to do the job. But is it ever that easy? A hastily introduced policy to stock only local goods in police and paramilitary canteens became a farcical exercise after the list of banned items ended up including products by the local units of Colgate-Palmolive Co., Nestle SA, and Unilever NV, which have had significant Indian operations for between 60 and 90 years, as well as Dabur India Ltd., a New Delhi-based maker of Ayurveda brands. The since-withdrawn list demonstrates the practical difficulty of bureaucrats trying to find things in a globalized world that are 100% indigenous. Free-trade champions fret that the prime minister, whom they saw as being on their side six years ago, is acting against their advice to dismantle statist controls on land, labor and capital to help make the country more competitive. Engage with the world more, not less, they caution. But Modi also has to satisfy the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the umbrella Hindu organisation that gets him votes. Its backbone of small traders, builders and businessmen — the RSS admits only men — was losing patience with the anemic economy even before the pandemic. Now, they’re in deep trouble, because India’s broken financial system won’t deliver even state-guaranteed loans to them. The U.S.-China tensions — over trade, intellectual property, Covid responsibility and Hong Kong’s autonomy — offer a perfect backdrop. A dire domestic economy and trouble at the border provide the foreground. Big business will dial economic nationalism up and down to hit a trifecta of goals: Block competition from the People's Republic; make Western rivals fall in line and do joint ventures; and tap deep overseas capital markets. The first goal is being achieved with newly placed restrictions on investment from any country that shares a land border with India. The second aim is to be realized by corporate lobbying to influence India's whimsical economic policies. As for the third objective, with the regulatory environment becoming tougher for U.S.-listed Chinese companies like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., an opportunity may open up for Indian firms.All this may bring India Shenzhen-style enclaves of manufacturing and trade, but it will concentrate economic power in fewer hands, something that worries liberals. They’re moved by the suffering of India’s low-wage workers, who have borne the brunt of the Covid shutdown. But when their vision of a more just society and fairer income distribution prompts them to make common cause with the ideological Left, they’re quickly repelled by the Marxist voodoo that all cash, property, bonds and real estate held by citizens or within the nation “must be treated as national resources available during this crisis.” Who will invest in a country that does that instead of just printing money? At the same time, when liberals look to the business class, they see a sudden swelling of support for ideas like a universal basic income. They wonder if this isn’t a ploy by industry to outsource part of the cost of labor to the taxpayer. Slogans like Modi’s vocal-for-local stir the pot and thicken the confusion. The value-conscious Indian consumer couldn’t give two hoots for calls to buy Indian, but large firms will know how to exploit economic nationalism. One day soon, I’ll get my mangoes — from them.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

To no one’s surprise, the results as a whole weren’t good: Earnings fell about 14% from a year earlier for members of the S&P 500 Index, according to DataTrek Research. Wall Street analysts expect things to get worse before they get better, with earnings forecast to plunge about 41% in the second quarter, decline 24% in the third quarter and drop 11% in the final three months of the year. Add them up and Wall Street forecasts a 20% tumble for the year to $127 a share. Coming into 2020, the consensus was that members of the S&P 500 would produce earnings of about $175 a share. But that’s the mile-high view. For a real sense of the challenges facing the economy, it helps to get as granular as possible. To that end, we’ve asked those Bloomberg Opinion columnists that focus on business and finance to provide their thoughts on the quarter  that snapped the longest U.S. economic expansion in history, revealing the winners and losers, highlighting interesting tidbits and musing about what may lie ahead.Bankers are the good guys? The message from the largest U.S. banks as they released their earnings in mid-April, just as the pandemic was escalating across America? We are well-capitalized, made a lot of money from trading in extremely volatile markets, and have the capacity to help our clients get through the crisis. Unlike the financial crisis just over  a decade ago, big banks have a chance to be the good guys now, processing U.S. Small Business Administration loans and allowing individuals and families to delay payments on credit cards, auto loans and mortgages in certain cases. Yet banks have been among the biggest laggards across U.S. stock markets. The KBW Bank Index has fallen about 42% this year, compared with just 12% for the S&P 500, suggesting the economic recovery might be slower and more punishing than the broader markets for equities may be signaling. —Brian ChappattaCable conundrums, streaming dreams. The absence of lucrative sports programming and muted advertiser demand has forced traditional cable-network operators to make an even bigger push into the rocky terrain of streaming, where revenue is entirely dependent on must-see content continuously propelling subscriptions. AT&T Inc. said total ad sales fell 13%, while Walt Disney Co. said ESPN alone suffered an 8% drop. Meanwhile, almost 16 million people signed up for Netflix and about 2 million canceled cable TV. —Tara LachapelleGorging on comfort food. As panic-ridden consumers stock up on essentials, Big Food brands of yesteryear, from Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes to Kraft macaroni and cheese, that had been struggling to find their place in a new health-conscious society suddenly had a moment. This explains the resurgence of companies such as General Mills Inc., whose brands include Betty Crocker, Pillsbury and Totino’s pizza rolls. Its U.S. retail sales surged 45% in March and 32% in April. The question: Is this only a moment? We’re also noticing some quirky consumer habits. Unilever NV said we are using less deodorant, skin care and shampoo, as much of this use is associated with work and socializing. Henkel AG enjoyed strong demand for home hair coloring. If the recession is a long one, expect these habits to continue. —Tara Lachapelle and Andrea FelstedAmazon isn’t alone. E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc.’s sales increased 26% in the quarter, and the company forecast up to 28% growth for its April-through-June quarter as nationwide lockdowns sparked a surge in online shopping. But overwhelming demand and shortages are giving its rivals opportunities as consumers increasingly shop elsewhere. It's showing up in the latest metrics from Shopify Inc.'s merchants, as well as Wayfair Inc., Best Buy Co., Target Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp. — all pointing to much faster online sales growth rates than the tech giant. —Tae KimBig Tech divergence. Shares of Facebook Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. rose post-earnings following better-than-feared commentary on April digital ad market trends. Even so, Facebook cautioned the future economic recovery may be worse than expected. And Google said not to extrapolate the stabilization that seemed to occur in April. Both internet ad giants may face business pressures going forward if companies cut their marketing budgets in coming quarters. In contrast, Amazon and Netflix are thriving as consumers increasingly shift spending to e-commerce and watch more streaming video content. Finally, Apple Inc. uncharacteristically failed to give sales guidance for its current quarter for the first time since 2003, signaling the lack of visibility it has for iPhone demand. —Tae KimCovid-time tech winners. Best-of-breed cloud software makers are surging as companies accelerate the spending shift away from traditional on-premise equipment to the cloud's more scalable and cost-efficient offerings. Some of the biggest earnings winners included Datadog Inc., Okta Inc. and Twilio Inc. Video-game stocks are one of the hottest-performing subsectors this year as it has become a key in-home entertainment choice under shelter-in-place orders. Both Activision Blizzard Inc. and Electronic Arts Inc. posted strong results and confirmed accelerating sales for its offerings in April. Investors also bid up Zoom Video Communications and Slack shares as the two companies benefited from the workforce-collaboration software trend and revealed strong accelerating business metrics. —Tae KimPharma unfazed, for now. As a wide variety of industries panicked and cut profit targets, large drugmakers broadly reaffirmed guidance in the first quarter. Merck & Co., which makes many hospital- and physician-administered treatments, was the only big firm to slash its drug sales forecast seriously. Making medicine is a durable business, even in a pandemic. However, if a strong second-half economic recovery doesn't materialize, more companies may follow Merck as patients make the tough decision to stay home instead of venturing out and seeking treatments. —Max NisenCover me. Large health insurers were also relatively sanguine, despite a pandemic that would seemingly spark increased claims. They believe that the dive in expensive elective surgeries will balance out adverse effects. That doesn't mean there won't be change. UnitedHealth Group Inc. announced this month that it plans to re-enter Obamacare's insurance markets after mostly exiting four years ago. A 14% unemployment rate will do that. Watch for imitators. —Max NisenCashing in on Covid cures? During Gilead Sciences Inc.’s first-quarter earnings call, an analyst asked CEO Daniel O'Day if investors should expect the sort of attractive returns from newly confirmed Covid treatment remdesivir that the company produces for other drugs. O'Day responded that ""there's been no other time like this in the history of the planet"" and that ""we understand our responsibility."" In other words, probably not. Gilead announced on Tuesday a temporary royalty-free license that will allow five generic drugmakers to make a presumably cheaper version for more than 100 low-income nations. Other companies will face pressure to follow its example and price moderately in developed countries, which calls into question the soaring valuations for pandemic-focused drugmakers. —Max NisenGoing local. Still spending. Coronavirus shutdowns have snarled industrial-supply chains already facing strain from the U.S.-China trade war. While no one envisions an abandonment of China as a manufacturing hub, there are early signs of work being brought back to the U.S. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to mean much in terms of jobs, at least not for humans. Rockwell Automation Inc. said it's seen an uptick in interest from companies that might have previously manufactured products out of Asia to take advantage of low wages but are now rethinking that economic calculus. When it comes to investment, discretionary spending on things like travel has been cut across the board at many manufacturers. Most CEOs and top executives have taken pay cuts. Buybacks are off the table but for a few brave souls, including Eaton Corp. But many manufacturers are continuing to fund projects they view as essential to their future growth. For United Parcel Service Inc., that means investments in automation that can help make e-commerce deliveries more profitable. For Caterpillar Inc., that's services work and expanding its product lineup. ""I'm not planning on sacrificing the future just to cut back on capex,"" Honeywell International Inc. CEO Darius Adamczyk said on a recent earnings call. —Brooke SutherlandPink slips or paychecks? While aerospace manufacturers such as Boeing Co. and General Electric Co. have moved swiftly to announce large layoffs amid a collapse in the industry, other industrial companies have been more surgical, at least for now. Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby has said his company's efforts to hold headcount relatively flat even as revenue climbed the past few years means there's less slack in the system and the company doesn't have to be as ruthless on job cuts during the pandemic. Others, such as railroad Union Pacific Corp., are worried about having enough labor at the ready whenever a recovery does occur so prefer furloughs when possible. ""We don't want to cut the talent so deep that when the recovery happens, we don't have the right people,"" said Greg Hayes, CEO of Raytheon Technologies Corp., whose robust balance sheet and defense business give it more flexibility to weather the commercial aerospace downturn. Companies can still save costs without cutting employees: Trash-hauler Waste Management Inc. is guaranteeing 40 hours a week of pay for full-time employees through the pandemic, but the redistribution of its workers has helped it reduce more costly overtime hours by half. —Brooke SutherlandStaying safe. Most manufacturers have kept their doors open through the pandemic because their work is considered essential. That has come at a cost: Trash-hauler Republic Services Inc. spent $3 million in the first quarter on actions to keep its employees safe, including providing them with protective gear and doing enhanced cleaning. To keep Emerson Electric Co.'s factories humming, Chief Operating Officer Steve Pelch had to rent aircraft to bring in crucial supplies and double the number of buses used to transport workers in Mexico so they can safely spread out, according to an interview with Bloomberg News's Thomas Black. Automated doors have been installed, as have hand-washing stations. Plexiglass partitions separate workers on the factory floor. Siemens AG digitally redesigned an Airbus SE factory that's been repurposed for ventilator manufacturing to ensure social distancing, and workers must pass through a sanitization tent to gain access. In what could be a key test for the reopening of other parts of the economy, automakers with large union workforces including General Motors Co. and Ford Motors Co. are bringing their factories back to life this week in preparation for a May 18 official restart. Ford said it will require face masks for anyone entering its facilities, as well as safety glasses with side or face shields for those employees whose jobs don't allow for social distancing. It's spacing out production shifts to allow more time for cleaning and requiring employees to complete daily health and temperature checks. —Brooke SutherlandOil, oil everywhere. At a primeval level, the oil business is all about sinking money into the ground. When the barrel gods are smiling, even more money comes back up. In 2020, it feels like the gods aren’t happy. Hence, earnings season for oil companies was odd. While exploration and production companies are always careful to talk up efficiency, what really gets the juices flowing are spending plans for new wells. Not this time. Parsley Energy Inc., which fracks in America’s oil heartland, the Permian basin, suspended drilling, declaring bluntly (and correctly) that right now, “the world does not need more of our product.” At the other end of the scale, Exxon Mobil Corp. also slashed spending this year to as little as — get ready for it — $23 billion! While Exxon recognizes the immediate impact of Covid-19, it doesn’t think “events like this change basic human nature or people's wants and desires.” The jury remains out on that notion. And in any case, the switch from budget boasting to public prudence offers a glimpse of what peak oil could mean for what’s ahead. Expect dissonance. —Liam DenningThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Beth Williams is a managing editor with Bloomberg Opinion.

2020-05-13	2020-05-13 17:09:45	UL	Unilever PLC	Uber Requires Drivers and Passengers to Wear Masks in Cars	(Bloomberg) -- Uber Technologies Inc. outlined new safety procedures at a virtual event on Wednesday, a move aimed to inspire more drivers and riders to feel comfortable getting in a shared car again.The rules will require drivers, passengers and food delivery couriers to wear face masks as cities begin to reopen across the U.S. After the Covid-19 pandemic began spreading rapidly more than two months ago in the U.S., Uber urged riders to stay home and shuttered its carpool service completely. Drivers were often conflicted about continuing to pick up the few remaining passengers or putting their health at risk.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended wearing face coverings in public since April 3 to prevent the spread of the virus. But masks have become a polarizing sign. Some people believe they aren’t necessary and that the economic effects of the lockdowns outweigh the health risks. President Donald Trump has long defended his decision to not wear a mask, helping to fuel an anti-mask movement across the U.S. that has spurred protests, fights and at least one fatal shooting.Uber will also ask drivers to submit a selfie showing them wearing a mask. Drivers who refuse the verification in the U.S., Canada, India and most of Europe and Latin America will not be able to go online beginning May 18.“We’ve designed this feature to adapt to changing public health guidance and regulations as the pandemic evolves,” Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said in a blog post. The mask policy will remain in effect through June and be reassessed based on local public health needs. The global pandemic has been taken a toll on Uber’s ride-hailing business, with rides down about 80% globally in April. As a result, Uber announced cost-cutting measures last week, including ending food delivery operations in seven countries and trimming 14% of its workforce. But Uber’s food delivery service, Uber Eats, has fared better as homebound people order more takeout. Uber has approached Grubhub Inc. about a takeover, according to people familiar with the situation, a move that could combine two of the largest food-delivery services in the U.S. The proposed deal is already facing resistance from officials, who said Uber has failed to set up adequate safety measures to mitigate the risk of infection for drivers.Under the new rules, riders will also need to confirm they’ve taken precautions, including wearing a mask and washing their hands, and must agree to sit in the back seat and open windows for ventilation. Uber is also reducing the maximum suggested number of passengers for an UberX ride to 3 from 4. Drivers will be able to cancel a trip without penalty if they don’t feel safe, including if the rider isn't wearing a face mask.Other efforts Uber is making to keep drivers and passengers safe include allocating $50 million to purchase supplies like masks, disinfectant sprays and wipes, hand sanitizer, and gloves. As of this week, Uber has obtained more than 23million masks for drivers and delivery people around the world, the company said. Uber also announced two new partnerships, with Clorox Co. and Unilever Plc, to provide disinfecting tips and hygiene kits for drivers and delivery people in some markets.  For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-requires-drivers-passengers-wear-170945252.html?.tsrc=rss

Reiss said Ben & Jerry's ""happy cows"" claim was merely an opinion, and that Ehlers did not show that reasonable consumers would buy its ice cream solely because the company said on its website it used ingredients from ""Caring Dairy"" farms."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unilevers-ben-jerrys-prevails-happy-233047462.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-24	2020-04-24 12:14:50	UL	Unilever PLC	We're Pampering Our Pets More Than Ourselves	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In a locked down world, cat food is in, but deodorant is out. How consumers adapt to pandemic life is playing out in the contrasting performances of two big consumer goods companies: Nestle SA and Unilever.Nestle, which has been fine-tuning its focus on food, on Friday posted its highest rate of growth for almost five years, with a 4.3% increase in first-quarter sales excluding currency movements, acquisitions and disposals. That far outstripped the showing at Unilever, which didn’t manage any sales expansion in the first quarter despite demand for disinfectant soaring.Food is usually the sleepy cousin of faster-growing personal-care products, such as skin creams and shampoo. However, the Covid-19 crisis has turned this on its head.Nestle, which generated about 15% of its sales from pet care in 2019, has doubly benefited from an embrace of our furry friends in this unsettling time. Not only did people panic buy for their cats and dogs, but they’re pampering them more now that they’re spending more time with them. Pet food sales helped Nestle’s overall organic sales growth increase by more than 7% in both the Americas and Europe.By contrast, Americans and Europeans are spending less time worrying about their own appearance, be it tinkering with their hair, shaving or applying makeup and moisturizer. With nowhere to go, the change in behavior is so radical that, according to Unilever, a typical day stuck at home entails on average 11 fewer “personal care moments.”That’s a big problem for Unilever. The company generates 42% of sales from its beauty and personal-care brands, such as Dove moisturizers and Timotei shampoo. And it’s absent from some categories that have been performing well, such as hair dye for use at home.But this isn’t just the corporate equivalent of being in the right place at the right time.Nestle’s chief executive officer, Mark Schneider, has made some canny changes to the Swiss firm’s portfolio, which includes coffee, bottled water and frozen food. Of course, no one had a crystal ball, but those decisions now look prescient. The company sold a skin-health business that makes Botox, which looks very wise now that nobody can get to the beauty salon. It completed the sale of its U.S. ice cream business at the end of January, so it didn’t suffer as much Unilever from the decline in demand in this category. Nestle has really scored from its $7 billion deal two years ago for the right to sell Starbucks products outside of cafes. The pandemic has turned people into their own baristas forcing them to stock up on coffee at the supermarket. Schneider is continuing to reshape Nestle, with a strategic review of the Yinlu business that makes traditional Chinese porridge and peanut milk.Change at Unilever hasn’t been as dramatic. The Anglo-Dutch company has made small bolt-on acquisitions in what have been fast-growing categories such as plant-based meat and premium beauty products like Hourglass cosmetics. This is sensible given long-term trends, but these products are facing headwinds right now. For example, a large proportion of the company’s beauty offerings are sold through North American retailers such as Ulta Beauty Inc., which are currently closed.Now led by company veteran Alan Jope, Unilever has also been more reticent about big disposals. It sold its spreads business in 2017, and is reviewing its tea division, which includes brands such as PG Tips and Lipton.Investors certainly seem to be backing Schneider’s approach over that of Jope. On a price-to-earnings basis, Unilever is at its biggest discount to Nestle for more than a decade.How Unilever performs during the crisis should spur a rethink of the portfolio. The company is well placed in one sense with many of its brands in the mass-market segment. In the downturn that will inevitably follow the pandemic consumers will trade down. But some brands also look tired. Will a large number of people really turn to Brut aftershave and V05 shampoo or Toni&Guy when supermarkets and discount retailers do a good job in cheaper alternatives?Home workers using less deodorant isn’t just an issue for those sharing a lockdown space.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is also seeing voters take a second look at their support. With his campaign limited to a few livestream events a week, he hasn’t been able to capitalize on Trump’s newfound weakness.Three weeks ago, only 5% of voters overall were undecided in the 2020 race. That number has jumped to 12%, and 16% in one Fox News poll, as voters appear to find both candidates wanting during a national emergency.Lockdown Pushes Economy Into Record Slump (4 p.m. HK)Europe’s economy suffered a massive blow in April when government restrictions to contain the coronavirus left companies fighting to stay afloat. An estimate of private-sector activity in the euro area plunged to just 13.5 from 29.7 in March, IHS Markit said Thursday. The drop was far sharper than economists had anticipated and marks a record low for the Purchasing Managers’ Index.Figures for Germany and France, the euro region’s two biggest economies, also pointed to unprecedented slumps at the start of the second quarter.Merkel Urges Germany to Support EU Stimulus (3:57 p.m. HK)German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a Europe-wide economic stimulus program to be financed by the European Union’s budget, making a national appeal that helping its partners would be good for Germany.“A European growth program could support an upswing over the next two years and we’ll work for that,” Merkel said in a speech to the lower house of parliament in Berlin on Thursday. “We want to act quickly in Europe, and we, of course, need instruments to be able to quickly deal with the effects of the crisis in all member states.”Italy Sees 2020 Deficit Soaring (3:51 p.m. HK)Italy’s government expects its budget deficit to spiral to 10.4% of gross domestic product this year as the economy, paralyzed by a nationwide lockdown, is seen shrinking by 8%. The government is set to request parliamentary approval for broadening the budget deficit by 55 billion euros ($59.4 billion) to fund a new stimulus package, according to officials, who asked not to be identified discussing a draft economic and financial plan. The plan is still being worked on and details could change, they said. The cabinet may meet to approve the program Thursday.Cruise Ship That Triggered Surge Leaves Australia (3:43 p.m. HK)A coronavirus-stricken cruise ship that’s been the source of hundreds of cases and at least 20 deaths in Australia, leading to a criminal investigation, has began its departure from the country. The Princess Cruises-operated Ruby Princess left Port Kembla in New South Wales state on Thursday and is expected to sail to the Philippines where it will offload its crew, weeks after its passengers were allowed to disembark in Sydney before test results were known.Russia Cases Drop Again (3:30 p.m. HK)Russia reported fewer new coronavirus cases for a second straight day. New infections rose by 4,774 over the past day, down from 5,236, taking the total to 62,773. The death toll rose by 42 to 555.The number of new cases has remained above 4,000 for seven days, but the daily increase in total cases has slowed down to 8.2% from over 14% a week ago.Singapore Has 1,000 New Cases for Fourth Day (3:26 p.m. HK)Singapore confirmed an additional 1,037 cases of coronavirus cases with the majority coming from foreign worker dormitories. This compares with 1,016 cases the day before. Initially seen as a global model for how to contain the pandemic, Singapore now has the most reported infections in Southeast Asia as cases among foreign laborers living in densely packed dormitories surged.The city-state is “very likely” to see a sharper fall in GDP, trade and industry minister Chan Chun Sing said Thursday in an interview. “We are really concerned that worldwide, this is going to lead to a more serious problem than many had anticipated just a month ago.”U.K. Is Set to Sell Most Debt on Record (2:57 p.m. HK)The U.K. will raise in four months of debt sales almost as much as it did during the height of the global financial crisis, as the government steps up borrowing to combat the economic chaos wrought by the coronavirus.It will sell 180 billion pounds ($222 billion) from May to July. Together with the 45 billion pounds it plans on raising in April, offerings this year will likely dwarf the 228 billion pound record in 2009-10. Last month it estimated a total of 156.1 billion pounds of sales for the fiscal year.SNB Posts Record $39 Billion Loss (2:47 p.m. HK)The Swiss National Bank reported a record first-quarter loss of 38.2 billion francs ($39.3 billion) after its stock portfolio was hit by the market rout caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The SNB, with the legal status of a corporation, said on Thursday that poor equity markets in the first three months of the year caused a 31.9 billion franc hit to its portfolio. The franc’s appreciation against other currencies also contributed to losses. A valuation gain on its gold holdings and on fixed income securities, as well as interest and dividend income helped offset some of those losses.German Coalition Agrees on Package (2:43 p.m. HK)Germany’s ruling coalition agreed on a 10 billion-euro ($10.8 billion) package of further measures to dampen the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis, as party leaders settled differences over how to tackle the next stage of the pandemic.Chancellor Angela Merkel and coalition leaders sealed an accord to temporarily reduce value-added tax for restaurants and increase the amount of money paid as state wage support as part of a seven-point plan to fine-tune the government’s crisis response. The agreement came after almost eight hours of wrangling in the chancellery in Berlin.Unilever Withdraws Guidance (2:16 p.m. HK)Unilever withdrew financial guidance for the year because of coronavirus-related disruptions to the food and household-products giant’s global business. Like other consumer-goods companies, Unilever is benefiting from strong sales of cleaning products -- it owns the Cif and Domestos brands.Credit Suisse Takes Hit (2:15 p..m. HK)Credit Suisse Group AG is taking more than $1 billion in writedowns and provisions for bad loans after the coronavirus, joining U.S. banks in taking an upfront hit as the outbreak pummels economic activity across the globe.Hermes Reopens Mainland China Stores (2:01 p.m. HK)Hermes International reported a smaller decline in first-quarter sales than analysts expected. The company said it has reopened all of its mainland Chinese stores, preparing for a bounce back in demand after the coronavirus outbreak erased demand for luxury goods.Hermes has been gradually resuming operations at its French workshops since April 14, having shuttered them a month earlier. With the majority of products produced in-house in France, Hermes could be among the brands most exposed to supply constraints when stores reopen.German Cases Increase (1:40 p.m. HK)The number of coronavirus cases in Germany rose for the second time in five days as the government considers how to tackle the next stage of the crisis.There were 2,195 new cases in the 24 hours through Thursday morning, bringing the total to 150,648, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Fatalities rose by 229 to 5,315. The death rate is now at 3.53%, while the number of people who have recovered climbed to more than 103,000.Hyundai Predicts Earnings Hit, Renault Profit Plunges (1:33 p.m. HK)Hyundai Motor Co. predicted weakening profitability for this quarter as the coronavirus outbreak weighs on car demand, after reporting a decline in net income for the first three months of the year. Renault SA posted a plunge in first-quarter sales and said it’s impossible to judge the impact the coronavirus will have on results as the pandemic clobbers the auto industry. Earlier Daimler scrapped forecast.Renault acting CEO Clotilde Delbos said there are good reasons to seek billions of euros in state-backed loans “to be on the safe side” during the global coronavirus pandemic.Australia to Keep Borders Shut (1:31 p.m. HK)Australia will keep its international borders closed for at least three to four months to protect itself from the coronavirus pandemic that continues to deepen in other parts of the world. Border restrictions would likely be the final measure lifted and would stay in place even if other rules were eased, according to Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported Thursday.Six Vaccines in Human Trial, WHO Says (12:12 p.m. HK)The World Health Organization said there are 83 coronavirus vaccines in development globally, with six candidates -- half of them in China -- already in human trials, as drugmakers race to find a cure for the deadly pathogen. That’s an improvement from April 13, when the WHO said there were 70 vaccines in development, with three candidates in human trials.South Korea Prepares for Second Wave (11:13 a.m. HK)The country will prepare for a second wave of novel coronavirus in the fall and winter as many experts have warned of the possibility, said Yoon Tae-ho, the director general of health ministry. There is a high chance of fast spread again as there is no vaccine or treatment yet and immunity in population hasn’t been created.NZ to Look at options on Stimulating Economy (9:55 a.m. HK)New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern won’t rule any stimulus option in or out.Asked about the possibility of the government making direct payments to households, she said: “We are working through the range of options for making sure we are continuing to help our economy to recover. We haven’t ruled anything in or out at this stage. We are focused on doing what will help our economy recover the fastest”Panic Buying in North Korea (9:37 a.m. HK)Consumers in North Korea’s capital this week have been “panic buying” food staples, causing some store shelves to empty, according to a news service that specializes in the country.The purchases may be due to stricter coronavirus measures on the way for Pyongyang and don’t appear related to reports this week that leader Kim Jong Un may be seriously ill, NK News reported, citing people who live in Pyongyang and were able to communicate outside the country. Shortages were initially limited to imported fruit and vegetables and then moved on to other goods, it said.Mexico Numbers Jump (9:26 a.m. HK)The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Mexico rose by more than 1,000 in one day for the first time on Wednesday, signaling the country’s curve is moving sharply higher.Confirmed cases rose by 11% to 10,544, Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said. The number of deaths rose by 13% to 970. The Health Ministry estimates as many as eight times more people have had the virus than is shown by the official data.NYSE May Reopen in Phases (9:16 a.m. HK)The New York Stock Exchange may reopen in phases starting in May, CNN reporter Shimon Prokupecz said in tweet, citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter. There will be reduced headcount on the NYSE floor when it does open and social distancing guidelines will be in place. An NYSE spokesman declined to comment to Bloomberg on the CNN report.China Reports No Deaths (8:45 a.m. HK)China reported no deaths from the coronavirus for the eighth straight day. Confirmed cases rose by 10, with six of them from abroad, according to the country’s National Health Commission. The country also reported 27 asymptomatic cases, the least since it started reporting such cases at the beginning of the month. China has 984 asymptomatic coronavirus cases under medical observation as of April 22.Total confirmed coronavirus cases are at 82,798, while the death toll is at 4,632.Shanghai allowed companies and individuals of the city to book for nucleic acid tests in designated hospitals, according to a statement on the city government official microblog.South Korea’s Economy Shrinks Most Since 2008 (7:21 a.m. HK)South Korea’s economy suffered its worst contraction since the global financial crisis in the first quarter as the spread of the coronavirus hit consumer spending and business activity.Gross domestic product shrank 1.4% in the three months through March from the prior quarter. Economists had forecast a 1.5% contraction. South Korea was one of the first countries hit by the outbreak, with the world’s second-highest caseload in February. It has since managed to flatten the infection curve without forcing shutdowns.Trump Says He Disagrees With Georgia Reopening Plans (6:42 a.m. HK)President Trump said he spoke with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and told him he disagreed with the decision to relax some of the state’s restrictions. Tattoo studios, nail salons and massage parlors are among the businesses allowed to open in Georgia starting Friday.“I disagree with what he’s doing,” Trump said at his daily briefing. “I think it’s too soon.”CDC Director Denies Warning Second Wave May Be Worse (6:30 a.m. HK)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield denied telling the Washington Post that a second wave of the coronavirus in the U.S. this winter may be worse than what the country already has experienced.“I didn’t say that this was going to be worse,” Redfield said Wednesday at a White House press conference. “I said it was going to be more difficult and potentially complicated” because of the flu and coronavirus circulating at the same time.Redfield was quoted by the newspaper on Tuesday as saying a resurgence in the virus could coincide with flu season and strain the health-care system. He said Wednesday he was accurately quoted in the article, but that the headline lacked context.Official Ousted for Questioning Trump-Touted Drug (6:04 a.m. HK)Rick Bright, who left his role as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority this week, said he was removed from his post because he insisted on limiting the use of a drug President Trump has pushed as a Covid-19 treatment despite little clinical evidence it works.The drugs Trump touted, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, “clearly lack scientific merit,” Bright said in a statement through his lawyers on WednesdayFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-cases-slow-york-plans-221651796.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-17	2020-04-17 08:35:00	UL	Unilever PLC	Stock Investors Prize Companies With Less Debt in India Lockdown	(Bloomberg) -- Stock investors are rewarding Indian companies with a smaller debt load as solvency has increasingly become a worry in an economy under the world’s largest lockdown.A basket of Indian equities with the highest credit quality has outperformed those with the lowest by about 30 percentage points this year, according to a Bloomberg measure based on factors including debt levels and cash flows. The divergence in performance widened as fear about the coronavirus outbreak increased in March.The all-but-certain recession for India in the coming months is forcing stock buyers to think like credit investors, focusing on firms with solid cash buffers to survive the public health crisis. Tracking investor behaviors elsewhere in the world, they are willing to pay a premium for those that have lower debt burdens, or are able to sustain their growth from internal cash.Brijesh Ved, head of equities at BNP Paribas Asset Management India, said he’s evaluating companies’ ability to repay debt more stringently in the current environment and that his team is running “stress case scenarios across sectors.” Sachin Shah, a fund manager at Emkay Investment Managers Ltd., is using a proprietary model that quantifies corporate governance as well as financial data to identify companies with balance-sheet strength, meaning zero or low debt.Among the companies listed on the NSE Nifty 50 Index, food-to-apparel conglomerate ITC Ltd. has the most amount of cash relative to its short-term debt. Its shares have declined 4% since March, compared with a 21% plunge in the benchmark. Chemical producer Grasim Industries Ltd. is among the ones with the worst ability to service debt, and has slumped 21% over the period.For now, many investors are finding shelter in stocks of Indian software service providers, which not only are less connected to the domestic economy, but also are relatively cash-rich and well-placed to meet near-term obligations. Companies in more cyclical sectors whose performance tends to follow the trajectory of economic growth, such as banking, energy and metals, have suffered. The Nifty 50 index rose 1.7% on Friday, taking gains from a March 23 low to more than 20% and entering a technical bull market.“Once things gradually begin to stabilize, and we start heading towards the recovery phase, the move towards cyclical businesses could come back,” said BNP Paribas’ Ved.(Updates Nifty 50 performance in second last paragraph.

2020-04-13	2020-04-13 09:24:34	UL	Unilever PLC	Satellites Are Helping to Track Food Supplies in Coronavirus Era	(Bloomberg) -- As the coronavirus pandemic leads to anxiety over the strength of the world’s food supply chains, everyone from governments to banks are turning to the skies for help.Orbital Insight, a California-based Big Data company that uses satellites, drones, balloons and cell phone geolocation data to track what’s happening on Earth, has seen inquiries about monitoring food supplies double in the past two months, according to James Crawford, founder and chief executive officer of the company.“We’re helping supply chain managers, financial institutions, and government agencies answer questions they never thought they would have to ask,” Crawford said in a phone interview.The coronavirus outbreak has triggered a fresh surge in demand for alternative data to shed light on how the pandemic is impacting industries and trade across the globe. That’s especially important as multiple government lockdowns and tighter restrictions on the movement of people and goods upend supply chains and logistics everywhere from Asia to Europe and the Americas.Risks to food supply chains are becoming more noticeable as millions of people around the world are affected by government-imposed lockdowns, causing logistical nightmares, and as infections spread including among workers that are responsible to getting food from farms to supermarket shelves.Truckers in Europe are enduring lengthy wait times, thousands of shipping containers are piling up in a rice port in the Philippines, and curfews in Guatemala and Honduras may slow shipments of specialty coffee. In the U.S., the world’s biggest pork producer is warning of meat shortages after the virus outbreak among employees forced a major plant to shut, while India said shipments of sugar may slow due to a lack of labor at ports and mills.Orbital customers have been asking for data such as when cargo ships leave ports, when plants close, and the number of passengers traveling through airports. As infections continue to spike, clients in recent weeks began concentrating on tracking grocers, wholesalers, and distribution centers to monitor everything from food supplies to the production of medical supplies at specific factories, Crawford said.It’s not just those looking to monitor supply chains that have turned to alternative data. Companies seeking to strike deals at a time when quarantine is preventing in-person meetings are also edging toward unusual methods to get more information. Coty Inc., which owns brands such as Wella and OPI, and suitors for its professional beauty unit are considering conducting due diligence by flying drones across manufacturing facilities, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Early DetectionUnilever NV, which counts on Orbital to improve the traceability of raw materials along its supply chains, is using technology such as crawlers and artificial intelligence to comb through millions of deliveries and thousands of suppliers to spot potential risks or shortages.The consumer goods giant is looking for warning signs by analyzing delivery patterns to see if suppliers are struggling to keep up with demand and checking suppliers’ financial health so it can quickly look for alternatives, said Marc Engel, chief supply chain officer at Unilever.“It’s all about can I get my raw materials, do I have enough people to run my factories, and can trucks drive across countries to deliver the goods,” Engel said by phone from London. “You can sit and wait around until it happens, but then you’re usually too late.”Orbital has received funding in the past from Bloomberg Beta, a venture-capital unit of Bloomberg LP.(Adds food supply chain disruptions around the world in 5th graph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/satellites-helping-track-food-supplies-210000258.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-31	2020-03-31 08:07:46	UL	Unilever PLC	No Touching, No Actors as Advertisers Confront Life in Isolation	(Bloomberg) -- Shaking hands has a publicity problem -- so does walking through crowds, attending a concert and passing out high fives.Scenes like these are disappearing from advertisements as companies come to grips with public health orders to self isolate and limit the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Ads that were in the works have been shelved and campaigns have to be reworked on a short timeline. Travel and hospitality companies have gone quiet. Meanwhile, with so much of the world on lockdown, it’s not exactly easy to shoot new commercials.“You have to ask what meaning does your commercial have right now, given that everything has changed in the immediate realities of life,” said Mark Lund, chief executive officer of McCann Worldgroup U.K. “How do you avoid that tone deafness which might offend and alienate people?”The U.K. advertising regulator said it got 163 complaints about a KFC television ad in March which featured people licking their fingers. Complaints said it was irresponsibly encouraging unsanitary behavior, according to a spokesperson for the Advertising Standards Authority. When the agency contacted the fried-chicken fast food chain, whose longtime slogan is “Finger lickin’ good,” the company had already decided to pull the ads.Unilever Plc suspended its “Unstoppable” campaign for Domestos, including a video ad that said the toilet cleaner kills germs that are “hiding, breeding, infecting the weak.”Getting InventiveIn addition to new sensitivities around hygiene, advertisers are having to cope with limited resources to make new commercials as production crews and actors self-isolate.“World War II comes to advertising land. What can you make out of this empty washing-up-liquid bottle and a bit of sticky-back plastic?” said Emma de la Fosse, chief creative officer of Digitas Inc.’s U.K. business. “It’s about being inventive.”A cookie brand that Digitas works with had to pivot quickly from a campaign about going out to one about staying in and staying safe, she said. Agencies are getting creative with footage that’s already been shot, and they’re looking at user-generated content and social-media influencers, though the quality can be hit-and-miss, Fosse said.Lund said that McCann has done an ad for grocery store Aldi using existing footage and resurrecting an animated carrot from its Christmas campaign telling shoppers to “go easy” on the vegetables.As the lockdown drags on, advertisers will also have to make the decision about whether to make a bigger pivot on campaigns, such as commissioning more animation and using computer-generated imagery that can be produced by teams of graphic designers, art directors and 3D modelers working from home.“The likelihood is things will take a bit longer, but there is no creative compromise,” said Mark Benson, CEO of global creative ad studio Moving Picture Company. Brands are coming to the studio to complete ads that were already in production with special effects, he said. “For example, an auto spot where the car would have normally been shot by a specialist auto director -- it still can be, but the car will be built by animators in computer graphics instead of shot live-action on location.”New TechnologyAnimation and visual effects studios were already changing the way they work so teams can collaborate remotely, and shifting computing horsepower from office servers to the cloud. The shock of the coronavirus will hasten the move to new video production methods, said Neil Hatton, CEO of film and TV industry lobby group the UK Screen Alliance.“There are parallels with the Japanese tsunami, which accelerated a move from production delivered on tape to production on computer file as the tsunami wiped out the tape-manufacturing companies on the coast of Japan,” said Hatton.For an industry that prides itself on creativity, ingenuity is more important than ever. Advertisers may be facing a worse setback than the 10% retraction in marketing spending that followed the 2009 financial crisis, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Bloxham said. Ads typically cost companies the equivalent of about 11% or 12% of sales and are easy to reduce. The slump is going to spread quickly from the travel and leisure industry clients, who cut their spending immediately, to luxury goods, cars and clothes, he said.Read more: TV Industry Faces Billions in Lost Ads During Sports Hiatus“We know that it’s going to be quite a sharp kind of effect -- the question is how long that effect goes on for,” McCann’s Lund said. “We’re having conversations with our clients about what does the world look like on the other side and what does it mean for brands and how they exist in people’s lives.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/no-touching-no-actors-advertisers-080746941.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-28	2020-03-28 00:00:50	UL	Unilever PLC	Why Disease and Xenophobia Go Hand in Hand	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Pandemics have always been fellow travelers of globalization. A third phenomenon stalks in their shadow: racism.That's worrying. The global threat of Covid-19 seems to be leading not to a unified global response, but to an American president who until Tuesday was describing it as a “Chinese virus” while officials in Beijing stirred up conspiracy theories on social media about a U.S. military origin for the disease. Already, stories are proliferating of people subject to abuse and attacks for “coughing while Asian,” or being turned away from businesses because of actual or presumed Chinese ethnicity.Sadly, there’s nothing new in this. As my colleague Pankaj Mishra has written, the current situation parallels events a century ago, when the first interconnected world economy unraveled into the chaos of World War I. It was disease, as much as war and revolution, that drove that collapse.The age of sail had imposed a natural restraint on both epidemics and migration. It took as long as a month to cross the Atlantic, meaning any infections had already burned themselves out by the time a port was reached. When typhus spread to North America among Irish emigrants fleeing the potato famine of the 1840s under sail, the onboard outbreaks were so notorious that the boats were nicknamed “coffin ships.”Steamships changed all that, opening up ocean transport by drastically lowering its cost and cutting the time needed for transatlantic crossings to less than a week. That helped spark the first era of mass migration as millions of Europeans left for the new world — but it also put the length of a transatlantic journey well within the period when diseases could spread unnoticed.Cholera, which had previously been confined to an endemic area around Bengal, spread among the officers and traders of the British Empire to inflict devastating epidemics on every continent. Smallpox pandemics played a crucial role in the Americas since Columbus’s day, enabling colonialism due to their devastating impacts on indigenous populations. Yellow fever crept up repeatedly from the Caribbean and central America to ravage the southern U.S. In 1889, the first modern influenza pandemic spread rapidly from Russia to North America.Since that era, immigration restrictions and public health measures have often gone hand-in-hand. It’s no coincidence that sites in New York Harbor synonymous with migration such as Ellis Island and Liberty Island started life as quarantine stations. “International mobility is central to the globalization of infectious and chronic diseases,” according to a 2007 bulletin from the World Health Organization. “The history of health and foreign policy reflects long-term links to migration issues.” As people confined to their homes will be well aware, limits on human movement and interaction are crucial to holding back outbreaks of disease. Racism, however, exploits a flaw in human reasoning quite as effectively as infections exploit flaws in our immune defenses. The central fallacy is to assume that if international travel helps spread disease, a perceived “foreign” group is most likely to be carriers. Viruses, though — unlike people — don’t much discriminate by race.(2)The Covid-19 outbreak in Italy is a case in point. Several commentators have claimed without evidence that the source across the north of the country was the large number of Chinese migrants working in Italy’s fashion sector. In fact, tracing the contacts of the infected and finding “patient zero” is a well-established practice in epidemics, and there’s no sign of any significant origins among garment workers. All the research to date suggests the key source was instead a 38-year-old Unilever Plc employee named Mattia from the town of Codogno.Despite the lack of evidence that ethnic groups are responsible for disease, the canard has been frequently been used to justify racist measures. One notorious 19th-century cartoon from Australia’s Bulletin magazine presented China as a malignant octopus attacking the country, two of whose arms were labeled “smallpox” and “typhoid.”It was a similar story in the U.S. Only about 1% of the mostly European immigrants coming to Ellis Island around the turn of the 20th century were rejected for medical reasons. By contrast, some 17% of the more Asian migrant population at San Francisco’s Angel Island was disbarred for sickness, owing in large part to more intrusive screening and vague disease categories applied to non-Europeans. Anti-Chinese measures like San Francisco’s Cubic Air Ordinance were justified on public health grounds as measures to combat “insanitary” overcrowding. For much of the past century, the relative absence of pandemics has put the alliance between racism and disease into remission.

2020-03-25	2020-03-25 10:01:53	UL	Unilever PLC	Spain Sells $11 Billion of Debt, No Problem at All	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Nothing says funding is not a problem during this crisis than a 10 billion-euro ($11 billion) debt issue. Spain, in a state of emergency because of the coronavirus, achieved this on Tuesday with a seven-year bond sale that attracted more than 36 billion euros of orders.The country was one of 11 high-grade borrowers testing the waters in what was the busiest day of the month for bond sales and the fourth-busiest of the year. This week’s volumes have already surpassed the total of the first three weeks of March, when the outbreak really suppressed supply. Wednesday is set to be even bigger.Raising such a jumbo deal did mean Spain had to offer a yield that was 18 basis points higher than an existing, slightly shorter seven-year bond. Its last syndicated issue, earlier this year, came with a lower yield than its existing debt. However, the world has changed profoundly and issuers have to be prepared to dangle a carrot to entice investor demand. In the circumstances, this wasn’t much of a premium for investors.A similar phenomenon was also evident for the European Investment Bank, whose three-year bond deal came at an 11 basis-point premium to its existing equivalent. Likewise, premiums were in evidence Monday for new deals from the German States of Bavaria and Saxony-Anhalt. Though, again, they weren’t huge, which shows how desperate investors are to find somewhere to put their money.Corporate deals are making a comeback too: Unilever NV and Engie SA last week followed the trend for higher yields. Company issuance has seen the biggest decline in the bond market this year, unsurprisingly give the business shutdowns, running nearly 20% behind last year's pace. Coca Cola European Partners, Sanofi and Nestle SA all came to the market with multi-tranche issues on Tuesday, illustrating the improvement in conditions. Heineken NV, Danaher Corp. and Carrefour SA were doing benchmark euro deals on Wednesday.The European Central Bank can breathe a bit easier as its 1 trillion euros of quantitative easing planned for the rest of this year is starting to take effect. As there will be considerable emphasis on its corporate sector purchasing program, many of the new investment grade deals should benefit from being scooped up by the ECB, if they’re from Europe-based issuing entities.Wednesday has also seen the return of major banks with Lloyds Banking Group Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. all bringing euro deals. Credit spreads (the yield on corporate debt relative to sovereign benchmarks) have ballooned since late February, offering better returns for investors than government bonds if they have cash to put to work. Those spreads will start to narrow, but the virus has created a new paradigm, whereby a decent new-issue premium is essential to a successful deal. Normality is returning to European debt capital markets, but the heady days of super-tight credit spreads and incredibly low non-core government bond yields look to be over.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Marcus Ashworth is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering European markets.

2020-02-27	2020-02-27 10:00:25	UL	Unilever PLC	Reckitt Benckiser Cries Over $6.5 Billion of Spilled Milk	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When Laxman Narasimhan cut the full-year outlook for Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc in October, the company’s new chief executive officer threw in everything but the kitchen sink.On Thursday, he completed his demolition job of expectations at the maker of everything from Durex condoms to Dettol disinfectant, saying the operating margin would be much lower in the future and announcing a 5 billion-pound ($6.5 billion) writedown to the value of the Mead Johnson baby-formula business, which Reckitt bought just three years ago for $17 billion.Easing back on Reckitt’s margin expectations was essential, as it gives it the space to make some much-need investments to boost sales. Even in 2019, when its results were hurt by a poor flu season and the continued underperformance of Mead’s infant nutrition products, its operating margin was 26.2%, well ahead of Unilever’s 19.1% and Nestle’s 17.6%.Reckitt aims to invest about 2 billion pounds over the next three years to try to deliver mid-single digit organic revenue growth. It rose by just 0.8% in 2019. Part of this will be funded by 1.3 billion pounds of cost savings. But there will also be a hit to the margin of 3.5 percentage points this year, much bigger than the market had expected.Relaxing the margin also leaves room to change Reckitt’s hard-driving culture, which has historically obsessed about controlling costs and short-term earnings. Martin Deboo, an analyst at Jefferies, anticipates an operating margin of 22.7% in 2020. The company wants to return to a margin percentage in the mid-20s eventually.The new CEO has also signaled portfolio change. He has ditched a plan to split Reckitt into its hygiene and home business —  owner of brands such as the Cillit Bang cleaner and Vanish stain remover — and its health arm, which owns Nurofen painkillers and Scholl foot products. Reckitt will now remain as a single company, but with three divisions: hygiene; health and nutrition.This structure, together with the whopper writedown, suggests that the nutrition business — primarily Mead Johnson — might be for sale at the right price. That is wise, given the poor performance of baby milk since Reckitt acquired Mead. The foray into formula under former CEO Rakesh Kapoor looks like a colossal waste of money. Reckitt also missed out on buying Pfizer’s consumer health unit, a far better fit, because it was busy digesting Mead Johnson and needed to cut debt.Narasimham says Reckitt’s problems are operational. Still, fixing them won’t be straightforward, particularly with any coronavirus related disruption to consumption and supply chains. Given the economic context, the new growth and operating margin targets look a stretch.Also, an activist investor might be tempted to push for a breakup if his strategy doesn’t work, particularly if the shares, which fell about 5% on Thursday, decline further. The now abandoned plan to split the hygiene and home division from the health unit might have delivered value.If Narasimham doesn’t clean up at Reckitt, a hedge fund may try to do the job for him.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-02-24	2020-02-24 22:56:56	UL	Unilever PLC	Dan Loeb’s $48 Billion Target Has SomeTesty Investors	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Dan Loeb’s Third Point LLC says it has a history of working constructively with boards to promote the success of their companies. The activist’s latest goal seems to involve removing the board of Prudential Plc entirely, and dismantling the head office around it, as part of a breakup of the $48 billion insurer.That may not be as hard as it sounds.Once focused on Britain, Prudential has transformed into a large Asian insurer with a smaller U.S. business attached. Its shares suffer under a stark valuation discount to Hong Kong-listed peer AIA Group Ltd., and Loeb has set out a plausible explanation for why. The reason, he says, is that the Asian side needs capital to grow, but competes with shareholders for dividends. Likewise, the U.S. business would be better off conserving cash in support of its own capital strength. Meanwhile, most investors don’t want to invest in an Asian-U.S. hybrid insurer.The remedy sounds simple: Split Prudential into separate U.S. and Asian businesses with their own stock listings and dividend policies. The Asian shares would probably command a much higher valuation than whole the group does now,  providing an acquisition currency that would be a cheap source of growth capital. At the same time, scrapping the conglomerate structure would eliminate the need for a costly corporate center based in London.None of this is likely to be a huge surprise to Prudential’s directors. The board has already been simplifying the company, mainly by spinning off  the M&G Plc asset management business. That move has failed to address the valuation gap, so the next logical step would be to jettison the U.S. subsidiary and become a pure Asia play. Prudential’s chairman, Paul Manduca, is retiring next year anyway, and Chief Executive Officer Mike Wells has been in the role for five years. Manduca’s successor, banker and former government minister Shriti Vadera, has a chance to be radical.The real opponents to Loeb’s ideas are more likely to be found among Prudential’s long-term investors. Third Point is a new arrival taking on a longstanding problem. But Prudential has a large number of U.K. investors whose own narrow interests may be served by keeping it in its current form, paying high dividends via a London-listed share. Recall that consumer giant Unilever NV encountered huge resistance to an attempt to simplify its structure in 2018, while plumbing group Ferguson Plc is moving with extreme care about a possible re-domicile for the same reason.Loeb argues Prudential in two pieces would be worth twice what it is today. He may be right, but if a breakup involves a dividend cut along the way, it won’t be plain sailing.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

2020-02-13	2020-02-13 11:45:23	UL	Unilever PLC	Bingeing Alone Isn’t Enough for Nestle	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It isn’t just Unilever NV that’s struggling to sell more food. Rival Nestle SA now expects to come up short of its self-imposed sales-growth target this year, and it’s counting on acquisitions to put it back on track.While Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider met the lower end of  a goal for underlying operating margin 12 months early, it will take at least another year for the owner of the Nesquik and Nespresso brands to reach and sustain its annual sales growth objective of 4-6%, partly due to the effect of disposals.It’s a rare misstep for Nestle’s first external CEO for almost 100 years. Even with the 2% drop on Thursday, the shares are up more than 40% since his arrival in January 2017, outpacing Unilever. While Schneider’s made a good start selling off underperformers and making purchases in faster growing areas, such as coffee, pet food and meat substitutes, more reshaping is needed. He has traded — either acquired or moved  out of — businesses that accounted for about 12% of total sales in 2017. That’s ahead of his target for changing up 10% by the end of 2020. He’s not done yet. From here the focus will be more on acquisitions than disposals.While expanding in the right growth markets is key, Schneider should also go further in pruning the Swiss food giant. Possible culprits for offloading could be parts of the U.S. frozen foods business, especially pizzas, or some water assets, such as those mainstream brands that can’t be taken up market. The fact that Nestle wrote down the value of its Yinlu business in China could be a prelude to an exit from difficult divisions, for example making peanut milk. However, selling off these businesses may be trickier than previous disposals in confectionery, skincare and ice cream.There’s also a risk that Schneider, in an effort to turbocharge growth, becomes less disciplined when he buys. He indicated that he’s open to a wide array of options, the most promising being small or mid-sized purchases, particularly in the hot market for nutrition and metabolism. He lamented that last year was heavy on disposals, but light on purchases. That should change this year, but he shouldn’t be too eager and so strike rash deals.Schneider is comfortable in the pharmaceutical space, having led German healthcare company Fresenius SE before joining Nestle. Medical nutrition not only has higher growth prospects and margins than many food areas, but it is also less constrained by competition rules because Nestle doesn’t have such a big position. He most recently bolstered Nestle’s medical nutrition arm by acquiring gastrointestinal medication Zenpep and increased the investment in Aimmune Therapeutics Inc., which has developed a product to counter the effects of peanut allergies. It indicates that this area, particularly treatments related to the body’s metabolism, is likely to be a bigger focus.To fund any large-scale ambitions, Schneider has Nestle’s stake in L’Oreal SA, worth about 35 billion euros ($38 billion), to play with. The company has always said that it won’t part with this holding unless it has a strategic use for the proceeds, but but he seemed to be more open to an exit on Thursday. Small- to medium-sized deals wouldn’t require any change. A bigger transaction — which can’t be ruled out — might.Either way, Schneider can’t afford to take the wrong turn. Not only is activist Dan Loeb still on the register, but Nestle’s valuation has increased significantly under his tenure. The shares trade on about 22 times forward earnings, compared with about 20 times for Unilever.The premium is justified by Unilever’s recent sales stumble, as well as its slower pace of portfolio change and less focused approach to acquisitions. That doesn’t mean Nestle won’t be punished if it disappoints in the same way as its rival.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-02-10	2020-02-10 16:47:17	UL	Unilever PLC	Harry's Fixes Shaving, Breaks Exit Strategy	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Harry's Inc. billed itself as an alternative to overpriced razors, and the sales pitch worked — too well, in fact.The shaving company’s planned sale to Schick razor maker Edgewell Personal Care Co. officially collapsed on Monday after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the $1.37 billion deal on anti-competitive grounds.There had been some thought that Edgewell would fight for the Harry’s deal in court, but the company said Monday it’s instead walking away, “given the inherent uncertainty of a potential trial, the required investment of resources and time and the distraction that a continuing court battle would entail.” Shareholders are fine with that: The stock rose more than 20% on Monday after climbing 13% on Feb. 3, when the FTC’s opposition was announced. While investors may be happy to say goodbye to an acquisition that was arguably overpriced, regulators’ opposition to the takeover has wide-ranging ramifications. Among other things, this threatens to close the door on one of the more sure-fire exit strategies for would-be direct to consumer unicorns.In advertisements, Harry's pitched itself as &quot;the shaving company that's fixing shaving.&quot; In its complaint, the FTC argues that Harry’s successfully disrupted an effective duopoly between Edgewell and Gillette-maker Procter & Gamble Co. and forced the incumbents to start lowering their prices for razors. Curiously, it argues that this only happened once Harry’s products migrated out of the e-commerce-only environment in which they launched and started appearing on shelves at Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. stores. Using similar logic, the FTC dismisses Dollar Shave Club – acquired by Unilever NV in 2016 for $1 billion – as a full-blown competitor capable of making up for the loss of an independent Harry's in part because it still mainly sells razors via an online direct-to-consumer model.The idea that firm lines exist between the online and brick-and-mortar worlds — and that pricing dynamics in one don’t affect the other — feels rather silly in this day and age. Most consumers wouldn’t distinguish between the two marketplaces, and increasingly, neither would businesses. The FTC’s decision to block the Harry’s purchase is reminiscent of pushback to the merger of Staples and Office Depot in 2016, where the regulator ignored the stream of sales defecting to Amazon and declined to view it as a strong enough competitor in commercial office supplies. Amazon’s 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc., by contrast, was waved through without a second glance and closed in just two months.Notably, without Harry’s and without the sales from an infant and pet-care business Edgewell sold in December, the company now expects total revenue to decline as much as 5% this year. When Edgewell had announced the Harry’s purchase last year, it projected a $20 million increase to Ebitda by 2023 from annual cost savings and an additional $20 million boost from revenue benefits, including new brand launches and international expansion opportunities. Antitrust regulation isn’t a forward-looking industry and I don’t think anyone would want to task the FTC or the Department of Justice with picking out the winners and losers of the future. But the result is a system that seems ill-suited to navigating the changes to the economy from e-commerce and direct-to-consumer business models. And while regulators may not want to predict the future, their actions will have a significant impact on what unfolds from here.One of the odd messages being sent by this decision is that it may be better for upstart consumer brands to avoid brick-and-mortar stores if they want to sell themselves to a more-established organization down the road. That’s not going to be helpful for Target, Walmart or the bevy of aging department stores trying to compete with Amazon and make themselves relevant to today’s consumer. Another alternative is for startups to sell out before they get big enough to matter, which raises the odds that smaller brands get swallowed up and killed off rather than nourished into viable competitors. The IPO route looks increasingly closed, at least at the valuations many had enjoyed in the private markets. Some brands will still succeed as independent entities – Glossier, Allbirds and Warby Parker come to mind – but the road to making it big arguably just got tougher.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-02-03	2020-02-03 11:48:46	UL	Unilever PLC	Big Tobacco’s Future Is Now	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Cars and cigarettes have at least one thing in common these days: They are both being disrupted by more modern alternatives. So Stefan Bomhard, the chief executive officer of car dealer Inchcape Plc, should have some idea of what he’ll face when he takes the reins at U.K. cigarette maker Imperial Brands Plc.It isn’t easy to find executives willing to move to the much-aligned tobacco industry. But Bomhard looks a good  CEO choice for Imperial, which sells Lambert & Butler cigarettes and Blu vapes. The company had decided to part ways with Alison Cooper in October, a week after a profit warning. She will now step down as with immediate effect.Bomhard did a solid job at Inchcape. While the shares are down about 18% since he became CEO in April 2015, underperforming the FTSE All-Share Index, conditions in car dealing haven’t been easy since Britain voted to leave the European Union and consumer confidence crumbled. It’s still a much better performance than the FTSE All-Share General Retailers Index.The downside is that Bomhard doesn’t have any tobacco experience. But this is less of an issue than it would be in, say, general retailing. Imperial will have plenty of executives with many years’ worth of knowledge of the traditional cigarette business, still the biggest and most profitable part of the group. And he should be able to pull on his prior experience with big global brands in the race to grab market share for Imperial’s new products, whatever they may be.The new chief executive spent his career in consumer goods before joining Inchcape, with roles at spirits company Bicardi, chocolate and candy maker Cadbury, and consumer-goods giant Unilever. That should put him in good stead as Imperial attempts to pivot to alternatives to traditional cigarettes, which could in turn, pave the way for it to diversify into dispensing other adult, highly regulated products, such as cannabis.When Bomhard takes up the role at a yet to be determined date, his first task will be to get to grips with the crisis in the U.S. vaping industry. The company is evaluating the impact of the recent Food and Drug Administration ban on flavors aside from menthol and tobacco for pod-based electronic cigarettes, the type it makes.Then Bomhard will have to work quickly to decide where best to focus Imperial’s attention, and investment. Although the group has strong positions in vaping and oral nicotine, it only entered the heat-not-burn market relatively recently. He must decide whether to expand in this category, which has not been drawn into the crisis in the U.S. vaping industry.He could also look at reshaping other aspects of Imperial’s business, including traditional cigarettes. The company is already seeking to raise up to 2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) through disposals, including a sale of its premium cigar business. But he could go further, say selling off parts of the portfolio in Asia and Africa, and returning the proceeds to shareholders, or investing more in tobacco alternatives.Either way, Bomhard must take decisive action. Shares in Imperial have fallen more than 20% over the past year, and they trade at a 40% discount to Bloomberg Intelligence’s global tobacco manufacturing valuation peer group. The company even lags Altria Group Inc., which is reeling from its disastrous investment in vaping company Juul Labs Inc.Imperial has long been seen as an acquisition target, with Japan Tobacco Inc. tipped as the most obvious contender. Another possibility would be for Japan Tobacco and British American Tobacco Plc to carve up Imperial’s empire between them along geographical lines. So if Bomhard doesn’t light up the Imperial share price, a bigger rival just might.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-01-30	2020-01-30 10:54:41	UL	Unilever PLC	Tea Time Rings at Unilever	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Alan Jope’s efforts to instill purpose into the British heritage tea brand, PG Tips, have been all about bringing people together over a nice cup of tea. Now Unilever NV’s chief executive officer wants to cleave the tired tea business apart from the rest of the consumer giant.He’s conducting a strategic review of the division, which also includes the Lipton and Pure Leaf lines, that could lead to a sale or partnership, and possibly even herald a broader exit from the group’s sluggish food business. Facing the slowest quarterly growth in a decade, even before any impact from the deadly coronavirus, Jope must improve performance at the company whose businesses range from Dove soap to Ben & Jerry’s ice cream.Tackling tea, where demand has shifted away from the traditional black beverage to flavorful herbal options, is a good start. The unit, including its operations in emerging markets, generates annual sales of about 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion). Martin Deboo, an analyst at Jefferies, estimates it could be worth about 6 billion euros, assuming a multiple of two times sales.Jope, a long-time Unilever veteran, should have scrutinized Unilever’s portfolio earlier in his tenure that began just over a year ago. But now that he’s finally grasped the nettle, he should go further. His predecessor Paul Polman sold the margarine and spreads arm in the wake of the $143 billion approach from Kraft Heinz Co. three years ago. But since then meaningful disposals in the division have stalledThe food and refreshments unit as a whole generates about 20 billion euros a year of sales, and could have an enterprise value of about 60 billion euros, according to Deboo. Selling it off would leave Unilever concentrated on the household and personal care businesses, which Jope previously oversaw, potentially lifting the company’s growth rate, and its valuation.But such a chunky disposal would require a buyer with a big appetite. Kraft Heinz, already highly leveraged, would struggle. Private equity firms may be interested, but it would still be a large transaction, likely requiring more than one player to join forces.So a more piecemeal approach looks sensible. Other disposal candidates beyond tea are dressings, with annual sales of of about 3 billion euros; savory sauces, stocks and food, including Pot Noodle, with revenue of 6 billion euros; and ice cream, which generates about 7 billion euros of sales. While still sizable deals, they are not impossible for a buy-out group to digest. As my colleague Chris Hughes and I have argued, food businesses may be expanding more slowly, but their stable cash flows can support borrowings, and there is scope to lift margins.Unilever shares, which rose as much as 2% in London on Thursday, are still above their level at the time of Kraft Heinz’s bid in February 2017. But they are at a significant discount to rival Nestle SA. Its CEO, Mark Schneider, is already doing many of the things that Jope should, selling off underperformers for good prices and recycling the proceeds into focused acquisitions.As I have long argued, Kraft Heinz isn’t in a position to come back. But an activist investor might be tempted to weigh in. At current valuations, the prospect of a breakup may be more appealing to a hedge fund than even a double cherry Magnum. So it would be good for Jope to share a brew with some willing private equity buyers. Otherwise he might find it’s an aggressive investor he’s bringing closer. That would make for a far less cosy cuppa.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-01-30	2020-01-30 09:59:24	UL	Unilever PLC	Unilever Reviews Future of Lipton Tea	(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.As the flat white trounces black tea, Lipton owner Unilever is weighing a sale of one of its best-known brands.The Anglo-Dutch giant initiated a review of its global tea business, which includes the more than century-old label and generates sales of almost 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion). The move comes after the company’s slowest quarterly growth in a decade.Unilever is following a consumer shift to coffee as a primary source of caffeine, with takeaway cafes proliferating from London to Beijing and capsule-spewing espresso machines supplanting kettles on kitchen counters around the world.In the U.K., almost 900 million fewer cups of tea were drunk over the 12 months through May 2018, according to trade publication The Grocer. Even those who eschew coffee are giving a pass to the traditional cup of English Breakfast or Earl Grey, opting for herbal alternatives.Demand for black tea has been “slowing in developed markets for several years due to changing consumer preferences,” Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said on a call. The strategic review “could include a whole range of options -- no ownership, partial ownership.”Spreads SaleThe review accelerates Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope’s restructuring of the owner of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, which has been hurt by sluggish demand for big brands. Under predecessor Paul Polman, Unilever sold its margarine and spreads business to KKR & Co. for about $8 billion. The company tried to profit from growth in herbal tea by acquiring the Pukka brand in 2017.The shares rose as much as 1.6% early Thursday in Amsterdam. The tea review is expected to conclude by midyear.The company posted 1.5% growth in underlying sales in the fourth quarter, just above a consensus analyst estimate but still the slowest in a decade. For the full year, sales declined 0.5% in the developed world as shoppers switched to supermarkets’ own-label products and higher-priced niche products.Rival Nestle SA, which has a portfolio of coffee brands including Nescafe and Nespresso, has also launched a sweeping overhaul of its overall lineup, including recent deals to divest portions of its luncheon-meat and ice cream businesses. In 2017, Starbucks Corp. announced that it would close all of its 379 mall-based Teavana stores due to persistent underperformance.Unilever’s strategic review of tea suggests there might be “wider action on the portfolio,” Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said in a note.Jope has been quicker than his predecessor to rethink Unilever’s business. In 2014, Polman separated the spreads business into a standalone unit, but it wasn’t sold until three years later, after Unilever rejected an unsolicited takeover approach for the whole company from Kraft Heinz Co.Personal CareUnilever’s personal-care business, the company’s largest, is struggling too. In the latest period it was hurt by weak pricing of shampoo and other hair products in the U.S.The souring performance comes a month after Jope warned investors that sales gains would be below earlier guidance in 2019 and in the lower half of its expected range this year.The results cap a tough first year at the helm for Jope. The company will act faster on backing new products when they’re successful or divesting them when they’re not, he said on a conference call with analysts. Managers can tell after about 100 days whether a new product is worth more investment or should be discontinued.Tea has been around much longer, but now looks like it could be one of the first targets for Jope’s cull.“It has been significantly dilutive to growth for the past ten years,” the CEO said on a call.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Buckley in London at tbuckley25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Eric Pfanner at epfanner1@bloomberg.net, Marthe FourcadeFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unilever-reviews-future-lipton-tea-073612511.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-23	2019-12-23 15:00:50	UL	Unilever PLC	Online Retail Is Beginning to Look a Lot Like Real-World Retail	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Amid the grim march of the retail apocalypse, the industry has derived some hope in recent years from the rise of scores of digital-centric startups. There is cause for optimism, but there’s also reason to be skeptical of the hype surrounding these brands — not just because their business models aren’t proving durable, but also because many of them are now intertwined with the companies they are ostensibly disrupting.Consider, for example, the November announcement from supermarket behemoth Albertsons Cos. about the future of meal-kit maker Plated, which the grocer paid $200 million for only two years ago. The company said it was ending the subscription model for Plated and that its products would now simply be part of its private-label business. It’s hard to see that as anything other than a concession that the format is a dud.And that’s not the only meal-kit business that’s gone cold: Blue Apron Holdings Inc. had only 386,000 paid customers in its latest quarter, down from 646,000 in the same quarter a year earlier and 856,000 the year before that. The decline partly reflects a deliberate shift to focus on its best customers, but it’s also an indication that the long-term market for online meal-kits is just not that big.Dollar Shave Club’s low-priced, subscription-based model for grooming gear was similarly seen as a disruptive game-changer when it captured attention with a viral YouTube video in 2012. Unilever NV acquired it for $1 billion in 2016, a testament to its growing market share. But the Wall Street Journal recently reported that the digital brand is still not profitable and the consumer-products giant “has concluded that selling staples as online subscriptions doesn’t make financial sense.”Still other 2010s wunderkinds are pursuing growth in ways that don’t look so different than the playbooks embraced by their predecessors. Quip toothbrushes, Native deodorant, Bark pet toys, and Harry’s razors can all now be found in the aisles of Target stores. Men’s clothing from Bonobos and Mizzen + Main is sold at Nordstrom Inc., while beauty brand Glossier recently launched pop-ups at the department store. Everlane has brick-and-mortar stores, as does bedding brand Parachute.The result is that the term “digital-native brand” is all but meaningless. How could a startup not be digital-native in the year 2019? How are their hybrid online-and-store selling models any different from what mature brands are doing? This is not to write off this crop of retailers entirely. They have collectively snatched billions of dollars of market share from incumbents and have made some genuinely alluring products, such as the Allbirds sneakers that have spawned copycats. Mall landlords have been forced to rethink their leasing models and floor plans to accommodate their needs. But, so far, these startups are no more than spoilers for legacy brands. They’re not replacing them.The constellation of insurgents collectively is poised to open 850 physical stores over five years, according to a 2018 analysis by JLL. In other words, the entire group will add roughly as many stores as are in the Macy’s Inc. portfolio. That means their growth doesn’t come anywhere close to offsetting the massive shakeout of established chains. In 2019 alone, Coresight Research estimates, there have been 9,302 store closures.Also, if these digital brands were finding easy paths to profitability and customer growth, many more of them would probably be going public or agreeing to be acquired for dizzying sums. But IPO hopefuls such as Casper remain on the public market sidelines, and the aforementioned Dollar Shave acquisition and Edgewell Personal Care Co.’s $1.4 billion deal for Harry’s are exceptions, not the rule.Meanwhile, Bonobos founder Andy Dunn is set to exit a companywide role at Walmart Inc. a little more than two years after the big-box chain acquired his clothing brand, a change that may turn out to be a cautionary tale about the ability of these scrappy virtuosos to apply their skills within retail’s old guard.All of this leads to a bracing conclusion: The transformative power of the digitally oriented swashbucklers has been overestimated. Would-be investors and entrepreneurs, consider yourselves warned.To contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Newman at mnewman43@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-12-17	2019-12-17 12:53:16	UL	Unilever PLC	Unilever Slumps as New CEO Faces Slowest Growth in a Decade	(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.Unilever slumped after Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope backed away from his predecessor’s growth targets as consumers around the world jilt mainstream brands.The maker of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and Dove soap said sales gains will be slightly below guidance for 2019 and in the lower half of its expected range in 2020.The stock fell as much as 6.6% in Amsterdam on Tuesday, the steepest intraday decline in almost three years. Analysts at RBC Europe said the new outlook implies fourth-quarter growth will be the Anglo-Dutch company’s weakest for more than a decade.The forecast cut undermines Jope’s aim of showing that companies that emphasize social purposes can outperform rivals that don’t. Unilever has targeted annual growth of 3% to 5% since his predecessor, Paul Polman, fended off a takeover bid from Kraft Heinz Co. in 2017.Jope, who took over earlier this year, maintained Polman’s goals. Reaching them has gotten tougher as Unilever struggles to keep up with shoppers shifting from mass-market brands to niche products and retailers’ private labels. Some of its rivals are pulling ahead.While Unilever has bought the likes of Tatcha creams and Graze snacks while selling its margarine business, Nestle SA has moved aggressively to shed slower-growing operations under CEO Mark Schneider. Procter & Gamble Co. in October raised its full-year sales forecast.Unilever needs “to make sharper decisions around its portfolio,” Martin Deboo, an analyst at Jefferies, wrote in a note to investors, calling it a “problem that we expect to be slow to fix, just when the absence of any emerging-markets rally denies Unilever its customary lifeboat.”In its latest update, the company cited weakness in South Asia, West Africa and North America, after a third quarter in which growth missed estimates because of disappointing sales of ice cream in Europe and black tea across the developing world. The slowdown follows a changing of the guard at Unilever. After Jope succeeded Polman, Chairman Marijn Dekkers announced last month that he was stepping down to make way for Danish businessman Nils Andersen.Outlook ChangeThe company had previously said that 2019 sales would be in the lower half of the muliyear range. Unilever said the change to the outlook won’t affect profitability.“Growth remains our top priority and we are confident we have the right strategy and investment in place to step up our performance,” Jope said in a statement.India and West Africa contributed the most to the slowdown, Unilever executives said on a call. The Indian market, the company’s second-biggest after the U.S., should start to recover in the second half of 2020, it said.Slowing consumption in India, home to more than 1.3 billion people, is weighing down makers of everything from shampoos to cars as the third-largest Asian economy expands at the slowest pace in six years.Unilever owns a 67% stake in the listed subsidiary Hindustan Unilever Ltd., India’s largest consumer-products company. The unit cited the market slowdown and supply chain disruptions in an Oct. 14 earnings call, with Chief Financial Officer Srinivas Phatak telling analysts that the “near-term demand outlook continues to be challenging.”India Slowdown“We are very strongly developed in South Asia, so when India takes a slowdown, we definitely feel it more than some of our competitors,” Jope said on the conference call with reporters on Tuesday. “We are far from crisis conditions. It’s just a little more turbulent than we’ve previously seen.”Unilever is accelerating the pace of cost cuts so it can reinvest more in its brands, with next year focused on new product releases, Jope said.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Robust economic growth in every region will be needed if Unilever is to have any hope of reaching even the low-end of its multiyear 3-5% organic-sales-growth target.”&#92;-- Duncan Fox, BI consumer-goods analystAsia’s Economic Slowdown Hampers Unilever’s Organic Sales: ReactWhile ice cream had a difficult third quarter in the U.S., it has been performing better and isn’t a reason for the outlook change, according to the company.Unilever said it’s on track for its 2020 profitability goals and expects to regain lost market share in North America.&#92;--With assistance from Bhuma Shrivastava.To contact the reporters on this story: Thomas Mulier in Geneva at tmulier@bloomberg.net;Thomas Buckley in London at tbuckley25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Eric Pfanner at epfanner1@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unilever-sales-growth-miss-forecast-080503774.html?.tsrc=rss

It doesn’t seem to be doing much for its sales.The Anglo-Dutch company surprised the stock market on Tuesday, warning that revenue growth this year would be below its 3% to 5% range.

Unilever forecasts sales increases will be in the lower half of its target range in 2020, with most progress coming in the second half.The company said it was suffering from an economic slowdown in south Asia, particularly India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, and difficult trading conditions in west Africa. Meanwhile, its big-selling north American products such as ice cream and hair care are still recovering from a sluggish period, while competition is fierce in parts of Europe.Yet Unilever must take some of the blame for its own predicament. Its rival Nestle SA has managed steady sales growth, while pulling off some canny acquisitions and disposals.After a failed takeover approach from Kraft Heinz Co. back in 2017, Unilever set the goal of lifting its operating margin from 16% to 20% by 2020. Alan Jope, the chief executive officer, could have ditched this target when he took the reins at the start of this year to give himself more firepower to invest. But it seems he’s sticking with it: The company said on Tuesday that the goal wouldn’t be affected by the sales slowdown. While Unilever insists it’s spending enough on research and development and marketing, Jope may have to back his biggest brands with more funds to make sure they’re competitive. That would have to come at the expense of margins. He also needs to decide in which categories Unilever wants to compete, and reshape its sprawling portfolio accordingly. It’s admirable that the company generates close to 60% of its sales in emerging markets, and operates in popular areas such as beauty and personal care. Unfortunately, it is also over-exposed to more sluggish food ranges such as tea and dressings.Jope could do worse than learn from Nestle’s CEO Mark Schneider. The latter has been quick to prune unwanted categories, recently selling its U.S. ice cream business to a joint venture between itself and private equity. Nestle has also been buying in its preferred product areas, such as coffee.Unilever, meanwhile, has been less bold, undertaking a plethora of small acquisitions — from fake meat to fancy laundry products. The group generated only about 0.5 percentage points of growth from its acquisitions and disposals in the first half of the financial year; Jope says he’ll slow the pace of bolt-on deals and step up disposals.If he doesn’t hurry, someone else might attempt to do some portfolio tidying for him. Kraft Heinz isn’t in a position to make another approach. But an activist investor may be tempted. Selling Unilever’s foods and refreshments business for cash is a possibility, although a demerger might be complicated by Unilever’s dual British and Dutch structure.The food unit could have an enterprise value of 55 billion euros ($61 billion), according to UBS analysts.

2019-12-12	2019-12-12 11:56:00	UL	Unilever PLC	Hot Scoop! Ben & Jerry's Needs to Watch Out	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Nestle SA Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider just proved his ability to be both strategic and creative as he methodically shapes the Swiss food giant, scooping and scraping up where he can.The company, which spans water, pet food and coffee, on Wednesday agreed to sell its U.S. ice cream business for $4 billion to Froneri, the joint venture it created three years ago with private equity group PAI Partners. The price equates to 2.2 times Nestle’s U.S. ice cream sales in 2018, similar to the multiple European rival Unilever NV achieved when it sold its spreads business to KKR & Co. almost exactly two years ago. That looks reasonable for Nestle’s unit, which includes the Haagen-Dazs brand in the U.S.With the sale, Schneider, a German-American educated at Harvard Business School, is very close to his target of changing up 10% of Nestle’s portfolio, helping to keep activist investor Dan Loeb happy. An outright sale would have been cleaner. But given that Froneri already holds Nestle’s European ice-cream assets, it was probably the easiest option.Nestle and PAI will each inject some funds into the joint venture to facilitate the deal. Even so Nestle should still receive between $3 billion and $4 billion in cash from the proceeds.Most importantly, there is scope for a fuller exit in time. PAI could acquire Nestle’s stake in the joint venture, or, more likely, the two could pursue an initial share sale for Froneri. Increasing sales growth, elevating profitability by developing Haagen-Dazs and cutting costs could potentially generate further value for Nestle in a few years’ time.That Nestle has been able to find a creative way to offload ice cream is encouraging. Schneider had already tackled many of the obvious disposal candidates within the group, including the U.S. confectionery and skincare divisions.Stay tuned for more. He may be equally imaginative with other parts of the group, such as its joint ventures in cereals with General Mills Inc., the U.S. maker of Cheerios, and in chilled dairy with Lactalis International, the French milk and cheese company.For example, Nestle has a few more ice cream divisions in Canada, Latin America and Asia that could be folded into Froneri in due course. But it’s likely Nestle didn’t want to rush it to avoid a bout of indigestion. There are other disposal candidates elsewhere in the group. It is already selling its Herta cooked meats business, while Bloomberg News has reported that it’s weighing the $1 billion sale of two Chinese brands.At least some parts of  the U.S. frozen-food division, such as pizzas, could be put on the block, although Nestle has so far stressed its commitment to staying in the business of frozen food. It doesn’t want to miss out on the latest trends with people cooking less and cutting down on meat, which has created a boom in vegetarian and vegan dishes. And although Nestle has restructured its waters business, indicating it wants to keep this division rather than offload it, it could always decide to carve out for sale the part that delivers bottles and dispensers directly to homes and offices.And of course there is Nestle’s stake in L’Oreal SA, although so far the group has remained committed to this. Nestle doesn’t need the money. Even with returning $20 billion to shareholders, year-end net debt is estimated just 1.4 times Ebitda. Deleveraging isn’t part of the strategy, indicating further capital returns. A wild card would be a big deal, for example in medical nutrition.In the meantime, it’s a question of delivering on Schneider’s strategy of steering a steady course between revenue-driven start-ups that make little profit and companies that prioritize margin expansion at the expense of investing in growth. So far, this has paid off for Nestle shareholders, with the stock up 27% this year. But the turn of events may be slightly worrying for Magnum owner Unilever, which now faces a more muscular competitor in ice cream.While Schneider has exhibited laser-like focus in M&A, Unilever’s relatively new CEO Alan Jope and incoming chairman, Nils Andersen, face the challenge of integrating the plethora of small acquisitions the Anglo-Dutch owner of Ben & Jerry’s has made over the past few years, all while trying to elevate sales growth.That was already a tall order. Now they’ll need to add avoiding a malfunction in the frozen aisle to their to-do list.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-11-17	2019-11-17 06:00:27	UL	Unilever PLC	Fires and Floods Make Saudi Aramco IPO a Hard Sell	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It is a bad time to buy into an oil company whose major asset is reserves in the ground that can sustain current production levels of the carbon-laden fossil fuel until near the end of the century. Oil lost its place in the power generation market after the oil shocks of the 1970s, and it is now starting to see serious competition for powering cars, buses and trucks along with the first signs of viable alternatives for fueling maritime transport. Oil’s domination in air transport looks safer for now, and the industry forecasts the strongest growth in petrochemicals that go into everything from plastics and fertilizers to electronic gadgets and clothing. But the tide of history is moving firmly against fossil fuels.Saudi Aramco may boast that it holds the rights to the largest reserves of crude with the lowest carbon footprint to extract, but that rather misses the point. The climate concerns around oil are not about the carbon cost of getting it out of the ground, but of what is done with it afterward.The oil age may not be over — far from it — but oil is facing unprecedented headwinds. Here’s a sample from recent weeks and months:Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said last week that climate change is menacing the historic maritime city, which suffered its second-highest tide on record. Parts of northern England are suffering their worst flooding in decades, and millions were displaced as Cyclone Bulbul hit Bangladesh and northern India.Storms and floods are not new, but they are becoming more severe, more frequent and causing more damage as sea levels rise and the climate changes — developments that are linked, at least in part, to the burning of fossil fuels.Unprecedented bushfires are ravaging parts of eastern Australia rendered tinderbox dry by a two-year drought. Wildfires forced hundreds of thousands of Californians to flee their homes earlier this month. Russia is suffering one of its worst years this century for forest fires. Once again, climate change is contributing to the creation of the hot, dry conditions that have allowed the fires to spread.Climate change is also melting Russia’s permafrost. Not a problem for Saudi Aramco, perhaps, but certainly one for Russia’s oil industry, which relies on infrastructure built in the 1970s on ground that is no longer able to support the weight it was 40 years ago.Mounting climate concerns are inexorably turning public opinion against hydrocarbons, including oil.What’s more, pollution caused by leaking pipelines, accidents involving oil tankers, or drilling rigs are all increasing the pressure on the oil and gas industry.  Particulate emissions from burning fossil fuels are behind elevated mortality rates, leading to stricter controls on ship fuels, measures to push cars and vans out of city centers and increasing pressure on airlines to find alternatives.Aramco has a solution to the predicament the industry is in — petrochemicals. The company wants to turn 40% of its crude into chemicals, according to Abdulaziz Al-Judaimi, Saudi Aramco’s senior vice president for downstream. But petrochemicals are under pressure, too.Globally more than 200 businesses, from Coca-Cola Co. to food and consumer goods giant Unilever NV  have made commitments to reduce plastic waste, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Unilever aims to halve its use of virgin plastic by 2025. Coca-Cola’s goal is for its bottles to contain an average of 50% recycled content by 2030. Initiatives like those will make a serious dent in the projected demand for new plastics.And then there’s an issue that is specific to Saudi Aramco — the security of its facilities. The company did a spectacular job of restoring output levels after a devastating attack on its oil facilities in September, using spare capacity elsewhere to boost flows. But the very fact of the attacks has raised concerns among potential investors about Saudi Arabia’s ability to protect its oil infrastructure.The time to bring private investors into Saudi Aramco was when everybody wanted a piece of the action. Twenty years ago investors would have fallen over each other beating a path to Saudi Aramco’s door. It’s a much tougher sell now.To contact the author of this story: Julian Lee at jlee1627@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Julian Lee is an oil strategist for Bloomberg.

Nils Andersen, a non-executive director since 2015, will replace him.In one sense it’s a natural time for a change. Dekkers has overseen the CEO succession, with Alan Jope starting last January. Unless something goes horribly wrong, that should be off the agenda for some time. Yet it jars that the chairman is leaving the post immediately after filling it for just three years.Unilever says he wants to concentrate on his responsibilities as founder and chairman of Novalis LifeSciences, an investment and advisory firm for the drugmaking industry. Novalis recently raised $85 million and plans to invest in at least eight companies. The suggestion was that this didn’t leave much time for leading the board of Unilever, whose market value is 147 billion euros ($162 billion).Dekkers, a former CEO of Bayer AG, will stay as a non-executive director. It’s strange nonetheless that Unilever didn’t wait until its annual shareholder meeting in April before standing him down. It’s hard not to link the wholesale change at the top of the Anglo-Dutch company to its botched attempt to simplify into a single Netherlands-based organization.After this unification effort was abandoned last year, the future of Unilever’s dual-headed corporate structure is unresolved. Andersen will need to address this, especially if the company wants to spin off its food business or use its shares to make a big acquisition in the U.S. Having two classes of shares makes this more difficult.That the new chairman is neither British nor Dutch (he’s Danish) is helpful given that the future domicile will probably be on the agenda again. However, hiring an outsider would have been better still for tackling such a profound question; Jope is a Unilever lifer.The new CEO may now find himself confronted by a stronger chairman given that Dekkers was damaged by the unification debacle. Andersen has relevant experience too: He was chief executive of the brewer Carlsberg A/S between 2001 and 2007.Jope has a difficult enough task in accelerating sales growth, which has been stubbornly sluggish despite Unilever’s strong portfolio of brands and enviable emerging market exposure. Making a success of the company’s many acquisitions, from fake meat to premium laundry, is another priority. Integrating these businesses, often created by entrepreneurial founders, into the Unilever culture isn’t easy.Longer term, Jope and Andersen must decide whether to stick with the food business after Unilver sold its spreads arm in 2017, or whether to go all in on the faster growing beauty and personal care brands. If they do decide on radical change, it will need to be better executed than the plan to ditch the British headquartersTo contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

The nation is looking to stabilize its economy after securing a $6 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.Deliberations are ongoing and Shan Foods can still decide to sell a non-majority stake or keep the business, the people said. Representatives for Shan Foods and Unilever declined to comment.Shan Foods, founded in 1981, is known for its small boxes with spices and recipe mixes that are used in South Asian cooking, according to its website. Its products are available in 65 countries, the website shows.Among measures to revive the economy, Pakistan discourages consumer good imports that makes it a boon for local manufacturers including Unilever’s operations there.

2019-10-18	2019-10-18 06:49:14	UL	Unilever PLC	China’s Economy Slows on Weak Investment, Testing Global Growth	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. China continued its grind to more moderate growth in the third quarter as investment slowed, providing little upside for a global economy flirting with its first recession since 2009.Gross domestic product rose 6% in the July-September period from a year ago, the slowest pace since the early 1990s and weaker than the consensus forecast of 6.1%. On the upside, factory output improved and retail sales held up, but slowing investment growth remained a concern.Policy makers appear to be allowing the world’s second-largest economy to drift lower as they seek to clean up the financial system and curb excessive credit growth while they fight a confidence-sapping trade war with U.S. President Donald Trump. With a drop off in exports to the U.S. expected to continue as long as tariffs remain, the economy is likely to keep struggling as falling factory prices hit company profits and rising consumer inflation hits spending power.Even with the slowdown, year-to-date growth of 6.2% suggests the government can hit its target of an expansion of 6% to 6.5% for 2019. Until now, officials have focused on limited, targeted measures such as reserve-ratio cuts and credit support, wary of expanding the nation’s already heavy debt load. A meeting of the Communist Party’s top leadership due in the coming days may present an opportunity to review stimulus settings.“China’s economy is grappling with both external and internal headwinds,” said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong. “Exports started to contract of late amid wobbly global demand and rising tariffs in the U.S. Despite some stabilization in retail sales and industrial production in September, overall demand continues to soften, reflecting still relatively tight credit conditions.”Stocks pared earlier gains after the data, with the Hang Seng slipping 0.5% and the Shanghai Composite falling 1.3%. The offshore yuan was weaker at 7.0850 per dollar at 2:43 p.m. in Hong Kong.Further Details from the Report:Factory output rose 5.8% in September, retail sales expanded 7.8%, while investment gained 5.4% in the first nine monthsInfrastructure investment growth picked up to 4.5% in the nine months to SeptemberThe contribution of net exports to GDP growth picked up to 19.6% in the 9 months through September. That’s not necessarily an indication of economic strength though, as it was likely led by a pullback in importsConsumption’s contribution increased to 60.5% from 55.3%; Investment’s contribution slowed to 19.8% from 25.9%The surveyed jobless rate remained at 5.2%Nominal growth, which is un-adjusted for inflation, slowed to 7.6% from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations. That’s the slowest since the third quarter of 2016.The nominal growth rate “tends to capture the cycles in the economy better,” according to a research note from Trivium China. It also gives a better idea of whether growth is fast enough to repay the nation’s growing debt, as lending is denominated in nominal values and isn’t adjusted for inflation.The slowing nominal rate indicates that the deflator, a reading of inflation across the economy, dipped to 1.6%.As China slows, it is buying less from the rest of the world, pushing its trade surplus higher and dragging on global economic growth. That’s having a knock-on effect on trade partners, from developed economies like Germany to commodity suppliers.Global policy makers including People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang are meeting in Washington this week for the International Monetary Fund’s annual meetings. The IMF set the tone for the gathering, making its fifth-straight cut to its forecast for 2019 global growth, which is on pace for the slowest expansion in a decade.The long-term slowdown underlines the challenge for companies doing business in China now, where high sales growth had once been a given.French distiller Pernod Ricard SA said growth in China slowed to 6% in the latest three months, less than one-quarter of the year-earlier rate. Nestle SA said sales in the country were flat for the first nine months, while Unilever said business there “slowed a little” in the latest period.What Bloomberg’s Economists Say..“China’s 3Q GDP growth, while avoiding falling below 6% for now, was in line with our view that the consensus forecast appeared optimistic. September industrial production growth was unexpectedly strong, but a further deceleration in investment growth underscores the challenges of using infrastructure spending to support growth.”Chang Shu and David Qu, Bloomberg EconomicsFor the full note click hereInvestors are looking for further confirmation of a detente between the U.S. and China on trade, as signs emerge that an agreement struck between negotiators in Washington this month and due to be signed by President Xi Jinping and Trump in November isn’t water-tight.China’s Ministry of Commerce Thursday signaled that Beijing is still pushing for the removal of all tariffs imposed by the U.S. since the trade war began -- a concession that’s not currently on the table.“The economy would almost surely slow further with the current policy stance,” said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Due to the lack of demand now, the government has to create more demand by itself through infrastructure spending. Even a trade deal is not an substitute for an escalation of stimulus.”&#92;--With assistance from Kevin Hamlin, Rachel Chang and Carolynn Look.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: James Mayger in Beijing at jmayger@bloomberg.net;Tomoko Sato in Tokyo at tsato3@bloomberg.net;Miao Han in Beijing at mhan22@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeffrey Black at jblack25@bloomberg.net, James MaygerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-economic-growth-unexpectedly-slows-021321431.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-17	2019-10-17 11:19:32	UL	Unilever PLC	Fake Meat, Coffee or Sparkling Water? Nestle’s Next Moves Matter	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Nestle SA Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider is in a good spot. He’s on the verge of capping what he set out to do when he became the Swiss food behemoth’s first outside leader for almost 100 years.Nestle is on track to meet its target for operating margin a year early. Its organic sales growth goal for next year looks attainable. And on Thursday the company unveiled plans to return another $20 billion to shareholders by 2022. That is unless it can find better ways to spend some of the money on acquisitions.The latest buyback comes just as the last $20 billion capital return — announced in June 2017 — is being completed.The German-American CEO took over in January 2017 with the aim of making changes. He received a blessing in disguise that June, when activist investor Dan Loeb’s Third Point bought a stake and started agitating for change, giving Schneider the license to move quickly.Under pressure from Loeb, he has changed up of 9% of Nestle’s the portfolio so far, in line with his plan to trade 10% of it by the end of 2020. He has sold off the U.S. confectionery business, the Gerber life assurance unit and most recently the dermatology arm, all for better-than-expected prices.And he has made canny acquisitions, including spending $7 billion for the rights to market Starbucks Corp. products outside of its cafes, which is helping drive growth in Nestle’s coffee unit. Adding Sweet Earth, which makes meat substitutes, also looks smart given the boom in plant-based protein products.Combined, the moves mean Nestle is on track to meet the low end of the target for full-year underlying operating margin of between 17.5% and 18.5% in 2020, a year early. Organic growth in the mid-single digits by 2020 looks possible, too. Nestle forecasts about 3.5% expansion in 2019.But from here, life gets tougher. Obvious disposals have been made, although Schneider could go further in pruning parts of the U.S. frozen food business, which includes Hot Pockets and DiGiorno pizzas, and its joint ventures in chilled dairy, cereals and ice cream.The decision to no longer run the challenged waters arm as a separate business and instead integrate it into Nestle’s three main geographic regions indicates that that business won’t come up for sale in its entirety.Nestle believes its range of waters, which include the Perrier and S.Pellegrino brands, are capable of delivering strong growth, thanks to demand in emerging markets and the trend for health and wellness in developed regions. But staying so committed to the business looks like a rare strategic misstep, given the pressures on the lower end of the market and growing environmental awareness.As for further acquisitions, more bolt-ons that take Nestle into nascent but potentially fast-growing consumer categories along the lines of fake meat, look likely given the creation of a unit to bolster expansion both within the group and outside of it.There is one portfolio change that seems to remain stubbornly out of Schneider’s plans: selling Nestle’s 32 billion–euro ($35.6 billion) stake in L’Oreal SA, the world’s biggest maker of beauty products.Loeb has been pressing to offload it. Nestle doesn’t need the money, and would prefer to link any change to a big strategic move. But there is merit in considering the disposal. Concern is rising about a slow-down in luxury demand in China, something that has been buoying L’Oreal’s premium cosmetics brands. Meanwhile, the U.S. make-up market looks more challenging after a boom. If conditions deteriorate, Nestle may have missed the best chance to extract maximum value.And it can’t afford any slip ups. The shares have risen 44% since Schneider arrived in January 2017, and trade at a forward price earnings ratio of 22 times. While the premium to Unilever NV is deserved, at this elevated valuation, there is less room for error than when Schneider walked in to shake up what was then a lumbering food giant. To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-10-16	2019-10-16 11:04:59	UL	Unilever PLC	Watch Out, Billionaire Del Vecchio Is Meddling	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Italy’s second-richest tycoon made his fortune in spectacles, and now he has ideas about how to run a bank. There is no doubting Leonardo Del Vecchio’s entrepreneurial flair. But his decision to take a 7% stake in Mediobanca SpA and opine publicly about its strategy merits caution. He is but one shareholder, and he should not dictate the lender’s strategy.Del Vecchio is not a naturally passive shareholder or owner. Chief executive officers at his glasses maker Luxottica Group SpA would rotate at an alarming pace. The merger of Luxottica with French lenses group Essilor diluted his dominant holding into a non-controlling stake and created a balanced board with representation from both sides. The arrangement soon fell into acrimony. That is an inauspicious backdrop for a large and potentially growing investment in Mediobanca.His motivations are unclear. The benign explanation is that this is portfolio diversification: Most of Del Vecchio’s wealth is tied up in the eyewear industry. He has some financial exposure to Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali SpA and lender UniCredit SpA, but this is relatively small. The more worrying possibility is that it really is about meddling with another Generali shareholder — Mediobanca owns 13% of the insurer — or that it relates to some other personal agenda.Del Vecchio has reportedly said Mediobanca needs to be more ambitious in mergers and acquisitions, expand in investment banking, and rely less on the income it receives from Generali. It is not obvious all of these ideas would benefit other shareholders. Wealth management is where acquisitions might make sense for Mediobanca, but deals are risky given that the main assets — the people — can walk out of the door. Mediobanca CEO Alberto Nagel has been rightly cautious.Lifting exposure to investment banking activities, reviving a former strategy, would re-introduce more volatile revenue streams and risk lowering the multiple of earnings on which the shares trade.The function of the Generali stake is a trickier question. Corporate finance theory would dictate that Mediobanca should sell it and return cash to shareholders. If the bank needed cash in the future, it would then ask shareholders to stump up when it could show what the funds would be used for.That works for big, diversified corporations like Unilever NV. But a smaller, less well-capitalized, Italy-focused bank would probably find the capital markets unwilling to provide funds just when it needed them most — for example, in hard times when bid targets were most affordable. So long as there is a possibility that Mediobanca might want to do M&A, the stake is best seen as a financial resource to be retained.It’s possible that Del Vecchio’s vision and Nagel’s could align if Mediobanca finds a decent takeover target, which the Generali stake could pay for. But while Mediobanca’s existing strategy looks sound, and the group is well run, Nagel cannot be complacent. The Generali stake makes a big contribution to net income but doesn’t require any management effort. And Mediobanca’s central and treasury functions make an uncomfortably high dent in the profits that the other businesses bring in. An upcoming strategy refresh offers the chance for Nagel to set some hard targets for revenue growth and further cost efficiency that would dispel any suggestion of low ambition.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

In 2019, investors in one of Canada's best tech names, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), has enjoyed great returns. SHOP stock is up over 155%. So far Ottawa-based SHOP stock has been a high-growth company. Through its multi-channel commerce platform, merchants can set up online storefronts with retail functionality.Source: Jirapong Manustrong / Shutterstock.com Many analysts have been concerned about the high valuation of the stock throughout the year. However, the Shopify stock price has kept going up. On Aug. 27, SHOP stock reached an all-time high of $409.61. Now it is hovering around $330.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Buy Now With the recent drop investors are wondering if the share price can once again start to rise in the coming months. SHOP stock is expected to report earnings on Oct. 29. Let's look at what may be next for the share price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Shopify Stock's Story So FarShopify stock has been a darling of Wall Street since its IPO in May 2015. It started trading at a price of $28. And it has become one of the most watched tech stocks.Quarter after quarter, the stock has been gaining impressive market share in the rapidly growing e-commerce industry. Its annual revenue growth has been around 50%.Shopify's growth comes from two main segments: Merchant Solutions and Subscription Solutions.The Merchant Solutions business includes tools that enable sellers to serve their customers better and sell more products. And they are more correlated with clients' Gross Merchandise Volumes (GMVs). Within Merchant Solutions, the group offers Shopify Payments, Shopify Shipping, Shopify Capital (working capital lending), and the Shopify POS (point of sale) system.Subscription Solutions offer merchants of all sizes monthly recurring subscription plans that cost from under $10 to over $2,000 per month. In other words, there are different tiers for different-sized merchants. Many analysts highlight the importance of the monthly recurring revenue (MRR) for the future strength of the company.Many on Wall Street credit the company's success with a wide range of tools that enable store owners to easily manage their businesses.Based on the growth story, there's certainly a bull case to be made for SHOP stock extending far beyond 2019, but it is plagued by over-valuation concerns. Therefore, in the next earnings report, Wall Street would like to see the guidance for the rest of the year to increase. What to Expect in SHOP's Q3 EarningsOn Aug. 1, SHOP stock reported strong Q2 results that beat analysts' average estimates, thanks to strong demand for its subscription solutions. On an adjusted basis, the group earned 14 cents per share.Shopify stock's revenue of $362 million surpassed the $350 million expected by analysts. It was a 48% increase from the comparable quarter in 2018. Merchant Solutions revenue grew 56%, to $208.9 million. Subscription Solutions revenue grew 38% to $153 million.Shopify Plus, the premium version of Shopify, has over 5,300 customers, including names like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Unilever (NYSE:UL), and the Obama Foundation. About a quarter of the company's monthly recurring revenues comes from Shopify Plus merchants. Overall, Subscription Solutions is more profitable.As of June 30, 2019, Shopify had an impressive $2.01 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. A year ago, that number stood at $1.97 billion.When Q3 results are released, investors may want to do due diligence to assess whether the number of stores and merchants will continue to grow, whether SHOP stock's subscription revenue will continue to grow, and whether Shopify will continue to offer merchants a technological lead in the e-commerce platform.However, Shopify has not yet reported any profits. And investors may have to wait several quarters before they see any meaningful profits. Could SHOP Stock's Margins Become a Worry?CEO Tobi Lutke recently stressed that SHOP would continue to innovate and launch new products and services for both merchants and their customers. Wall Street also expects the company to continue to grow via acquisitions.Over the summer, Shopify stock has announced that the group is entering physical fulfillment business. It will offer sellers access to a network of dedicated U.S. fulfillment centers to store and ship consumer goods for online orders. This move into logistics is likely to create new opportunities for the group. Management is hoping that Shopify merchants can now better compete with Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) expanding distribution capabilities.SHOP bulls are happy to point out that the company's increased logistics services are likely to add to revenue growth, which is showing no sign of slowing down. In Sept. 2019, management announced a $450-million deal last month to acquire 6 River Systems, maker of autonomous warehouse robots.Yet some investors are now quite concerned that the logistics business will likely drive down the margins. SHOP stock's success so far has been due to the core business of being a high-margin, high-growth software company. As of the end of June, SHOP stock's gross margin stood at 56.57%.However, Shopify has been exhibiting contracting gross margins especially in Merchant Solutions. Furthermore, in Q2 the company's operating expenses increased by 49.9%.If SHOP management cannot keep meeting the Street's aggressive growth forecasts, then the owners of SHOP stock may become more concerned about its lack of profit, and Shopify stock could drop. Instead of focusing on profits, management wants to expand the company by launching new businesses. Therefore, those who plan to own SHOP stock over the long-term need to pay attention to the cash flows from its new ventures. The Bottom Line on Shopify StockSHOP is a growth and speculative stock. Prior to the earnings report, I expect SHOP to be a battleground between investors and traders. While long-term investors would like to see Shopify stock go over the $350 level, traders are likely to keep it between $325 and $275.In a few weeks, SHOP stock is likely to release another strong quarterly report. I'd like to analyze the statement before hitting the &quot;buy&quot; button.Those who have benefited from SHOP's 2019 gains may also consider taking some money of the table as we look ahead to the next earnings report. Alternatively, they may consider hedging their positions with covered call or put spreads.If the earning report is another strong one, SHOP stock is likely to go and stay above $350. If SHOP stock's quarterly report disappoints, then a move toward $250 or below could happen rather quickly.From a fundamental valuation perspective, Shopify is still too expensive for me. However, there's no doubt it's an impressive growth company.Many analysts indeed regard Shopify stock as one of the best e-commerce plays around. And it has been one of the top-performing stocks in 2019. Thus the strength of Shopify share price might be a good indication that within three or four years, investors who buy SHOP on weakness are likely to be rewarded handsomely.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-11	2019-10-11 14:30:05	UL	Unilever PLC	How a Battery Can Lead a Quiet Revolution	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- This week, the Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to John Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino for their work developing the lithium-ion battery. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, in announcing the award, said the three men “created a rechargeable world.” The ubiquitous battery is now found in items as varied as hearing aids and power grids. It is a testament not just to technological revolutions, but also to the power of advancements in performance and decreases in cost. Whittingham began working on the lithium-ion battery in an Exxon Mobil Corp. laboratory in the 1970s, when it was being considered for automotive applications. The lithium-ion battery wasn’t a fit for cars then, but research and development continued and the technology improved, to the point that it became a viable power source in search of an application. But it was Sony Corp., not Exxon Mobil, that would introduce the first lithium-ion battery for consumers. That new device in need of a suitable power source? The handheld 8 mm camcorder. In 1995, camcorders created the biggest source of demand for lithium-ion batteries. By 2000, laptops had become the biggest driver of demand; by 2005, it was feature phones. By 2010, the smartphone was the biggest source of demand for lithium-ion batteries. As this rather dramatic chart shows, passenger electric vehicles have vaulted past consumer electronics to become the single biggest source of demand for lithium-ion batteries, less than 15 years after Martin Eberhard built the first Tesla Roadster battery pack from 6,831 of the lithium-ion cells used in laptop computers.The lithium-ion battery has come a very long way in other ways, too. Battery costs have come down by more than 80% in nine years.And battery manufacturing capacity has increased more than 200-fold in 15 years. There is far more expansion planned. Next year will see more new capacity added than the global manufacturing capacity’s total in 2016. By 2023, total capacity will have more than doubled.The combination of cost, capacity and capability has in itself created a new market for the lithium-ion battery: energy storage within power grids. We need look no further than northern Indiana, where power utility Nipsco plans to replace coal-fired power with wind, solar and solar-plus-storage projects. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences concluded its announcement of this year’s chemistry prize rather poetically: “Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized our lives since they first entered the market in 1991,” the academy said. “They have laid the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society, and are of the greatest benefit to humankind.” Sometimes being good enough is revolutionary, too.Weekend readingSome of 2019’s wackiest investment predictions are coming true. “Firms that align their business models to a net zero world will be rewarded handsomely,” Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in a speech in Tokyo this week. “Those that fail to adapt will cease to exist.” Carbon Tracker estimates that Japan’s coal-fired power generation fleet could end up as $71 billion of stranded assets. Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte has decided against investing in Saudi Aramco’s initial public offering, in part over environmental concerns. Unilever says that it will reduce its use of virgin plastic by 50% by 2025, and reduce its absolute use of plastic packaging by 100,000 metric tons. A new Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development study finds that obesity-related diseases will claim more than 90 million lives in the next 30 years, lower life expectancy by three years, and reduce gross domestic product by 3.3% in OECD countries. Three out of 10 low-income Americans do not have access to broadband of any kind.

2019-10-10	2019-10-10 12:40:20	UL	Unilever PLC	Doritos, Snickers and Pizza Are Under Attack	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Why should society permit the existence of food companies that contribute to poor health? The standard answer is that people should be allowed to make bad choices about what they eat and drink. But that’s a slippery defense when the consumers are children and the choices they face are loaded against their wellbeing, as Thursday’s British government report on childhood obesity makes clear.The snacks industry — from Mondelez International Inc. to Coca-Cola Co. and from Nestle SA to the Kraft Heinz Company — needs to rethink its purpose, and strategy, if its license to operate is to endure.Former U.K. chief medical officer Professor Sally Davies, the report’s author, cites multiple causes for a saddening rise in obesity among England’s 10-11-year-olds since 1990. The giant food brands are only part of the problem but that hardly absolves them from leading the solution. As Davies says, cheap unhealthy food tends to be the most readily available. Portion inflation is rampant. Advertising or sponsorship is pervasive. Healthy options are often unaffordable for those on low incomes, while the unhealthy options are cheap.Davies’s recommendations include some radical ideas. The U.K. public may be banned from eating and drinking on public transport. Industry faces calorie caps on food portions consumed “out-of-home,” tiered VAT on unhealthy food, plain packaging and the end of tax deductibility of marketing costs for unhealthy products. These may just be proposals. But the direction of travel is clear.This is what happens when an industry fails to self-regulate to mitigate its worst effects. Governments wake up. The food and drink industry is a big employer and a big taxpayer. Even so, the economics favor intervention. The medical costs of obesity, coupled with lost productivity, are 3% of global GDP, according to McKinsey research from 2014. Today’s unhealthy children are tomorrow’s sick workforce.The U.K. Food and Drink Federation, the lobby group, says “punitive action” might hinder continuing the progress the manufacturers have already made in cutting salt, sugar and calories from their products over the last four years. It says the industry must “take the consumer with us.” The question is whether it is taking itself and its customers to an early grave. The industry needs to see this problem as an opportunity not a threat. First, it should be clear about its role in society. Making treats that people want to eat can be a good reason for a corporation to exist, but not when it adds to a public health crisis. This doesn’t mean PepsiCo Inc. ending production of Doritos. But it does mean defining responsibly what the target market — and age group — is for such products. And it requires combining marketing with education.At the same time, food manufacturers should redouble their efforts to innovate healthier, cost-effective alternatives to sugar and salt. This is a chance for the food giants to think about the huge market for healthy snacks. Food technology has a vital role here and it’s best mediated by the private sector. R&D has already helped, as with the development of Nestle’s so-called hollow sugar.This week the OECD proposed reforms to corporate taxation, which would allow governments to tax digital companies that generate revenues in countries where they have no physical presence. The food industry faces a similar revenue challenge. Its products will be subject to extra taxes in certain markets until they start to use their well-funded research labs to help meet national health objectives.It’s not clear that the sector sees obesity as a strategic issue yet. Unilever NV is recycling plastic packaging but still aiming to sell lots more Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. The debate among investors about what stocks to divest centers on fossil fuels right now. If food companies don’t act, they’ll join tobacco and oil in the sin bin.&#92;--With assistance from Lara Williams.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

2019-10-04	2019-10-04 09:12:40	UL	Unilever PLC	When Deal Genius Fails: Hard Lessons From 3G to SoftBank	(Bloomberg) -- They’re the big dogs of modern mergers and acquisitions—rapacious dealmakers that have devoured mighty corporations, bankrolled young disrupters and upended entire industries. And they’re not looking so tough anymore.Since 2014, when the latest wave of mergers and acquisitions began to build, three names have inspired fear and envy in the M&A world. In doing so, each has been totemic of a particular vogue in the capital markets:3G Capital, the Brazilian investment firm that has picked off some of America’s most famous brands and aggressively squeezed out costs and jobs Valeant Pharmaceuticals, the ill-fated Canadian company that gobbled up drugmakers, drove up prices and fueled outrage over high prescription costs And SoftBank, the big-dreaming—and big-spending—Japanese conglomerate that has backed the likes of Uber and WeWork and remains one of the most powerful forces in Silicon ValleyFrom the start, the three M&A powerhouses adopted wildly different strategies. But for any investor, the similarities deserve attention. Wall Street believed them and their many imitators to be exceptional. Turns out, they weren’t, and aren’t.(4)That’s worth remembering at a moment when the financial world is struggling to come to grips with the yawning gap between what the pros think companies are worth and what those companies actually fetch on public markets. (See WeWork’s botched initial public offering).Not long ago, 3G, co-founded by billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, seemed unstoppable. Lemann became a global name by cobbling together the world’s biggest beermaker, Anheuser-Busch InBev; picking up brands like Burger King and Tim Hortons; and driving the 2015 merger between Kraft and Heinz to create one of world’s largest food companies.3G has since stumbled—hard. Mixing Kraft and Heinz turned out to be a disastrous idea, and not just for those two companies.The investment firm’s usual combine-and-cut formula failed miserably at Kraft Heinz. Since Lemann teamed up with none other than Warren Buffett to do the deal, sales and profits have tanked. 3G’s dream of turning Kraft Heinz into the savior of Big Food ended when Unilever rebuffed its $143 billion takeover offer in 2017. This February, Kraft Heinz took a staggering $15.4 billion writedown. The company’s stock has plunged more than 70% from its peak, helping to drag down rivals like Kellogg, Campbell Soup and General Mills.Former management consultant Michael Pearson had a similarly radical idea at Valeant: that drugmakers like itself had no business actually making drugs.Instead, it would borrow money to acquire rivals, dramatically increase the price of their treatments and fire almost everyone. Rinse, repeat. Valeant’s ambition peaked in 2014 when it teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman to mount an audacious $54 billion takeover offer for Allergan, the maker of Botox.The bid was spurned, but Ackman and Pearson were undimmed and, as if to prove their theory, took the company on a buying spree that included gastrointestinal drugmaker Salix ($11.1 billion) and Sprout, a developer of female libido stimulants ($1 billion). For a while investors approved, sending Valeant’s market value to $90 billion in August 2015. Then things went spectacularly wrong.Accounting irregularities, mounting debts and political angst over surging drug prices destroyed not only the Valeant dream, but those of the entire specialty pharmaceuticals industry. Among those that followed Valeant to that 2015 peak, Perrigo, Endo International, and Mallinckrodt have since lost, respectively, 74%, 96%, and 98% of their market values. For its part, Valeant is 93% lower, with a new management, board and shareholder base, and has renamed itself Bausch Health.There is no nice way to bring SoftBank into this part of the story.By almost any conceivable measure, it is having a diabolical 2019. The quixotic Masayoshi Son, a startup kingmaker of undoubted brilliance, has staked SoftBank’s billions—and its reputation—on three companies: Uber, the ride-hailing app which has lost about a third of its value, or $19 billion, since its May IPO; Slack, a messaging platform which debuted in June and is down 35% from where it ended its first trading day; and WeWork.(5)The scale of these blowups, so starkly at odds with SoftBank’s recent esteemed status, has dislocated the U.S. IPO markets as investors and would-be public companies look skeptically at one another across a widening gulf of value perception.In hindsight, the impermanence of the three dealmakers’ strategies is easy to skewer. But the success of 3G and Valeant was fueled by some of the most well-known names in finance. SoftBank, meanwhile, tapped entire nations to bankroll its ambitions of creating a future of robot-human harmony.These failures could end up restricting Son’s access to future funding, but it’s unlikely to diminish his vision for what he has said is a 300-year plan to grow the company he started 38 years ago.Nor, probably, will it dampen his enthusiasm for what he has called the gold rush of investing in nascent technology. “It’s just a money thing. It’s not important, it’s just a process. What is more important is humans’ happiness. How do we help ourselves, humans, become happier?” Son said in 2017, calling himself a “super optimist.” “There’s always a solution.”What’s more likely is the end of the burgeoning trend of taking loss-making companies public in the hope the future will come to them. Perhaps, too, some doubt will attach itself to the idea that pumping a young business with money and expecting it to succeed isn’t an idea of wheel-inventing novelty.Either way, there will be something else to worship soon enough. There always is.(1) Another area of commonality is a tolerance for bad corporate governance. In the case of Kraft Heinz and (to be very charitable) Valeant, there was sloppy accounting. For SoftBank, it was willing to put up with the various untraditional practices of Travis Kalanick and Adam Neumann.(2) I can’t add anything revelatory to the mass that has been written about SoftBank and WeWork, the fact that it valued it at $47 billion, whether or not Messrs. Son and Neumann met for 10, 30, or 60 minutes, etc. So I won’t. But it’s hard to feel not a little sad for Adam Neumann. The Disney prince/founder/ex-CEO of WeWork, who just weeks ago was gallantly riding toward his public market destiny, has been banished from the kingdom, leaving a regency of lesser mortals to seize the reins.To contact the author of this story: Ed Hammond in New York at ehammond12@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Hauck at dhauck1@bloomberg.net, David GillenBen ScentFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deal-genius-fails-hard-lessons-091240569.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-02	2019-10-02 09:00:07	UL	Unilever PLC	Tesco Boss Leaves Before His Sell-By Date	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In the five years since Tesco Plc was plunged into the biggest crisis in its history, Dave Lewis, its chief executive officer, has executed an (almost) textbook turnaround of Britain’s biggest retailer.He’s now decided that his job is done and he will hand over the reins next year to Ken Murphy of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.“Drastic Dave” — a moniker Lewis picked up because of his cost-cutting zeal in a former job at Unilever Plc — took Tesco out of intensive care. He revived sales growth, restored profit, cut debt and reinstated the dividend. The shares are 18% higher than they were back in 2014, when Tesco announced a bombshell 250 million-pound ($307 million) profit black hole. That stock price increase is twice that of the FTSE 100 index.There’s still a vague sense of disappointment, though. One might have expected some Lewis initiatives, such as taking prices closer to those of the German-owned discount grocers Aldi and Lidl, to bear more fruit. While Tesco is managing to grind out incremental growth in an ever-more-competitive market, it’s hard to get too excited by that.Lewis did deliver on his key turnaround target: lifting the company’s operating margin to between 3.5% and 4% six months earlier than expected. So he’s making the wise move for a CEO of going out on a high note.But it’s curious that he didn’t appear to be in the running for two other high-profile CEO posts that have been filled recently, at the consumer goods giants Unilever Plc and Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc. Lewis doesn’t have another job to go to and plans to take some time off before thinking about his next move.The choice of replacement is certainly a surprise. Lewis’s natural successor was Charles Wilson, the popular ex-boss of Booker, which Tesco bought in 2018. However, he stepped back from running Tesco’s British arm last year due to illness. Murphy was joint chief operating officer at Walgreens’ British pharmacy chain Boots before being promoted at the American parent. So he does have experience in the fiercely competitive U.K. retail market.Still, he has no direct experience of the cutthroat grocery sector, which has been transformed by the price-slashing antics of Aldi and Lidl. This is Tesco’s greatest challenge. At least Murphy will benefit from the advice of Wilson, who still has a senior role at Tesco.While the supermarket giant has prospered from the weakness of its great rival J Sainsbury Plc, the latter appears to have gotten its act together lately. And while the British shopper has remained pretty immune to Brexit so far, a no-deal departure from the European Union might change that.It won’t be easy to balance these challenges against an investor base that’s expecting a special dividend or buybacks from next year. Already Tesco’s U.K. sales growth has slowed. That may reflect a broader deceleration across the grocery market, after a strong 2018, but a slowdown is a slowdown. Shareholders are naturally cautious about the management change, although the stock did rise 2% in a falling London market on Wednesday.At least Lewis didn’t hang around beyond his sell-by date, unlike so many other CEOs.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-09-30	2019-09-30 21:00:00	UL	Unilever PLC	Top Tech Investor Bets India Corner Shops Can Fight Amazon	(Bloomberg) -- One of the most successful Silicon Valley-Asia venture capital firms is counting on the humble mom-and-pop store that dominates India’s retail landscape to hold its own against Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.Menlo Park, California-based GGV Capital, a $6.2 billion investor in some of the biggest unicorns in the U.S. and China including Airbnb, Xiaomi Corp., and Slack Technologies Inc., is backing startups that serve the tiny, family-run businesses known as kiranas.“It’s all about powering the little guys,” said Hans Tung, managing partner, in a recent joint interview with fellow investor Jixun Foo in Bangalore, where the duo was meeting a dozen entrepreneurs. “We’re backing startups that provide technology and working capital to make kiranas more efficient, so that these mom-and-pops can become e-commerce and lending enablers in their communities,” Tung added.From the poshest neighborhoods to teeming slums, typical Indian kiranas are cramped spaces that can just about fit a king-size bed but are chock-full of sacks of rice, lentils and dried chili peppers. Their floor-to-ceiling shelves are stacked with toothpaste and cooking oil, and their shopfronts festooned with colorful bags of potato chips, tiny sachets of shampoo and pickles. With their personalized service, the stores usually offer door-step delivery and interest-free credit.GGV, which has focused almost exclusively on China and the U.S. for two decades, is bullish about India. “We are seeing the same movie played out a little differently in emerging economies,” said Tung. “India can be very big over the next 10 years.” As much as 20% of the $1.9 billion fund raised by the VC firm last year will be allocated to India as well as Southeast Asia.India has the market size and talent pool to make things happen and now investors are lining up with capital, said Foo. GGV Capital will write $5-10 million in checks in the case of very early-stage entrepreneurs and $50 million checks for later-stage startups, he said.The firm has built an investment strategy around kiranas based on the premise it’s better to play with a model that already exists rather than building new supply chains that could take as long as a decade to materialize. GGV’s first such investment amounting “to tens of millions of dollars” is in Udaan, a Bangalore-based B2B marketplace for small businesses, the partners said. More recently, GGV has put money in Khatabook, a mobile app that’s a digital version of the bahi khata, or the hand-written ledger that owners of tiny businesses traditionally use to keep track of daily accounts. It’s an earlier-stage bet so the investment is “lower”, Tung said.Large global investors like Tiger Global Management, Lightspeed Venture Partners and even consumer giant Unilever’s investing arm are backing technology startups that serve kiranas but GGV Capital is the first to crystallize a proposition that goes beyond India to include the neighborhood-store equivalents of kiranas in Indonesia, Vietnam and Latin America.“Across these countries, the value of the average online order is still low and the cost of last mile logistics is very high,” said Foo. “Entrepreneurs are finding a different way by empowering the mom and pops and that can get e-commerce going.”In India, even the biggest conglomerates including Tata and Reliance have been unable to diminish kiranas’ dominance while newer online retail entrants Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart are trying to embrace them, using the shops to facilitate deliveries or offer assistance to customers going online for the first time. Reliance has already said it will equip kiranas with technology as part of its online-offline e-commerce model.GGV also sees the neighborhood stores as more than a place to shop. “If you power them up and earn their trust, they can be the place to serve the community far beyond just groceries and daily necessities,” said Tung.To contact the reporter on this story: Saritha Rai in Bangalore at srai33@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-tech-investor-bets-india-210000261.html?.tsrc=rss

Investors have awaited details on the partnership since the companies announced it about a year ago.The venture, called Feng Mao, will start a launch campaign for the platform in the second week of October, after China’s Golden Week holidays, the companies said Monday. That gives time to promote the business ahead of China’s Nov. 11 Singles’ Day holiday, when unmarried couples shower each other with gifts.Richemont is leading luxury-goods makers in e-commerce expansion after acquiring high-end internet retailers YNAP and Watchfinder. It’s a way for the Swiss company to capture Chinese consumers -- who Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang has said may make up almost half of the global luxury market by 2025 -- without the expense of opening physical stores.Last year, Singles’ Day brought in $31 billion in revenue to Alibaba, making it one of the biggest events in e-commerce ever.Feng Mao is 51% owned by Richemont, while Alibaba holds 49%, and will operate the site under the Swiss company’s Net-a-Porter brand.

2019-09-25	2019-09-25 09:42:50	UL	Unilever PLC	African Free Trade Stumbles With Nigerian Blockade of Benin	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Nigeria and Benin are embroiled in a trade dispute two months after signing an agreement to free up the movement of goods and services in Africa.Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the partial closing of its boundary with Benin last month to curb smuggling of rice and other commodities. The blockade has had a ripple effect across West Africa, with factories and traders struggling to import key raw materials and having to use alternative routes for their exports, according to the Lagos Chamber of Commerce.The border restrictions come after Nigeria and Benin in July agreed to join the African Continental Free Trade Area, which targets greater economic integration through the removal of trade barriers and tariffs on 90% of commodities. The duty-free movement of goods is expected to boost trade in the market of 1.2 billion people, similar in size to India, and a combined gross domestic product of $2.5 trillion.“Over 80% of West African cross-border trade is by road,” said Muda Yusuf, the head of the Lagos business chamber in the Nigerian commercial hub. “The cost is quite enormous and the closure is not sustainable.”Benin is a key transit route for traders and operates a system that allows landlocked neighboring countries to use its harbors for imports.The impact of the dispute is being felt as far afield as Ghana, which is separated from Nigeria by Benin and Togo. Manufacturers have complained about the impact on costs, John Defor, research director at the Association of Ghana Industries, said by phone. In Nigeria, units of multinational companies including Unilever NV are in talks with the government to find a solution.The restrictions are the latest taken by Nigeria to protect its foreign-currency reserves by curbing imports. The central bank has restricted access to dollars for the import of more than 40 items from cement to soap, while the government wants Africa’s most populous nation to become self-sufficient in the production of staples such as rice.Protectionist PoliciesTraders and smugglers in Benin have taken advantage of Nigeria’s protectionist policies to import and re-export goods to their bigger neighbor, said Ahmadou Aly Mbaye, an economics professor at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Senegal’s capital, Dakar.Rice is a good example. Benin, with a population of 11 million that is barely 5% of Nigeria’s, is the biggest buyer of the grain from Thailand, the world’s second-largest exporter. Official shipments from Thailand to Nigeria have dwindled to almost nothing from more than 1.2 million tons in 2014, while those to Benin have increased by more than half.“Benin is basically importing for Nigeria,” Mbaye, who is a senior fellow at the Washington D.C.-based Brookings Institution, said by phone. “Protectionism is difficult to implement in a globalized world, because people find ways around it.”Buhari defended the blockade at a meeting in Japan with Beninese President Patrice Talon at the end of last month. He said Benin and its northern neighbor, Niger, should take “strict and comprehensive measures” to curtail smuggling across their borders.While Nigeria is committed to the African free-trade deal, the agreement “must not only promote free trade, but legal trade of quality made-in-Africa goods,” Buhari said in a Sept. 20 speech, which a spokesman shared in response to questions.A spokesman for Talon declined to comment.Countries which have ratified the African free-trade agreement are expected to start trading with slashed tariffs from July 2020.(Adds date for implementation of free-trade agreement in final paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Demetrios Pogkas.To contact the reporters on this story: Yinka Ibukun in Accra at yibukun@bloomberg.net;Ruth Olurounbi in Abuja at rolurounbi4@bloomberg.net;Virgile Ahissou in Accra at vahissou@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Andre Janse van Vuuren at ajansevanvuu@bloomberg.net, Paul RichardsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/african-free-trade-stumbles-nigerian-050000972.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-23	2019-09-23 19:25:20	UL	Unilever PLC	Long-Term Investors Should Consider Buying SHOP Stock Near $250	September has been a tough month for Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock, one of Canada's most coveted tech names. On Aug. 27, SHOP stock reached an all-time high of $409.61. Despite the recent drop in price, year-to-date, Shopify stock is still up an eye-popping 135%.Source: justplay1412 / Shutterstock.com Although SHOP stock's revenue growth continues to impress Wall Street, there might be further volatility and profit-taking in the shares. However, long-term investors are likely to find value in the stock as the price declines more.  * 7 Worst Stocks in the S&P 500 in 2019 Let's look at what may be next for Shopify stock in the final quarter of the year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips How SHOP Stock Makes MoneyIn a nutshell, Shopify sells out-of-the-box e-commerce solutions. The company's growth comes from two main segments: Merchant Solutions and Subscription Solutions. Many on Wall Street credit the company's success with a wide range of tools that enable store owners to easily manage their businesses.On Aug. 1, SHOP stock reported strong Q2 results that beat analysts' average estimates, thanks to strong demand for its subscription solutions. On an adjusted basis, the group earned 14 cents per share.Shopify stock's revenue of $362 million surpassed the $350 million expected by analysts. It was a 48% increase from the comparable quarter in 2018.Merchant Solutions revenue grew 56%, to $208.9 million. Merchant Solutions includes tools that enable sellers to serve their customers better and sell more products. Within Merchant Solutions, SHOP offers payment services, shipping services, and a working capital management tool.Subscription Solutions revenue grew 38% to $153 million. Subscription Solutions offer merchants of all sizes monthly recurring subscription plans that cost from under $10 to over $2,000 per month.Shopify Plus, the premium version of Shopify, has over 5,300 customers, including names like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Unilever (NYSE:UL), and the Obama Foundation.A quarter of the company's monthly recurring revenues comes from Shopify Plus merchants. SHOP recently launched a multi-currency feature for Shopify Plus merchants who also use Shopify Payments.CEO Tobi Lutke recently stressed that SHOP would continue to innovate and launch new products and services for both merchants and their customers. Wall Street also expects the company to continue to grow via acquisitions.As of June 30, 2019, Shopify had an impressive $2.01 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. A year ago, that number stood at $1.97 billion. Shopify Stock Is Growing InternationallyManagement has also been looking at expanding overseas, especially in non-English-speaking countries, as the company's next key growth area. In Q2, the company's overseas customer base grew, enabling its international revenue growth to accelerate.The leading multi-channel commerce platform has recently announced that Shopify would be extending its cannabis e-commerce platform features to allow U.S. merchants to sell hemp and and hemp-derived cannabidiol where allowed by law. Several of Canada's provinces have already used Shopify to start online cannabis stores.Earlier in the year, Shopify launched its payment gateway, Shopify Payments, in Germany, making bank account transfers possible there. In its efforts to expand beyond core English-speaking countries, the company has recently made the Shopify website available in eighteen other languages, including Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish.In other words, Shopify is an attractive company with excellent growth prospects in cloud-based e-commerce, both in North America and globally. However, investors also need to be aware of some question marks facing SHOP stock. SHOP Stock Has High ValuationCould valuation worries be behind the recent decline in price in Shopify shares?SHOP stock bears point out the stock's high valuation. Different analysts have been warning how the increase in SHOP stock price cannot be justified by various metrics.Furthermore, in case of an upcoming slowdown in the U.S. or global economy, then the momentum of high-flying names like SHOP stock will slow down, too.On Aug. 23, CNBC's Jim Cramer sold SHOP stock, which he was holding in his charitable trust. He is possibly one of the most public commentators to raise the alarm bell on the company.One of the metrics I pay attention to is SHOP stocks's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. Despite the recent price decline, it is still high enough to make value investors run for cover. Shopify stock's P/S ratio stands at about 27x. To put the metric into perspective, the S&P 500's average price-sales ratio is 2.1x.Another way to look at this number is to compare the company's current  P/S ratio with its P/S ratios over time. Since going public, SHOP stock's lowest and highest P/S level has respectively been 6.86x and 32.78x. That essentially means that the owners of SHOP stock are paying a lot more for Shopify stock now than they were when the P/S ratio was 6.8x.Another way to analyze the P/S ratio is to compare it with the ratios of companies in similar sectors. Alibaba's (NASDAQ:BABA) P/S ratio stands at 8.5x. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) stock's P/S is 14x, and the P/S ratio of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is 3.6x.Although the P/S ratio of SHOP stock is very high, investors should also remember that it is only one of many valuation metrics. Moreover, it does not take into account the profitability or costs of Shopify. What Else Could Derail Shopify Stock?SHOP bulls are happy to point out that the company's revenue growth is showing no sign of slowing down. On the other hand, Shopify has not yet reported any profits. In Q2, Shopify stock's operating loss was $39.6 million, or 11% of revenue.If SHOP cannot keep meeting the Street's aggressive growth forecasts, then owners of SHOP stock may become more concerned about its lack of profit, and Shopify stock could drop.During Q1, SHOP launched its TV and film content division, Shopify Studios, Wall Street is debating why Shopify has decided to create such content. In June, SHOP announced that it would be launching a fulfillment network and offer two-day shipping across 99% of the continental U.S. Analysts believe this ambitious strategy is likely to be quite costly for Shopify. The company expects to invest about $1 billion in the network over the next five years.Instead of focusing on profits, management wants to expand the company by launching new businesses. Therefore, those who plan to own SHOP stock over the long-term need to pay attention to the cash flows from its new ventures.Many investors have also been quite concerned about the various reports by short seller Citron Research, which regards Shopify's business model as a &quot;get-rich-quick-scheme.&quot; Moreover, several analysts have recently downgraded SHOP stock in response to its stellar bull run.Shopify stock's price decline in September accelerated when management announced the group would raise about $603 million in a secondary offering, selling 1.9 million Class A shares. Investors are clearly not impressed with this dilution.Finally, those investors who follow short-term technical charts will be interested to know that Shopify stock has spent a good portion of 2019 in overbought territory. It is possible that some further profit-taking will negatively impact SHOP stock in the near future, possibly prior to its next earnings report, expected in late October. Bottom Line on Shopify StockIn a few weeks, SHOP stock is likely to release another strong quarterly report. However,  SHOP stock is simply too expensive for me to hit the &quot;buy&quot; button on it at these levels.SHOP is a growth stock and a speculative stock. Therefore, in the coming weeks, I expect SHOP to be a battleground between investors and traders. While long-term investors would like to see Shopify stock go back over the $350 level, traders are likely to keep it between $300 and $250.Markets offer investors plenty of choices to invest their hard-earned cash, and SHOP stock's fundamentals might not offer the best prospects right now. Therefore, I'd consider buying SHOP stock as the price declines toward $250, or even $200, and not before.Those who have benefited from SHOP's 2019 gains may consider taking profits as we look ahead to the next earnings report. Alternatively, they may consider hedging their positions with covered call or put spreads.When Shopify stock reports Q3 earnings in a few weeks, investors may want to do due diligence to assess whether the number of stores and merchants will continue to grow, whether SHOP stock's subscription revenue will continue to grow, and whether Shopify will continue to offer merchants a technological lead in the e-commerce platform.Well-performing stocks tend to keep on winning, and the recent strength of Shopify stock might be a good indication that within three or four years, investors who buy SHOP on weakness are likely to be rewarded handsomely. Shopify could also be acquired by a giant retailer such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT).As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-19	2019-09-19 09:00:21	UL	Unilever PLC	One Way to Slow Climate Change: Pay CEOs to Protect the Planet	(Bloomberg) -- The executives tasked with introducing Seventh Generation’s line of eco-friendly laundry detergents, dish soaps and cleaners to Southeast Asia faced a dilemma earlier this year. If the Unilever NV unit proceeded with the planned product launch before enough recycled plastic could be found for packaging, it could undercut sustainability goals tied to 20% of employee bonuses. Picking a non-recycled material could cost them all a chunk of money.   “If you don’t have access to recycled resins, then we just won’t launch,” Seventh Generation Chief Executive Officer Joey Bergstein said the company decided at the time. His team eventually found suitable material from the region’s fledgling recycling infrastructure, and Seventh Generation hit store shelves there without lowering standards—or bonuses. The search paid off for Unilever, too, with the same supplies of recycled resins going into the packaging of the European consumer giant’s other brands in Southeast Asia.Most large companies now set sustainability goals, but few impose consequences on employees who fail to meet them. Around 500 corporations worldwide tie executive pay to environmental, social or governance goals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Not all of these are related to climate impact—diversity and safety are more prevalent than environment targets among this group.That’s beginning to change. “It’s is coming up more and more, but five years ago this wasn’t part of the conversation,” said Seymour Burchman, a managing director at Semler Brossy, a consultant that advises on compensation plans. With companies creating better data around environmental impact and risks, he said, the case for linking compensation gets stronger. “The board can’t ignore it.”The employers that most often link compensation to environmental impact aren’t crunchy consumer brands like Seventh Generation but gritty miners. Extractive industries need to measure environmental impact to get licenses required to operate in local communities, and Burchman said that incentive pay has been an effective way for miners to improve these results.Cameco Corp. links 40% of annual bonuses to safety, environment and community measures. Vale SA started linking emission reductions to annual bonuses in 2018. Rio Tinto Plc said in April it was considering how to link greenhouse gas cuts to short-term incentive plans. BHP Group—the world's largest miner—said Tuesday it will increase the amount of short-term incentives CEO Andrew Mackenzie has tied to carbon emissions reductions and climate metrics in 2020 from 4% currently. As more companies reckon with their carbon footprints and face pressure to embrace renewable energy, links between climate-related targets and compensation are spreading. General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra had seven sustainability objectives last year, including reaching 200,000 electric vehicle sales in the U.S. GM’s proxy statement denoted each one with a little green leaf, alongside other traditional financial goals for CEO pay like revenue, dividends and share repurchases. There are other executives at the Detroit automaker with sustainability goals included in their compensation, although a GM spokeswoman didn’t say how far these targets extend down the line.Climate goals for executive pay are more common in Europe, where companies like Novozymes A/S, the Copenhagen-based maker of industrial enzymes, gives each employee his or her own incentives for meeting financial, social and environmental targets. Food and beverage maker Danone SA bases about 10% of CEO Emmanuel Faber’s pay on meeting climate commitments and creating a sustainable supply chain.Sustainability is increasingly creeping into traditional financial incentives for companies — and even their suppliers.  Walmart, for example, has pledged to cut a gigaton of greenhouse gases out of its business by 2030, extending all the way into its supply chain. Earlier this year, in an effort to spur suppliers to do better, Walmart offered better financial terms to anyone who delivered on green goals. Walmart specifically links diversity and culture to 15% of executive incentive pay and 10% of pay for associates, but doesn’t break out environmental goals in its proxy.  In the credit markets, nearly $70 billion of green- and sustainability-linked loans were issued this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The loans let companies lower the cost of their debt if they meet specific sustainability targets. At Seventh Generation, the entire workforce sees pay change along with company-wide sustainability metrics. That puts the unit on the far end of adoption, which makes sense for an environmentally-minded consumer brand. “When you bake it into the incentive system people really feel compelled to go after it,” said Bergstein, the chief executive.Meeting goals on packaging and greenhouse-gas reduction prompted the launch of an ultra concentrated laundry detergent in 2018. The detergent weighs less, which the company claims will cut emissions from shipping by about 70%.Scientists working for Seventh Generation, however, have concluded that 92% of the company’s greenhouse-gas footprint stems from people washing and drying clothes at home—something very difficult for executives to change. Working with manufacturers to design washing machines that are more efficient didn’t seem like it would address that problem fast enough. So the company took an unorthodox approach.Seventh Generation set a target that 100 U.S. cities would need to pledge to shift to clean energy by 2030. If they didn’t, employees would lose out on incentive pay. Bergstein will admit that it sounds crazy: “What kind of control do we have over 100 cities across America to make that kind of commitment?” he said. “But we looked at each other and said if we’re really serious about cleaning up the energy grid, then we’ve got to do something like this.”Seventh Generation spent $1 million on lobbying efforts and worked with the Sierra Club and other groups to sway local officials. It worked — and its 160 employees got to keep their bonuses. “It would have been a lot easier to take that $1 million and spend it elsewhere,” Bergstein said. “But it really keeps your feet to the fire.”This story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to highlight climate change.To contact the author of this story: Emily Chasan in New York at echasan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Aaron Rutkoff at arutkoff@bloomberg.net, Tim QuinsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-way-slow-climate-change-090021896.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-09-16	2019-09-16 13:58:24	UL	Unilever PLC	We Need to Get Serious About the Sustainability of Shopify Stock’s Growth	If there was any doubt to the power of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and its e-commerce business, SHOP stock removed it all. At a time when we have so many questions about the viability of the domestic and global economies, SHOP represents the bright beacon of hope. Since the start of the year, shares have jumped an astonishing 146%.Source: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com Even more remarkable, Shopify stock had slowed down noticeably last year. Once the dust settled on a volatile end to 2018, shares of the upstart e-commerce firm were only up 36%. That gave ammunition to the bears -- including yours truly -- to criticize the company's business model. At the time, it also seemed like the bubble was bursting, given that SHOP stock skyrocketed 133% in 2017.Of course, I was dead wrong about Shopify stock. Part of the reason why shares have done so remarkably well in 2019 was due to the fundamentals, the very thing that bears have criticized. For example, in the company's most recent second-quarter earnings report, management knocked it out of the park.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn terms of per-share profitability, SHOP delivered earnings of 14 cents per share. That figure easily surpassed analysts' consensus call for earnings-per-share of 2 cents. On the revenue front, Shopify rang up $362 million, besting consensus estimates for $350 million. Not surprisingly, SHOP stock flew substantially higher on the news.Additionally, the granularity was also very positive in Q2. For instance, gross merchandise volume (GMV) hit $13.8 billion, shooting Merchant Solutions revenue up 56% year-over-year to $153 million. Also, the number of merchants is over 800,000 (although Shopify didn't specify in their Q2 summary).  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy All in all, that's tremendous news for Shopify stock, right? Not so fast. SHOP Stock Is a Deceptively Attractive InvestmentOn the surface, it seems you can't lose with Shopify stock. For one thing, it's levered to the broader e-commerce revolution that drove up names like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). More importantly, they're demonstrating that more merchants are boarding the Shopify train.For the bulls, the below chart represents one of many reasons why they're excited about SHOP stock. Whether you're talking about the price of shares or corporate revenue or GMV and merchant count, several metrics are exercising the positive end of the vertical scale.  Click to EnlargeBut while it's crucial to have the right numbers moving higher, the reality is that context matters. And this is where some of the optimistic narrative for SHOP stock dies down for me.While Wall Street toasted Shopify stock for the underlying company producing another strong earnings report, I was left wondering what they were talking about. Principally, I don't see the same sustainable growth story that has tickled the suits covering the e-commerce firm.Let's break down what we actually have here. Over the trailing year since Q2 2019, Shopify merchants have generated GMV of $49.7 billion. Although I don't have the actual merchant figure, I'm going to conservatively estimate that they have 870,000 stores. That gives me an average annual GMV per merchant of $57,126.That's probably a bit on the high end. For instance, in 2014, annual GMV per merchant was $26,061. A year later, this metric increased to $31,399. Between 2016 and 2017, GMV per merchant averaged just under $42,000. Last year, the stat registered $50,122.  Click to EnlargeMy question is, what business can survive on gross sales of $50,000 a year? In the U.S., the median household income is $56,516.You're better off working for a living, which means the rally in SHOP stock is probably not sustainable. Follow the LogicOf course, calculating averages is merely an arithmetic exercise. In reality, we know that merchants can't live off of $50,000 a year. Just off the top of my head, I can think of overhead expenses and inventory outlays. These and other costs and expenses can really start eating into profits in a hurry.  * 7 Hot Penny Stocks to Consider Now Logically, then, we know that Shopify gets the bulk of its GMVs from its top-tier, high-level merchants. We're talking about the names that management always brags about in their quarterly summaries, such as Unilever (NYSE:UL), Kylie Cosmetics, Allbirds, and MVMT.What about the other 869,996 merchants? Well, most of them will fail because they have to. Mathematically, if the lion's share of GMVs are produced by a handful of elite organizations, that leaves very little for everybody else. And that means, revenue sources like Merchant Solutions are threatened because they could drop off as the merchants do.Plus, if we have a recession, it's game over. There's no way that merchants making far less than $50,000 a year can compete with the scale of big-box retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) or Target (NYSE:TGT).Don't get me wrong: SHOP stock can get interesting at a lower valuation. But right now, it has simply gotten well ahead of itself.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-11	2019-09-11 09:53:49	UL	Unilever PLC	Naspers Unit Soars in Debut to Close Discount With Tencent	(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.Naspers Ltd.’s newly listed internet unit received an enthusiastic early response from investors, soaring on its trading debut to close a valuation discount to its biggest investment, Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd.Prosus NV, as the new Amsterdam-listed company is known, jumped as much as 32% in early trading to value the business at about 125 billion euros ($138 billion). The group’s 31% stake in WeChat creator Tencent is worth about $131 billion, the result of a timely investment made almost two decades ago.The investor reaction is an early vindication of the strategy masterminded by Naspers Chief Executive Officer Bob van Dijk, who took the helm of the Cape Town-based company five years ago. His plan to carve out Prosus into a new listing in Amsterdam was designed to attract a more global investor base and realize more value, while weakening the group’s dominance over the Johannesburg stock exchange.The move to Euronext is “to facilitate our next phase of growth,” Van Dijk said in an interview with Bloomberg TV just after the market opened. Prosus’s classified-ads business is the largest in the world, while the group also sees fast expansion in internet payments, food delivery and online trading in second-hand goods, he said.While the discount to Tencent was all but wiped out, the firm is still trading below the sum of its parts when you add other assets, including shareholdings in Russia’s Mail.Ru Group Ltd. and Delivery Hero SE of Germany. Van Dijk’s next challenge will be to generate higher returns from those investments and prove that Prosus isn’t merely a proxy for holding Tencent stock.“Our next step will be to bed down and invest in our core business units,” Chief Financial Officer Basil Sgourdos said by phone.Shares in Prosus -- a Latin word meaning ‘forwards’ -- declined slightly after the early surge. The value as of 11:28 a.m. in Amsterdam was 121 billion euros, making it the third-largest publicly traded company in the Netherlands, behind Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Unilever NV. Its market value rivals that of Europe’s biggest tech company, Germany’s SAP SE.Naspers is retaining a 73% stake in Prosus, and will keep hold of South African businesses including the newspapers that form the basis of the company’s origins a century ago. Its stock rose in Johannesburg, trading 5.4% higher as of 11:28 a.m. local time.“Naspers has been looking to unlock value in the steep discount applied to its Tencent holding and the successful listing of Prosus today has certainly gone some way to achieving that target,” said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. “Prosus is not only the Tencent holding though.”(Updates with CFO comment in sixth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Swetha Gopinath, Anna Edwards, Matthew Miller and Kit Rees.To contact the reporters on this story: Loni Prinsloo in Johannesburg at lprinsloo3@bloomberg.net;John Bowker in Johannesburg at jbowker2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Thomas Pfeiffer at tpfeiffer3@bloomberg.net, Jennifer RyanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/naspers-internet-business-soars-europe-081723613.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-30	2019-08-30 09:00:11	UL	Unilever PLC	The Stock Market Has Become a Very Liberal Place	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Wall Street was a very conservative place politically when I started working in the capital markets in 1999, but it seems to have lurched to the left lately. It’s not only that many of the people who work there have become more liberal, but more importantly, left-leaning behavior by publicly traded companies is being rewarded by the stock market.The decision by the Business Roundtable, which is an organization led by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, to explicitly state that the purpose of a publicly traded company is social responsibility and not creating value for shareholders is just the latest example of this lurch to the left. For decades, most public companies have chosen to remain politically neutral. That remained the case even after the Citizens United Supreme Court decision on campaign finance in 2010 that held that the free speech clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for political communications by corporations. Most expected the Citizens United decision to result in conservative political speech, but it has been quite the opposite. Ben and Jerry’s, a unit of Unilever Plc, recently launched a flavor of ice cream designed specifically to support Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign.Nike Inc.’s shares are up about 36% since the start of 2018, compared with 9.20% for the S&P 500 Index, despite backlash from some conservative outlets for signing controversial former National Football League quarterback Colin Kaepernick to a marketing deal and then bowing to pressure from the left and pulling its special edition sneakers featuring the “Betsy Ross Flag” that some feel was a symbol of racism. I was recently in a Nike outlet store here in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and it was packed with a checkout line 30 people deep in the middle of summer.The technology sector leans to the left, led by Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., whose Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post. Many consumers may complain about the liberal orientation of these companies, but there is not a lot they can do to avoid them. Sure, share prices of tech firms have stalled lately, but that’s more likely due to the threat of antitrust action than a reflection of their political orientation.The list of companies who have engaged in left-leaning speech, marketing or protest is getting long. The list of actions include pulling advertising from various Fox News programs, supporting the Women’s March, pulling products related to President Donald Trump from stores and banks dropping business with the certain gun makers. There have been few consequences, and no serious boycotts of these companies by conservatives, or at least none have been effective. Conservative media outlets had some fun with Procter & Gamble Co.’s $8 billion charge for Gillette, attributing it to backlash from an ad campaign asking men to “do better.” But the razor business has been bad for a while, with competitive threats coming from all sides. And more men are growing beards these days, so one is probably not related to the other.Corporate America may have declared a political orientation for strategic reasons. Companies today have more data and information than ever on their customers. What works for Nike may not work for Bass Pro Shops.Then there’s the waterfall of money that is earmarked for environment, social and governance, or ESG, investing strategies. It is the only form of active management that seems to be gathering assets even with a mixed track record when it comes to returns. The idea here is that companies engaging in socially responsible behavior should be rewarded by the stock market, but that isn’t always true. Indexing is widely considered to be a left-wing philosophy, the idea that you would invest in all companies equally, instead of trying to pick the best stocks. It has even famously been called worse than Marxism by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. As everyone knows, index fund assets have been growing at an astronomical pace. By some estimates, passive strategies now make up 40% to 50% of all assets under management, and it shows no signs of slowing down. Even actively managed funds with great performance are losing assets.We’ve come a long way from suspender-snapping, bull and bear cufflinks and “lunch is for wimps.” Back then, the idea that you would invest your money and not seek the highest return would have seemed odd.I assume that decisions to engage in political speech are carefully considered by managements, but I still find it disconcerting. I’m from a generation that grew up believing the job of a public company was to “make money,” not “do good.”  When they both align, then great, but what hasn’t changed is that people still like to see the value of their investments go up every year.To contact the author of this story: Jared Dillian at j.dillian@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Robert Burgess at bburgess@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Jared Dillian is the editor and publisher of The Daily Dirtnap, investment strategist at Mauldin Economics, and the author of &quot;Street Freak&quot; and &quot;All the Evil of This World.&quot; He may have a stake in the areas he writes about.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-become-very-liberal-090011404.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 05:00:00	UL	Unilever PLC	Spanish Uber Rival Eyes Supermarkets as Consolidation Looms	(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.A Spanish startup best known for delivering takeaways is betting on building a network of convenience stores to expand its business -- just as the food delivery sector eyes a wave of consolidation.Glovo, a Barcelona-based web platform used mainly for ordering food from restaurants, is rolling-out so-called dark-supermarkets -- delivery-only convenience stores -- from Tbilisi to Lisbon in an attempt to tap into growing web-based demand for groceries.The company is also focusing on delivering groceries for existing supermarket chains. In May it announced a deal with Carrefour SA to handle their deliveries in under 30 minutes in four countries, and it has similar partnerships in different countries with Walmart Inc., Auchan Holding Sadir and Kaufland Stiftung & Co KG, among others.Glovo drew preliminary interest from Uber Technologies Inc. and Deliveroo, Bloomberg reported in August. The startup is in 180 cities spread across 24 countries, according to its website.But the company is increasingly marketing itself as an &quot;app for anything&quot; that allows users to request a rider -- as the delivery staff, who mainly ride bicycles, are known -- to buy any product. With this function, a user can send a rider to any store to pick up a product and the price is charged directly to the user’s credit card, together with a fixed service fee.Competitors are increasingly moving into delivering groceries alongside restaurant-delivery. Uber Eats has piloted delivery goods from Nestle and Unilever, and said in July that it’s in discussions with European supermarkets to roll out a grocery delivery service. Amazon.com Inc. is growing its grocery store delivery operations in several countries including Spain, one of its first markets.Germany’s Delivery Hero SE is already offering transport of consumer items such as groceries and toiletries in 12 markets and plans to raise that number in the coming months, Chief Executive Officer Niklas Oestberg said last month.Demand for online groceries in Europe’s largest economies set to grow by about 60% between 2018 and 2023, to more than $45.1 billion, according to estimates compiled by Delta Partners, a consultancy.Unlike online grocery shoppers such as U.K.’s Ocado Group Plc, which delivers weekly purchases the following day, Glovo is targeting small baskets at speed. Such deliveries are simply the latest twist in the “anything&quot; strategy, according to co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Oscar Pierre, a wiry 26-year-old aeronautical engineer who started the company in 2015, shortly after a short stint working for airplane manufacturer Airbus SE.“The app aims to allow users to buy whatever they need from their phone&quot;, says Pierre.Glovo’s main food-delivery competitor in Latin America, Rappi, recently received an $800 million investment from two SoftBank units, the Vision Fund and the smaller, Latin America-focused Innovation Fund. Glovo is also in talks to receive an investment from SoftBank’s Vision Fund, after raising 150 million euros in a round earlier this year.To contact the reporter on this story: Rodrigo Orihuela in Madrid at rorihuela@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Stefan NicolaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spanish-uber-rival-eyes-supermarkets-050000637.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-08-26	2019-08-26 10:20:05	UL	Unilever PLC	Naspers Says Prosus Unit to Be Valued at About $100 Billion	(Bloomberg) -- Naspers Ltd. said a newly created entity containing assets including a stake in Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. will be valued at about $100 billion.Africa’s largest company by market value received shareholder backing last week to proceed with the listing of Prosus NV in Amsterdam next month. Alongside the Tencent stake, the new company will hold businesses from Brazil to Germany in industries such as online food delivery and classified advertising.A value of $100 billion would make only Royal Dutch Shell Plc and consumer-goods giant Unilever bigger in Amsterdam by market capitalization. The company would overtake ASML Holding NV, a semiconductor gear-maker priced at about 80 billion euros ($89 billion).Naspers opted to spin off Prosus -- in which it will keep a 73% stake -- to ease its dominance of Johannesburg’s stock exchange and help reduce a valuation gap between the Cape Town-based company and its stake in Tencent. The new group’s assets were valued at about $34 billion as of end June, Naspers said in a statement on Monday.Naspers Looks to Invest in AI as Prosus Listing ApprovedNaspers shares erased gains after the publication of the anticipated market value of Prosus, and traded 0.1% higher at 3,421.11 rand as of 11:52 a.m. in Johannesburg.The stock could gain by a further 40% to 4,800 rand, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by JP Davids said in a note published Monday. “In addition to Tencent’s outperformance, we expect the recent compression in the holding company’s discount to be sustained as it reduces its South African sovereign exposure.”Prosus had net income of about $1.4 billion for the three months through June, compared with $1.1 billion the previous year, Naspers said.JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are the main financial advisers on the Prosus listing.(Updates with Amsterdam ranking in third paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Joost Akkermans.To contact the reporters on this story: Loni Prinsloo in Johannesburg at lprinsloo3@bloomberg.net;Renee Bonorchis in Johannesburg at rbonorchis@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rebecca Penty at rpenty@bloomberg.net, John Bowker, Frank ConnellyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/naspers-says-prosus-unit-valued-102005206.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-10	2019-07-10 17:55:21	UL	Unilever PLC	Is Shopify Stock Getting Ahead of Its Fundamentals?	Investors in online marketplace Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), one of Canada's best tech names, have enjoyed the stock's stellar move up  in 2019; so far this year,  SHOP stock has soared 133%. On June 20, the Shopify stock reached an all-time high of $338.94.Source: Shopify via FlickrShopify is expected to report its second-quarter earnings on July 30. Now that SHOP's earnings are approaching, let's look at what may be next for SHOP stock, which has been a darling of Wall Street since its IPO in 2015. SHOP's Q1 Earnings and BackgroundOn Apr. 30, SHOP reported strong Q1 results that beat analysts' average estimates on both the top and bottom line, thanks to strong demand for its subscription solutions. Shopify reported revenues of $320.4 million, which was up almost 50% year-on-year. Its net loss came in at $24.2 million.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019 In a nutshell, Shopify sells out-of-the-box e-commerce solutions. The company's growth comes from two segments: &quot;Merchant Solutions&quot; and &quot;Subscription Solutions.&quot;Merchant Solutions includes tools that enable merchants to serve their customers better and sell more products. Within Merchant Solutions, SHOP offers payment services, shipping services, and a working capital management tool.Subscription Solutions offer merchants of all sizes monthly recurring subscription plans that cost from under $10 to over $2,000 per month. SHOP now has over 800,000 sellers, an increase of 25% over the past year.Shopify Plus, the premium version of Shopify, has over 5,300 customers, including names like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Unilever (NYSE:UL), and the Obama Foundation.A quarter of the company's monthly recurring revenues comes from Shopify Plus merchants.  SHOP has recently launched a multi-currency feature for Shopify Plus merchants who also use Shopify Payments.During the Q1 earnings conference call, CEO Tobi Lutke stressed that SHOP would continue to innovate and launch new products and services for both merchants and their customers. Wall Street also expects the company to continue to grow via acquisitions. Shopify Stock's Global GrowthManagement has also been looking at expanding overseas, especially in non-English-speaking countries, as the company's next key growth area.  In Q1, the company's overseas customer base grew, enabling its international revenue growth to accelerate.Earlier in the year, Shopify launched its payment gateway, Shopify Payments, in Germany, making bank account transfers possible there. Several of Canada's provinces have used Shopify to launch online cannabis stores, giving Shopify even more global visibility.In its efforts to expand beyond the core English-speaking countries, the company has recently made the Shopify website available in six other languages: French, German, Japanese, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish; the website is soon expected to be available in 11 languages.In other words, Shopify is an attractive company with excellent growth prospects in cloud-based e-commerce , both in North America and globally. However, investors also need to be aware of some question marks facing SHOP stock. Should Investors Be Concerned About the Valuation of SHOP Stock?SHOP stock bears point out that, given the high valuation of Shopify stock, the shares would be hit hard if a recession occurs. Even if the stock market does not go up as rapidly as it has over the past decade, then the momentum of high-flying names like SHOP stock will slow down, too.For example, SHOP stocks's price-sales (P/S) ratio is high enough to make value investors run for cover. Shopify stock's P/S ratio stands at about 30. To put the metric into perspective, the S&P 500's average price-sales ratio is 2.1.Another way to look at this number is to compare the company's current  P/S ratio with its P/S ratios over time. Since going public, SHOP stock'a lowest and highest P/S level has respectively been 6.86 and 30.In other words, at present, its P/S ratio is at its highest level ever. That essentially means that the owners of SHOP stock are paying a lot more for Shopify stock now than they were when the P/S ratio was 6.Another way to analyze the P/S ratio is to compare it with the ratios of  companies in similar sectors. The P/S ratio of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is four. Alibaba's (NASDAQ:BABA), P/S ratio stands at eight. And MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) stock's P/S is 17.Although the P/S ratio of SHOP stock is very high, investors should also remember that it is only one of many valuation metrics. Moreover,  it does not take into account the profitability or costs of Shopify. What Else Could Derail SHOP Stock?SHOP bulls are happy to point out that the company's revenue growth is showing no sign of slowing down.But on the other hand, Shopify has not yet reported any profits.  If SHOP cannot keep meeting the Street's aggressive growth forecasts, then the owners of SHOP stock may become more concerned about its lack of profit, and Shopify stock could drop.During Q1, SHOP launched its TV and film content division, Shopify Studios, Wall Street is debating why Shopify has decided to create such content. And in June, SHOP announced that it would be launching a fulfillment network and offer two-day shipping across 99% of the continental U.S. Analysts believe this ambitious strategy is likely to be quite costly for Shopify.Instead of focusing on profits, management wants to expand the company by launching new businesses. Therefore, those who plan to own SHOP stock over the long-term  need to pay attention to the cash flows from its new ventures.Many investors have been quite concerned about the various reports by short seller Citron Research which regards Shopify's business model as a &quot;get-rich-quick-scheme.&quot; Moreover, several analysts have recently downgraded SHOP stock in response to its stellar bull run.Finally, those investors who follow short-term technical charts will be interested to know that Shopify stock has spent a good portion of 2019 in overbought territory. It is possible that some profit-taking will negatively impact SHOP stock in the near future, possibly prior to its Q2 earnings report. The Bottom Line on Shopify StockIn a few weeks, SHOP stock is likely to release another strong quarterly report. However,  SHOP stock is simply too expensive for me to hit the &quot;buy&quot; button on it at these levels.SHOP is a growth stock and a speculative stock. Therefore, in the coming weeks, I expect SHOP to be a battleground between investors and traders. While long-term investors would like to see Shopify stock go over the $350 level, traders are likely to keep it between $300 and $250.Those who have benefited from SHOP's  2019 gains should possibly consider taking profits as we look ahead to the next earnings report.Well-performing stocks tend to keep on winning, and the recent strength of Shopify stock might be a good indication that within three or four years, investors who buy SHOP on weakness are likely to be rewarded handsomely.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-03	2019-07-03 17:40:48	UL	Unilever PLC	5 Dividend Stocks to Buy From Across the Globe	Most income seekers and retirees have a sort of set playbook when it comes to dividend stocks. They either buy an exchange-traded fund that's heavy in dividend stocks like the iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:DGRO) or they stick to a few well-known dividend stocks like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). And there's nothing wrong with that approach. You certainly can get plenty of income and total return potential from going this route. But income seekers may want to move outside their comfort zone.Specifically, I'm talking about dividend investments that are outside of the U.S.The truth is, some of the best dividend stocks can be found outside the United States. The world is filled with a variety of strong multinational and international leaders. Even better is that valuations for many global stocks are lower than the U.S., while dividend yields are higher.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe yield on the internationally focused MSCI EAFE Index is about double that of the S&P 500. That should be music to an income seeker or retirees' ears.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice In the end, going global can result in some wonderful dividends stocks. With that, here are five international dividend stocks to buy today. Unilever (UL, UN)Dividend Yield: 2.96%Suave soap, Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, Q-tips … these are all brands most people are familiar with. In fact, you probably use some of these brands yourself. That goes to show just how powerful and big Unilever (NYSE:UL, NYSE:UN) is. The firm is a consumer products powerhouse and features 400 different brands and sales in more than 190 different countries.This portfolio of brands continues to pay some big results for UL and its bottom line. Sales continue to rise, jumping 3.1% during the first half of the year. That's not bad for a firm the size of Unilever. The firm has more than 10 brands that generate more than $1 billion in annual sales. So, this is a big ship. Moreover, emerging markets make up a ton of those sales. Here, UL continues to see plenty of growth and high single-digit sale boosts.The future looks rosy for Unilever as well. The firm has announced that it's doing away with its Anglo-Dutch dual share listing and moving to a single share structure. This will reduce costs. Moreover, the firm has undergone some strategic reviews and it has pruned itself of underperforming brands to improve margins and profits.All of this will translate into continued dividend strength. Since moving to a quarterly payout back in 2010, UL has managed to boost its payout by around 90%. This is a testament to its huge portfolio of brands and continued rising sales.Today, Unilever yields nearly 3% making it a top dividend stock to buy. Royal Bank of Canada (RY)Dividend Yield: 3.8%One of the most under-owned nations on the planet happens to be our neighbors to the North. For some reason, Canada isn't included in many international indexes. That's a real shame as the country features plenty of leading dividend stocks and multinational giants.This includes banking giant, the Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY).Historically, Canada's banks have been more conservatively run than U.S. ones. This has been the case for RY for decades. The firm's continued focus on risk management has allowed it to skate through various financial downturns relatively unscathed. Both the Great Recession and the recent Oil Bust didn't affect the bank's bottom line or financial position. This fact has allowed RBC to pay dividends for more than 100 years and keep its payout steady during both crises.But RY isn't a stodgy, old fuddy-duddy. In fact, Canada's banks were some of the first to embrace consumer technology, mobile banking, apps and A.I. Partnerships with tech for its small businesses, enterprise and wealth management divisions have directly boosted retention and overall usage, with digital payments at the bank are surging. All of these digital initiatives have paid off in a big way -- with RY now realizing more than $15 billion in annual revenues. The best part is that RBC now expects to pull in three times the number of new clients as a result of these moves. That'll only grow its base even more.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for A Summer Rally For dividend seekers, RY blends the best of both stable revenues with a huge upshot to its growth. With a near-4% yield, it could be one of the best dividend stocks to buy today. GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) Dividend Yield: 5.14%When it comes to dividend stocks, Big Pharma offers some of the biggest yields. And the U.K.'s GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK) offers a juicy 5.14% payout. GSK features a robust portfolio of consumer healthcare products with brands such as Aquafresh, Nicorette and Theraflu under its umbrella. However, the firm is also a prescription drug powerhouse with several blockbusters under its belt. Likewise, it has a huge vaccine business that it contains to generate steady revenues.All of this has made GSK a big-time dividend player throughout its history. As a U.K. company, GSK sends out a percentage of profits twice a year, so the amount varies. But it has been steady and consistent.But dividend and growth seekers have a lot to like about GlaxoSmithKline. That's because GSK is currently merging its consumer health division with Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE). This separate company will feature a massive portfolio of brands and produce plenty of stable cash flows. Meanwhile, the remaining biopharma company will feature a robust pipeline of new cancer fighters and other drugs. Investors will be able to get the best of both worlds -- growth and income -- from GSK.Buying GSK today, investors get a seat at the table and the ability to score a high yield. BP PLC (BP)Dividend Yield: 5.85%For a long time, BP (NYSE:BP) was the whipping boy of the energy patch. The Deepwater Horizon spill was horrific and cost billions upon billions of dollars in legal fees, damages and fines. Because of that, BP was pretty much dead for years. But lately, the energy giant has returned to its former glory days … at least in terms of dividends and growth.Thanks to the costs related to the spill, BP was forced to become &quot;lean and mean.&quot; That meant selling underperforming and non-core assets, spinning out its logistics infrastructure and reducing its overall debt load. All of this has made the firm a much better run energy stock than before. The results of this made themselves known last summer, when BP actually started to pull in some serious cash flows, Now, BP's operating cash flows currently cover its CAPEX spending and dividend payments when oil is around $50 per barrel.However, with continued technology improvements, BP estimates it should reduce its breakeven price to about $35 per barrel by 2021. With new major finds in the Gulf of Mexico, an increase in onshore shale drilling and other moves, BP is back on the prowl. Since suspending its dividend during the spill, BP has been able to increase its payout by 47% and completely end its so-called script dividend program, which paid investors shares rather than cash.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks With Critical Levels to Watch With a near-6% yield, BP makes a strong contender for investors looking for international dividend stocks. iShares International Dividend Growth ETF (IGRO)Dividend Yield: 2.87%Perhaps the best way to get a dose of international dividends is to own them all. We mentioned the popular DGRO ETF in the opening slide. That fund also has an international sister -- the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IGRO).Similar to DGRO, IGRO tracks a basket of international dividend stocks. The key for the ETF is that it's not just about the payout, but the ability to grow that payout over time. The ETF's index screens for stocks that have been increasing dividends for at least five years straight. A second screen is used to ensure that firms aren't overreaching their ability to pay. Stocks with payout ratios of above 75% are removed. This leaves you with a basket of 408 different dividend stocks. There is some emerging market exposure, but developed markets garner the bulk of assets.Top holdings include pharma giant Sanofi (NYSE:SNY), consumer products superstar Nestle and tech firm Samsung.In terms of performance, IGRO hasn't been bad. The ETF is relatively new -- only opening shop in mid-2016. Since then, it has managed to produce a near-7% return annually. That's not too shabby. Moreover, IGRO yields a very healthy 2.87%. And as a member of iShares core group of funds, expenses for the ETF run at a dirt cheap 0.22%.All in all, when it comes to getting broad exposure to international dividend stocks, IGRO could be one of the best and cheapest ways.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-13	2019-06-13 11:50:14	UL	Unilever PLC	Nelson Peltz Likes the Look of American Plumbing	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Nelson Peltz’s latest investment target is a big, slow-moving target with a massive bullseye on its back. The renowned U.S. activist has zoned in on Ferguson Plc, a plumbers’ merchant formerly known as Wolseley. His gripe is that the company trades at a stubborn discount to American peers. The snag is that remedies aren’t easy to administer.Ferguson is among the handful of U.K.-domiciled, London-listed blue-chips that aren’t really British companies. Some – such as BTG Plc or Firstgroup Plc – have already attracted takeover or activist interest. North America generates 87% of Ferguson’s revenue; the company recently changed its name to that of its U.S. subsidiary; it reports in dollars.The one un-American characteristic is the valuation. Ferguson has traded at a consistent discount to U.S. peers such as Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos Inc. The obvious explanation is that the company is listed on the wrong exchange, which makes it harder to attract its natural investor base. But that’s not the only interpretation. The valuation may also reflect a lack of faith in Ferguson’s strategy or management, or some challenges unique to its business. Either way, the discount slightly narrowed on Thursday after the disclosure that various Peltz funds had amassed a 6% stake. This pushed the stock up 6%, valuing the group at 13 billion pounds ($16 billion).It is hard to know whether Ferguson would get a higher valuation if it just moved its listing. Markets may not be 100% efficient, but capital is global and location can’t be the only explanation for the lack of investor love here. True, some funds are restricted geographically in where they can put money but that’s unlikely to be a huge factor in holding back demand for Ferguson shares.Such restrictions on funds might, though, be an obstacle to engineering a move for Ferguson. Unilever Plc’s plan to simplify its Anglo-Dutch structure into a single Netherlands company would have seen it lose its spot on the FTSE 100. That irked index investors and those with mandates to hold U.K. stocks who would have been forced to sell their shares. The plan foundered.Unilever wasn’t a one-off. Re-domiciling headquarters or listings has long been controversial. The textbook case is the thwarted migration of car parts maker LucasVarity back in the late 1990s from the U.K. to the U.S. For these changes, existing investors generally demand a premium. The cleanest way to achieve a move is to take the company private, then relist it.More pertinent are worries about the company’s resilience in the face of a U.S. slowdown. U.S. organic growth is slowing from a recent high single-digit percentage clip, while margins have barely improved since 2015, UBS analysts point out. The share price seems to be assuming that Ferguson’s long-run sustainable operating margin is just 5%, according to independent research provider Willis Welby, which argues that this is overly pessimistic.Peltz’s pitch is that he likes to engage with the management of his portfolio companies. Ferguson has responded diplomatically that it looks forward to dialogue, as it does with all shareholders. The mere presence of such a big name has got people excited. The tougher job will be convincing investors that the company’s equity story – twinning organic growth with a strategy of acquiring competitors – is still a winner. That case has yet to be made.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

In his first interview since taking the top job at the £140bn company, Mr Jope signalled that the centre of gravity at the Anglo-Dutch group would shift further from food to the higher-margin beauty and personal care market.  “This year we’ve set the guidance in the 3 to 4 per cent range, and I would hope that next year we would start to edge that up,” Mr Jope said.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ab4297ea-191c-34ef-acbe-c6a278d31fbd/new-unilever-ceo-jope-banks.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-05	2019-06-05 20:55:48	UL	Unilever PLC	101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond	Dependable dividend stocks that routinely grow their payouts are welcome in any environment. But they seem especially attractive nowadays.Stock market volatility is back with a vengeance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went from powering ahead to an all-time high of 26,828 on Oct. 3 to losing 8% in the span of about three weeks. These kinds of rocky markets tend to give investors motion sickness. But they can add a dose of Dramamine to their portfolios - in the form of reliable dividend-growth stocks.&quot;Dividend growers, which tend to be quality companies, have generally shown greater resilience in unsteady markets and could address concerns about dividend stocks in a rising-rate environment,&quot; write Tianyin Cheng, director of strategy and ESG Indices at S&P; Dow Jones Indices; and Vinit Srivastava, head of strategy and ESG indices at S&P; Dow Jones Indices. &quot;This argument applies to not only to the U.S. large-cap space, but it also extends to small- and mid-cap segments and international markets.&quot;Dividend stocks - both at home and abroad - with long track records of rock-solid rising payments tend to generate superior returns over long periods of time and can help investors weather shorter periods of market turbulence.This is a look at the most reliable long-term dividend stocks in the world. Dubbed the &quot;Dividend Aristocrats,&quot; they have raised dividends for at least five straight years (Canadian firms), 10 years (E.U.-based firms) or 25 years (U.S. companies). Such stocks provide reliable and rising income streams - and a sense of security that will help you sleep better at night. We've listed them here alphabetically; take a look.

2019-05-09	2019-05-09 14:37:40	UL	Unilever PLC	Adobe Stock Is a Good Long-Term Investment	Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) continues to prove why it is one of Wall Street's favorite investments. On March 15, the creative software maker announced strong Q1 results as the company delivered broad-based sales growth, lifting Adobe stock. Specifically, ADBE reported record revenue of $2.6 billion, up 25% year-over-year.Source: Shutterstock A big winner over the past several years, ADBE still remains on track to produce consistent growth for the foreseeable future. However, this week has once again reminded investors what volatility due to political uncertainty, such as the U.S-China trade wars, may mean for their portfolios. Therefore Adobe stock price might be weak in  the short-term, especially between now and June 18, when the company is slated to report its Q2 earnings.  * 7 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Stay Far Away From  Adobe Stock Thrives on Strong FundamentalsADBE reports the revenue of two of its segments: Digital Media and Digital Experience.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Digital Media segment includes revenues from Adobe Creative Cloud (CC) and Adobe Document Cloud. In recent years, Creative Cloud's revenues have increased by high double-digit percentage levels, driven by increases in subscriptions by both B2C and B2B customers  In Q1, the Digital Media segment's revenue was $1.78 billion, while Creative's revenue jumped to $1.49 billion and Document Cloud reached record revenue of $282 million.The Digital Experience segment includes Adobe Experience Cloud, which offers a range of cloud-based tools for marketing, advertising, analytics and content management. Customers use these tools to better manage their marketing initiatives. This segment has been been adding more enterprise customers to its ecosystem. Its Q1 revenue rose 34% year-over-year to $743 million.Many analysts agree that Adobe's 2018 acquisition of Marketo, a marketing software and e-commerce platform, as well as Magento Commerce, a market-leading e-commerce platform, has helped ADBE grow its market share in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and become a digital-marketing platform leader.Going forward, ADBE has enough cash on hand to finance more potential acquisitions to fuel the growth of its digital-experience segment. ADBE's Subscription Model Has Boosted Adobe Stock PriceAdobe's flagship software products for video, graphic and audio content creation include Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat and Dreamveawer. In 2012, when Adobe first announced that it had switched from a software- licensing model for Adobe Creative Cloud to a monthly subscription-based model, Wall Street was not sure as to how this radical approach would affect Adobe stock price.Overall, Adobe offers powerful solutions that face little competition. As a result,  many customers decided to move to Adobe's subscription cloud solutions because there was no real alternative. The subscription model has enabled Adobe to achieve high gross margins and  raise its prices without losing customers.Fast forward to 2019, and investors realize that the significant risk that Adobe has taken has paid off: Users, the company and investors are all happy with the subscription model.Users always  have the latest versions of Adobe's software, ADBE does not have to persuade customers to buy a newer version every few years, and the owners of Adobe stock have been thrilled with its recurring, stable income;, asabout 85% of ADBE's revenue now comes from subscriptions.As ADBE offers more cloud-based products, Wall Street is expecting the company's dominance and revenue  to grow. So far, most of ADBE's revenue has come from the U.S. But Wall Street believes the company can easily grow its businesses in both Asia and Europe, adding to the current $3 billion of annual revenue that ADBE obtains from these regions.Investors also believe that Adobe will be able to push deeper into customer relationship management (CRM) through Sensei, its artificial intelligence (AI) platform, boosting its top line and Adobe stock . Adobe's Partnership With MicrosoftAdobe's strengths are not limited to its robust financial results. Management has also been taking important steps to make the company a  leader in the content-creation space.Since 2016, Adobe has had a powerful  partnership with Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud business, Azure. The two companies work together to provide cloud-based data to enterprises.Additionally, Adobe's Experience Cloud and Microsoft's Dynamics CRM platform will be integrated with Microsoft's LinkedIn. Pooling Adobe platform's data with Microsoft's tools could cause the gains of Adobe stock to accelerate.The strong and unique collaboration between Adobe and Microsoft has  fueled rumors that Microsoft may purchase Adobe as early as 2020. Many analysts increasingly believe that Microsoft is looking at Adobe as more than just a partner. If MSFT does buy ADBE, the owners of Adobe stock are likely to be rewarded handsomely. The Bottom Line on Adobe StockADBE is the dominant player in  the cloud-based software market. Adobe stock is a winning name that many investors are likely to stick with. Within two to three years, investors who buy Adobe stock are likely to be rewarded handsomely. By then, ADBE  could become a takeover target.Tech stocks may continue to be volatile in May, and I would not advocate trying to identify stocks that could be immune to a U.S.-China trade war. In the past few trading days, ADBE stock price is down almost 10%.But if Adobe stock price declines further, long-term investors may find Adobe stock particularly attractive. I believe Adobe stock price  is likely to find major support between $250 and $260.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-18	2019-04-18 15:14:08	UL	Unilever PLC	Now Is the Right Time to Buy Kraft Heinz Stock	Kraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC) CEO Bernardo Hees, who gained notoriety on Wall Street as a cost-cutter, will now have to figure out how to invest money into the beleaguered packaged food company if its long-suffering shareholders ever hope to get any relief.Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrUnfortunately, Hees won't be able to just write a check to make KHC's problems go away. Like other packaged food companies, KHC has been hurt by the rising consumer demand for &quot;fresh and healthy&quot; ingredients at the expense of processed food. New York-based KHC made matters worse by making unrealistic forecasts for the savings of its 2015 merger, which loaded its balance sheet with more than $31 billion in debt.   Plunging Share PriceKHC stock has plunged more than 64% since Unilever (NYSE:UL) rejected the company's unsolicited $143 billion offer. The stock was further bloodied by its recent announcement of disappointing earnings, a $15 billion write-down, a dividend cut and an SEC investigation into its accounting practices. S&P recently announced that it was reviewing KHC's debt for a possible downgrade after the company missed the deadline to file its annual report (form 10-K) with the Securities & Exchange Commission.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDuring the company's earnings conference call, Hees tried to reassure investors that he was willing to deploy capital where it's needed. Hees is also is a partner with 3G Capital, the Brazilian private equity that owned Heinz and arranged with Warren Buffett for the merger with Kraft.    * 6 Cheap Stocks That Cost Less Than $10 &quot;In a nutshell, we plan to go to market in 2019 with a stronger innovation pipeline than we ever had, backed by more marketing dollars while leveraging advantaged category managed and go-to-market initiatives to win assortment and improve distribution across all channels, including e-commerce,&quot; He said. &quot;And we plan to do this while we maintain industry-leading margins.&quot;Easier said than done since KHC clearly fired too many workers and damaged its brands, damage which won't be easy or cheap to fix.The company is trying to clean up the mess Hees helped create. According to media reports, Kraft Heinz is reviewing strategic options for its Maxwell House Coffee business including a possible sale and may dispose of other well-known brands such as Breakstone's Cottage Cheese and sour cream.  Selling off poorly performing businesses is a step in the right direction though it isn't a substitute for a business strategy.  The Oracle of OmahaIndeed, the growth through acquisitions approach isn't the answer for KHC. According to CNBC, the company passed on bidding for Pinnacle Foods and failed to make a compelling offer for Campbell Soup when it was being shopped around last year.  KHC stock deserves to be in Wall Street's penalty box but it's not going to be in their forever. The company has a major fan in Buffett, who recently described the company as a &quot;fabulous&quot; business though he admitted that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) &quot;overpaid&quot; for Kraft. He has no plans to liquidate his position.For investors with a large tolerance for risk, KHC is worth testing Buffett's maxim to &quot;be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.&quot;  However, there are better places for investors to put their money in the consumer sector, including Campbell, Chuch & Dwight (NYSE:CHL) and Clorox (NYSE:CLX).As of this writing, Jonathan Berr did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-17	2019-04-17 16:42:10	UL	Unilever PLC	3 Personal Products Stocks to Revitalize Your Portfolio	In a trading world where investors seek the latest technology or the newest trend, personal products stocks tend to receive less attention. As an older industry which mostly produces commoditized products, investment interest in this sector tends to revolve around preserving existing wealth or generating dividend income.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth Despite the perception, these firms may receive more attention as they innovate on product development or marketing. Also, a growing presence in emerging markets has also bolstered these consumer staples stocks. Although many personal products stocks could bring opportunity, these three appear especially well-positioned to profit investors:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Herbalife (HLF)Source: Aybek Erkinov via FlickrOne can argue that Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) has become better-known for hedge fund interest than what the firm produces. However, with Carl Icahn finally winning on his long bet against short-seller Bill Ackman, traders can evaluate HLF stock on sales and profit growth.The Cayman Islands-based nutrition company makes products for nutrition, energy, sports and fitness. However, its weight management segment drives more than 50% of its revenue. Though weight management encompasses multiple products, the division centers on its original product, protein shake. This Formula 1 shake is a soy-based product marketed as a &quot;meal replacement.&quot; The company sells its product directly to the public via multi-level marketing.Unlike most personal products stocks, HLF acts as more of a growth equity. While it does not pay a dividend, it has begun to post improving growth numbers. After stagnating in the middle of the decade, revenues again started to increase in 2018. Revenue growth seems to have returned as Wall Street predicts a 6.1% increase for this year and 6.6% growth in 2020.As a result, profit increases have returned to double-digit levels, with earnings rising by 10.1% this year. This takes the forward P/E ratio to just under 14.4.HLF stock can rise, the question is how much? Herbalife currently trades at almost $53 per share. The one point of concern is it appears to have become stuck in a range. Since last August, it has twice pulled back from the low $60s per share level. I think the improving profit outlook can at least take it back to that level. However, it will need to break out of this range to sustain a longer-term upward trend. Nu Skin Enterprises (NUS)Nu Skin Enterprises (NYSE:NUS) is a multilevel marketing company who produces and sells both dietary supplements and personal care products. They market under the Nu Skin and Pharmanex brand names.The Provo, Utah-based firm operates in about 50 markets worldwide. According to the company's 10-K, they derive about 88% of their revenue from outside the U.S. Its largest market, mainland China, accounts for around 33% of that revenue.Like most personal products stocks, NUS stock pays a dividend. The current annual payout of $1.48 per share has increased every year since 2001. For new shareholders, it also yields around 2.9%, well above S&P 500 averages.A falling stock price may explain the relatively high yield. Over the last six months, the equity has lost over 40% of its value. This decline stems from its significant presence in China and investigations. Chinese authorities allege firms such as Nu Skin engaged in the unlawful promotion of health and wellness products. In early January, China instituted a 100-day ban on business meetings.The uncertainty surrounding this probe has hammered NUS stock. Consequently, investors may have a buying opportunity. NUS stock now trades at a forward P/E ratio of 11.6. Equities forecasted to increase profits by an average of 11.35% per year over the next five years rarely trade at such a low multiple.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm The tenuous situation in China adds to the risk of NUS stock. For this reason, it might make sense to wait or to buy only for the dividend. However, I think once the current crackdown ends, investors will hold a low-priced, high-growth stock with a generous payout. Unilever (UL, UN)Investors often confuse the stocks of London-based Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) and Unilever N.V. (NYSE:UN) based in the Netherlands. Despite the legal separation, both are Unilever. It maintains this dual headquarters arrangement and two tickers for a variety of reasons. Still, while UN faces higher dividend taxes, UL and UN remain almost identical for purposes of U.S. traders.Unilever owns a wide variety of consumer brands including Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, Lipton Tea, Dove soap, and Axe skin products. In 2018, it derived about 60% of its revenue from personal products. The remainder came from packaged food-type products. It has undergone cost-cutting initiatives over the last few years and has aggressively moved into emerging markets.Over the long-term, UL and UN stock have generally risen, though it has stagnated over the last year. As of this writing, UN trades at about $57.50 per share, near its 52-week high. Still, both tickers support a forward P/E of about 20. Also, analysts expect an average 9.3% per year increase in profits over the next five years.For this reason, most of the benefit of owning UL and UN stock comes from the dividend. Since the company pays in pounds and euro, payouts may fluctuate. However, the stocks currently yield about 3.05%. Dividends also rise annually, at least when measured in the currency of their respective countries.Unilever may trade at a somewhat higher multiple compared to other personal products stocks. However, with its growing presence in emerging markets, both UN and UL stock can become a profitable growth and income play.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-03-07	2019-03-07 11:30:15	UL	Unilever PLC	Walmart Fights Back at Amazon by Getting Into the Advertising Game	Retailing these days can be thought of as really just a two-horse race. In lane one is mighty Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). In the other is discount champion Walmart (NYSE:WMT). And while it may seem like AMZN has the upper hand, you can not count out WMT in the slightest. The world's largest retailer continues to fight back in a big way and the tug of war between the two is shaping up to be a big battle.Source: Mike Seyfang via Flickr The latest salvo from Walmart against Bezos' baby is taking a very successful play out their own books and applying it against them. We're talking about digital advertising.   * 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains AMZN has already used digital advertising effectively and Walmart's latest announcement to get into the game could put pressure on Amazon and ultimately cut some of those lucrative revenues. For investors in WMT, it just goes to show that the traditional retailer is adapting to the new environment with gusto. Walmart Gets Serious About Digital AdsWe've talked before about how Amazon is effectively selling space on its website to advertisers. The quick gist that vendors bid to have their products show up alongside a related search term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo, Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG) pays to have Tide products show up alongside the words &quot;laundry detergent.&quot; The beauty for Amazon is that it doesn't matter if you buy Tide or Arm & Hammer, it still gets a sale and makes money on the sponsored ad.However, advertisers love the sponsored ads, as they can and do result in higher sales and AMZN is a retailer. Searching detergent on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) still requires you then go to a retailer to purchase. By using Amazon, it cuts out the middle man. Because of this, Amazon's digital advertising revenues have continued to surge over the last few quarters. In fact, last quarter, AMZN reported that ad sales and other revenue jumped 95%to $3.4 billion.Do you know who else has a website that sees an insane amount of consumer traffic? Walmart. And now Walmart is looking to get in on the digital advertising act as well.In a meeting with suppliers at the end of February, WMT unveiled a plan to capture more advertising revenues. For starters, the retailer is now consolidating teams into a single group for ad sales and operations. That includes bringing its digital ad business under its banner and ending its relationship with ad giant WPP.Secondly, Walmart has plans to expand access to a massive amount of consumer data. According to Forrester Research, more than 300 million shoppers visit Walmart's stores every month and millions visit its various shopping brands websites each month. These shoppers create a ton of data that advertisers would kill to get their hands on. However, for the longest time, WMT hasn't done anything with it. A Big Deal for WalmartAll of this is a huge win for Walmart. The idea is that WMT becomes a network that firms can advertise on. Just like AMZN, Walmart features a rich ecosystem of websites and tangential offerings such as its Vudu video service. Using its rich pool of consumer data, on-demand and native advertising become a snap for firms tapping into WMT's network. Suppliers can pay for ads to sell products across the entire system. Did you buy a bike at a physical store? Well, you could now see an ad for a bike helmet while watching a movie on Vudu. And that clicked ad could take you to Jet.com -- a Walmart brand -- to purchase it.Moreover, like Amazon, Walmart can benefit from the same sort of &quot;sponsored ad&quot; set-up within its core website. Walmart gets the sale and ad revenue.But where Walmart potential has a leg-up on Amazon is in its physical store frontage.Already, product makers like Unilever (NYSE:UL) or Kellogg's (NYSE:K) pay WMT to set up physical displays and ads in its stores and aisles. But with access to the trove of consumer data, this can allow them to target very specific stores among its 4,600+ locations. Why waste money and time, when UL can pick these 100 stores that have exactly the consumer they are looking at for new mayo product. That's basically what Facebook (NYSE:FB) does for advertisers. Walmart can now do that with its physical stores. A Potential Game Changer for WalmartAs we've seen with Amazon, digital ads can be a huge money-maker for a retailer. Given WMT's huge base of data and store frontage, similar results should be had. And, like AMZN, the easy revenues here will allow Walmart the ability to invest in continued omnichannel innovation and help it fight the online sales war.All in all, the decision is a huge win for Walmart and its investors.And while Amazon will feel the heat, it probably won't be a crushing blow. But it could hit ad revenues a tad. And where Walmart could hit hard is among the pure players, like FB and Google. Already, we've begun to see the cracks in GOOG's advertising armor. With WMT getting into the mix, its dominant position will be tested even more.  * 9 Trade War Stocks to Sell on U.S.-China Deal News The bottom line is that Walmart has found a smart way to get some additional revenues and build-out its online presence.

Last quarter, the company reported profits and revenue that beat consensus last quarter. This time, the only unpredictable near-term risk is whether or not the stock's valuation will bring selling pressure.

In light of markets getting skittish, a correction in the share price may create an entry point.

  * 8 Dividend Stocks With Growth on the Horizon 



### Strong Momentum and Shopify Stock

Shopify added shipping features that help merchants sell more and work more effectively. Its users are getting benefits from the partner ecosystem. And the launch of its new App Store last September is leading to meaningful conversation rate increases for app installations after the user performs a search.

Shopify's profit margin keeps growing because the features it develops also adds value at the transaction levels. As revenue from merchants grows, so does GMV.

This is a win-win for both Shopify stock and its customers.  On its conference call, management mentioned Fraud Protect as an example of a feature that adds value for the merchant by preventing fraudulent charge-backs. In return, Shopify earns a small fee for the service.

### Shopify Plus and Shopify Stock

Ahead of the busy holiday season, hundreds of fast-growing merchants joined Shopify Plus. The offering primarily targets big retailers. For instance, The Brick and Leon's Furniture is a large-sized firm in Canada that is signed up for Shopify Plus.

Unilever (NYSE: UL) is a Shopify Plus client. Even more potentially valuable as a growth catalyst is the addition of licensed cannabis stores fronts. After Canada legalized cannabis on Oct. 17, 2018, Shopify will definitely benefit from more and more companies opening up.

### Cannabis a Positive Catalyst

Limited supply and unknown regulatory changes in cannabis is a potential headwind limiting Shopify's growth. If markets priced in much of the growth ahead on the basis of companies making billions in sales, SHOP stock is at risk of falling.

Still, management did not model for exuberant growth from the legalization of cannabis. In fact, it is broadening its market geographically to capture growth.

### Global Growth

Shopify recognizes the importance of international markets for expansion. With 70% of the largest e-commerce markets being non-English speaking, Shopify must localize its platform in each region it enters.

In Germany, Shopify tailored Shopify Payments to accept not just credit card payments but also local bank transfers. This approach, customizing the uniqueness of the German markets, will likely result in strong growth in this region.

### Shopify Still Losing Money

Despite the highlights as mentioned above, plus the 55% Y/Y GMV expansion to $10 billion, Shopify still reported an adjusted operating loss of $3.6 million in the third quarter. Its adjusted net income was $4.5 million or just $0.04 a share. It ended Q3 with $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

The profits look small but fast-growing firms like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported losses and minuscule profits for years before the stock topped out at over $2000 a share in the last year.

### Outlook

Shopify raised its forecast for the full year. It now expects revenue growing 55% and in the range of $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion. Operating income will be $8 million to $10 million.

For the fourth quarter report, scheduled for Feb. 14, the firm expects revenue of $315 million - $325 million. Adjusted income will be between $16 and $18 million. Shopify will also spend $30 million in stock-based compensation in that period and $105 million for the full year.

### Limited Risk to Growth

Shopify is not likely to report slowing growth in the near-term. Even though it is attracting big customers, its primary market is the small and medium merchant.

Its Shopify Plus targets such businesses and is not an area competitors are as interested in. So for the foreseeable future, expect the pricing model to stay the same, which in turn will lead to more merchants signing up.

Disclosure: the author does not own shares in any of the companies mentioned.

A growing list of British institutional refuseniks and the prospect of a retail investor rebellion in the context of Britain's planned exit from the European Union prompted the company to reverse course and ditch the plan on Friday, three weeks before it was to be voted on.  Interviews with UK shareholders, advisors and analysts paint a picture of Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) as either miscalculating the level of dissent to becoming a single corporate entity headquartered in the Netherlands, or dismissing it in the interests of a broader vision they were convinced was right.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/haste-dutch-unilever-miscalculated-concerns-100201750.html?.tsrc=rss
