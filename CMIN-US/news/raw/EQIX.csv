2021-03-25	2021-03-25 15:51:18	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	Analysts See an ‘Attractive Entry Point’ in These 3 Stocks	"What to make of markets today? Everything is both up and down. The major stock indexes are showing strong gains for the past year, but have seen recent pullbacks. High volatility, however, brings on opportunities. During these pullbacks, investors get a chance to ‘buy low and sell high,’ taking advantage of short-term falls in share prices. There’s risk, of course. Stocks don’t exist in a vacuum, and the forces tugging on them are subject to their own varying influences. Inflation worries, sparked by Federal spending plans, have pushed up bond yields, but the Federal Reserve has no intention of raising interest rates any time soon. The financial landscape is uncertain – and the only clarity is that, for now, stocks are currently offering the best rates of return. Wall Street’s analysts are still seeing plenty – in their words – attractive entry points, stocks that are primed for just this sort of trading. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up the details on three such stocks. Let's take a closer look. AbCellera Biologics (ABCL) We'll start with AbCellera, which holds a fascinating position in the biotech industry. The company is a leader in human antibody research, researching the immune system to develop antibodies which be used as the base for new drugs and disease treatments. AbCellera – and its tech platform – have been involved in the fight against COVID-19 since last summer, researching potential antibody treatments for the virus. Its Covid-19 drug, Bamlanivimab, developed in partnership with Eli Lilly, was granted an emergency use authorization by the FDA this past November, and has shown positive results in two Phase 3 clinical trials. AbCellera is no stranger to pandemic-related research. The company had a leading role in the Pandemic Prevention Platform, part of the DARPA Biological Tech Office. AbCellera works on developing countermeasures to pandemic agents on an accelerated timescale. ABCL shares are new to the public market; the company held its IPO this past December. In its first day of trading, ABCL jumped from a $20 initial price to an afternoon high above $70 before closing the day at $58.90. The IPO raised over $555.5 million in gross proceeds. Since then, the stock has fallen, and ABCL shares are now down 55%. This opens up the ‘attractive entry point’ seen by Credit Suisse analyst Tiago Fauth. “With the pace of new company creation in biotech at highs, and a clear value proposition for partners (high-throughput solution intended to shorten the antibody discovery cycle and generate higher probability drug candidates), we believe the pullback in shares offers an attractive entry point for investors looking to capitalize on the disruptive potential of a leading technology-powered drug discovery platform,” Fauth opined. Getting into the details, the Credit Suisse analyst adds, “We believe ABCL offers uniquely strong thesis fundamentals that clearly stand out from some of the comps that have lagged in recent days, including (1) visibility on substantial near-term cash flows generation from bamlanivimab and no financing overhang, (2) a differentiated and increasingly validated discovery platform with a large TAM, and (3) underappreciated LT business model optionality.” To this end, Fauth gives ABCL shares a $54 target price, suggesting a robust 103% upside potential by year’s end. His bullish target supports his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating. (To watch Fauth’s track record, click here) Sometimes, Wall Street’s analysts all agree, and that’s the case here. ABCL has 5 recent reviews and all are to Buy, giving the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are trading for $26.55 with an average target of $55.80 implying ~107% one-year upside. (See ABCL stock analysis on TipRanks) Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) The next 'attractive' stock we're looking at is Ionis Pharmaceuticals, a California-based clinical research firm focusing on RNA-targeted therapeutics. These medications are designed to interact with the patient’s own RNA, making for a precise treatment that disrupts disease processes. Ionis has three drugs approved and an active pipeline of candidates in development. The approved drugs are Spinraza, used to treat spinal muscular dystrophy; Tegsedi, used to treat the neurodegenerative disease ATTR; and Waylivra, which treat genetically caused triglycerides in the blood. Of the three drugs, Spinraza has the highest sales, and brought in $2 billion in worldwide revenue last year. More than 11,000 patients were receiving Spinraza at the end of 4Q20. The other two approved drugs, Tegsedi and Waylivra, saw product sales increase 65% from 2019 to 2020. Strong product sales allowed Ionis to finish 2020 with $1.9 billion in cash on hand. The stock has slipped 30% since its recent peak in January, but Oppenheimer's 5-star analyst Kevin Degeeter views the ""current valuation as offering an attractive entry point for investors with 9-plus month outlook…” Expanding on this outlook, the analyst adds, “We view simplification of IONS's portfolio and transition from partnering to investment in wholly owned pipeline programs as offering a catalyst for unlocking value from the RNAi platform. We expect IONS shares to enjoy steady multiple expansion as the company diversifies revenue away from Spinraza royalties toward in-house orphan drug therapies, including TTR. There could be upside to our outlook if IONS identifies creative structures to unlock value from its broad pipeline of partnered programs with Biogen, Pfizer, Roche, and Novartis.” Based on the above, DeGeeter rates IONS shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and sets a $63 price target that implies room for a 49% one-year upside. (To watch DeGeeter’s track record, click here) What does the rest of the Street think? Looking at the consensus breakdown, opinions from other analysts are more spread out. 6 Buys, 3 Holds and 2 Sells add up to a Moderate Buy consensus. In addition, the $56.70 average price target indicates 33% upside potential. (See IONS stock analysis on TipRanks) Equinix (EQIX) From biopharma and biotech, we’ll change gears and take a look at digital tech. Equinix is a leader in the colocation data center market, operating over 200 data centers in 25 countries across the America, Europe and the Middle East, and Asia. The company does business as a real estate investment trust, owning and managing the data centers, which are leased out to business clients. As can be imagined, a major owner/operator of data centers would find itself well-positioned to reap benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic – and Equinix did. It might be fairer to say, however, that the company’s model proved immune to the virus. Equinix’s business has been growing for 18 years, and the corona crisis couldn’t dent that. In 4Q20, the company recorded its 72nd consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. The top line for 2020 came in at $5.99 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Acquisition costs and losses due to debt extinguishment pushed income down by 27% yoy. Looking ahead, the company projects income in range of $6.58 billion to $6.64 billion, for another annual gain of 10% to 11%. Equinix is continuing to expand, and earlier this month released plans for $3 billion hyperscale program, financed in part by joint venture partners. The project will increase the company’s ability to meet the demands of its 10,000-strong customer base. Sami Badri, in his coverage of this stock for Credit Suisse, writes of Equinix’s general situation. “[As] we head towards a post-COVID world, digital leaders will be reminded of the importance of minimizing time to market and the ability to rapidly alter workload capabilities, both of which are eased through the use of the Equinix Metal Platform... Through its partner solutions EQIX will seek to complement its existing interconnection, networking and compute services to offer an expanded choice of Infrastructure as a Service solutions, which will only grow EQIX's appeal among data center customers looking for a long-term solution to best serve their end consumers,” Badri wrote. Regarding the stock’s value to investors, Badri adds, “EQIX is trading below large cap peer DLR based on consensus estimates, also a new recent development. We believe the recent pull back in EQIX's trading price makes this a very attractive entry point.” In all, the analyst gives this stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his $942 price target implies a 43% upside over the next 12 months. (To watch Badri’s track record, click here) Who doesn’t like a market leader with a near two-decade record of revenue growth? Wall Street’s analysts are unanimous here, giving EQIX 13 Buy reviews for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are selling for $660.23, and their $838.92 average price target implies a 27% one-year upside potential from that level.

2021-03-09	2021-03-09 19:58:08	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	4 Secular Growth Stock Ideas: Chewy, Amazon, Alphabet, Equinix	Growth stocks have been outperforming value stocks for almost the entire last decade. Yet with stocks at all-time highs, many growth stocks now have stretched valuations. Those steep earnings and sales multiples aren’t necessarily a problem as long as the companies keep delivering the growth for which investors are looking. If the growth slows down, growth stocks can take a big hit. For example, former growth stock Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UAA) saw its growth numbers start to slump back in 2016, and its stock ultimately dropped from above $54 to as low as $11.40 by late 2017. Secular growth stocks are a rare breed of companies that analysts say will continue growing forever. Here are four secular growth stocks that BofA Securities analysts love. Amazon.cm, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) Not only is Amazon a secular growth stock, it is a market leader in two of the largest secular growth markets in the world today. Amazon is the market leader in e-commerce, a secular growth theme that will likely continue to play out for decades. It is also the market leader in cloud services, another business that will continue to grow as long as the world keeps producing more data. Amazon is still in the early stages of the retail transition from offline to online, and Amazon’s AWS cloud revenue growth could even accelerate this year as IT spending recovers post-pandemic, said BofA analyst Justin Post. BofA Securities has a Buy rating and $4,150 price target for AMZN stock. Alphabet, Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Like Amazon, Alphabet has a basket of secular growth businesses. Its online advertising business and YouTube video platform are unrivaled, and global internet and smartphone usage will likely continue to rise indefinitely. In addition, Google Cloud gives Alphabet exposure to the cloud business, while Waymo gives Alphabet exposure to next-generation auto technology. Post said investors shouldn’t worry too much about Google’s recent decision to remove support for third-party cookies from the Chrome browser over the next year. The decision could make Google’s “privacy sandbox” even more valuable for app developers, the analyst said. BofA has a Buy rating and $2,440 price target for Alphabet stock. Chewy Inc (NYSE: CHWY) In the company’s fiscal third quarter, Chewy reported 44.9% revenue growth and 58.4% net income growth. It’s unlikely the company will maintain that growth rate forever, but the online pet supply business is certainly on a secular growth track. Analyst Nat Schindler said credit card data so far in 2021 suggests Chewy’s 2020 momentum is spilling over into at least the first half of this year. In addition to growing earnings and revenue, the analyst said Chewy is well-positioned to grow its market share, its margins and its pet pharmaceutical sales. BofA Securities has a Buy rating on Chewy with a $133 price target. Equinix Inc (NASDAQ: EQIX) Equinix is the largest data center operator in the world. Big data is a major secular growth theme, and Equinix grew its revenue by 8.7% in 2020. Equinix should benefit from growing demand for network-neutral colocation, said BofA analyst Michael Funk. Colocation demand should continue to grow alongside enterprise data usage over time. In addition to the stock’s growth opportunity, Funk said there is an extremely high technical barrier to entry in the data center market, limiting potential future competition for Equinix. BofA Securities has a Buy rating on Equinix with an $865 price target.

2021-02-22	2021-02-22 15:15:52	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	Understanding Equinix's Ex-Dividend Date	On February 10, 2021, Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) declared a dividend payable on March 17, 2021 to its shareholders. Equinix also announced that shareholders on the company's books on or before February 24, 2021 are entitled to the dividend. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. Equinix has an ex-dividend date set for for February 23, 2021. The company's current dividend payout is $2.87, which equates to a dividend yield of 1.53% at current price levels. What Is An Ex-Dividend Date? An ex-dividend date is when a company's shares stop trading with its current dividend payout in preparation for the company to announce a new one. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Typically, companies will announce and implement new dividend yields on a quarterly basis. Equinix's Dividend Payouts And Yields Over the past year, Equinix has seen its dividend payouts climb upward and its yields trend downward. Last year on February 25, 2020 the company's payout sat at $2.66, which has since increased by $0.21. Equinix's dividend yield last year was 1.73%, which has since decreased by 0.2%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. Click here to find details on Equinix's previous dividends.

2021-01-15	2021-01-15 16:54:03	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	The 7 Top Dividend Stocks for 2021	Last year was a tale of two halves for dividend equities. Owing to the novel coronavirus pandemic, the first half of 2020 was chock full of payout cuts and suspensions by S&P 500 member firms, but dividends rebounded mightily in the second half of the year, indicating that many of the top stocks for 2021 are dividend payers. The fourth-quarter trajectory of S&P 500 payouts indicates that the darkest clouds of the coronavirus cuts have passed. And dividend investors could be in for better things this year. “Indicated dividend net changes (increases less decreases) for U.S. domestic common stocks increased $9.5 billion during Q4 2020, compared to a decline of $2.3 billion in Q3 2020, and a gain of $10.6 billion in Q4 2019,” noted the S&P Dow Jones Indices. “For Q4 2020, aggregate increases amounted to $13.9 billion, up 64.2% from the $8.4 billion increase of Q3 2020 and up 15.7%, from Q4 2019’s $12.0 billion. Aggregate dividend cuts decreased 59.8% to $4.3 billion from Q3 2020’s $10.8 billion in cuts, and was up 221% from the $1.3 billion in cuts for Q4 2019.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Adding to the case for dividends in 2021 are recent dividend futures data, which, as Goldman Sachs notes, implies those contracts could bring cuts. But the bank says that’s a case of mispricing and that dividends should rise this year. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon With that opportunity ahead, here are some of the top dividend stocks to consider for 2021: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Western Union (NYSE:WU) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) VICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Dividend Stocks: Apple (AAPL) Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.com Apple’s dividend yields just 0.64%. In this environment of historically low interest rates and depressed yields, the company doesn’t standout on the basis of yield. However, it is one of the rare examples of a name that’s legitimately a growth stock with a solidified, growing dividend. In bygone eras of investing, technology companies didn’t rush to pay dividends because it was supposedly a sign that growth was behind them. That’s not the case with Apple. A relatively new participant in the dividend landscape, AAPL stock has consistently surged since it became a dividend payer less than a decade ago. As of Jan. 15, the company has a market capitalization of $2.15 trillion. The combination of 5G iPhone sales, a bigger push into high margins, revenue-steadying subscription-based services and its robust entertainment arm make Apple a top stock for 2021. For its most recent quarter, the company had $191.83 billion in cash on hand — more than enough to support and grow the dividend this year. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com For a good portion of 2020, allocating to bank stocks, including JPMorgan Chase, tried investors’ patience. The group fell out of favor because of low interest rates, but that wasn’t all. Shareholder rewards (the one benefit of being involved with these names) suffered a blow when the Federal Reserve told the largest banks to scrap buybacks and that there would be no payout growth in 2020. Rather, JPMorgan had to set aside large sums of capital to cover bad loans due to the fragile Covid-19 economy. On that note, the sour loan situation didn’t turn out to be as bad as the Fed expected. That could mean at some point in 2021, JPMorgan and rivals will be allowed to repatriate that cash back into earnings. 7 Dividend Stocks That Are Growing Their Payouts There are reasons for optimism when it comes to the JPM stock dividend, including the Fed relenting on the buyback freeze last month. JPMorgan seized on that announcement, swiftly saying it will repurchase $30 billion of its shares. Western Union (WU) Source: apichon_tee/ShutterStock.com Dividend stocks are often associated with large- and mega-cap companies, but some smaller stocks have enviable payout track records. That group includes money-transfer provider Western Union. The company has a $8.95 billion market cap and yields 4.16%. This results in an annual payout of 90 cents per share, up from 24 cents a decade ago. WU stock was a sluggish performer last year, and its prosaic business doesn’t seem to jive with the current level of sexiness ascribed to the fintech revolution. But Western Union has digital capabilities of its own that could act as catalysts for the sleepy stock this year. “Expanding real-time payout capability is a key focus of the Company’s digital growth strategy which centers on growing its industry-leading digital services offered through westernunion.com and digital partnerships,” according to the company. “Together, the two growth drivers grew digital revenue 45% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2020, representing 21% of Western Union’s consumer business and trending at an annual rate of over $900 million.” Microsoft (MSFT) Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com Microsoft’s dividend history is longer than Apple’s. But they are both prime examples of growth companies that offer much more than just a dividend. Rather, they are growth names with the ability to support and grow the payout while delivering impressive levels of capital appreciation. While so many energy, consumer discretionary and real estate companies — just to name a few sectors — were cutting and halting dividends in 2020, Microsoft grew its payout. Last September, the tech giant raised its quarterly payout to 56 cents a share, a 10% increase. The company finished 2020 with $136.52 billion in cash on hand, so future dividend growth is easily supported. The Top 7 Marijuana Stocks to Buy for January Of course, Wall Street demands more of MSFT stock than dividend growth. And investors should, too. Fortunately, the company can execute. In the September quarter, Microsoft’s Azure cloud business, the second-largest of its kind, grew 48%. While the PC market could ebb a bit this year, Office 365, particularly the version including Teams, adds another growth driver for the company. VICI Properties (VICI) Source: Shutterstock Real estate investment trusts (REITs) were among the most egregious offenders when it came to dividend cuts in 2020. But VICI Properties didn’t get that memo, raising its payout 11% for its third consecutive hike. VICI is a gaming REIT, meaning it’s in the casino real estate business. To that end, it’s worth noting the company is the property owner of Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas strip, among dozens of other domestic gaming venues. However, investors should also note that Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) is the REIT’s biggest client, and Caesars has a deep portfolio of regional casinos. Translation: VICI is significantly less Vegas-dependent than meets the eye. In fact, just about a quarter of its rental income was generated on the strip in the September quarter. VICI has some growth levers to pull as 2021 unfolds. Caesars is likely to divest several properties around the country to generate cash. VICI is the likely suitor for some of those venues, as it holds rights of first refusal for some assets on the strip. Additionally, VICI has served as partner for smaller casino operators looking to scoop regional venues, which leads to new rental income. Equinix (EQIX) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With a current price around $700, data-center REIT Equinix isn’t for everyone. EQIX is in the midst of a pullback that’s seen it retreat 17% from its 52-week high. But that could be a buying opportunity for investors. Data centers house servers and networking gear. And with cybersecurity and cloud-computing spending forecast to surge again this year, the case for EQIX stock remains strong. Plus, Equinix has recent history on its side, easily topping broader real estate benchmarks for five years. There are plenty of avenues for growth in 2021. 7 Hot Stocks That Will Keep You Energized With 3%-Plus Yields “Interconnection remains strong and, in our view, will continue to be the primary driver of Equinix’s continuing strength. The firm added eight new cloud on-ramps in the quarter, bringing its total to 160 and, resulting in a 42% market share in its footprint according to the company,” according to Morningstar. Texas Instruments (TXN) Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com Semiconductor maker Texas Instruments is one of the original tech dividend names, initiating its payout in 1962. That’s ancient in tech dividend terms. More importantly, the payout grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27% from 2004 to 2019. 2020 marked the 17th consecutive year in which the payout grew. Like many of its tech dividend counterparts, Texas Instruments has growth outlets despite being a mature company. Its battery management system (BMS) makes it a credible electric vehicle (EV) derivative play. The BMS is used by EV manufacturers to “reduce the complexity of their designs, improve reliability and reduce vehicle weight to extend driving range.” Design and extended range are two of the big hurdles that, if cleared, could rapidly speed EV adoption. There are more glamorous semiconductor stocks, but TXN is a way for conservative investors to get some EV exposure while getting compensated. That’s no small feat given the scarcity of dependable dividends in the EV arena.

2020-09-16	2020-09-16 00:00:00	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	The Argus Dividend Growth Portfolio	Often overlooked amid the market's gyrations, dividend income is an important element of total return. Consider recent results: in 2015, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 1.4%, including dividends -- but excluding dividends, the market was down 0.7%. Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors. And dividend payments softened the blow in 2018, when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks, particularly in a slow-growth or recessionary economic environment.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ee2cb308-3324-39c8-b0ae-47798c9d8c19/the-argus-dividend-growth.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-25	2020-06-25 15:47:40	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	Tech-Exposed Real Estate Is Pulling Away From Other Properties	(Bloomberg) -- The same trends behind soaring stock prices for Amazon.com Inc. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. are benefiting shares in the companies associated with their real estate.Communication towers and data center stocks -- sometimes referred to as “where the internet lives” -- have seen some of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 so far this year as stay-in-place measures to combat the coronavirus have accelerated the demand for digital services and connectivity.Whereas the pandemic has severely hit many commercial property owners, shares in real estate investment trusts related to technology are outperforming. The combined market value gained by just five of those stocks is almost the same as the amount lost by 30 REITs specializing in malls and shopping centers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.“If you’re a real estate investor and your mandate is to own real estate, you’re obviously not doing very well owning offices or owning retail,” Cowen analyst Colby Synesael said in a phone interview.With more people at home, the demands on technology and its infrastructure have been tremendous, whether it’s allowing for online shopping, mobile streaming or working remotely. As a result, certain REITs have emerged as defensive plays for investors, Synesael said.American Tower Corp., Digital Reality Trust Inc., Equinix Inc., Crown Castle International Inc. and SBA Communications Corp. have added roughly $50 billion in total market capitalization this year, and valuations for towers and data centers have never been higher.Data centers, for instance, are trading at a roughly 15% premium to the overall REIT average on a price to estimated adjusted funds from operations basis, according to Berenberg analyst Nate Crossett. Historically they’ve traded at a 7% discount.As a global data center company, Equinix has boasted of its work building out coverage and scale for clients that have gone on to become household names in the work-from-home era including Zoom and Cisco Systems Inc.’s Webex.“Two significant customers of ours is Zoom and Webex -- both of whom obviously saw exceptional increases in their demand as work from home took off,” Chief Executive Officer Charles Meyers said in an interview. “We played a very key role in helping them ramp up their capacity to meet that demand. That was true also in networking cloud providers.”Meyers said it’s difficult to anticipate how much more revenue the company could see over time. In terms of demand, he pointed to recent overall online traffic trends, which surged 25% to 30% over a 30- to 45-day period-- growth that normally would take nine months to a year to achieve.Digital Realty Chief Financial Officer Andy Power said in an interview that the company had seen a pickup in data center demand from clients filling near-term gaps but that longer-term, he was “pleasantly surprised” at how larger enterprises were also taking this moment to plan for the future.“We’re seeing the criticality of our infrastructure playing out front and center while many of our other asset classes [in real estate] are seeing sloping rent,” he said. Even for clients in struggling industries such as travel, the company has seen increased deployments. “Our services are fundamentally mission critical for their businesses. You cannot book an airline ticket or any hotel reservation without the infrastructure we’re essentially providing.”Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lindsay Dutch said the need for increased connectivity during the pandemic has demonstrated the importance of digital infrastructure, which is a long-term driver for the stocks.“If you think of everyone on their computers, trying to connect to their workplace and do all these Zoom calls and stream Netflix -- that creates more traffic and the need for power,” she said.Before the virus, shares in tech-related REITs had already been rising, catching the attention of investors, Cowen’s Synesael said.For communication towers, he noted a sea change in 2018 when Vanguard Group began adding towers to its investment portfolio, prompting more investors to do the same ahead of the U.S. rollout of 5G spectrum.Unlike data centers, tower stocks aren’t seeing a fundamental change in earnings from the pandemic, Synesael said. However, they are still benefiting from trends Covid-19 has accelerated like mobile data use, which Synesael expects to continue.Despite their relative premium, Berenberg’s Crossett said that on an absolute basis “there’s still plenty of room to run” for data center stocks.“To the extent that there’s a pullback, I would be adding to these names,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-exposed-real-estate-pulling-154740149.html?.tsrc=rss

Can the market extend the rally? Which stocks can continue handing out ample rewards through 2020 and beyond?In such instances it is worth turning to the pros to get the lowdown. Multinational investment bank and financial services provider, Cowen, has a history of successfully picking up disruptive companies and emerging markets early on, Amazon being a case in point. The company was also the first Wall Street firm to exhibit serious interest in the fledgling cannabis industry.With the help of TipRanks’ Stock Screener, we were able to get the full scoop on the company’s 3 favorite stocks for the new year. All 3 have had a strong 2019, yet Cowen thinks their growth is set to continue in the year ahead. Let’s take a look.Charter Communications (CHTR)2019 continued to hear talk of the ‘cord-cutting’ trend whereby old, traditional cable companies are about to become obsolete due to pay-tv customers moving over to newer, more flexible streaming services. Telecommunications giant, Charter, has stayed ahead of the curve by leveraging losses of cable customers by picking up more subscribers for its broadband service. As broadband becomes a must-have service for every household, and most areas only provide two options for broadband services, companies like Charter almost become recession proof.Apart from success in the broadband sector, Charter’s entrance into the wireless phone market is also bearing fruit. Its mobile business has seen solid growth, adding 276,000 new lines in the last quarter alone.Additionally, it has kept buying back company shares, always a promising sign for investors. In Q3, the company spent $3.1 billion on stock buybacks.This cable giant has easily outperformed the market in 2019, delivering a year-to-date gain of 65%, but has the leading broadband provider climbed too high?Not according to 5-star Cowen analyst Colby Synesael, who noted, “All said, despite the stock rally and premium valuation, we still see Charter as the ideal scaled pure-play Cable provider and best stock to play the Broadband story with underlying catalysts including the FCF story (24% CAGR), buybacks, attractive network assets ideal for the 5G topology, and strategic optionality. Longer-term, the company is well positioned to measurably build a DIY wireless network (trialing CBRS) and aggressively buy back shares, to be eventually taken out by a wireless carrier (because wireless carriers may have no choice).”To this end, Synesael reiterated an Outperform rating on Charter along with a price target of $537, indicating gains of 14% could be in place. (To watch Synesael’s track record, click here)What does the Street make of the communication giant’s prospects? A breakdown of 14 Buys, 7 Holds, and a solitary Sell, provide Charter with a Moderate Buy rating. The average price target stands at $503.16, which implies 7% upside potential. (See Charter Communications stock analysis on TipRanks) Equinix (EQIX)Another high-flyer in 2019 is internet connection and data center provider, Equinix. Year-to-date, EQIX is up 58%, leaving the S&P 500 in the dust despite its stellar year.The company is unusual given the fact that it is a REIT (real estate investment trust) but operates like a growth stock. Equinix provides the buildings and infrastructure for companies to house their servers in. Most companies use Equinix’s IBX (international business exchange), as along with a lack of alternatives, it is too expensive to build their own. Therefore, like REITS, the company has a recurring income stream.The company reported good 3Q19 results with it breaking records for 3Q bookings, cross connect adds and bookings through its channel, which came in at 30%, indicating a loyal customer base is in place.Synesael noted, “We continue to have a positive LT view of Equinix as the company is able to demonstrate stable/durable growth that coupled with its highly attractive returns we believe should continue to drive multiple expansion and further separate it from comps. We do not however expect upcoming 2020 guidance to alone act as a catalyst, and instead expect the stock to continue to grind higher over the NTM.”All this has prompted the 5-star analyst to reiterate an Outperform rating on Equinix. A price target of $628 provides potential upside of 13%.The Street is equally effusive about Equinix’s 12-month prospects. The data center provider has a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, with the breakdown formed of 12 Buys and 1 Hold. The average price target is $615.25, providing 10% upside potential. (See EQIX stock analysis on TipRanks) GDS Holdings (GDS)Staying in the data field, we move on to Chinese high-performance data center provider, GDS Holdings.Even with Cowen’s previous picks exhibiting fantastic growth in 2019, they are both dwarfed by GDS, which has seen its share price more than double in 2019, growing by 118%. Accordingly, the company ranks as Cowen’s no.1 choice for 2020.A solid 3Q report reflected a strong year. The company leased 21,600 sqm compared to the trailing 12 months average of 19,400, thereby achieving the company’s 2019 leasing goal of 80,000 sqm. Management reiterated that it expects to equal this performance in 2020, and raised 2019 EBITDA guidance thanks to stronger than expected margins year-to-date.Adding to the good news, GDS announced it had reached an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in target companies which own a data center campus in the Shunyi district of Beijing. The campus comprises three data centers with an area of 19,700 sqm. The acquisition is set to close in the first half of 2020.Synesael notes that while GDS is likely to experience trade driven volatility - the combination of strong secular demand, further margin expansion, and industry leading growth ‘should drive continued stock appreciation.’  The analyst concluded, “We believe GDS continues to be well positioned in what remains a strong demand environment and is taking the right steps to secure more supply in its major markets as it prepares for even stronger demand in 2020.”Synesael reiterated an Outperform rating on GDS, along with a price target of $65. Should the target be achieved, a handsome increase of over 29% could be in the cards.The Street is relatively quiet when it comes to GDS right now. Over the last 3 months, the data center provider has had 3 analysts rating its prospects. All, though, conclude GDS is a Buy, therefore designating it with Strong Buy status. The average price target of $60, could provide investors with 19% upside.

The 13 Best REITs to Own in 2019	Real estate investment trusts (REITs) - a way for investors to gain access to assets such as apartments and office buildings while often collecting generous yields - had a disappointing 2018. With just a few days left to go in the year, the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) had lost 13.5% compared to a 12% decline for the broader market. This contrasts with 10-year average annual gains of just more than 12% for the VNQ.Will REITs bounce back in 2019? Well, the same fear that hampered these real-estate plays in 2018 - rising interest rates - still is on the board for the coming year. And higher rates on bonds sometimes hamper the performance of REITs.However, these companies are not created equal. The best REITs for 2019 could benefit from other powerful trends in 2019. For instance, cloud computing's growth should continue to fuel robust demand for data storage services. A massive infrastructure spending bill could improve the fortunes of related REIT plays. And mobile-data growth, as well as the rollout of lightning-fast 5G technology, offers potential growth for cell-tower REITs.Here are the 13 best REITs to buy and hold in 2019. Not only should they benefit from broad trends that could help them outperform their brethren, but REITs as a whole are trading at much more palatable valuations lately. Moreover, average dividend yields in the space currently exceed 4%; all the more reason for investors to stick with REITs if market rockiness continues in the coming year.

Despite the major exchanges continuing to hit record highs, there are reasons for investors to be uneasy.The market continues to digest the impacts (real and perceived) of the U.S.-China trade war. Earnings reports, though basically strong, suggest some weakness may exist. Institutional investors are spurning the usually fast-growing &quot;unicorn&quot; stocks. And 2020 is an election year which introduces uncertainty into the market.With uncertainty comes volatility. If you're looking for investment strategies to diversify your portfolio, now may be a time to look at real estate investment trusts (REITs).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsREITs own, operate or finance income-generating real estate properties such as apartment complexes or retail locations. REITs are heavily regulated and must meet a number of qualifications. They are legally required to pay at least 90% of their taxable income in dividends.REITs are often specialized in specific areas such as residential or commercial. But even within those two areas there are distinctions. For example some REITs focus on healthcare facilities, others focus on apartments, and others may focus on shopping centers.  * 7 Companies Using Artificial Intelligence to Outperform the Market Here are three REITs that set up well for whatever hits the market in 2020. Sun Communities (SUI)Dividend yield: 1.89%Source: Shutterstock The first REIT I want to discuss is Sun Communities (NYSE:SUI). Manufactured homes are showing the highest percentage growth of all REIT sub sectors in 2019. Sun Communities is one of the leading REITs in this sector and focuses on the midwestern and southeastern United States.With a market cap of $14.96 billion, Sun Communities is a large REIT that has been on a steady rise since the depths of the global economic crisis and the housing crisis. With that said, the stock has been getting a lift recently from a strong housing market. SUI stock is up over 55% in 2019.On Nov. 19, the Commerce Department released information on the housing market that showed that it is getting ready to heat up even though the calendar says it's winter.Residential construction surged in October with permits at their highest level since May 2007. Housing stats were also up in October. Although slightly lower than estimates, the 1.314 million number is an 8.5% year-over-year increase.SUI should continue to have a catalyst going forward as many rental properties are still citing very low vacancy rates. Welltower (WELL)Dividend yield: 4.18%The next REIT for you to consider is Welltower (NYSE:WELL). This is the largest healthcare REIT. Its properties span a variety of categories across the spectrum of patient care. WELL owns over 1,517 properties including hospitals, outpatient clinics, assisted living, and skilled nursing facilities across the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom.Healthcare will continue to be a hot sector with a number of catalysts. To begin with, the baby boomer generation is aging, and approximately 63% of WELL's net operating income comes from senior housing. This is the core of the company's portfolio.And despite the rhetoric about a single payer system and &quot;Medicare for all,&quot; approximately 94% of Welltower's revenues are private payers, so the stock is not exposed to that risk.Welltower's stock is up over 26% in 2019. In the second quarter, the company generated $1.3 billion in revenue with earnings coming in at $137.7 million.  * 7 Marijuana Penny Stocks That Have Ridiculous Possibilities It's fair to be concerned about a dividend that has not grown in three years. But while it may not be best in class, it's certainly not the worst. And with the stability you get from the recession-proof property mix, it's a stock that's worthy of consideration. Equinix (EQIX)Dividend yield: 1.76%Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a REIT with exposure to the growing data center segment. EQIX owns over 200 data centers. Their global customer base includes nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies.EQIX stock is up nearly 59% in 2019 compared to the S&P 500, which has returned 26.8%. But EQIX stock is not a one-year wonder. Over the last 10 years, Equinix stock has grown 640%, which crushes the 245% return in the broader market.Institutional investors are forecasting the company's earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a 21.4% average annual rate for the next five years. If that pans out, and there's no reason to believe it won't, the company will continue to have solid growth in its funds from operation (FFO). A larger FFO will allow EQIX to increase its dividend. EQIX shares currently have a dividend yield of 1.76%.A catalyst for the data center segment is the organic growth that comes from recurring revenues. In the case of Equinix, recurring revenue accounts for approximately 94% of total revenues.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not have a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-17	2019-11-17 10:44:57	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	3 Monster Growth Stocks That Can Move Even Higher	One thing is clear: investors are constantly searching for serious growth names. These aren’t any old stocks with blink-and-you’ll-miss-it growth narratives. We’re talking about stocks in it for the long-haul, poised to climb higher and deliver returns in the years to come. For investors that have settled on this strategy, what’s the best way to find these tickers with growth prospects that go above and beyond? Our suggestion: make use of TipRanks. The platform’s Stock Screener tool simplified our research process by allowing us to filter our search results by analyst consensus and upside potential from the current share price. To this end, we were able to pinpoint 3 stocks primed for substantial long-term gains.With this in mind, let’s get started.Equinix, Inc. (EQIX) Equinix is best-known for being the world’s largest data center and colocation provider, with its products enabling speedy application performance and low latency. On the heels of its third quarter earnings, several members of the Street are backing EQIX, which is already up 56% year-to-date.To kick off the release, the company reported that gross bookings were the highest ever for a third quarter and the second-highest overall. Not to mention EQIX is ahead of its competitors as it boasts 356,000 customer cross-connections, which includes 20,000 virtual connections. If that wasn’t enough, EQIX’s hybrid cloud growth is accelerating due to its recent shift to cloud trends. This resulted in the enterprise segment making up 60% of bookings.Oppenheimer’s Timothy Horan also points out that while there had been some concern regarding the recently announced Digital Realty (DLR) and InterXion (INXN) merger, it makes EQIX “well-positioned as the only pure-play interconnectivity focused data center”. He notes that as its competitors undergo a complicated integration, there will be a window to take market share.  All of this prompted the five-star analyst to not only keep a Buy rating but also to bump up the price target to $650. At this new target, shares could rise 18% over the next twelve months. (To watch Horan’s track record, click here)      Similarly, other Wall Street analysts take a bullish approach when it comes to EQIX. 12 Buys and 1 Hold assigned in the last three months give it a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus. Its $611 average price target indicates 11% upside potential. (See Equinix stock analysis on TipRanks) ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW)  Originally an IT service automation tool, ServiceNow has become one of the top providers of cloud-based solutions that tracks service issues within businesses as they come up. With shares moving 46% higher year-to-date, Wall Street has its eyes on NOW.Despite facing foreign exchange (FX) headwinds, the company posted a beat in terms of EPS, subscription billings as well as subscription revenue, which is up 33% year-over-year. Its guidance for fiscal Q4 2019 was also generally better than analysts expected.   Most notably, management addressed the misinformation circling around the Street. Incoming CEO Bill McDermott tells investors that the current situation is much brighter than some may think, citing its “pristine” platform and “amazing” organic growth story. Its CFO search is in fact coming to a conclusion, with a decision expected soon. There also hasn’t been a change to employee attribution rates as 97 out of the top 100 sales staff are staying put. This helped reaffirm Macquarie analyst Sarah Hindlian’s conclusion that NOW is still a Buy. “We are highly confident in ServiceNow’s global strategic positioning and believe an opportunity for entry exists,” she commented. As a result, the four-star analyst attached an increased price target of $336 to her bullish call. This updated target conveys her confidence in NOW’s ability to jump 29% in the next twelve months. (To watch Hindlian’s track record, click here)  Like Hindlian, the rest of the Street is impressed. NOW is a ‘Strong Buy’ based on the 18 Buy ratings and 2 Holds issued in the last three months. In addition, its $229 average price target brings the upside potential to 15%. (See ServiceNow stock analysis on TipRanks) The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL)The global makeup and beauty name has taken some heat recently thanks to a fiscal 2020 outlook reset. That being said, one analyst believes that EL’s growth narrative remains strong, with further gains on top of its already achieved 47% year-to-date growth expected.Part of the concern is related to EL’s 100 basis point reduction in its guidance for global beauty market growth as a whole. This has been blamed on U.S. makeup weakness, as well as some deceleration in China and the travel retail space. However, Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein argues that EL has a lot more going for it than the Street realizes. “China actually accelerated (as did the broader Asia-Pacific corridor) supporting the view argued in our initiation, that growth from China will remain stronger for longer than investors appreciate,” he explained.Ottenstein adds that foundation, or makeup applied to the skin for a more natural look, drove the 4% net makeup sales increase, with skincare sales also ramping up. This is important as skincare margins are 4x higher than makeup and foundations maintain the highest consumer loyalty compared to all other types of makeup. Bearing this in mind, the analyst reiterated his bullish call and $230 price target, suggesting shares could surge 20% over the next twelve month period. (To watch Ottenstein’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, 8 Buy ratings vs 3 Holds add up to a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus. On top of this, its $218 average price target puts the potential twelve-month gain at 14%.

2019-11-05	2019-11-05 18:16:29	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	5 REITs That Make the Cloud Pay You Dividends	Most investors know about tech stocks that have harnessed the cloud for growth, such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Amazon.com (AMZN).But are you familiar with the cloud's landlords?&quot;Cloud czars&quot; don't operate entirely on their own. There's a huge industry in connecting these clouds to each other, and to large and small customers alike. It requires cell towers, data centers and other communications technology.A number of real estate investment trusts (REITs) specialize in properties and other assets that ensure your tablet can stream Netflix (NFLX) content and that your company's data is secured in the cloud. As a reminder: REITs are a special type of business structure - one that requires at least 90% of taxable income be paid out to shareholders as dividends, in exchange for generous tax benefits.Many of these stocks have risen by leaps and bounds in 2019, though they're getting expensive as a result. Still, they sit smack-dab in the middle of a growth industry, and some of them remain valuable as takeover targets. Private equity firms EQT Partners and Digital Colony Partners bought fiber network owner Zayo Group for $8 billion in May. And in October, Digital Realty Trust (DLR) bought European data center giant Interxion (INXN) for $8.4 billion.Here are five REITs that can help you squeeze dividends out of the cloud. If you're looking for a broad-based play on the industry, the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF (SRVR) invests in 20 such companies. However, these five holdings stand out among the rest. SEE ALSO: 20 Dividend Stocks to Fund 20 Years of Retirement	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-reits-cloud-pay-dividends-181629350.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-02	2019-10-02 19:06:12	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	Equinix Nears Deal to Buy Axtel's Mexico Data Centers	(Bloomberg) -- Equinix Inc. is in advanced talks to buy Mexican telecom firm Axtel SAB’s data centers for around $200 million, according to people familiar with the matter, a deal that would give the real estate investment trust a foothold for expansion in Latin America’s second-largest economy.The Redwood City, California-based company could soon announce a deal for a majority stake in the business, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. Axtel plans to keep a minority stake, they said.No decision has been made and the talks could fall through, they added.Representatives from Equinix and Alfa SAB, Axtel’s parent company, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The deal would give Equinix a base in Mexico to challenge local providers such as Carlos Slim, the billionaire who controls America Movil SAB. Mexico overhauled its telecommunications regulations in 2013 to introduce more competition, but rivals including AT&T Inc. and Telefonica SA have struggled to whittle away at Slim’s dominance.Equinix plans to aggressively expand in Mexico, using Axtel’s data centers as the foundation of its business in the country, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Equinix doesn’t have any data centers in Mexico, though it has some in Brazil and Colombia, according to its website.The deal would be one of only a handful of major deals announced in Mexico since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won election last year and shook the confidence of investors with a series of moves, such as canceling an airport project and cutting off private investment in the energy sector.Axtel has been selling parts of its business to focus on providing services to businesses and government clients.Axtel has been looking for a buyer for a majority stake in its data centers since last year, Chief Executive Officer Rolando Zubrian said in a conference call in April. Its data centers, located in Queretaro and Monterrey, generate about $15 million annual earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization, he said.Equinix and other data center owners have been seeking to expand globally through acquisitions, as companies increasingly rely on third parties to manage their data. In April, the company purchased a data center business in Amsterdam for 30 million euros (34 million).Equinix has a network of 200 data centers in 52 markets in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific regions, according to its annual report.&#92;--With assistance from Andrea Navarro.To contact the reporters on this story: Michael O'Boyle in Mexico City at moboyle7@bloomberg.net;Liana Baker in New York at lbaker75@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brad Olesen at bolesen3@bloomberg.net, Matthew Monks, Michael HythaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equinix-nears-deal-buy-axtels-190612279.html?.tsrc=rss

It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]When most investors hunt for dividend stocks, the technology sector is often not on their shopping list. The perception is that most technology firms need and are forced to plow every extra cent back into their businesses in order to fuel growth. As a result, tech stocks are seen as a strictly capital appreciation element for a portfolio.However, this isn't true at all. Tech stocks make for amazing dividend stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe reality is, that many firms in the tech sector are cash flow and profit machines. Thanks to surging revenues and high margins, mature tech firms simply mint money at this point. So much, in fact, that many have too much money sitting on their balance sheets. To rid themselves of that excess cash, many tech stocks have started paying some hefty dividends. And they have been growing those dividends by leaps and bounds too.In the end, when looking for dividend stocks, the technology sector should be the first stop for portfolios rather than an afterthought. But which tech stocks have what it takes to be considered good dividend stocks as well?  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip Here are five that are worthy of consideration. Cisco (CSCO)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.8%No list of dividend stocks in the tech sector can be written without the firm that started the modern trend of payouts from tech. We're talking about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). CSCO started paying a token dividend back in 2011 and hasn't looked back, growing that payout by more than 480%. And it's easy to see why Cisco has become such a dividend stalwart.Sensing a slowdown in networking, router and physical equipment sales, CSCO started to pivot into more software and services. Cloud computing, cybersecurity and other such products have quickly become big-time money makers for the firm. Perhaps, more importantly, these sales come with higher margins, reoccurrence and the ability to add value/upsell networking transactions. &quot;We just built you this massive network for your cloud operations. Would you like us to secure it as well?&quot;Because of this, CSCO has become a cash flow giant.In fiscal Q3  alone, the firm managed to generate a 16% jump in operating cash flows once adjusting to overseas taxes paid for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Meanwhile, cash on CSCO's balance sheet has swelled to more than $34.6 billion.With sales of software/services continuing to rise, CSCO should be able to keep bringing in the cash for the long haul. Even better is that the growth in data centers and 5G networking is once again boosting equipment sales.At the end of the day, Cisco is one of the best dividend stocks to buy -- tech sector or not. Seagate Technology (STX)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.5%Like previously mentioned Cisco, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) may seem like a relic from the dot-com days. However, STX has managed to see plenty of new life in recent years. The key is data center demand is making one heck of a dividend stock.For many years after the dot-com bust, STX struggled. The rise of mobile and tablet computing crimped PC sales. At the same time, flash-based solid-state drives (SSD) hit Seagate's platter-based hard disk drives (HDDs) right in the wallet. SSDs are faster, smaller, and more power-efficient. Manufacturers liked these facts and started favoring them in PCS and other devices. As a result, STX stocks stagnated and was looking like a lost cause.That is until cloud computing and data center demand started to take over.It turns out, those building out networks and data centers prefer capacity over speed. That makes HHDs much better suited for this application. Since Seagate dove into SSD production -- like rival Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) -- it's been able to reap the full benefits of this expansion. In fiscal 2019, STX managed to produce $1.8 billion in cash flow from operations and $1.8 billion of free cash flows from higher drive demand.  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip And naturally, Seagate has been rewarding investors with that extra cash. Today, shares yield a tech-sector high 4.5%. Apple (AAPL)Source:  Yuanbin Du Via FlickrDividend Yield: 1.4%$95 billion.That's a big number. It also happens to be the amount of cash Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has on its balance sheet. This makes the consumer tech company one of the most cash-rich firms on the planet. That fact alone could make it a big buy. But the fact that Apple has quickly become one of the leading dividend stocks and continues to increase its buyback programs makes it a big buy right now.The key is that Apple has been able to use its vast cadre of devices to sell apps, music, movies and games. This helps Apple produce plenty of cash flows. Meanwhile, its shift into various services and other add-ons for its customers have only enhanced its cash flows further. So, even though AAPL has been handing out plenty of cash to investors, its over cash balance continues to hover over that $200 billion mark. Last year, Apple spent more than $74 billion on buybacks and raised its dividend by roughly 5.5%.With new devices hitting the markets and a focus on building out content for those devices, Apple should have no problem growing that cash balance far into the future. That should make dividend investors happy. And while there are some risks with revenue slowdowns and Chinese trade, that massive cash pile provides such a huge cushion to keep the dividend grow going.With that, Apple is still one of the best dividend stocks to buy. Equinix (EQIX)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.8%One of the biggest trends in tech continues to be the growth of cloud computing and mobile access. Any time you use an app to go shopping or check your bank balance, you're tapping into a data center far away. It turns out that's a very good business to be in. Just ask Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX).EQIX is the world's largest owners of these data centers -- with more than 200 under its umbrella. The key is that EQIX doesn't actually own or really operate the centers, it's a real estate investment trust (REITs). That is, it owns the specialized buildings and rents space inside to firms to build their required computing needs. It's essentially an apartment building owner for computers.Given the continued surge in data center demand from e-commerce, cloud computing, and mobile operations, EQIX has been sitting pretty over the last few years. In Q2, its net income jumped 22%  versus Q1. This continues the REIT's string of strong performance.The data center giant has paid plenty of special stock dividends to its shareholders and has managed to grow its cash payout by 45% since 2014.  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip With continued demand for data centers assured, EQIX is the best dividend stock to play tech's backbone. Shares currently yield 1.8%. First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend ETF (TDIV)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.4%Considering that this list didn't even touch such amazing tech dividend stocks like Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or even Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN), one approach could be to think broad. There are plenty of tech ETFs on the market, but only the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend ETF (NYSEArca:TDIV) tackles the sector with a dividend approach.The $1 billion fund tracks an index that screens for tech stocks that have paid a regular or common dividend within the past 12 months and haven't cut the payout either. This provides exposure to all the top names in tech that pay dividends -- currently at 92 different stocks. This includes all the names on this list as well. That focus also throws off a surprising amount of income as well. Today, TDIV has an SEC 30-day yield of nearly 3.17%. That's' better than the S&P 500 and current yields on Treasury bonds.And as a total return component, TDIV has been top notch. Since its inception in 2012, the ETF has roughly doubled in share price and managed to produce an average annual return of around 12%. That's around the same as the S&P 500. The key is that TDIV has been less volatile than the broader index. Less volatile than all the tech stocks in the broader index as well. The secret is in the power of the dividends.All in all, for investors looking to score some hefty dividends from tech and take advantage of the sector's growth, TDIV could be the best way to capture those benefits.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not have a position in any stock mentioned.

Alibaba Stock Will Be Just Fine Without Jack Ma	Jack Ma retired on September 10 as executive chairman of Alibaba Group (NASDAQ:BABA) to become Bill Gates. (Or, maybe, Andrew Carnegie.)Source: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com The Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder retired at age 58 to become a full-time philanthropist and student of the world. Carnegie eventually gave away his entire fortune, worth $76 billion in 2019 dollars. Ma is retiring at age 55, he says to become a teacher.After building a company many liken to Jeff Bezos' Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Ma leaves a company at a crossroads under his chosen successor, Daniel Zhang.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe crossroads is between China and the world. Its way forward is the cloud. Alibaba GlobalAlibaba's base of China suffers from a depreciating currency, which the government is being forced to prop up. It's the primary victim of the Trump trade war, which is slowing growth.  * 7 Best Stocks That Crushed It This Earnings Season But BABA has a way out. Alibaba's cloud, launched in 2009, is going global rapidly. It's expanding into Europe and dominating in Asia where it has a 19% marketshare, eclipsing even Amazon, with services in 15 different regions.Among Alibaba's latest partners is Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), a $46 billion cloud landlord whose shares are up 53% so far in 2019. Alibaba is now providing services in the U.S. through alliances with companies like Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), privately-held WordPress and International Business Machine's (NYSE:IBM) Red Hat unit.While Amazon offers infrastructure and Microsoft offers a platform, Alibaba is providing a full application stack, including financial and database applications. Its targets aren't just big enterprises, but small businesses for which it will take their entire data and computing budget as they grow.Zhang now says cloud will be &quot;Alibaba's main business in the future.&quot; That's a real change for Zhang. His first Alibaba strategy was known as &quot;New Retail.&quot; He bought supermarkets and shopping centers, making the company look more like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to the average Chinese consumer. Alibaba NumbersEven having delayed its Hong Kong offering due to the continuing crisis there, Alibaba is the 7th most valuable company in the world by market cap. It trails only the five U.S. &quot;Cloud Czars&quot; and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A).After a rough May, the shares are still up nearly 30% on the year. They carry a price to earnings multiple of 50 and bring about 23% of revenue to the net income line. For its first fiscal quarter, reported in August, Alibaba had net income of nearly $2.8 billion, $1.17 per share, on revenue of $16.7 billion. That's a net income gain of 146% on just 42% more revenue.Cloud revenue was up 66%, while core commerce revenue was up just 44%, with much of that coming from logistics and consumer services. The numbers sent the stock up 11.6% over the last month, despite continuing tensions. The Bottom Line for BABA StockMa's retirement and birthday ceremony was held in the football stadium of his hometown. There he said he hopes to engage in projects that avoid any connection to politics.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September But he's too big for that.

2019-07-30	2019-07-30 11:00:00	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	Blockchain.com Enters Crypto Trading With New London-Based Exchange	(Bloomberg) -- Blockchain.com, which has created more than 40 million digital-asset wallets, is moving into the trading side of cryptocurrencies with a new exchange.The Pit, a London-based marketplace, will offer Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, Tether, Litecoin and Paxos. Customers can deposit funds immediately, with trading beginning soon. The idea came from the the boom-and-bust cycle of 2017 and 2018, when exchange performance was spotty at best, Blockchain.com Chief Executive Officer Peter Smith said in an interview.“After that cycle we stepped back and said, ‘What do we need to do differently next time?’ That’s when you start reinvesting,” Smith said. “We wanted to build a Wall Street or a Chicago-level matching engine,” he said, referring to software that pairs buyers and sellers.Exchanges for the $248 billion cryptocurrency market have a woeful record of hacks, thefts, fraud and mismanagement stretching to 2014 when 850,000 Bitcoins were stolen from Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin site at the time. Services to keep digital coins safe, known as custody, have been slow to develop.The Pit will execute orders in under 50 microseconds, compared with 200 to 500 milliseconds at most crypto exchanges, Smith said. He declined to identify any banks working with Blockchain.com, saying only that lenders will allow customers to deposit U.S. dollars, euros and British pounds on to the exchange.New Crypto Exchanges Don’t Want (to Hold) Your Money: QuickTakeThe exchange’s servers will reside in the Equinix LD4 facility in London, allowing connections to most of the world’s largest banks and investors.To help build the market, Blockchain.com brought in Nicole Sherrod as head of trading products. She spent more than 20 years in online brokerages and helped build the Think or Swim trading system at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.“I thought I was retired,” Sherrod said in an interview. Then, looking at the crypto marketplace, “I realized there was a tremendous opportunity to do work there.”Sherrod said she watched as order books dried up and market-makers stepped away during the intensely volatile markets of 2017 when “reliability was a big issue, and then liquidity.” Since then, there hasn’t been much news about digital exchanges improving their systems and robustness, she said.Blockchain.com claims that 25% of all Bitcoin transactions originate with one of its wallets. The company will encourage users to keep their digital coins in their wallets rather than on the exchange, Smith said.“The promise of crypto is direct bearer assets” that form “the basis of a self-sovereign economy,” Smith said. The exchange is “an investment in the future of the crypto market.”To contact the reporter on this story: Matthew Leising in Los Angeles at mleising@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

2019-07-28	2019-07-28 01:00:09	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	Protest Breaches Threaten Hong Kong’s Digital Hopes	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Hong Kong’s ambitions to be an international data-center hub are a potential casualty of the city’s mass protests. Privacy breaches stemming from a summer of clashes between demonstrators and police threaten to erode confidence in the city as a base for foreign companies to set up storage facilities. To alleviate concerns, the government needs to improve security and regulation in the handling of sensitive data.Last month, dozens of protesters were arrested after being treated in the emergency ward of a public hospital following battles with riot police. The city’s Hospital Authority subsequently denied leaking patient data – despite the discovery of an internal document labeled “for police” that listed names of protesters seeking medical treatment, according to the South China Morning Post. At around the same time, the personal information of more than 800 police officers was hacked and released online.Data centers are a fast-growing market, valued at $31 billion globally in 2017 and forecast by Zion Market Research to grow 14% annually to reach $105 billion by 2026. In Hong Kong, total revenue for data centers is expected to reach $1 billion this year, with three firms sharing 55% of the market: Japan’s NTT Communications Corp.; Sunevision Holdings Ltd., a unit of local developer Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd.; and Silicon Valley-based Equinix Inc.The Hong Kong government has targeted the industry for growth, and the city has many advantages that make it an attractive location. The former British colony has a common-law legal system that’s recognized and trusted across the Western world, and its data-privacy laws are among the strictest in Asia. In addition, Hong Kong sits at the mouth of the Greater Bay Area, a grouping of 11 cities with a population of 69 million and annual GDP of $1.5 trillion that China plans to develop into an economic bloc. For multinationals, storing data in Hong Kong bypasses red tape and potential legal minefields in mainland China.Besides its legal system and geographic position, Hong Kong is well equipped with a highly reliable power supply – averaging only 1.5 minutes of unplanned power outages per year, according to one of the city’s two main electricity providers. This compares with 17 to 28 minutes in other major cities such as New York, Sydney and London. Consistent power enables strong broadband capacity and an established fiber-optic network. Another boast is Hong Kong’s low latency transfer in cloud computing – the speed at which information travels from place to place.The government has supported construction of data centers, by offering large financial incentives for companies to set up shop and specifying three locations to build such facilities. Unlike technology hubs such as Silicon Valley, these locations were intentionally set aside to accommodate the sector – no small feat, considering the diminishing supply of available land. Last year, Sunevision bought the last designated plot with a winning bid of $697 million – 45% higher than the estimate of Colliers International Group Inc., the South China Morning Post reported.The sale highlighted the perceived growth prospects for Hong Kong's data-center business. Companies such as Nvidia Corp. and Digital Realty Trust Inc. are also eyeing Hong Kong for expansion opportunities (though the city’s land shortages and red-hot property market may make that easier said than done).These advantages may count for little unless the government sustains confidence in the ability and willingness of authorities to protect data privacy. The leaking by hospitals of protesters’ identities – an apparently blatant privacy breach – caused widespread unease. In the case of the police hack, eight people were eventually charged with dishonest intent and criminal destruction. Still, the ease with which the intrusion took place shocked politicians and the public. Fears of further breaches could scare businesses away.Hong Kong needs to strengthen its data-security laws or risk international companies abandoning the city for more privacy-oriented locations, according to Padraig Walsh, a partner at legal firm Tanner De Witt who focuses on fintech and data privacy. Having been in the vanguard when it passed the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance in 1996, Hong Kong has been overtaken by jurisdictions such as the European Union, which adopted its General Data Protection Regulation in 2017, Walsh said.To remain competitive, the government should consider amending the Hong Kong ordinance to require data users to report breaches and to give the Privacy Commissioner stronger enforcement powers. Singapore will update its privacy laws next year, according to Walsh. If Hong Kong doesn’t adapt, companies will go elsewhere.(Ronald W.

2019-06-19	2019-06-19 19:28:58	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	Best ETFs for 2019: Financial Sector Spider ETF (XLF) Still Has a Chance	Editor's Note: This article is part of InvestorPlace.com's Best ETFs for 2019 contest. Dana Blankenhorn's pick is Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF).At the start of 2019, when we relaunched our best exchange-traded funds feature, I thought the market was getting frothy and chose to get defensive with the Financial Sector Spider ETF (NYSEARCA:XLF).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo far, that's up 15%. Pretty fly for an old guy. But folks who were more aggressive have done better. The editor of this section, Robert Waldo, has more than doubled me up with his choice, the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:SRVR). SRVR has big holdings in technology landlords like American Tower (NYSE:AMT), which owns most of those big cell towers you love, and Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), a data center REIT that connects the clouds.Can the big banks come back? Look for ConsolidationHope for a comeback lies in consolidation. The merger of BB&T (NYSE:BBT) and SunTrust (NYSE:STI) to create something called Truist is making investors money. It's a big win for Charlotte, which will be the new bank's headquarters, and a loss for my hometown of Atlanta, where SunTrust is based.The Prosperity Bancshares (NYSE:PB) acquisition of LegacyTexas Financial Group (NASDAQ:LTXB) in Dallas gave that state its first big locally owned bank in decades. By such standards it's still a minnow. Total assets will be about $30 billion (SunTrust alone is worth seven times more) but if this is the start of a trend, then XLF investors should benefit. That's because takeovers fuel speculation about more takeovers, leading speculators to feed on potential targets and bankers to start whispering sweet nothings of profit in other bankers' ears.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever  Banks Are Payment ProcessorsIn general, however, banks remain subject to the same computerization trend facing other service-based businesses like insurance and real estate. Don't let your kid think he can grow up to sit behind a desk with pillars at either side and a swinging gate in front of him. That's a game for lawyers.I have only been in banks a few times in the last year … once to visit my safety deposit box and another time to use a notary. (You probably thought I was going to say bathroom.) There was a time when I regularly visited my broker's office to deposit checks into my market account, but there's an app for that now.Willie Sutton, the bank robber who supposedly said banks &quot;are where the money is,&quot; would today be a geeky hacker, because that's where the money is in banking today. It's in programming.Why sit in front of a banker when you can just borrow through Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital -- they have all your financial figures anyhow. On the other hand, the biggest banks are also the biggest payment processors. They're not going to let that business go without a fight.Expect more deals. Bottom Line on the XLF ETFThe bottom line is that as money continues to become magnetic ink, banks will remain under pressure to consolidate and run off to the dog track with the depositors' money. The likelihood of more scandals like that of Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), once seen as a Donald Trump-era darling, is only going to grow.It all comes down to a new sobering reality. Banks are about to become the new stock market casino. But casinos make good money. And if your kid grew up as a geeky programmer type, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is hiring.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-05-21	2019-05-21 13:03:03	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	5 Data Center REITs to Buy That Deliver Sizable Income	[Editor's note: This story was previously published in April 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]A real estate investment trust (REIT) is dedicated first to income. It is required to send 90% of earnings back to investors in the form of dividends. This means it's unusual to find REITs that also offer capital gains. But I've found REITs to buy whose prices tend to rise over time .Data Center REITs offer hosting, colocation and cloud on-ramps to enterprises and Internet Service Providers. They act as a sort of glue among the Cloud Czars, like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you do a Google search for something and then buy it on Amazon, the request and response likely went through a data center owned by a REIT. The data centers hosted by REITs aren't all cloud-based, but they usually require connections to clouds.The colocation market alone continues to grow at 10% each year, driven by the needs of the Cloud Czars, according to Synergy Research. This was a $34 billion market last year.It's part of a larger trend in which the Cloud Czars are taking over the telecommunications market.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential If you're seeking both income and capital gains, you can find both in data center REITs. Here are some good data center REITs to buy Equinix (EQIX)Source: Shutterstock Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) was founded in Redwood City, California in 1998 and has focused on global services almost since its inception. It has a market cap of $40 billion, and last year delivered $9.84 per share in dividends to its shareholders.To a current buyer that's a yield of just 2.17%. But five years ago, the stock was trading at $172 per share. Yesterday it closed at $480. If you bought some shares five years ago, the current dividend would give you a yield of 5.75%. Plus, there's that capital gain, almost 30% per year, doubling what you would have gotten from the average NASDAQ stock.This is key to successful income investing. Don't just focus on the current yield. Let time work for you. If you're on the right side of a trend, you are almost certain to prosper.Last year, Equinix had revenue of $5.09 billion, up from $2.44 billion in 2014, and it brought $365 million of that to the bottom line. The asset base has more than doubled, to $20.24 billion, and while there is $9.44 billion in debt on those assets, the debt-to-asset ratio has been improving.Equinix continues to grow its international footprint, most recently with a new Australian center. Its DC1 building in Virginia was the first large greenfield center to open, 20 years ago, back when such centers were mainly selling themselves as a way for corporations to speed data flows for things like video conferencing, or as alternatives to the Network Access Points (NAPs) that then dominated internet switching.Equinix is not a huge acquirer, its most recent buy being Metronode in 2017.  But that means that other companies' shareholders aren't getting a big chunk of your gains and that the stock isn't being watered down with new shares.All this makes Equinix one of the best data center REITs to buy. Digital Realty Trust (DLR)Source: Shutterstock Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) was formed as a public company in 2004 out of 21 data centers acquired out of bankruptcy by GI Partners, a private equity firm. It now has 214 centers with 34.5 million square feet of rentable space in the U.S. and Europe.As of yesterday's close it had a market cap of $26 billion, and last year delivered $4.32 per share in dividends to investors. That's a yield of 3.55%. Add a 19% one-year gain in the stock price and you get a total return of about 22%. Over the last five years, the stock is up 137%, and if you bought in 2014, when the price of the stock was about $60 per share, your current yield is about 7.2%.In 2018, Digital Realty had revenue of slightly over $3 billion, with net income of $341 million, meaning 11% of revenues became net income. The company's assets are worth over $23.7 billion, with $11.1 billion in debt, a slight improvement over 2014. Operating cash flow has also doubled.The company's biggest deal came in 2017, a $7.8 billion agreement to buy DuPont Fabros Technology. But the company quickly came back for more, buying Ascently, based in Brazil, last year for $1.8 billion. The company also broke ground last month for its third center in Singapore.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential Brad Thomas of iREIT Investor notes that, while Digital Realty is an aggressive acquirer of data centers, it doesn't account for acquisitions aggressively, which means it's not stressing its balance sheet at the expense of the long term. Thomas calls Digital Realty's global footprint a big advantage, and its size let it carry $236 million of empty land in fast-growing northern Virginia on its balance sheet. CoreSite Realty (COR)Source: Todd Van Hoosear via Flickr (modified)CoreSite Realty (NYSE:COR) is much smaller than Equinix or Digital Realty, with a market cap of $5.3 billion. CoreSite was born from two &quot;telecom hotels,&quot; as they were called then, in 2001, in San Francisco. It was then called CRG West, and the location was where Internet Service Providers hooked into phone networks, and where enterprises could go for big bandwidth.CoreSite went public in 2009, and then began expanding internationally, starting in London. Its early expansion was funded by the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. They reduced their interest to about 29% in 2016.The small size of CoreSite Realty, relative to Digital Realty and Equinix, does give it some big advantages, in the form of capital gains. The shares are up about 270% in the last five years, while quarterly dividends have tripled from 36 cents per share in 2014 to $1.10 now. That dividend yields a fat 4%.CoreSite is the right stock for you if you're mainly looking for exposure to the U.S. internet market. It is, like the other REITs, a great long-term holding. It's expected to raise the dividend again, to $1.29 per share, later this month. It bills itself as offering &quot;hybrid cloud solutions,&quot; with its close connections to big clouds like Amazon and Microsoft, and colocation services for enterprises building their own cloud systems. QTS Realty Trust (QTS)Source: Gothopotam via Flickr (Modified)Smaller market caps can deliver big gains, as CoreSite shows, but there are downsides. A strategic shift can take a stock down hard.QTS Realty Trust (NYSE:QTS) made that kind of shift in 2017, moving from managed services to being a &quot;cloud on-ramp.&quot; The company insisted the new plan would mean big new opportunities, but these have taken time to develop, with repeated misses on earnings estimates taking a toll on the stock.QTS began life in Kansas, in 2003, expanded into Atlanta through a 2005 acquisition, and now has 25 data centers with 5.7 million square feet of rentable space. QTS went public in 2013 and has since doubled in price, while the quarterly dividend has also doubled to its current 44 cents. That represents a yield of 3.91%, and the company's market cap stands at $2.82 billion.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential There are opportunities here, both in the success of its strategy shift and its continuing weakness, which could make it a prize for a larger company. A single transaction can transform an investor's play from the weakest stock on the block to a big stake in one of the strongest. CyrusOne (CONE)Source: Shutterstock Like QTS Realty Trust, CyrusOne (NASDAQ:CONE) is an underperforming company that is said to be attractive to acquirers. CyrusOne's weakness comes from its history of being privately held.CyrusOne wasn't publicly traded until 2013. Founded in 2001, it was bought by private equity players ABRY Partners in 2007 and then by Cincinnati Bell, a small phone company, in 2010. It went public in 2013 and by 2015 Cincinnati Bell had sold out its stake.The company today has 45 data centers, mostly in the U.S., but it also has operations in Europe and Singapore. It expanded into Europe through the 2018 acquisition of Zenium for $442 million.A business that began with small warehouses in central cities, where phone exchanges interconnected, is now built on finding big parcels of empty land near where cloud giants intend to build. A modern data REIT must acquire land and build ahead of demand, competing with other REITs, private equity companies trying to build new REITs from scratch and the cloud owners themselves.Some speculators are betting CONE will be acquired, which keeps the price of the stock up.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-26	2019-03-26 11:25:36	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	Best ETFs for 2019: Pacer Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF Is a Leader	This article is a part of InvestorPlace's Best ETFs for 2019 contest. Robert Waldo's pick for the contest is the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:SRVR).As of this writing, the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:SRVR) is in the No.1 spot for our best ETFs for 2019 contest, up 20% year-to-date.All of the exchange-traded funds are in the green and it's a close race, with a tie for second place as I write this. But regardless of the success of other ETFs riding on SRVR's tail, I still believe this 5G ETF will come out on top at the end of the year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe SRVR ETF is one of the best ETFs to buy this year because it's a well-rounded play on an upcoming trend that will affect how the world operates for years to come.I'm talking about 5G -- &quot;the next generation of cellular connectivity&quot; that will make the most exciting and futuristic tech ideas possible. To get an idea of how fast 5G is compared to 4G LTE, consider that 4G LTE's top speed is 1GB per second, while 5G will have a top speed of 20 GB per second -- a 2,000% increase!  * 7 5G Stocks to Buy as the Race for Spectrum Tightens While these top speeds won't be obtained consistently, they still signify a significant leap in speed that will help make our hyper-connected, high-tech world operate much quicker and more efficiently. This 5G ETF Is Not Just About 5GBut as hype-worthy of a trend as 5G may be, that's not all that SRVR has going for it. In fact, part of my decision to pick this fund for our best ETFs contest was that it's a real estate investment trust (REIT) ETF. This means its holdings own data centers and fiber that are vital to the 5G rollout, but are also necessary for all of our current, general tech-related luxuries like the cloud.Without SRVR's holdings, our day-to-day, tech-obsessed lifestyle would be much different.And that's the key reason why it's one of the best ETFs to buy: Its holdings are necessary with or without the 5G catalyst, which makes it a safe, long-term play with significant growth potential.The companies that make up SRVR's top holdings, like American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) and Equinix Inc (NASDAQ:EQIX), provide the infrastructure that enables our current connectivity, but each of these will gain a significant boost as 5G is adopted in the years ahead and the need for more fiber, cell towers, etc., becomes a reality.Its design as a REIT ETF also means that it comes with a hefty 3.7% dividend yield, which will help provide steady income to investors as 5G expands over the years. And all this for an expense ratio of 0.6%.All of these perks add up to SRVR's current success as the best performing ETF in our contest right now. But no matter the end result, you can bet that this will be a strong 5G ETF to buy for many years.Robert Waldo is an Assitant Editor for InvestorPlace.

2019-01-09	2019-01-09 20:34:06	EQIX	Equinix, Inc.	10 Tech Stocks That Pay You Dividends to Own Them	"The name of the game in investing is &quot;total return.&quot; When you buy a stock, your total return comes from two places - price appreciation and dividends. For the longest time tech stocks were never mentioned hand-in-hand with dividend stocks. Pick up Amazon.com (AMZN) for $300, sell half at a thousand bucks a few years later, and you're sitting on free shares worth $1,600 each a year after that. That's the blueprint!

Many tech stocks used to offer share splits as their prices rocketed higher. However many technology companies are maturing, and with breakneck growth in the rear-view mirror, and they need a different way to draw investors. The answer, for many, has been to start delivering dividends, paying investors for owning their shares.

To be clear, tech stocks that pay dividends aren't done growing. The increased presence of technology in all aspects of human life means that there's still plenty of upside, even for Wall Street's biggest tech companies. To wit, old-guard blue chip Microsoft (MSFT) has surpassed Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) in market value this year, and it's neck-and-neck with Amazon.

Here are 10 tech stocks that offer an ideal combination of dividends and growth potential. They might not be the flashiest names in the sector, but they deserve attention nonetheless.
