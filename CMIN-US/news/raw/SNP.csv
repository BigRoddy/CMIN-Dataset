That’s more than the station’s total emissions. Sinopec, officially known as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., said surplus power will go to external grids.The top oil refiner in China has been pouring investments into the energy transition as the country seeks to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060. Sinopec is running about 160 solar plants in provinces including Hainan and Guangdong, and wants to become carbon-neutral 10 years before China’s target.“The project appears to be more than just a pilot scheme, and Sinopec should have figured out the way to ensure positive profits for these stations,” according to Daiwa Capital Markets analyst Dennis Ip. He added that profitability may still be partly compromised due to costs for energy transition.The state-owned company also wants to become China’s top hydrogen company with 1,000 hydrogen refueling stations by 2025, and operate 7,000 solar plants by then.Still, despite China’s green push, oil and gas production and the use of other fossil-fuel sources including coal are still set to rise in the near term amid efforts to ensure energy security.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sinopec-opens-first-gas-station-034934928.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-05	2021-05-05 09:08:01	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	Six Reasons Asia's Oil Refiners Aren't Going Away Anytime Soon	(Bloomberg) -- Predictions of peak oil and the impending demise of fossil fuels will hit Asian oil refiners especially hard. The region is home to three of the top four oil-guzzling nations, and more than a third of global crude processing capacity. Yet, Asian refiners are expanding at a breakneck pace, even building massive new plants designed to run for at least half a century.What is going on?After a century of powering the world’s vehicles, oil refiners are having to plan for an oil-free future in mobility as cars begin switching to batteries, ships burn natural gas, and innovation brings on other energy sources such as hydrogen. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicts oil demand for transportation will peak as early as 2026.Yet, even as a slew of headlines announce oil major BP Plc selling its prized Alaskan fields or Royal Dutch Shell Plc pulling the plug on refineries from Louisiana to the Philippines, Asia’s big refineries are planning for a much longer transition. Chinese refining capacity has nearly tripled since the turn of the millennium, and the nation will end more than a century of U.S. dominance this year. And China’s capacity will continue climbing – to about 20 million barrels a day by 2025, from 17.4 million barrels at the end of 2020. India’s processing is also rising rapidly and could jump by more than half to 8 million barrels a day in the same time.“Asia is going to be the center of global activity and hence the choices that are being made in Asia about pioneering cleaner technology development, or not, are very important,” said Jeremy Bentham, vice president of global business environment at Royal Dutch Shell Group. “Economic development is going to be very Asian centered, hence the consumption of energy will be very Asian centered and hence then the opportunity to take a lead in deploying clean technologies is there.”Refiners have begun the long path of reinventing their business. There has been a flurry of announcements from processors in South Korea, China and India in the past few months about ‘net-zero’ targets, switching to hydrogen and capturing carbon. But behind those promises is a business model that will continue to rely for several decades on rising demand for traditional vehicle fuels and even faster growth in the use of petrochemicals and plastics.“Energy transition is happening in many ways already,” said Sushant Gupta, research director for Asia Pacific refining and oil markets at Wood Mackenzie. “But in Asia, over the next two decades, we still see transport fuel demand. It will be slower, but will still be there.”Here, then, is a roadmap for Asian oil refiners to make it to 2100 by adapting their businesses in stages.1. Keep making gasolineGasoline and diesel for vehicles may be the first major product area to vanish from refineries, but it is unlikely to happen soon in Asia. About 3.5 million barrels per day of global capacity will be shuttered by the end of 2023 -- 1 million barrels more than has already been announced, industry consultant FGE predicts. But Asia’s big, new refineries have the advantage of modern facilities, located close to growing markets.Rongsheng Petrochemical Co.’s 800,000 barrels-a- day plant at Zhoushan became fully operational this year and will yield almost 30% transport fuels, mostly gasoline and diesel, and 70% petrochemicals. Hengli Petrochemical began operating its 400,000 barrels-a-day refinery in northeastern China in late 2018, which can produce almost 10 million tons annually of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. While Asian refiners produce more vehicle fuel, processors in the mature Western markets are likely to see demand peak sooner as automakers switch to electric propulsion. Already, Shell’s Convent Louisiana facility, three plants of Marathon Petroleum Corp. and two of Phillips 66 are being either shut down or converted into oil terminals or biofuel plants on concern that gasoline demand will never recover from the pandemic-induced slump. Shell announced on Tuesday an agreement to sell its Puget Sound Refinery as it focuses on sites that have integrated oil refineries and chemical plants -- a bet on the future growth of petrochemicals. Almost 80% of US refinery output on average is gasoline or middle distillates – a category that is mostly diesel, according to the IEA.“There will be closures and there will be the transformation of existing refineries to shift yields from transport fuels to petrochemicals,” Gupta said. Even so, he expects gasoline and diesel yields globally to drop by only 2.5%-3% by 2040.Some fuel markets will last longer than others. While natural gas and alternatives are becoming increasingly important fuels for big ships, it will take decades to wean the armadas of ferries, fishing vessels and small craft off marine diesel. And jet kerosene will probably remain the only viable propulsion for large aircraft until well into the second half of the century.2. Produce more plasticShifting more capacity to plastics and polymers can be done relatively easily using existing plants. Petrochemicals will account for more than a third of global oil demand growth to 2030 and nearly half through 2050, the International Energy Agency predicts.Even if the drive to eliminate single-use plastics revives in a post-Covid world, the demand for other petrochemical products, which include everything from water pipes to nail polish, is predicted to keep rising. Asia’s expanding middle class will drive demand for consumer goods and plastics used in buildings and packaging. Ironically, even manufacturers of autos and airplanes will use more plastic as they strive to lighten vehicles to meet emissions standards, according to FGE.The overall result is that global plastics consumption will rise more than 60% to close to 600 million tons by 2050 from 2019 levels, requiring refiners to produce an additional 7 million barrels a day in feedstock, FGE said.“Petrochemicals will become the new base-load for oil demand, driven by economic growth and rising consumption especially in emerging markets,” Goldman Sachs said last month.China, the biggest market, is leading the transition. The country’s new mega refineries can convert as much as half of their crude oil into petrochemicals, way more than the traditional 10%-15% yield for most processors.In South Korea, home to three of the world’s 10 biggest refining complexes, four new steam crackers will come onstream over the next 4-5 years to make ethylene, the building block for plastics, according to Gupta. India’s Reliance Industries Ltd., which owns the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to replace sales of road fuels like diesel and gasoline, eventually producing only jet fuel and petrochemicals, as part of a plan to reach net zero by 2035. Rival Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s biggest refiner, aims to double petrochemicals output from its nine refineries.3. Switch to hydrogenEventually, markets for traditional transportation fuel will dry up and refiners have already started working on replacements. Perhaps the most promising from the point of view of their traditional business model is hydrogen, which, like gasoline, is a combustible, storable and transportable fuel that could power vehicles of all sizes and types.“Hydrogen is the ultimate green option,” said to S.S.V. Ramakumar, director for research and development at Indian Oil, which is running a pilot project in New Delhi to power buses using hydrogen spiked with natural gas. “But there is a journey for hydrogen to make to attain that status of mainstream energy source.”China’s biggest refiner China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., better known as Sinopec, touted the gas in a recent broadcast on state television, and the National Development and Reform Commission, the nation’s top planning body, selected it as one of the nation’s “future industries.” Sinopec has about 27 pilot hydrogen refueling stations and plans to expand the network to around 1,000 by 2025.“In some cases it will be hydrogen as a gas or liquefied form, and in some cases people are looking at carriers of hydrogen like ammonia, potentially as a fuel for marine,” said Shell’s Bentham.Refiners are already among the biggest hydrogen producers because they use it to remove sulfur from fuels and to maximize production of gasoline and other lighter fuels. With less gasoline needed, some of that hydrogen can be diverted. But current production of the gas is largely powered using fossil sources, with every kilogram of hydrogen producing about 10 kilograms of CO2, according to Ramakumar.Like most companies studying hydrogen, Indian Oil is banking on eventually using electricity from wind, solar and hydro power to make carbon-free hydrogen by electrolysis, but it’s also looking at making the fuel from compressed biogas.Whatever the production method, the cost of making hydrogen needs to drop substantially if it’s to compete commercially with natural gas. That may mean finding places with cheap renewable energy, such as Chile and Saudi Arabia, or relying on improved technology. Under India’s National Hydrogen Energy Mission roadmap, the country could use renewables to make some of the world’s cheapest hydrogen, according to BloombergNEF.4. Make biofuelsHydrogen isn’t the only option. An alternative popular in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia that produce palm oil, is to adapt refineries to produce biofuels. “There are limitations to the amount of vegetation and land available for developing those kinds of fuels, but they are there and they will play a role,” said Shell’s Bentham.Indonesia, the world’s largest palm-oil producer, is planning to produce more biofuels at existing petroleum refineries and also set up dedicated refineries to turn palm oil into biodiesel. It increased the required blend of palm biodiesel to 30% last year. Marathon Petroleum Corp., the largest U.S. refiner, is converting a plant in Dickinson, North Dakota, to make renewable diesel, while Phillips 66’s Rodeo refinery near San Francisco will make fuel from used cooking oil and other fats. Refiners in Asia and across the globe are also investing in a host of technologies in renewables, energy storage and other alternative fuels. Indian Oil is evaluating prototype batteries based on aluminum-air technology with Israeli startup Phinergy. Trials could take six months to a year and, if successful, would lead eventually to a gigawatt-scale manufacturing facility, Ramakumar said.5. Capture carbonEven with the switch to plastics and hydrogen, refineries and the fuels they make will still produce greenhouse gases, so a third part of the plan has to include ways to capture those gases and store or reuse them. The methods to do this have generally been too expensive to be commercial, but rising penalties for CO2 emissions and increased spending on technology are likely to balance the equation.China’s Sinopec aims to have a 1 million ton carbon capture project running by 2025, while Indian Oil plans to turn carbon monoxide and CO2 into ethanol at its Panipat refinery. To get the technology to work, some companies are teaming up with innovative startups. South Korea’s biggest refiner, SK Innovation Co., has joined a carbon capture and storage research project led by Norway-based Sintec.6. Get it rightThe speedy adoption of technologies such as electric vehicles is causing the biggest shock to the oil industry in half a century and navigating a way through the changes that have already begun won’t be easy. There are likely to be far fewer oil refineries in the second half of the century and the ones that survive will need to adapt rapidly and embrace new markets and new production systems. “Refiners can no longer ignore these emerging technologies and no longer can they just rely on traditional refining,” WoodMac’s Gupta said. “Non-conventional ways will become more conventional.”(Adds detail on Shell refinery sale in 11th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/six-reasons-asias-oil-refiners-210016611.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-14	2021-04-14 03:20:25	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	China Clamps Down on Private Oil Refineries to Curb Capacity	(Bloomberg) -- China is clamping down on independent oil refiners in an effort to curb overcapacity and stamp out illegal practices as the central government tries to control one of the country’s fastest-growing industries.The National Development and Reform Commission, the top economic planner, begins inspections this week of more than 50 privately-owned oil refineries, most of them in the eastern province of Shandong, said people with knowledge of the checks.A key reason for the probe is to determine whether processors have closed outdated, polluting equipment demanded by Beijing over the past decade, they said, asking not to be named as the matter is private. Inspectors will also visit plants that are allowed to buy foreign crude to investigate allegations of irregular activities such as tax evasion and illegal resale of the imports, the people said.China is trying to curb overcapacity, a move that could potentially effect the growth of China’s crude imports. Private refiners have caused a seismic shift in the global oil market since Beijing gave them permission to import crude in 2015. While state-run PetroChina Co. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. -- better known as Sinopec -- still account for the majority of the nation’s refining, independent producers processed 3.16 million barrels a day in 2020, rivaling that of Japan or South Korea.“The intensity and depth of this inspection may be greater than any checks before,” Chinese consultancy JLC said in a note. There are large uncertainties on the enforcement and possible problems, it said.A March report by China Energy News, an industry journal run by the state-owned People’s Daily, estimated that excess refining capacity in China could grow to 150 million tons a year by 2025 unless authorities strengthen supervision and implement controls. The report was read by top Chinese leaders and partially triggered the inspections, the people said.The paper said some refineries had been meeting targets to cut capacity by double counting or reporting reductions that had been idled earlier. The NDRC didn’t respond to a fax requesting details of the new probe.Since they began to pop up in the early 1990s, the independent plants have shown a knack for survival. Known as ‘teapots’ because of the shape of early designs, they grew from small clay kilns that began processing oil from fields in Shandong that produced more than state refiners could take.Beijing initially tried to shut them down in a bid to keep the industry in the hands of the state refiners, but local government support and the exploitation of tax loopholes allowed teapots to thrive. Processors in Shandong have been operating near record levels after a sharp rebound from the pandemic in April last year.Shandong’s refineries have been promising to merge and upgrade since at least 2018 in the face of growing competition from state-backed rivals, new private mega-complexes in neighboring provinces, stricter tax rules and reduced access to funding. Key to the industry’s transformation is President Xi Jinping’s campaign to reduce refining as part of efforts to cut emissions.Officials will check whether 17 small refineries in Shandong that were supposed to shut down last year actually halted output, the people familiar with the plans said. The inspections, reported by JLC on April 12, will take from three to five days in each refinery and will be carried out by NDRC officials and industry experts, who will submit their conclusions to top economic officials of the central government, the people said.(Adds analyst comment in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-clamps-down-independent-oil-003000524.html?.tsrc=rss

The company operates about 30,000 service stations, according to its most recent annual report.The ambitious target underscores the emphasis China is putting behind the still-nascent transport technology. The announcement caused Morgan Stanley analysts to raise their forecast for hydrogen stations in the country by 2025 to 2,000 from 580 previously.“Sinopec’s ambitious hydrogen development plan in 2021-2025 will speed up fuel cell penetration significantly,” Morgan Stanley analyst Jack Lu in a report on Monday.Two-thousand stations would be enough to maintain 150,000 to 300,000 fuel-cell vehicles on the road, Lu said. China is targeting to have 1 million fuel-cell vehicles in operation by 2030, according to an energy savings vehicle development plan drafted by authorities, despite only 2,700 such cars selling in the country in 2019.Sinopec also said it plans to boost its solar power capacity, building 7,000 distributed photovoltaic power stations by 2025, when China’s 14th 5-year plan ends.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sinopec-throws-itself-hydrogen-china-042740106.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-19	2021-01-19 09:38:58	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	China’s Virus Flare-Up Before Holiday Stokes Oil Demand Fear	(Bloomberg) -- The resurgence of Covid-19 in China has led to lockdowns and calls for citizens not to travel during the upcoming Lunar New Years holidays, stoking concern that oil and fuel demand will take a near-term hit.People are being encouraged to remain in their cities to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, with some provinces offering cash incentives, or hongbao, and food vouchers to those who choose to stay home. China State Railway Group Co. cut its estimate for the number of travelers over the festive period to 296 million from 407 million amid low train ticket bookings, Xinhua news agency reported. While it’s a significant drop, it’s still higher than 2020.Uncertainties about Chinese demand are starting to flow through to the physical oil market. Some buyers are sitting on the sidelines and that’s contributing to a slump in spot trading sentiment, according to traders, with Russian Far East and Middle Eastern grades selling at narrower premiums to benchmarks.Hundreds of millions of Chinese typically travel during the Lunar New Year period, crowding trains and airports as they return to their hometowns for the festivities. The Ministry of Transport expects a significant drop in travelers over the 40-day period from Jan. 28 to March 8, with commuters shunning long-distance bus rides in favor of other options such as private cars.China was the only major economy to expand last year after the nation largely contained the pandemic within its own borders following strict lockdowns and sweeping testing programs. The latest Covid-19 outbreak is the largest in months and started in the province of Hebei that surrounds Beijing.Demand EasingSome independent refiners in Shandong province are considering cuts to crude processing as fresh lockdowns crimp fuel demand, said Jean Zou, an analyst with Shanghai-based commodities researcher ICIS-China. Margins are likely to be squeezed because they regularly supply fuels to Hebei, where several cities have been sealed off due to the outbreak, including the capital Shijiazhuang.The lockdown has forced China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., also known as Sinopec, to reduce operating rates at its plant in Shijiazhuang to under 66%, according to a refinery official who asked not to be identified because of internal policy. There had been logistical bottlenecks that caused restrictions for inbound and outbound shipments of fuels, the official added.See also: IEA Cuts Oil Demand Forecast as New Lockdowns Temper RecoveryOil markets have recently weakened despite Saudi Arabia’s move to deepen output curbs over the next two months, a timeline that overlaps with peak refinery maintenance in Asia. March-loading cargoes of Russian ESPO crude traded at a premium of $1 to $1.20 a barrel against the Dubai benchmark this week, down from $2.90 to $3.50 agreed last month.Differentials for Middle Eastern grades are also being squeezed, with Abu Dhabi’s Murban trading at a steep discount to its official selling price and Qatar’s Al-Shaheen selling at a much lower premium. An open arbitrage window for flows of U.S. oil into Asia has also exacerbated the weakness.Sales of Angolan crude -- most of which is regularly purchased by Asia -- have been slower so far in January compared with a month earlier, with about a quarter of February-loading cargoes still unsold, according to traders.China’s rebound last year drove a strong recovery in physical markets, with refiners sparking bidding wars at various times for cheap spot cargoes. The recovery led to the nation processing a record volume of crude in 2020.(Updates with details on Sinopec cutting runs in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-virus-flare-holiday-stokes-065753984.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-15	2021-01-15 09:13:37	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	U.S. Targets Xiaomi, Cnooc in Trump’s Late Anti-China Push	(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration blacklisted Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi Corp. for alleged military links along with the country’s third-biggest oil company over its drilling in the South China Sea, part of a final push to ratchet up pressure on Beijing before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.Xiaomi was one of nine firms added to the Defense Department’s list of Chinese military companies, a move that will restrict U.S. investments in its securities. Other firms include state-owned planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, which is central to China’s goal of creating a narrow-body plane that can compete with Boeing Co. and Airbus SE.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department’s move against China National Offshore Oil Corp., the nation’s main deepwater explorer, denies it access to U.S. technologies without specific permission. It follows a December decision to blacklist more than 60 other Chinese companies.Read more: U.S. Blacklists Xiaomi in Widening Push Against China Technology“This measure by the Trump administration once again demonstrates to the public, to the international community, what is unilateralism, double standards and bullying,” China Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a briefing in Beijing on Friday. “The Chinese side will take necessary measures to ensure the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies, and we will stand by our companies, to protect, to uphold their rights and interests in accordance with law.”Spokespeople for Xiaomi, Cnooc and Comac had no immediate comment. China National Aviation, named on the Pentagon list, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The new raft of curbs mark a late push by President Donald Trump to ensure his pressure campaign against China stays in place long after he leaves office next week. While Biden and many Democrats say they oppose Trump’s tactics on China, the restrictions will give the new president increased leverage over Beijing when his team negotiates on trade with leaders of the world’s second-largest economy.Biden’s PledgeBiden has pledged to work with allies to develop a more coherent strategy against China, though it’s not clear whether there’ll be any immediate shifts in policy. Under an executive order signed by Trump last year targeting what it calls China’s abusive business practices, U.S. investors will need to unwind stakes in designated companies by November.Read more: Biden Will Inherit a Strong Hand Against Xi, Thanks to TrumpXiaomi surpassed Apple Inc. in smartphone sales in the third quarter, according to the International Data Corporation. It joined Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index in September after grabbing market share from Huawei Technologies Co. as U.S. sanctions on Huawei deepened.Unless the ban against Xiaomi is reversed, the smartphone maker risks being delisted from U.S. exchanges and deleted from global benchmark indexes. China Mobile Ltd., China Telecom Corp. and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. were removed by MSCI Inc. last week, while S&P Dow Jones Indices will drop Cnooc from its gauges next month.Xiaomi shares closed 10% lower in Hong Kong, while its suppliers also tumbled. FIH Mobile Ltd., which helps it assemble smartphones, plunged 14%. Component suppliers including Largan Precision Co., Sunny Optical Technology Group Co. and AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. also fell. Spreads on Xiaomi’s dollar bonds widened as much as 40 basis points Friday morning, according to credit traders.Cnooc’s listed unit, Cnooc Ltd., fell 1.1% in Hong Kong. Cnooc is the smallest of China’s so-called big three state-owned oil majors after China National Petroleum Corp. and China Petrochemical Corp., also known as Sinopec. The company’s operations in the South China Sea have proved controversial with neighbors because China claims drilling rights in waters far from its borders, and within 200 miles of countries like Vietnam and the Philippines.“China’s reckless and belligerent actions in the South China Sea and its aggressive push to acquire sensitive intellectual property and technology for its militarization efforts are a threat to U.S. national security,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. “Cnooc acts as a bully for the People’s Liberation Army to intimidate China’s neighbors, and the Chinese military continues to benefit from government civil-military fusion policies for malign purposes.”The ListsThe Trump administration has now listed 44 Chinese companies effectively owned by the People’s Liberation Army under a 1999 law, which authorizes the president to potentially impose sanctions on them. Trump signed an order in November barring American investments in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military in a bid to pressure Beijing over what it views as abusive business practices.The Department of Commerce’s blacklist, which was created last year to highlight restrictions on more than 100 businesses connected to China, Venezuela and Russia, is more severe and prohibits American firms from supplying those entities without a license.It was not immediately clear why Cnooc had been added now after it was not included in earlier listings. The ban also doesn’t apply to sales of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and also wouldn’t affect joint ventures between Cnooc and Western companies, a senior administration official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, told reporters in a briefing Thursday.Subsidiaries of Cnooc have stakes in two U.S. shale oil and gas projects, according to Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. The company also has interests in two offshore projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which are being developed alongside partners including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Hess Corp.Other ApplicationsVarious components used in oil drilling can also have military applications, making it unsurprising that Cnooc had been targeted, said Amy Myers Jaffe, a senior fellow for energy at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It’s a hassle for Cnooc, but China has its own oil service industry and offshore industry. It’s probably not as devastating as a company that would lose access to microchips,” she said.Cnooc has been at the center of territorial disputes since 2012, when it invited foreign drillers to explore blocks off Vietnam that Hanoi’s leaders had already awarded to companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and OAO Gazprom.Aerospace company Comac, key to China’s ambitions to deliver locally-made jets to domestic and foreign carriers, relies on U.S. suppliers for about 60% of parts for its C919 passenger aircraft.Read more: Trump Blacklisting Jolts China’s Ambitions to Take on BoeingThe Commerce Department also added Skyrizon to the military end-user list, saying it poses a threat to national security. Ross said the company’s push to acquire and “indigenize” foreign military technologies posed a significant threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. Skyrizon was unable to be reached for comment.“This action serves to warn the export community of Skyrizon’s significant ties to the People’s Liberation Army,” Ross said.(Adds Chinese foreign ministry comments, closes share prices)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-blacklists-xiaomi-oil-giant-225811602.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-04	2021-01-04 11:07:02	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	China Oil Majors May Be U.S. Target After Telcos Delisting	(Bloomberg) -- Chinese oil majors may be next in line for delisting in the U.S. after the New York Stock Exchange said last week it would remove the Asian nation’s three biggest telecom companies.China’s largest offshore oil producer Cnooc Ltd. could be most at risk as it’s on the Pentagon’s list of companies it says are owned or controlled by Chinese military, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Henik Fung. PetroChina Co. and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp., also known as Sinopec, may also be under threat as the energy sector is crucial to China’s military, he said.“More Chinese companies could get delisted in the U.S. and the oil majors could come as the next wave,” said Steven Leung, executive director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. At the same time, the impact of removing the telecom firms is probably minimal as they were thinly traded in the U.S. and they haven’t raised much funds there, he said.A Sinopec spokesperson declined to comment. Cnooc and PetroChina didn’t immediately comment, although Cnooc said in a Hong Kong exchange filing that it was not aware of any reasons for the “unusual” drop in its share price Monday. Cnooc fell 1.8% Monday while PetroChina was unchanged. Sinopec rose 1.7%.The three firms are mostly traded in Hong Kong, although they each have American depositary receipts listed in New York. Trading volumes are much higher in Hong Kong, according to exchange data. Cnooc’s ADRs fell 1.8% at 6:05 a.m. New York time in premarket trading, while PetroChina and Sinopec hadn’t traded.“The bottom line is the impact will be very limited,” said Neil Beveridge, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in Hong Kong. “Most institutional investors invest through the Hong Kong shares rather than the U.S. ADRs. The biggest downside for investors would be the loss of transparency from SEC filings.”Cnooc’s appearance on the Pentagon list is possibly due to its drilling activity in the fraught South China Sea, said Leo Ho, an analyst with Daiwa Capital Markets. If that’s the case, PetroChina and Sinopec would be at less risk of U.S. action, he said.The NYSE said it would delist the telecom operators to comply with a U.S. executive order imposing restrictions on companies identified as affiliated with the Chinese military. China Mobile Ltd., China Telecom Corp Ltd. and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. would all be suspended from trading between Jan. 7 and Jan. 11, and proceedings to delist them have started, the exchange said.Read more: China’s Three Big Telcos Slide on NYSE Move to Delist SharesU.S. President Donald Trump signed an order in November barring American investments in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military in a bid to pressure Beijing over what it views as abusive business practices. The order prohibited U.S. investors from buying and selling shares in a list of Chinese companies designated by the Pentagon as having military ties.China’s government will adopt necessary measures to safeguard the rights and interests of the nation’s companies, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily briefing in Beijing on Monday.“China firmly opposes the U.S. government’s behavior of politicizing trade issues, and abusing its national power and concept of national security to oppress Chinese companies,” Hua said. “This is in serious violation of the principle of market competition and international trade rules.”(Updates with ADR prices in U.S. premarket trading in 5th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-oil-majors-may-face-015820080.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-01-04	2021-01-04 06:43:08	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	China’s Three Big Telcos Slide on NYSE Move to Delist Shares	(Bloomberg) -- China’s state-owned telecommunications companies declined in Hong Kong after the New York Stock Exchange said it’s delisting them to comply with a U.S. executive order that sanctioned companies identified as affiliated with the Chinese military.Shares of China Mobile Ltd., the largest of the three, fell as much as 4.5% on Monday to their lowest level since 2006, while China Telecom Corp. dropped 5.6%. The two posted their biggest intraday losses since mid-November. China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. slipped 3.8%. The stocks pared most of those losses later in the day.The American depositary receipts of the three firms will be suspended from trading between Jan. 7 and Jan. 11, and the process of delisting them has started, NYSE said. The nation’s oil majors including CNOOC Ltd. also fell on concerns they will be targeted next for delisting in the U.S.“It’s largely a blow to sentiment” that could be temporary, said Mark Huang, an analyst at Bright Smart Securities in Hong Kong. “Though the ADRs are not exceptionally large, there’s some impact on fundraising. Some passive index tracking funds may be selling to avert risk. More importantly, this is another reason to dump telecoms and pursue outperforming sectors.”NYSE’s move followed an order by U.S. President Donald Trump in November barring American investments in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military, in a bid to pressure Beijing over what it views as abusive business practices. China’s securities regulator said given the small amount of U.S.-traded shares at each of the three phone companies, the impact on them would be limited and they are well positioned to handle any fallout.Direct SupportThe U.S. considers the three as Communist Chinese military companies, which are controlled by or affiliated with the Chinese military or a ministry of the Chinese government, as well as providing services for those bodies, according to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 and its amendments. These firms directly support the Chinese military, intelligence and security apparatuses and aid in their development and modernization, Trump said in his executive order.In a December article, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo discussed how U.S. investors are funding “malign PRC companies” on major indexes such as MSCI and FTSE. The delisting is more of a symbolic blow amid heightened geopolitical friction between the world’s two largest economies, as they are thinly traded on the NYSE. The companies also get almost all of their revenue from China.The decision “may impose short term selling pressure on the stocks,” Citigroup Inc. said in a research report. “However, Chinese telcos’ operations are mainly domestic focused and their sound fundamentals along with recovery trends and positive cash flows will not be affected by the delisting, in our view.”Thin VolumeThe ADRs total less than 20 billion yuan ($3.1 billion) and account for at most 2.2% of the total shares each, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said in a statement Sunday. China Telecom has 800 million yuan of ADRs and China Unicom has about 1.2 billion yuan.“The recent move by some political forces in the U.S. to continuously and groundlessly suppress foreign companies listed on the U.S. markets, even at the cost of undermining its own position in the global capital markets, has demonstrated that U.S. rules and institutions can become arbitrary, reckless and unpredictable,” the CSRC said. “It is certainly not a wise move.”Form 25Typically, a company is moved off the exchange as soon as it’s practical and on to an over-the-counter listing. The exchange then files a Form 25 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that formally acknowledges the change. The company immediately informs all shareholders of the delisting as well. Shareholders can choose to sell -- at the inevitably lower price -- or maintain their ownership of the company. On the final day of the public listing, the shares stop trading and are transferred to new brokerage accounts to hold for the shareholders.Index provider FTSE Russell will say Monday whether it plans to remove more Chinese stocks from its benchmarks, after the U.S. added to its list of sanctioned securities in recent weeks. FTSE Russell had already listed eight company deletions in early December, a decision that was later followed by peers MSCI Inc. and S&P Dow Jones. The changes from FTSE Russell will be effective from the start of trading on Thursday.In separate statements Monday, each telecommunications operator said it “regrets” NYSE’s actions, and said the decision might affect the prices and trading volume of the companies’ shares. All three companies said they hadn’t received any notification from the NYSE about the delisting.‘Lawful Rights’China Unicom and China Mobile said they’re reviewing ways to protect the companies’ “lawful rights.” China Telecom said it’s considering “corresponding options” to “safeguard the legitimate interests of the company.”China’s Ministry of Commerce said on Jan. 2 that the country will adopt necessary actions to protect the rights of Chinese companies and hopes the two countries can work together to create a fair, predicable environment for businesses and investors. Beijing has limited options to retaliate directly since American companies hardly rely on the Chinese market for financing. China has been seeking to avoid escalating the dispute with Washington before Joe Biden takes office in a few weeks. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn’t immediately respond Monday to a request for comment.CNOOC fell as much as 5.7% in Hong Kong on Monday, its biggest intraday loss since Dec. 1. PetroChina Co. dropped 2.9% and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp., also known as Sinopec, slipped 1.4% before reversing the drop.China’s largest offshore oil producer CNOOC could be most at risk as it’s on the Pentagon’s list of companies it says are owned or controlled by Chinese military, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Henik Fung. PetroChina and Sinopec may also be under threat as the energy sector is crucial to China’s military, he said.A Sinopec spokesperson declined to comment.

2020-12-01	2020-12-01 10:00:04	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	Even Exxon Mobil Is Capitulating to Peak Oil Demand	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Et tu, Exxon?Through all the shifts that have swept through the oil market in recent years, one thing has been a reliable constant: Exxon Mobil Corp. has remained resolute in its bullishness about the future of crude. In stark contrast to European competitors who've speculated about a peak in oil demand and switched investments toward renewables, Chairman Darren Woods has kept on preaching that old-time religion.The pullback by rivals shouldn’t be seen as a harbinger of doom for crude, but as an opportunity to spend more aggressively, Woods said at an investor day in March: “The best time to invest in these businesses is during a low, which will lead to greater value capture in the coming upswing.” Internal documents reviewed by Bloomberg Green earlier this year showed the company planned to increase its annual emissions 17% by 2025. Now even this most reliable of oil bulls seems to be having doubts. Exxon Mobil’s natural gas fields will be written down by as much as $20 billion, the company said Monday. More tellingly, those counter-cyclical spending plans are being marked to market. Annual capital investment through 2025 will be in the range of $20 billion to $25 billion, some $10 billion below the level that Woods forecast in March.That still sounds like a pretty substantial number — but when considered in the context of the wells Exxon Mobil is already operating, it looks markedly smaller. Depreciation, depletion and amortization is already running in the region of $20 billion every year. Subtract that amount, and you’re left with a growth capex figure of $5 billion a year at best, or zero at worst.Exxon Mobil likes to point to forecasts that the world will need new oil supplies to increase by 8% a year in the near term to meet rising demand as existing fields decline, with new gas requirements rising 6% a year, too. Its newly modest spending plans aren’t going to be sufficient to meet that scenario, let alone increase its own market share.In capitulating to a more subdued outlook, Exxon Mobil is simply following where other companies have led. It’s the only one of the big seven independent oil majors where analysts’ expectations of depreciation don’t already outstrip capital spending over the three years through 2022.Even if you look at the three years through 2023 to exclude the extreme circumstances of the current pandemic-hit year, BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and ConocoPhillips aren’t expected to spend enough to keep up with depreciation. Across the seven large independent oil companies, the deficit will amount to $4.82 billion. Investments in renewables by the likes of Equinor ASA and Shell are still too small to take a substantial chunk out of the industry’s petroleum-focused capex, but they certainly don’t help. Oil giants are divesting from petroleum as fast as any climate-focused fund manager.The same logic applies when you extend things further, to the listed national oil companies. Thanks to a $19 billion cut in capital spending by China’s big three oil majors this year and rising charges resulting from their spending splurge in previous periods, PetroChina Co. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, will be markedly more restrained in their investments in the years ahead. Growth capex totals of $3.18 billion and negative $4.76 billion respectively will be invested in the three years through 2022, based on analyst estimates.Petroleo Brasileiro SA, still recovering from a splurge in the early part of this decade, will reduce its net investments by $6.8 billion over the period. Equinor, aiming at a target of net zero emissions by 2050, will see depreciation exceed capex by about $656 million.Put together, the result looks like an oil industry that stopped spending four years ago and is showing no appetite to start again. Aggregate growth capex across a group of seven large independent and six national oil companies with adequate data will be a negative $23.8 billion this year and minus $6.77 billion next year. Even in 2022, when the sector as a whole should return to a measure of growth, the total will be about $8.8 billion — less than half the amount spent by Exxon Mobil alone in 2014.Oil gets used up quickly, so if the industry doesn’t spend, production will slump in short order. If investment continues at 2020 levels, supply will be 9 million barrels lower than forecast as soon as 2025, according to the International Energy Agency — equivalent to roughly 10% of the current oil market.It’s still probably too early to read oil majors’ miserliness as an indication that they expect demand to fall at quite that pace. The risks of under-investment are relatively limited, as long as everyone moves at the same time. If the world ends up seriously short of crude five years from now, they’ll end up raking in profits that can be recycled on belatedly plugging the deficit.Still, borrowing costs for investment-grade energy companies right now are the lowest they’ve been in six years. If oil majors were half as confident about the future of their core product as they claim to be, they’d be preparing to spend with abandon. When even Exxon Mobil closes its check book, the industry’s future looks truly doubtful.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has spent years mocking the idea of using hydrogen fuel cells rather than electric batteries to power next-generation green vehicles. “Fuel cells = fool sells,” the boss of the world’s top electric-car maker tweeted in June.China, the world’s biggest market for electric vehicles, isn’t so quick to dismiss the alternative to batteries. Officials are promoting the development of hydrogen-powered cars, trucks and buses, with Beijing offering to reward cities that achieve adoption targets.In a 15-year plan for new-energy vehicles released on Nov. 2, China’s State Council said the country will focus on building the fuel-cell supply chain and developing hydrogen-powered trucks and buses. President Xi Jinping in September set a 2030 deadline for China to begin reducing carbon emissions.“Hydrogen is expected to play a much more important role to drastically decrease the country’s greenhouse gas emissions,” Kevin Jianjun Tu, a non-resident fellow at the French think tank Ifri, wrote in a report published in October.China is targeting to have 1 million fuel-cell vehicles in operation by 2030, according to an energy savings vehicle development plan drafted by authorities, despite only 2,700 such cars selling in the country last year.The nation’s renewed interest in hydrogen could put it further ahead of the U.S. in next-generation autos even as President-elect Joe Biden tries to promote clean-car development.Read more: How Hydrogen Is and Isn’t the Future of Energy: Andreas KluthIn theory, fuel cells are an ideal alternative to the internal combustion engine, since their chemical reactions of hydrogen and oxygen emit no carbon. Powering vehicles with hydrogen can be expensive, though, and most of China’s supply comes from burning fossil fuels. The difficulties of storing and transporting hydrogen add to the cost.Trucks, BusesAs the supply of hydrogen generated by solar and wind power grows, the economics may improve. One utility is spending more than $3 billion on a wind and solar farm in Inner Mongolia that would produce as much as 500,000 tons of hydrogen a year, with operations expected to begin in 2021.State-owned oil refiner Sinopec said Oct. 29 it’s investing in hydrogen production, transportation and fuel cells and is building hydrogen vehicle refueling stations.The new infrastructure will likely support hydrogen-powered trucks and buses, with lithium-ion batteries remaining dominant for cars. Hydrogen makes sense for commercial vehicles since a fuel-cell automobile can go for longer on a single tank of hydrogen versus a battery-powered one on a single charge of electricity, according to Wang Chaoyun, the chairman of Anhui Mingtian Hydrogen Energy Technology Co., a startup that develops fuel-cell stacks and other inner workings for hydrogen vehicles.Filling up the hydrogen tank also is much faster than recharging an EV battery.China’s annual sales of fuel-cell vehicles will rise 10-fold over the next five years to 50,000 units before hitting half a million by 2035, says Wang, who predicts China will become the No. 1 market within three years.Shanghai-based SAIC Motor Corp. said in September that it plans to launch 10 hydrogen vehicles by 2025.Beijing SinoHytec Co., which develops hydrogen-fuel-cell engines, raised about 1.4 billion yuan ($213 million) in an initial public offering in August and is one of five Chinese companies that in June teamed up with Toyota Motor Corp. to develop fuel-cell systems for commercial vehicles.Read more: ‘Hydrogen Wars’ Pit Europe v. China for $700 Billion BusinessThe Japanese automaker sees the market dominated by hydrogen-powered trucks and buses rather than cars, said Chisato Yoshifuji, a project manager at Toyota. “China is concentrating on commercial vehicles and that aligns with Toyota’s thinking,” she said. “It’s a huge trend supported by the government.”Beer DeliveryOther foreign-backed companies see opportunities in hydrogen trucks, too. Hyundai Motor Co. on Nov. 5 announced agreements with five Chinese partners to promote the development of hydrogen fuel-cell commercial vehicles.“Hyundai believes China has a massive potential for hydrogen powered commercial vehicles,” said In Cheol Lee, Hyundai’s executive vice president and head of commercial vehicle division. Hyundai and its regional partners aim to supply some 4,000 fuel cell electric commercial vehicles in China by 2025.The Asian subsidiary of beverage giant Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, meanwhile, added four hydrogen fuel-cell trucks to its fleet, the company announced Sept. 28. It plans to deliver beer using the trucks, making China the first nation where the company has deployed such vehicles for beer shipments.“Pure electric vehicles and fuel cell-powered automobiles are equally important in our new energy vehicle development strategy and will coexist in the long run,” Wan Gang, who is a vice chairman of China’s national advisory body for policy making and often called the father of the country’s electric-car movement, said in January.Many skeptics do share Musk’s misgivings. Fuel cells are less efficient than batteries and the cost of building supporting infrastructure like refueling stations is much higher, according to a report published this month by IDTechEx, a research firm from Cambridge, England. Fuel-cell vehicles will “continue to be a commercial failure for the next two decades,” it said.And for now, Chinese leaders may be keeping their options open as they wait to see how the technology develops.“The limited details in this plan suggest, at the national level, policy makers are still deliberating over the role of hydrogen in China’s energy economy and the country’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2060,” BloombergNEF analysts Siyi Mi and Jinghong Lyu wrote in a report published Nov. 13, with reference to China’s 15-year plan for new-energy vehicles.ReFire, a Shanghai startup that manufactures fuel-cell engines, is one company that’s nonetheless preparing for a surge in demand. It makes about 1,000 engines a year for Chinese producers of trucks and buses and expects annual capacity to soar to 20,000 as early as 2024. The competitiveness gap with EVs will shrink as hydrogen gains acceptance, Chief Executive Officer Robin Lin said.“There’s a great chance for a dramatic drop in hydrogen prices,” he said. “As long as hydrogen power is cheap enough, it’ll be a natural choice.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-defies-elon-musk-warnings-210000644.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-10	2020-11-10 03:17:03	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	China Ready to Pick Up Slack With Global Oil Demand Wavering	(Bloomberg) -- As a rampant coronavirus ravages Europe and the U.S. and raises the risk of more lockdown measures, a range of indicators suggest China can cushion oil markets from the worst of the potential demand destruction.Stockpiles of crude and particularly fuels such as diesel and gasoline in the world’s biggest oil importer have shrunk over the past couple of months as economic activity exceeded expectations. Against this backdrop, one of China’s biggest state-owned refiners said it will keep crude throughput at its plants steady for the rest of the year.The nation’s independents -- accounting for around a quarter of refining capacity -- also look set for a revival. While buying by the so-called teapots has dropped since July, it’s expected to pick up again after import quotas for next year were raised. Weak margins remain a concern, however, although authorities have reactivated a minimum fuel-price mechanism that should help safeguard the processors and encourage more buying.See also: It’s Asia to the Rescue Again as Oil Demand Wavers ElsewhereWhile news of a potential virus vaccine breakthrough spurred a surge in oil prices on Monday, the demand outlook over the northern hemisphere winter still looks pretty shaky. These five charts show why developments in China mean oil traders and investors can breathe a little bit easier.China’s crude stockpiles started growing in early February as the pandemic crippled the economy, and got a further boost a few months later from a flurry of buying to take advantage of the crash in global prices. The inventories are coming down now, however, which means refiners will have some leeway to import more without worrying about storage constraints.Stockpiles peaked at 914 million barrels, or 73% of capacity, in the week to Oct. 2, according to Ursa Space Systems, a company that uses synthetic aperture radar to track 39 oil storage sites in China. They’ve since fallen to 885 million barrels, or 71% of capacity, in the week through Nov. 5.The magnitude of the drop in fuel inventories looks even more encouraging. Gasoline and diesel stockpiles peaked at 71.14% and 60.67% of capacity, respectively, in the week through Sept. 4, according to Oilchem, a Chinese energy and petrochemical information provider that’s part of Mysteel Group. They’ve since shrunk to 53.91% and 50.72% at the end of October.The flurry of buying by teapots helped global oil prices recover rapidly after their plunge in April. Purchases have been slowing since around the middle of the year, though, with congestion at ports holding up deliveries and the independent refineries running low on import quota.The Ministry of Commerce’s announcement last week that it would raise the quota for next year by more than 20% came as welcome news to the market. Oil traders had already been buying up cargoes since early October and sending them toward China, in anticipation of an uptick in purchases for 2021.Weak refining margins are a source of vulnerability in the Chinese oil demand picture, however. After rising as high as 1,170 yuan ($176.82) a ton in late April, teapot profits then dropped rapidly and have been hovering around zero since the middle of the year, according to data from consultant Energy Aspects.Chinese authorities said last week that they would reintroduce a floor-price mechanism that will hold fuel prices at a level that’s the equivalent of $40 a barrel crude. The measure aided margins and helped drive buying earlier in the year when oil prices crashed.The nation’s refining heavyweights -- China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. and PetroChina Co. -- also look set to do their bit to aid global demand. China is on track to import 550 million tons of crude this year, around 10% more than 2019, China Petroleum & Chemical, also known as Sinopec, said on Sunday.PetroChina said in mid-October that it wouldn’t cut overall throughput at its refiners in the fourth quarter. Sinopec is on track to reach its 2020 full-year refining target of 241 million tons, said an official at the company’s press office. That would mean fourth-quarter throughput would be around 5% higher than in the previous three months, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Sinopec public filings for the first nine months of the year.(Updates with comment from Sinopec in final paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-ready-pick-slack-global-031703315.html?.tsrc=rss

The conglomerate, South Korea’s third largest, has been working with SASAC, which oversees the country’s government-run companies, on social value efforts since 2019.The Covid-19 pandemic saw a surge in inflows into ESG-related assets, driving companies to step up social value disclosures in order to access a share of the trillions of dollars invested in this area. Even before the outbreak, China had pledged to make its nearly 4,000 listed corporates publish ESG metrics by the end of this year, though those efforts have yet to come to fruition. The world’s second-largest economy has also been seeking to burnish its environmental and social credentials, with President Xi Jinping targeting to make the country carbon neutral by 2060.“There are misconceptions that Asian companies are climate villains and they neglect ESG practices,” said Lee Hyung Hee, President of the Social Value Committee at SK Supex Council, the conglomerate’s main decision-making committee. “It’s disdainful of the entire Asia and we’d like to fix and show that Asian companies are interested in ESG.”Read more: Why China’s Missing Out on Trillions in Sustainable InvestmentBASF SE, the world’s largest chemical maker, is leading a growing number of global firms including BMW AG, Novartis AG and SK in a collaboration to create an international accounting standard of evaluating social value by 2022. SK, which is actively advising South Korean government organizations and companies on evaluating social values, aims to have its affiliates from SK Hynix Inc. to SK Innovation Co. adopt an integrated accounting method including ESG practices within the next five to 10 years, Lee said in an interview in Seoul.SK has so far channeled 74 billion won ($65 million) into impact funds investing in firms and startups that could address social and environmental problems and is planning to set up a new fund next year, Lee said. After successfully purchasing South Korea’s largest waste treatment company for more than 1 trillion won, SK is also considering more acquisitions in areas that can alleviate environmental problems through technology.The conglomerate and China’s SASAC first collaborated on a research program into the social value of state-owned companies in both countries in February 2019. SK and the government body will hold equal stakes in the new lab, which is expected to be set up within this year, according to Lee.China has yet to release guidelines to its companies on disclosing ESG information despite setting a goal to kick off the program this year. Roughly 1,100 companies listed on China’s two mainland exchanges -- less than a third of the total -- voluntarily disclosed environmental data in 2018, according to the statistics from the securities regulator.“The market value of a company now depends on how it manages ESG,” Lee said. “ESG is not something that undermines shareholders’ value. Putting no effort into ESG goes against value.

The premium valuations are likely to put to rest investor concerns over whether the state-mandated deal would compensate the companies properly for their extensive networks and reward shareholders.The agreements also create a 500 billion yuan ($71 billion) national carrier known as the China Oil & Gas Pipeline Network Corp. that will be at the center of reform efforts by President Xi Jinping’s government to boost domestic energy production and distribution in the world’s top consumer.“We see these announcements as positive for the companies as the valuations are market friendly,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts including Neil Beveridge said in a note, adding that both companies are likely to issue special dividends. PipeChina’s capitalization “would make it one of the largest pipeline companies in the world should it come to market,” they wrote.As part of the deals announced Tuesday, PetroChina will receive consideration totaling 268.7 billion yuan, which includes a 29.9% stake in PipeChina and 119 billion in cash, according to the filings and an analysis by Morgan Stanley, which upgraded its rating on the stock.Sinopec, known officially as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., will receive a total of 122.7 billion yuan, which breaks down into a 14% stake in PipeChina and 52.7 billion in cash, according to its filing.No announcement has been made yet regarding asset transfers from China National Offshore Oil Corp., the nation’s biggest liquefied natural gas importer, or Kunlun Energy Co., a PetroChina subsidiary that owns a gas pipeline and several LNG terminals.PetroChina closed 2.1% higher on Friday in Hong Kong, while Sinopec was unchanged, both paring earlier gains. Kunlun added 5.3%.As of 2015, China had 64,000 kilometers (about 40,000 miles) of pipelines carrying natural gas, 27,000 carrying crude and 21,000 carrying oil products, according to China’s main economic planning agency. Most of those are owned by PetroChina and its parent, China National Petroleum Corp.PetroChina’s dominance of the distribution network was seen as stunting the domestic drilling industry, as other firms could be blocked or have to pay prohibitively expensive fees to get their oil and gas to market.

European Union leaders agreed on an unprecedented stimulus package to pull their economies out of the worst recession in memory. Meanwhile, vaccine developments added to the positive sentiment with European regulators eyeing a potential approval of the first Covid-19 vaccine this year.On the supply side, analysts are expecting U.S. inventories to tighten. Crude stockpiles probably fell for the third time in four weeks, a Bloomberg survey showed.The “truly historic stimulus from the European Union governing body” is a “big positive for the oil market,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC. “That’s going to be very supportive of their economies and should translate into a better economic outlook and better fuel demand.”Brent futures are nearing the $45-a-barrel mark for the first time since early March, when a meeting between OPEC and its allies broke down acrimoniously and the alliance began a short-lived price war. Since then, prices have been range-bound as worldwide virus cases approach 15 million and various U.S. states mull reimposing lockdown measures.To rise above $45 would be a “big historical point for Brent, because it’s a real sign that things are getting back to normal,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group Inc. “Getting to where we are shows we’ve come a long way from where we were and we still have the potential to do better.”But pandemic-driven demand concerns spurred by the virus are challenging prices from posting a stronger breakout rally. The number of people infected with the coronavirus in parts of the U.S. is as much as 13 times higher than the reported rates in those regions, the New York Times reported, citing data released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“We don’t have this virus under control in terms of number of cases and yet oil prices are still moving higher,” said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. “One of two things happens, either the market is anticipating some kind of remedy that’s around the corner or folks are going to be disappointed and oil’s going to come back for a relapse.”In China, oil giant Sinopec plans to reduce its refinery operating rates at some of its plants this month as massive flooding along the Yangtze River disrupts fuel supplies and prompts more people to stay at home, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Meanwhile in the U.S., crude stockpiles probably declined by 2.2 million barrels last week, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Domestic oil supplies are currently sitting at the highest seasonal level in decades. The survey also showed that gasoline supplies likely dropped for a third straight week.The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly inventory data later Tuesday ahead of a government tally on Wednesday.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-erodes-gains-virus-concerns-222443507.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-28	2020-06-28 00:00:44	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	Saudi Aramco's Dividend Math Doesn't Add Up	"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s the mother of all payouts.The $75 billion that Saudi Aramco doles out in dividends every year dwarfs what any other listed company gives to shareholders. It’s roughly equivalent to the payouts from Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Chevron Corp., BP Plc, Total SA, PetroChina Co., Eni SpA, Petroleo Brasiliero SA and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. or Sinopec — put together.That makes Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser’s promise to continue that level of returns for the next five years an extraordinary vote of confidence in an oil market awash with uncertainties. Saudi Aramco will be prepared to borrow money to ensure that it meets its commitment this year despite oil prices heading into negative territory, he said this month.Running up debts to keep the dividend on track is standard practice for energy companies amid the carnage of 2020’s oil market — except for those, like Shell, which plan to cut payouts altogether. You only want to fund dividends out of borrowings, though, if you’re certain it’ll be a strictly temporary measure. The risk for Aramco is that upholding such a long-term promise to shareholders will bend its entire business out of shape, just when it needs to be especially nimble as crude demand slows and goes into reverse. The core of Aramco’s profitability is its astonishingly low production costs, with operating expenses amounting to not much more than $8 a barrel of oil and equivalent products last year. It’s remarkable how quickly the spending adds up, though. Royalties paid to the Saudi state alone added another $10 a barrel or so, while corporate income tax came to around $19 a barrel and dividends swallowed a further $15. Once all those tolls were paid, Aramco didn’t have a lot of spare change left out of $60-a-barrel oil, let alone the stuff in the $40-a-barrel range it’s selling at the moment.A firm dividend policy is an unusually inflexible cost. Unlike the royalties and income taxes levied as a percentage of Aramco’s revenues and profits, payouts don’t automatically shrink if the price of crude declines. If anything, the burden per barrel rises further when prices and output fall. Perhaps in recognition of this, the Saudi state has from the start agreed to forgo its portion of any payouts to the extent that receiving them would get in the way of Umm-and-Abu investors getting their share(1). That may help maintain a theoretical $75 billion-a-year payout but it makes a nonsense of the idea that all shareholders are equal, not to mention the principle that a dividend policy is some sort of a commitment to future earnings. It’s not clear, either, why a company with this get-out clause would want to take on debt to meet its promised payments, although Aramco’s borrowing costs are essentially identical to those of the Saudi state.Dividends aren’t the end of Aramco’s committed spending. Its purchase of a majority stake in chemicals company Saudi Basic Industries Corp., or Sabic, was completed this month, committing it to about $69 billion of payments over the next six years — even after a restructured plan pushed the bulk of the cash outflow toward the middle of the decade.Then there’s a potential $15 billion investment in Reliance Industries Ltd.’s Jamnagar refinery in India, $20 billion on a separate planned chemicals venture with Sabic, plus Sabic’s own $5 billion a year or so of capital spending which will now sit on Aramco’s balance sheet.Add it all up and the picture is troubling. It’s likely to be several years before operating cash flows rise above $100 billion a year again, even with Sabic’s business consolidated. If Aramco wants to spend three-quarters of that sum on its dividend while laying out $10 billion to $15 billion annually for Sabic’s finance and investment costs, then capex on its core operations will have to fall to a third or less of the $35 billion-odd that the company was spending until recently. For all that executives are confident of their ability to increase production at very low costs, that sort of belt-tightening would make the easiest route to higher profits — lifting crude output from its pre-Covid 10 million daily barrels to around 13 million — extraordinarily difficult to achieve.That path is likely to be constrained, anyway, by several years of weak demand growth as the world recovers from Covid-19. Not to mention the fact that Aramco’s importance to the oil market rests on the proposition that increases in its output, coordinated via OPEC+, should make prices move in the opposite direction, resulting in little by way of net revenue gains for the company.Unlike most of its competitors, Saudi Aramco doesn’t really need to be so focused on dividends. All but 1.5% of its shares are held by the same state that’s hoovering up royalty and tax payments further up the income statement. Riyadh shouldn’t really care how it’s getting paid, as long as it’s getting paid.That dividend policy looks more like a swaggering attempt to hold back the tide of an oil market on the edge of terminal decline. The quicker Aramco acknowledges that, the better equipped it will be to handle the coming turmoil.(1) Americans would call them ""Mom-and-Pop shareholders.""This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2020-05-29	2020-05-29 23:00:00	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	China’s Fuel Thirst Nurses Asia’s Oil Market Back to Health	(Bloomberg) -- As China’s demand recovery outpaces the rest of Asia, falling fuel exports from the refining giant are providing a much-needed buffer for other processors in the region still grappling with lowered consumption and poor margins.China is curbing exports with refiners selling fuels locally amid a rebound in demand and move to cash-in on higher prices due to a government-imposed “floor price,” said traders and analysts. Shipments so far this month have halved from April and are a quarter of the monthly average in the first quarter, according to Kpler.The cuts have coincided with plant closures and maintenance across South Korea, Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines, tightening supplies and pushing prompt prices against later shipments in the narrowing of so-called contango. As refineries return to operation, however, the market rebalancing will depend on a sustained demand rebound.China’s refiners are being discouraged from sending fuels abroad due to weak demand from fuel-importing nations such as Indonesia, and lower export prices when compared with domestic sales, said Yang Xia, analyst with SCI99. Shipments are likely to continue falling this quarter, according to the industry consultant.On average, Chinese fuel marketers who sold cargoes abroad in April had a theoretical loss of 932 yuan a ton for gasoline and 1,486 yuan a ton for diesel, as opposed to domestic sales, data by SCI99 showed. The nation exported 400,000 barrels of clean fuels so far this month, according to Kpler.Fuel demandAs lockdowns across Asia eased, diesel has become one of the strongest performers as industrial activity returned. In Singapore, margins for the fuel have climbed more than 80% from its bottom in mid-May, while producing gasoline flipped into a profit last week before slipping into losses. Commuters who chose to drive their cars over traveling on public transport are boosting demand for the motor fuel.These gains, however, are at risk of being eroded as more refineries return from planned maintenance or consider higher operating rates with demand still well below pre-virus levels. If that happens, balances may potentially flip back into deep oversupply, weighing on margins, said the traders and analysts.Floating storage of clean fuels off Singapore -- while still sizable -- is beginning to shrink. The glut that’s seen as a proxy for the region’s fuel consumption and economic health had made its way into tankers during the peak of coronavirus lockdowns when excess fuel had no where to go.About 12.4 million barrels of clean fuels were floating in Malacca Strait, Singapore Strait and East of Singapore as of May 25, a 4.4% drop from the previous week, according to Kpler. In mid-May, the hoard was about 13 million barrels, and just 5.4 million barrels on April 28.Playing Catch-upDespite several bullish signs across Asian fuel markets, the near-term recovery in margins appears to be more related to supply cuts rather than thriving consumption, according to the traders and analysts.Despite a quicker recovery in China versus elsewhere in Asia, full recovery in China’s domestic air traffic numbers could take a few months, and even longer in some other countries, said Brendan Sobie, founder of aviation analysis firm Sobie Aviation.In India, one of Asia’s top fuel guzzlers, demand for gasoline and diesel were recovering, but remains about 40% below last year’s levels and could take until the end of 2020 to get close to full recovery.Read also: Unlike China, India Oil Demand Stays Weak as Economy FaltersHigher fuel prices currently seen in Asia could be short-lived, said Sri Paravaikkarasu, Asia oil director of industry consultant FGE. A stronger demand recovery may come in June, but if refiners boost processing rates, this will threaten fuel margins, she said.“They will have to juggle high product inventories and demand recovery,” said the Singapore-based analyst, adding that refiners may increase runs cautiously in the coming month. Another cautionary point is the possibility of a second wave of infections, which could stymie nascent recovery, she said.(Updates with analyst comment in eleventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-fuel-thirst-nurses-asia-230000193.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-07	2020-04-07 01:00:00	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	Desperate Oil Producers Slash Prices as Demand Evaporates	(Bloomberg) -- From Russia’s northeastern coast of Sakhalin to the Permian basin in the U.S., oil is going cheap as sellers slash prices in a desperate attempt to attract buyers.Refiners across the world have made deep cuts to crude-processing rates due to slumping consumption and a growing fuel glut, leaving producers struggling to find buyers for their cargoes. Sellers, meanwhile, are aggressively dropping the price of their oil while they tussle for the remnants of demand, with the prospect of forced output cuts looming as global storage swells.In recent days, benchmark crude prices have rallied in the financial markets, primarily due to speculation that the world’s largest producers might reach some sort of truce to halt the price war. However, gloom persists in the physical markets, where actual barrels of oil are bought and sold, with crude still trading well below benchmark levels.For example, the spot differential for Russia’s Sokol was at a discount of about $8 a barrel against Dubai crude this week, according to traders who asked not to be identified. That’s the lowest in more than five years and a whopping $11 less than the last reported deal for the grade. Australia’s Varanus traded at a discount of between $13 and $14 against London’s Dated Brent, compared with a 50-cent premium for the previous cargo.U.S. crudes have declined to multi-year lows against benchmark Nymex crude oil futures because suppliers are running out of space to store barrels.Last week, the discount for West Texas Intermediate crude trading in Midland, Texas, America’s shale capital, fell to the lowest level since 2018. Offshore grade Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil plunged to the weakest discount to oil futures in data going back to 1991. Another offshore crude Mars Blend, a regional sour benchmark, tumbled to the lowest level in over a decade.Storage tanks the world over are filling fast, including at the 45 million-barrel Saldanha Bay terminal, a key hub in Africa. Scores of supertankers have also been charted for long-term plays, to be used as floating storage.“One could argue that currently there is a disconnect between the futures prices and the physical differentials which is pointing towards a more distressed market,” researchers at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said in a report.The study noted that the movement of price differentials -- the gap between the price for physical crude and its benchmark -- has been more extreme than for futures prices. It also highlighted that the weakness in grades like CPC Blend and Murban is due to high yields of jet fuel and naphtha, a component in gasoline production.The consumption of jet fuel to gasoline has plummeted as governments try and curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic by forcing people to stay at home. While China remains a bright spot as people return to work and factories begin to reopen after a prolonged shutdown, activity at Indian ports has slowed and the nation’s refiners are curbing processing amid a crippling lockdown.See also: Oil’s Apocalyptic April Could Reverberate for Years to ComeHowever, oil traders still have their sights on sending unsold crude to Asia, even as refinery margins in the region swing between profits and losses. The market phenomenon known as super-contango, where prompt crude prices are sharply below cargoes for delayed delivery, means that the cost of chartering a tanker can be offset by such gains, making the strategy viable.Even so, the question is where exactly in Asia can they send their supplies right now to get some relief. Recently, a tanker that was initially booked to send U.S. crude to India, based on fixture reports, was sent to China instead. Indian refineries have issued force majeure notices to defer their crude deliveries because the virus-led quarantines have crushed fuel consumption.(Updates with details on U.S. crude market activity in fifth and sixth and final paragraphs.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/desperate-oil-producers-slash-prices-010000306.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-03	2020-04-03 15:47:32	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	The U.S. Is Short on Workers Who Can Sew	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Venerable apparel retailer Brooks Brothers says it is “in the process of converting its New York, North Carolina and Massachusetts factories from manufacturing ties, shirts and suits to now making masks and gowns.” Michigan-based workwear maker Carhartt is shifting over to mask and gown production, too. In Houston, Gourmet Table Skirts & Linens, which normally sells to hotels and cruise ships, has gone all-in on surgical masks.These are encouraging signs for a country that remains way short on the personal protective equipment needed by health-care workers treating patients with Covid-19 — and eventually by the rest of us to help keep the disease from continuing its spread. But you’re not going to see a lot more announcements like these by U.S. apparel manufacturers, because there aren’t a lot more U.S. apparel manufacturers. Employment in the industry was actually up slightly in March — unlike employment in just about every other industry — but it has fallen 89% since 1990. In textile manufacturing, it’s down 79%.Manufacturing employment overall is down over that stretch too, of course, but by a much smaller 28%. And real value added by manufacturing (its contribution to gross domestic product, basically) is up 52% since 1997, when that data series begins, so part of the story is that productivity gains have allowed U.S. manufacturers to make more with fewer workers. For apparel, though, real value added is down 65% since 1997 and for textiles it’s down 39%, and while the latter has seen production rebound a bit over the course of the current expansion, apparel has not.Apparel making for the U.S. market basically moved overseas, with a quick look through my closet revealing “made in” labels from China, Honduras, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia and Mauritius. It had not been what you’d call a high-value industry, and the pay for workers certainly wasn’t great. U.S. consumers seem to have gained from the shift, with clothing and footwear’s share of consumer spending falling from 5.2% in 1990 to 2.7% last year. Still, it left a lot of jobs to replace and has left the country short-handed at a time when the ability to sew things is suddenly and unexpectedly of great value.To be sure, most of the protective respirators and the surgical masks in use today are not the product of traditional textile manufacturing or cut-and-sew production. They are generally made of spun or blown plastics — Chinese oil and petrochemicals company Sinopec has a peppy video about the factory it built over 12 days in February and early March that can produce 1.2 million N95 respirators or 6 million surgical masks a day. The U.S. still has a huge petrochemicals industry, and the biggest company in it, Exxon Mobil, announced Thursday that it is working with the Global Center for Medical Innovation in Atlanta “to rapidly redesign and manufacture reusable personal protection equipment for health care workers.” That’s good news. But in the meantime, it’s nice that Brooks Brothers, Carhartt and Gourmet Table Skirts & Linens are still around to fill in some of the gaps.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Justin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2020-04-01	2020-04-01 09:51:22	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	China’s LNG Demand Makes a Comeback to Aid Virus-Hit Market	(Bloomberg) -- As the coronavirus pandemic roils the global liquefied natural gas market, suppliers are finding that the center of demand has come full circle back to where it was first hit: China.Over the past two weeks, Chinese buyers have become some of the most active in the Asian market. That signals a turnaround from February, when the country’s top importers sought to delay or cancel shipments due to demand and logistical constraints caused by the Covid-19 outbreak.Meanwhile, stalwart buyers in South Asia and Europe have taken a step back as governments kick off strict lockdowns. Indian importers, who helped soak up a global LNG glut by snapping up cheap cargoes, had to declare force majeure on prompt shipments due to the pandemic. The clause allows companies to remove liability for natural and unforeseeable events.The reversal illustrates how the fast-spreading coronavirus can shut down economies and disrupt trade flows at the drop of a hat. China’s gas consumption is recovering, aided by a March rebound in manufacturing activity as factories ramp up operations after weeks of work suspensions.“Demand has also been driven by smaller players with storage capacity, who are emerging to take advantage of low spot prices,” said Edmund Siau, a Singapore-based analyst at energy consultant FGE.China imported about 1.26 million tons of LNG in the week of March 23, the first time it’s risen above the 2019 weekly average in more than a month, according to vessel-tracking data from Kpler.Small BuyersThe buying increase is mainly from smaller utilities, which are trying to take advantage of cheap prices while their bigger counterparts struggle to consume all their contracted supply, said BloombergNEF analyst Lujia Cao.Deals in March include the purchase of several cargoes by ENN Energy Holdings Ltd. and Guangdong Yudean Natural Gas Co. for delivery throughout 2020. Shandong Zhongnuo closed its first-ever tender seeking three shipments for May to October delivery, while Yudean had a separate tender for a May to June shipment.State-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp., the country’s biggest LNG importer, has been largely absent from the market as it grapples with bloated inventories. CNOOC in February invoked force majeure on prompt LNG deliveries to Chinese ports.Sinopec Group, which has room available in its storage tanks for spot cargoes, is in the market seeking cargoes for April and May delivery, according to traders with knowledge of the matter.There’s uncertainty over how sustainable China’s demand revival will be and whether it’s enough to arrest a slide in spot prices as the economy faces a growing threat from slumping external demand. The Asian benchmark LNG Japan/Korea Marker fell this week to a record amid the worsening coronavirus impact on other parts of the world.(Updates with Guangdong Yudean tender in eighth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-lng-demand-makes-quiet-054553840.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-27	2020-03-27 02:21:29	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	Even China’s Big Oil Is Cutting Back	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Under the watchful eye of Beijing’s energy hawks, China’s oil and gas majors have splurged for more than a decade, first on deals abroad and then drilling at home. Yet with crude prices at less than half where they were at the start of the year and demand battered by a coronavirus epidemic, they’re preparing to cut back.Cnooc Ltd. signaled Wednesday it might reduce its 2020 capital expenditure budget, which was set at as much as $13 billion, the highest since 2014. PetroChina Ltd., the country’s largest oil producer with a market value of $117 billion, suggested Thursday that it would do the same. Given the delicate politics involved, it’s a welcome hint of rational frugality.Energy security has always been a top concern for China’s leadership. Overseas deals peaked at $28 billion in 2012, the year Cnooc bid for Canada’s Nexen. Local production growth has been less exuberant, and China has been importing ever more. As trade tensions with Washington rose in 2018, President Xi Jinping urged the country’s state-owned titans to drill. That set off a frenzy from deepwater fields in the South China Sea to shale gas in Sichuan, where China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, has led. Performing national service is fine when oil is at $60 a barrel, even if the improvements are unimpressive compared to the capital spent. It’s a different matter when West Texas Intermediate is just coming off an 18-year low of less than $20. That’s a price at which no one can make money — not even Cnooc, with an all-in production cost of less than $30 per barrel of oil equivalent. Cnooc’s adventures in U.S. onshore and Canadian oil sands look terrible; its buccaneering domestic ventures are little better.Overseas, oil majors from Chevron Corp. to Saudi Aramco are cutting spending to preserve capital. Dividends are precarious. Logic dictates that China’s producers, even with healthier balance sheets, will follow the same pattern. The question is whether they can put financial logic ahead of political necessity. So far, the message is cautious: Cnooc executives pointed out that 2020 spending targets were drawn up when oil was at $65, so adjustments would be made. It gave no specifics. PetroChina, meanwhile, didn’t disclose precise targets for the year. That’s no accident, given a volatile market. After a string of personnel changes, there are new bosses across the industry. Political priorities haven’t been set in stone, given the delay in the annual National People’s Congress meeting. Still, the official message has been clear: Life is returning to normal after a devastating shutdown. Announcing a drastic spending cut, or anything that might hint at job losses or a weak economy, simply isn’t on the cards. PetroChina employed 476,000 at the end of 2018.That doesn’t mean that there won’t be mild cuts followed by steeper ones later in the year, a pattern seen before.How steep? Unlike during the last price crunch, in 2014 and 2015, the forward curve suggests prices will remain low, with little prospect for a quick solution to the Russia-Saudi spat that has worsened a global supply glut. Demand, meanwhile, is in the doldrums. China’s economy, and therefore its own appetite for oil and gas, is recovering only slowly, and the rest of the world is ailing as more lockdowns, factory closures and travel restrictions are imposed to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Analysts at UBS Group AG forecast Cnooc’s capex could come down 25% over the next two years, a cut that could be far deeper if oil averages closer to $30 this year. Overall, they project Chinese state-owned oil producers could cut spending by over a third, dragging production down 8% to 9%. Exploration budgets may be trimmed, though domestic production — where job preservation remains key — will mostly be spared. That leaves refining and other downstream activities, plus projects abroad, to bear the brunt. Low energy prices aren’t all bad for China, which imports more than 70% of the crude it consumes. Even liberalization of the domestic gas market becomes easier when prices are low enough for consumers to cope with change, Michal Meidan of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies points out. Cheaper oil could eventually stimulate demand. For now, a little less drilling all round. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When you’re in a critical fight, you need to use all the weapons at your disposal. And so, it’s time once again for America to marshal its great arsenal of democracy. Just as Detroit automakers became aircraft, tank and gun manufacturers during World War II, today’s industrial companies need to repurpose their factories for the tools needed to fight the current enemy: the coronavirus.Countries across the globe sealed their borders over the weekend and relegated citizens to the confines of their homes in an effort to slow the spread of the deadly virus before it overwhelms the Western World’s health-care systems. The president of Massachusetts General Hospital called on Sunday for the federal government to go into a “war-like stance” and launch a “Manhattan Project” to accelerate production of protective gear. No such plan has been announced by the Trump administration, but U.S. industrial companies should heed the call anyway. Because as far as wars go, this is one for which the country is woefully unprepared.The U.S. has fewer than 170,000 ventilators available for patient care, including estimates for those in the national stockpile, according to a report last month from the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. (The school is supported by Michael Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.) The number of face masks in that strategic reserve was depleted in the swine-flu outbreak of 2009 and as of early March it held only about 12 million N95 respirators and 30 million surgical masks, significantly fewer than the 3.5 billion masks experts estimate the U.S. would need in a severe pandemic, according to the Washington Post. It falls to private manufacturers to step in and fill the void.With airlines parking jets, consumers locked in their homes and companies focusing on managing the disruption, demand for jet engines, HVAC systems and factory equipment is going to shrivel up for the near future. Rather than sit idle, American factories should be redeployed for the products needed to fight the coronavirus, whether that’s face masks, ventilators, other health-care equipment or even toilet paper for that matter. The Trump administration has already leaned heavily on companies such as Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings, Roche Holding AG and Walmart Inc. to improve the availability and access to testing. But White House virus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx warned on Sunday that there will be a spike in cases as more people get access to tests. That’s when the real work is going to begin for the nation’s hospitals. It’s in every U.S. company’s interest to make sure they’re as prepared as possible, and manufacturers have a key role to play. Companies such as 3M Co. and Honeywell International Inc. already make masks and personal-protective gear, but they will need help to meet the huge demand.After China declared a “people’s war” on the outbreak in that country, companies including electric automaker BYD Co., petroleum refiner Sinopec and iPhone assembler Foxconn started making masks instead. French luxury-goods maker LVMH announced Sunday it’s converting perfume and cosmetics factories to make hand sanitizer, which it will deliver free of charge to the local authorities and hospital system. In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson is calling on manufacturers including Dyson, Unipart Group, Honda and Ford to help with that country’s ventilator shortage, according to the Financial Times. American companies need to follow this lead. Apart from the moral and patriotic implications, it’s just good business sense. The faster the world responds to this health crisis, the faster it can get back on its feet.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-03-12	2020-03-12 21:00:00	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	Xi Ordered China’s Oil Industry to Drill, Then the Crash Came	(Bloomberg) -- Oil’s historic price crash is presenting an uncomfortable dilemma to China’s energy majors: follow market signals to cut drilling, or heed President Xi Jinping’s orders to boost output.While China’s main influence on global oil is as the world’s largest importer, it also produces 3.8 million barrels a day, more crude than all but two of OPEC’s individual members. The last time crude slumped this low, in 2016, China’s response was to cut spending at old and expensive fields, and output slumped.That may not be an option this time, after trade tensions with the U.S. prompted Xi in 2018 to order an increase in domestic exploration and production to safeguard the country’s energy security. The longer the price collapse lasts, the more the government’s push for energy sufficiency will be tested, with state-owned firms like PetroChina Co., Sinopec Corp. and Cnooc Ltd. caught in the middle.“The Chinese government still wants to produce more to enhance its self-sufficiency rate,” said Dennis Ip, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. “Lower oil prices are definitely going to hurt the cash flow for those Big Three oil majors. Whether they execute 100% of their capital plan this year, or try to defer, really depends on how long this lasts.”Crude prices have tumbled by nearly half since the beginning of the year as the coronavirus outbreak saps demand and Saudi Arabia and Russia unleash supply in what appears to be the start of a price war. U.S. drillers like Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Diamondback Energy Inc. have already announced plans to slash spending amid the rout.China’s drillers are particularly sensitive to lower prices, because its fields are older and require more work to sustain production, said Parul Chopra, vice president for upstream research at consultancy Rystad Energy AS. The price needed for new wells to break even in the country is about $41 a barrel, compared to $13 for Saudi Arabia and $11 for Iraq, he said. PetroChina, the country’s biggest oil company, described some of its fields as having “no hope” of being profitable during the 2016 price crash.China’s oil production plummeted during the last crash, from a peak of 4.3 million barrels a day in 2015, when it was the world’s fifth-biggest producer, to 3.8 million barrels in 2018, when it fell to No. 8.By then, the country had surpassed the U.S. to become the world’s biggest oil importer. With trade tensions boiling, Xi instructed state-owned energy firms to boost output. China National Petroleum Corp., the majority owner of listed PetroChina, said it would adopt “revolutionary measures” to ensure stable or increased production.The country’s three oil majors raised spending the following year by 18% and managed to reverse the decline in production. It came at a cost, though. PetroChina’s shares fell 20% even as the MSCI Asia Energy Index rose 6% and it was accused of putting national service above shareholders.China’s economic recovery from the coronavirus outbreak will add more incentive to keep drilling activity elevated, said Max Petrov, a principal analyst with energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie Ltd.“Beijing will want to keep energy flows and employment levels running high as economic activity returns to normality after the impact of Covid-19,” he said. “This suggests spending will remain high or accelerate during the second half of the year.”In the wake of this week’s price collapse, analysts have been busy marking down their forecasts for the listed units. While the big oil firms enjoy government favor -- and subsidies -- they’re not protected from market circumstances. PetroChina, for example, imports gas at a loss to facilitate China’s switch from coal to the cleaner burning fuel.Of the Big Three, Sinopec may be best placed to ride out the oil market’s meltdown, according to Citigroup, because of its huge refining operations, which benefit from cheaper crude. At the same time, the value of its oil inventory will have been crushed by the collapse, and that’ll weigh on profits.Cnooc, the biggest offshore explorer, is the only one of the three to announce spending plans this year, saying in January it would boost expenditure to the highest level since 2014. Daiwa’s Ip said all three companies are conducting internal analysis on spending levels following the recent price crash, and have yet to decide a course of action.Sinopec declined to comment on its spending plans. PetroChina and Cnooc didn’t respond to requests for comment.While the oil crash will hurt drillers’ profits, it offers another way for the country to boost energy security, said Tian Miao, an analyst at Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co. Plunging prices are creating an opportunity for China to import cheap crude to fill its strategic reserves, which it can tap if its supplies are ever threatened.“China’s commitment to boosting domestic oil and gas production will stay unchanged for the long term,” she said. “Domestic oil majors’ incentives for higher output and more capex will inevitably be reduced if oil prices remain weak for the rest of the year, but that can be offset by higher imports.”To contact the reporters on this story: Dan Murtaugh in Singapore at dmurtaugh@bloomberg.net;Jing Yang in Shanghai at jyang251@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Jason Rogers, Jasmine NgFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xi-ordered-china-oil-industry-210000409.html?.tsrc=rss

It was one of the first known cases of the legal clause being invoked in commodity contracts due to the epidemic, which has plunged raw materials markets into chaos.Other Chinese firms, including PetroChina Co. and Sinopec Group, are mulling invoking force majeures on contracts, but haven’t officially declared yet. PetroChina was forced to delay discharge timings for multiple cargoes because it can’t get enough workers to its Rudong, Dalian and Caofeidian LNG terminals to run them at full capacity.At least five LNG vessels headed to China have been diverted or are idling offshore as the coronavirus constrains the country’s ability to take deliveries and cuts demand, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg and data intelligence firm Kpler.When God Appears in Contracts, That’s ‘Force Majeure’: QuickTakeChina is the world’s biggest consumer of most raw materials, from energy products to industrial metals, and the disruptions in its purchases are creating havoc across global supply chains.

The cancellations are among the first known cases of the legal clause being invoked in commodity contracts due to the epidemic.“Everything that we were afraid of, from trade wars or global growth, doesn’t compare,” said Jan Stuart, global energy economist at Cornerstone Macro. “This virus is an entirely different risk, especially in commodities where China’s role dominates.”China is the world’s biggest consumer of most raw materials, from energy products to industrial metals, and disruptions in its purchases create havoc across global supply chains. Now, while global markets bounce back from initial fears over the impact of the virus, the fallout in commodity trade is only worsening as Beijing keeps swathes of the country under lockdown and restricts travel.When God Appears in Contracts, That’s ‘Force Majeure’: QuickTakeIn a dramatic and rare step, China National Offshore Oil Corp., the nation’s biggest LNG buyer, invoked force majeure and told some suppliers it won’t take delivery of cargoes because of constraints caused by the coronavirus. French oil and gas giant Total SA rejected the declaration.Hours later, it emerged that Chinese copper smelter Guangxi Nanguo had also declared the same get-out clause, refusing to take delivery of raw materials.Meanwhile, copper buyers are requesting Chilean miners postpone shipments because of port shutdowns while China’s biggest oil refiner, Sinopec Group, is likely to ask Saudi Arabia to reduce crude supplies next month. Soybeans from Brazil and the U.S. are being held up on arrival in eastern China and Indonesian palm oil shipments are also being delayed.“We are truly concerned about the loss of buying power that has spread across every division of commodities,” said Pete Thomas, a senior vice president at Chicago-based broker Zaner Group. “The impact has been much larger than everyone even realizes it would be.”For LNG, CNOOC’s force majeure hurts a market already buffeted by rising U.S. supplies and weak demand after a mild winter in Europe and Asia. Even before Chinese buyers walked away from supply contracts, spot prices fell to a record low, crippling the profitability of energy giants such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp.CNOOC sent the force majeure notice to suppliers including Shell and Total, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Shell declined to comment.Total confirmed it received one force majeure notification, which it rejected after legal analysis, Philippe Sauquet, the company’s president for gas, renewables and power, said in a company presentation.“Of course we have to be careful, if there is a real quarantine in all unloading ports in China, we have a real case for force majeure,” he said. “But for the time being, this is not the case. For me it is ordinary negotiation.”Also read: Virus Could Dent China’s LNG Demand Growth by 38%, IHS SaysAmid low prices and demand, there is “a strong temptation from some long-term customers to try to play with force majeure and say I cannot take my cargo under long-term contract,” he said.At least four LNG vessels headed to China have been diverted or are idling offshore as the coronavirus constrains the country’s ability to take deliveries and cuts demand, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg and data intelligence firm Kpler.Japan Korea Marker, the spot Asian LNG benchmark, fell to a record low $3 per million British thermal units on Thursday, according to S&P Global Platts.China said last week that it would offer support to companies seeking to declare force majeure on international contracts.

2020-02-06	2020-02-06 21:01:38	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	Oil Rises on Hopes Russia Will Agree to OPEC+ Production Cut	(Bloomberg) -- Oil advanced for a second day on hopes that OPEC and its allies would further curb oil production as the deadly coronavirus outbreak hits global energy demand.Futures climbed 0.4% in New York on Thursday after a panel of technical experts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries recommended cutting output by an additional 600,000 barrels a day. But Russia remained noncommittal, asking for more time to decide.“There’s a little bit of hope OPEC will support the market,” said Michael Loewen, director of commodity strategy at Scotiabank. “Even before the virus, OPEC’s prior production cuts still left markets oversupplied and Russia has been reluctant to stick to these, so that also casts doubt on what they’re willing to do here.”Prices have lost 17% this year as the spread of the coronavirus has disrupted travel and fuel consumption, wiping out about 20% of oil consumption in China, the world’s second largest economy and key engine of crude demand. The outbreak has prompted the state oil company of Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, to make deep cuts to the price of crude it sells to Asia.West Texas Intermediate crude advanced 20 cents to settle at $50.95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier gaining as much as 2.9%.Brent traded 35 cents lower to close at $54.93 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, putting its premium over WTI at $3.79.See also: Commodity Shippers Face ‘Crisis in Demand’ on Virus Outbreak: QuickTakeAlso weighing on OPEC’s decision is the blockade of Libya’s ports which has hampered oil exports. The United Nations will hold a conference in Cairo on Sunday to discuss Libya’s oil production as the country’s warring sides are working to turn a provisional cease-fire into a formal agreement.“OPEC’s ability to cut production is fairly constrained as it is,” says Ryan Fitzmaurice, commodities strategist at Rabobank. “The coronavirus is still front and center but they’re also balancing the supply side risks in Libya.”Libya’s oil output has since plunged to its lowest levels since the NATO-backed uprising against Qaddafi. The warring factions attended an international meeting in Berlin last month amid a tentative cease-fire.See also: How Libya has contributed to falling OPEC output&#92;--With assistance from James Thornhill and Alex Longley.To contact the reporter on this story: Jackie Davalos in New York at jdavalos10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Catherine Traywick, Pratish NarayananFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opec-response-virus-oil-rising-021904875.html?.tsrc=rss

Petrochina, Trafigura, Vitol, Lukoil and Exxon Mobil Corp are among those looking to ship cargoes from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Europe, one source said.

2020-02-04	2020-02-04 02:59:38	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	Virus Jolts China Economy, Forcing Rethink on Almost Everything	(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.China is preparing steps to adjust to a slower rate of economic growth as the coronavirus outbreak shows few signs of abating.Officials are evaluating whether to soften the economic-growth target for 2020, while state-owned liquefied natural gas importers are considering declaring themselves unable to fulfill some obligations on cargo deliveries -- known as force majeure -- according to people familiar with the matter. And authorities in Beijing are hoping the U.S. will agree to some flexibility on pledges in their phase-one trade deal, people close to the situation said.Two-thirds of the Chinese economy will remain closed this week as several provinces took the extraordinary step of extending the Lunar New Year holiday to help curb the spread of the disease that’s claimed 425 lives, with 20,438 confirmed cases, mostly in Hubei.Below is a wrap of the considerations:Potential GDP ReductionThe annual growth target is typically unveiled in March at the country’s legislative session after being endorsed by top leaders at the yearly closed-door Central Economic Work Conference in December. Economists had expected China would aim for output growth of “around 6%” this year after seeking a range of 6% to 6.5% in 2019. Bloomberg Economics reckons growth could dip to 4.5% in the current quarter.Officials are also considering further measures to shore up the economy, including selling more special government bonds, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the private talks. They also could increase the planned cap on the ratio of the budget deficit to gross domestic product, they said.This year’s legislative gathering, which is scheduled to begin March 5, could be delayed as the epidemic disrupts work across the country.China’s State Council Information Office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Any changes to the growth target would have to be approved by top leaders of the Communist Party.Party MeetingChinese President Xi Jinping called on all officials to quickly work together to contain the virus at a rare meeting of top leaders, saying the outcome would directly impact social stability in the country.The effort to contain the virus directly affects people’s health, China’s economic and social stability, and the country’s process of opening up, he told a meeting of the Communist Party’s powerful Politburo Standing Committee on Monday. Leaders also urged officials “to achieve the targets of economic and social development this year” and “promote stable consumer spending.”It was the second meeting of China’s senior-most leaders to handle the crisis in recent days, a rare occurrence over the past few decades.LNG DeliberationsOil consumption in China, the world’s the top crude importer and second-biggest LNG buyer, is already estimated to have dropped by 20%, which is expected to cause fuel makers to cut back production and seek to delay some oil shipments. A decline in gas demand is similarly forcing buyers to consider postponing deliveries to cope with high inventories.LNG importers including China National Offshore Oil Corp. are still assessing the impact on consumption and haven’t decided yet whether to make the declarations, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information isn’t public. Firms declare force majeure when they’re unable to meet contractual obligations for reason beyond their control.CNOOC and PetroChina Co. have begun drafting the necessary documents to issue the declarations, in case they decide to move ahead, said the people. Sinopec Corp. is also considering force majeure.PetroChina and Sinopec declined to comment. Nobody answered multiple calls to CNOOC.U.S. TradeThe U.S. and China on Jan. 15 sealed the first phase of a trade agreement that’s supposed to take effect in mid-February. It has a clause that states the nations will consult “in the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event” delays either from complying with the accord. It’s unclear whether China has formally requested such a consultation yet, but the people familiar with the matter said the plan is to ask for it at some point.A spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Washington hadn’t received any request from China to discuss changes in Beijing’s purchase commitments. The Chinese Commerce Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.In the first year of the deal, China committed to buy an extra $76.7 billion of American goods beyond what it did in 2017, and an additional $123.3 billion in the second year. Purchases of agricultural products are particularly important for the livelihoods of American farmers who’ve been hurt in an escalating tariff war with China over the past two years and are a key base of support for President Donald Trump.Read the latest on impact of the coronavirus from Bloomberg EconomicsEven before the outbreak, China’s economy was already slowing amid weak domestic demand, a crackdown on debt and the trade war with the Trump administration. GDP expanded 6.1% last year, the least in almost three decades, and just within the range targeted by President Xi Jinping’s administration.In a containment scenario -- with a severe but short-lived impact -- the virus could take China’s first-quarter gross domestic product growth down to 4.5% year on year, according to Bloomberg Economics. That’s a drop from 6% in the final period of 2019 and the lowest since quarterly data that begins in 1992.Most of China’s provinces said before the virus became widespread they’re expecting slower economic growth in 2020, with at least 22 out of 31 major cities, provinces and autonomous regions cutting their targets as of Jan. 21, according to their work reports which lay out plans for this year.China’s central bank took its first concrete steps to cushion the economy and plunging markets from the blow of the virus, providing short-term funding to banks and cutting the interest rate it charges for the money.The People’s Bank of China added a net 150 billion yuan ($21.4 billion) of funds on Monday using 7-day and 14-day reverse repurchase agreements. The rate for both was cut by 10 basis points, driving down the cost of the money to “ensure ample liquidity during the special period of virus control,” it said in a statement. PBOC adviser Ma Jun indicated he expects further rate cuts later in the month.The cash injection was part of a raft of supportive measures announced over the weekend to soften a market sell-off and help firms affected by the disease outbreak and extended holiday.(Updates number of cases in third paragraph, party meeting from eighth.)&#92;--With assistance from Stephen Stapczynski, Alfred Cang, Niu Shuping, Steven Yang, Jenny Leonard and Shawn Donnan.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Steven Yang in Beijing at kyang74@bloomberg.net;Zheng Li in Shanghai at zli698@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: John Liu at jliu42@bloomberg.net, ;Brendan Murray at brmurray@bloomberg.net, Malcolm ScottFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-considers-lowering-2020-growth-112921218.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-02-03	2020-02-03 13:55:12	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	China Oil Demand Has Plunged 20% Because of the Virus Lockdown	(Bloomberg) -- Chinese oil demand has dropped by about 3 million barrels a day, or 20% of total consumption, as the coronavirus squeezes the economy, according to people with inside knowledge of the country’s energy industry.The drop is probably the largest demand shock the oil market has suffered since the global financial crisis of 2008 to 2009, and the most sudden since the Sept. 11 attacks. It could force the hand of OPEC and its allies, which are considering an emergency meeting to cut production and staunch the decline in prices.“It is truly a black swan event for the oil market,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. “There was some hope for the demand outlook this year before the outbreak, but that has been knocked off its block. OPEC+ has to react. If there are no further production cuts, there will only be more price losses.”Crude futures fell to one-year lows on Monday as traders reacted to the magnitude of the health crisis in China. Brent, the global oil benchmark, dropped 1.3% to $55.91 a barrel as of 1:53 p.m. in London. West Texas Intermediate declined as much as 2.2%, and traded 0.5% lower at $51.33.China is the world’s largest oil importer, after surpassing the U.S. in 2016, so any change in consumption has an outsize impact on the global energy market. The country consumes about 14 million barrels a day -- equivalent to the combined needs of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the U.K., Japan and South Korea.Chinese and Western oil executives, speaking on condition of anonymity because they aren’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said the decline was measured against normal levels for this time of year. It’s a measure of the current drop in demand, rather than the average loss since the crisis started, which would be smaller.Beijing has locked millions of people in quarantine and the New Year holiday has been extended. Flights have been canceled and authorities across the globe are trying to contain the virus’s spread. Traditionally during the New Year holiday, gasoline and jet-fuel demand increase as hundred of millions go back home, while gasoil consumption drops as industrial activity slows.The collapse in Chinese oil consumption is starting to reverberate across the global energy market, with sales of some crudes slowing to a crawl and benchmark prices in free-fall. Sales of Latin American oil cargoes to China came to a halt last week, while sales of West African crude, a traditional source for Chinese refineries, are also slower than usual, traders said.Chinese refineries are storing unsold petroleum products such as gasoline and jet fuel, according to the executives. But stockpiles are growing every day, and some refineries may soon reach their storage limits. If that were to happen, they would have to cut the amount of crude they process. One executive said that refinery runs were likely to be cut soon by 15-20%.There are signs that’s already happening. Sinopec Group, the nation’s biggest refiner, is in the process of reducing runs at its plants by an average of about 13-15% and will review whether further cuts are needed Feb. 9, according to one of the people. The company declined to comment on its operations.As many as 18 independent oil refineries may be cutting rates or shutting completely as storage fills up, according to traders familiar with operations at the plants known as teapots. China has as many as 40 of these independent refineries, which are located primarily in the eastern region of Shandong and account for about a quarter of the nation’s processing capacity.Beyond the headline price for Brent, every other indicator in the physical and derivatives market also points to a weakening market. So-called time-spreads, which measure the price difference between contracts for delivery at different times, have collapsed -- an indication that short-term demand is expected to remain weak.See also: Commodity Prices Collapse in China as Demand Fears Spook MarketIn China, stocks plummeted by the most since an equity bubble burst in 2015 as they resumed trading to the worsening virus outbreak. The CSI 300 Index slumped as much as 9.1% as onshore financial markets opened for the first time since Jan. 23, while the yuan tumbled and crude futures in Shanghai also sank by more than 7%.OPEC and its allies, which include Russia, are weighing their options to respond to the crisis and there have been discussions about calling an emergency meeting. Saudi Arabia is pressing for a gathering sooner than the one scheduled for March 5-6, though it has run into resistance from Russia. The Saudi and Russian oil ministers spoke on the phone for an hour on Thursday and another 30 minutes on Friday, according to Russians officials.For now, OPEC has called a technical meeting this week to assess the situation, and the Joint Technical Committee will report back to ministers.According to consultants at Energy Aspects Ltd., OPEC is considering an informal proposal to deepen current production curbs by about 500,000 barrels a day. But there’s no consensus on the idea, which was floated by at least one country. As OPEC and its partners are already in the midst of steep cuts, many analysts are skeptical on how much more they’re willing to do.The most recent agreed reductions only came together after considerable diplomatic wrangling, and Saudi Arabia has already slashed production to the lowest since 2014. Russia, which has become the most important producer in the coalition alongside the kingdom, has typically taken some persuading to sign up to additional cuts. Still, if the alliance does agree to call an early meeting, historic precedent suggests it will probably result in action.“Nothing concentrates a producer’s mind more than the prospect of a crude oil price bust,” said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, and a former White House oil official under President George W. Bush.&#92;--With assistance from Grant Smith, Olga Tanas, Lucia Kassai, Bill Lehane and Saket Sundria.To contact the reporters on this story: Alfred Cang in Singapore at acang@bloomberg.net;Javier Blas in London at jblas3@bloomberg.net;Sharon Cho in Singapore at ccho28@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Will Kennedy at wkennedy3@bloomberg.net, Rakteem Katakey, Alaric NightingaleFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-oil-demand-plunged-20-231351018.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-09	2019-12-09 12:45:24	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	China Sets Up National Pipeline Firm in Major Energy Revamp	(Bloomberg) -- China announced the creation of its long-planned national oil and gas pipeline company, officially kicking off one of its biggest energy revamps aimed at helping supply keep pace with swelling demand.The move marks a “key step” in China’s efforts to deepen reforms of its oil and gas sector, the official Xinhua News Agency said Monday.The government will merge the networks operated by its three state-owned giants under a single company, an important step toward removing barriers that have hampered domestic production, and which dovetails with efforts to use more gas instead of coal. The government will also encourage local oil and gas pipeline firms to integrate with the national company in “market-orientated ways,” Vice Premier Han Zheng said, according to a statement.Click here for a QuickTake Q&A explaining China’s national pipeline planA main development to watch is the valuation of assets, said Neil Beveridge, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. It may take six to nine months for that detail to emerge, based on a similar reform of telecom carriers in 2015 that created China Tower Corp., Beveridge said.The pipeline company’s creation has been considered since at least 2014 and is part of President Xi Jinping’s drive to streamline industrial capacity among state-owned enterprises. The government is seeking to spur wider natural gas distribution and upstream exploration by shifting ownership from competing producers into a single operator, which can make decisions based on overall national energy needs.The reform is also designed to help smaller private or foreign firms, which have found access to infrastructure blocked or prohibitively expensive. With the assets stripped from the hands of the big three state firms, other companies can gain access and move supply to where it’s needed.Sector OverhaulThe plan follows other Chinese reforms aimed at a more level playing field for private and state-owned enterprises. As well, the nation has been accelerating the overhaul of its energy sector in recent years, including changes to its gas pricing policy and merging power giants.Media representatives of the new pipeline operator didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. The State-owned Assets Supervision & Administration Commission, which oversees centrally owned enterprises, didn’t respond to a faxed request for comment. Nobody answered calls to the media departments of the three companies involved -- China National Petroleum Corp., Sinopec Group and China National Offshore Oil Corp.Policy makers have also embarked on a campaign targeting pollution, replacing coal with gas for industrial and residential uses. That’s boosted demand for the cleaner-burning fuel faster than pipelines can support it, giving China added urgency to push forward the latest reform.Shareholding StructureThe change will mainly affect PetroChina Co., the listed unit of CNPC, which controls about 70% of the nation’s networks. Its shares in Hong Kong sank to their lowest since 2004 last week amid concern the company’s earnings and cash flow would be diluted as it loses one of its most prized assets. The stock rose as much as 2.8% Monday following a gain in oil prices last week.CNPC may take a 30% stake in the pipeline company, while Sinopec holds 20% and CNOOC 10%, Economic Information Daily and 21st Century Business Herald reported. SASAC will own the remaining 40%, they said, citing unidentified sources.Zhang Wei, general manager of CNPC, will likely be appointed as chairman of the pipeline company, according to local media.(Updates with government plan to integrate local pipeline firms in third paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Ramsey Al-Rikabi, Jing Yang, Aaron Clark and Dan Murtaugh.To contact the reporters on this story: Alfred Cang in Singapore at acang@bloomberg.net;Jasmine Ng in Singapore at jng299@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Jason RogersFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-launch-major-reform-national-050742957.html?.tsrc=rss

Investors with political or strategic reasons to buy the stock are in, while many international money managers seem ready to pass -- at least until Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman decides to rein in his valuation ambitions still further.The richest Saudis are being pressed to commit large sums to the IPO. Among those considering sizable purchases are the Olayan family and Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the billionaire investor who was held for several weeks in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel during the 2017 crackdown on corruption.China, the world’s largest oil importer, may commit as much as $10 billion through sovereign wealth funds and other state-owned enterprises, according to people familiar with the situation. An investment would be a hedge against rising oil prices and chime with the objectives of Beijing’s ambitious Belt and Road program.But fund managers remain skeptical even after the Saudi government dropped their target valuation from $2 trillion to about $1.7 trillion.There’s a lot at stake for Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, and his Vision 2030 plan to overhaul the Saudi economy. He proposed the offering in 2016 as a way to expose the state-owned giant to the rigors of the market and raise money for the sovereign wealth fund.But he quickly boxed himself in by claiming a $2 trillion valuation for the company -- a number based on comparing the kingdom’s enormous oil reserves with those held by large international oil companies like Exxon Mobil Corp. Analysts have consistently challenged his calculation, saying metrics like cash flow and dividend yield are more relevant.&quot;MBS will be acutely aware that focusing solely on valuation risks damaging the symbolic value of the IPO,&quot; Torbjorn Soltveldt, principal analyst for the Middle East and North Africa at Verisk Maplecroft, said in a note. &quot;Putting pressure on wealthy Saudi nationals to act as cornerstone investors to boost Aramco’s valuation will only reinforce concerns about governance.&quot;Fund managers are concerned the Saudi government -- which may sell only about 2% of Aramco -- won’t give enough say to minority shareholders. Regional geopolitical risks, underscored when the company’s facilities were struck by missiles and drones in September, are also weighing on investors’ calculations.“In terms of scale and quality of Aramco’s assets, they’ve got the world’s best, bar none,” said Dwight Anderson, the founder of hedge fund Ospraie Management. “But the decisions that they make are optimized to achieve the country’s objectives, not yours as an individual shareholder.”Aramco will publish an initial version of the IPO’s prospectus on Saturday, giving investors greater details on the company’s structure, finances and strategy. A price range will be set on November 17th, kicking of a formal investor road show.Saudi Arabia is turning to rich local families as it seeks to shore up demand for the record-breaking share sale. As well the Olayans and Alwaleed, Aramco representatives have been seeking an investment from the Almajdouie family, whose businesses range from distributing Hyundai Motor Co. vehicles in the kingdom to a large logistics operation, according to people familiar with the matter.They have also approached members of the Al-Turki clan, who are involved in fields from real estate to general trading, food distribution and ports, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private conversations.In China, the Beijing-based Silk Road Fund is among parties that have been in discussions to buy stock in the offering, according to people familiar with the matter. State-owned oil producer Sinopec Group and sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp. have also held talks in recent months about investing.Large commitments from China would help Aramco make the share sale a success after Western money managers pushed back earlier on the company’s valuation.Money managers including AllianceBernstein and Frankfurt-based Union Investment Privatfonds believe the energy giant is worth less than the figure of about $1.7 trillion that the prince is now said to be willing to accept.“If Aramco decides to significantly lower its overambitious valuation expectations and float the company on investor-friendly terms, these will be considered a sign of strength and wisdom rather than weakness,” said Slava Breusov, a senior analyst with the emerging and frontier equities team at AllianceBernstein, which manages almost $600 billion.&#92;--With assistance from Kelly Gilblom and Selcuk Gokoluk.To contact the reporters on this story: Matthew Martin in Dubai at mmartin128@bloomberg.net;Dinesh Nair in London at dnair5@bloomberg.net;Netty Ismail in Dubai at nismail3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Will Kennedy at wkennedy3@bloomberg.net, Christopher SellFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aramco-ipo-lean-saudis-china-170853053.html?.tsrc=rss

Sign up here.Chinese state-owned entities are in talks about investing a combined $5 billion to $10 billion in Aramco’s initial public offering, as Saudi Arabia seeks commitments from friendly governments to shore up the record share sale, people with knowledge of the matter said.The Beijing-based Silk Road Fund is among parties that have been in discussions to buy stock in the offering, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Some other Chinese funds or state-owned enterprises may also join, the people said.President Xi Jinping has been seeking to increase China’s political clout and revive ancient trading routes under his “One Belt, One Road” initiative. An investment in Aramco would cement ties with Saudi Arabia as well as provide China a way to profit from rising oil prices.State-owned oil producer Sinopec Group and sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp. have also held talks in recent months about investing in the Aramco IPO, the people said. Commitments haven’t been finalized, and the lineup of investors and the amounts each firm puts in will ultimately depend on the Chinese government, the people said.The Silk Road Fund was set up in 2014 with $40 billion of initial capital. It was later supplemented with another 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) of funds, according to its website.Large commitments from China would help Aramco make the share sale a success after Western money managers pushed back earlier on the company’s valuation. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman has long insisted the state oil company is worth $2 trillion, although he’s prepared to scale back his expectations to between $1.6 trillion and $1.8 trillion, Bloomberg News has reported.Aramco declined to comment.

2019-10-15	2019-10-15 19:46:28	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	Oil Declines as Investors Focus on Gloomy Economic Outlook	(Bloomberg) -- Crude fell for a second day amid a weakening global growth outlook and abundant crude supplies in the world’s largest economy.Futures slid 1.5% in New York on Tuesday. Hopes for a resolution of key issues in the U.S.-China trade dispute are fading, souring prospects for a revival in energy demand. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund cut its 2019 global growth forecast for a fifth time.“There are still U.S.-China trade talks and demand concerns” that are weighing on the market, said Michael Hiley, head of OTC energy trading with LPS Partners.Aside from the U.S.-China trade war, investors are also focused on supply increases in the U.S. The Energy Information Administration sees crude output at major shale plays across the U.S. rising 58,000 barrels a day to 8.97 million barrels a day in November.West Texas Intermediate for November delivery fell 78 cents to settle at $52.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Brent crude for December settlement inched down 61 cents to end the session at $58.74 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange, and traded at a premium of $5.86 to WTI for the same month.Beijing wants a rollback in tariffs in its trade war with the U.S. before China can feasibly agree to buy as much as $50 billion of American agriculture products that President Donald Trump claims are part of an initial deal, people familiar with the matter said.Meanwhile, in the U.S., crude inventories probably rose for a fifth straight week. That would be the longest stretch of increases since February. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey see stockpiles increasing 3 million barrels. The Energy Information Administration is scheduled to release its weekly inventory report on Thursday.“The market has plenty of supply in the short-term,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group Inc. in Chicago.

2019-10-15	2019-10-15 07:24:08	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	China’s Biggest Refiner to Reduce Operations After Freight Rates Skyrocket	(Bloomberg) -- China’s biggest refiner plans to reduce operations from next month after a surge in the cost of shipping crude eroded margins, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Freight rates have skyrocketed since the U.S. announced sanctions on Chinese shipowners in late-September, triggering a flight from vessels owned by affected companies and a bidding war for alternative tankers. That’s driven up the cost of importing crude and is cutting into the profits made from refining.Sinopec Corp. is looking to start cutting run rates from November, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as information is private. The company could reduce total processing by one million tons of oil in December, the equivalent of about 5% of the company’s refining, according to one of the people. An external spokesperson for the company declined to comment.See also: Dilemma for Oil Refiners as Surging Ship Costs Kill MarginsThe decision by Sinopec -- China’s top refiner by capacity -- comes at a time when Asian processors would typically be increasing run rates to cope with higher fuel demand from winter and holiday consumption. The surge in oil-procurement costs has far outweighed an expected boost in margins toward the end of 2019 due to cleaner ship-fuel rules that take effect on Jan. 1.“Such a dramatic surge in freight rates is unprecedented,” said Li Li, an analyst at Shanghai-based commodities researcher ICIS-China. “It’s something that most market observers have never seen before, and it’s leading to widespread panic.”The cost of chartering a supertanker from the Arabian Gulf to China surged fivefold since late-September, according to Baltic Exchange data, as sanctions on units of companies including COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation Co. prompted cancellations and replacements. Booking a tanker for the West Africa to China route rose to $10 a barrel -- which adds almost 20% to the price of oil -- from about $2.50 before the sanctions.Sinopec, which operates complex refineries along China’s coast, the Yangtze River and in North China, imports oil from all the major producing regions. Higher freight rates are set to have a bigger impact on longer-haul shipments.The rising transport costs may prompt refiners to tap existing inventories as they reduce spot purchases. Indian Oil Corp. has been forced to reduce spot imports, while Hindustan Petroleum Corp. has raised concerns about the impact of shipping rates on the company’s procurement plans and profits.“The decision by Sinopec could contribute some bullishness to the Asian fuels and oil-products market,” ICIS-China’s Li said. “Particularly if more refiners across the region follow suit.”(Adds charts and analyst comments in 5th and last paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Alex Longley.To contact the reporters on this story: Alfred Cang in Singapore at acang@bloomberg.net;Sharon Cho in Singapore at ccho28@bloomberg.net;Serene Cheong in Singapore at scheong20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Serene Cheong at scheong20@bloomberg.net, Alexander Kwiatkowski, Andrew JanesFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-biggest-refiner-reduce-operations-042024872.html?.tsrc=rss

It's far from clear, to say the least. But for Chinese stocks Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), New Oriental Education (NYSE:EDU) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), the price charts are offering promising entries for investors willing to ignore headline threats in favor of risk-adjusted opportunities. Let me explain.They're pawns in a politically heated game where the rules of engagement are blurry at best. I'm referring to U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. As most investors are aware, the international trade war has negatively impacted the Asian giant's economy over the past couple of years and proven a foe for bullish investors in many of the country's largest companies.Diversified tech giant Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) and large-cap energy producer China Petroleum (NYSE:SNP) certainly haven't been immune. Since hitting highs in 2018, those titans of industry are off 20% and 37% respectively. And then there's a difficult 25% drop for the very popular iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA:FXI) market barometer.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow this political back-and-forth between the U.S. and China has added another layer of uncertainty to Chinese stocks. Over the past couple weeks, the President Donald Trump administration has hinted it's considering a forced delisting of publicly traded stocks domiciled in China.  * Are These 10 High-Yielding S&P Dividend Stocks Traps or Treasures? To be clear, there is no clarity on how this politically driven move might play out -- or how it might even be accomplished. And many argue whether it's really in the U.S.' best interests to consider going down this road. Bottom line, though, away from the &quot;will he or won't he&quot; headlines driving volatile day-to-day price action in Chinese stocks, shares of BIDU, EDU and JD stock have caught our eye on the price charts. They are names which are in friendly positions for bulls and bears in the weeks and months ahead. Chinese Stocks: Baidu (BIDU)Known to many as China's answer to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) due to its search business and broad reach in other technologies (like autonomous vehicles), BIDU stock is the first of our Chinese stocks to buy. Shares of Baidu have had a tough go due to company-specific issues over the last couple years. But many of those difficulties look to be in the rearview mirror after the company released its last earnings report.What's more, the pressure and price action add up to a below-the-market price multiple opportunity in a name still poised for growth.The price chart in BIDU stock also looks supportive for a turnaround in shares. The monthly view has Baidu stock setting up as an undercut variation of the classic double-bottom pattern. Combined with a &quot;modest&quot; failure of the closely watched 62% Fibonacci support, the possibility of a powerful intermediate low is raised in our technical assessment. The BIDU Stock TradeFor this Chinese stock, I'd suggest waiting for monthly chart confirmation of a pattern low. Waiting until a move above $116 looks like a solid buying strategy. That entry narrowly clears the high of the September pivot bottoming candlestick. This purchase also allows BIDU stock to reclaim the 62% level and should help drive additional buying pressure from bears positioned out of a smaller flag pattern.Along with our next two trade candidates, I'd also recommend a bull call spread in BIDU. It's a safer way to gain exposure in shares given today's volatile trading environment for Chinese stocks. New Oriental Education (EDU)New Oriental Education is another company to consider buying. EDU stock is well-known to growth investors and for good reason. Not only does this prep and online educational services outfit sport double-digit growth, after a significant 50%-plus correction in 2018 shares have been a rare bird within the universe of Chinese stocks as EDU continues to challenge fresh all-time-highs.Currently EDU is forming a tight triangle that's entering its third month of consolidation. With the pattern developing on either side of EDU's former highs, there's solid evidence this platform will lead to a breakout and another large rally into 2020. The EDU Stock TradeFor this Chinese stock, look to buy a slightly out-of-the-money intermediate-term bull call spread. But wait to see if EDU shares can stage a breakout above pattern resistance in the coming days or weeks. JD (JD)JD.com has been likened to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) by many investors due to its online retail presence and growing logistics and services businesses. Technically speaking, JD stock is one which could be setting up for either bears or bulls.The monthly chart of this Chinese stock shows two head-and-shoulder patterns. The smaller formation played out well for bears as shares broke neckline support in 2018 and proceeded to tumble by roughly 40% before forming a triple bottom below $20. But the worst may be yet to come. A larger head-and-shoulders formation has developed over the entirety of JD stock's time as a publicly listed company. Ultimately, a breakdown beneath triple-bottom support would confirm a failure of the large pattern's neckline.Alternatively, with JD stock's right shoulder having formed a pivot high against the smaller neckline and 38% retracement level, a failure or upside breakout could be a huge buy signal for shares. A broken pattern can be powerful motivators for new money to come in. Then a bullish phase could begin. The JD Stock TradeWith shares stationed much closer to a pattern failure than confirmation, if JD can clear the August high of $32.28, a buy entry could be close at hand. Still, bears do have the benefit of the developing bearish head-and-shoulders formation. Either way, respecting the price chart to enter and exit and make any long or short positions a more ironclad proposition using JD stock's options market is advised.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-10-01	2019-10-01 16:23:21	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	Oil Falls Toward One-Month Low as Bleak Signals Proliferate	(Bloomberg) -- Oil fell to the lowest in almost a month as negative economic signals darkened the outlook for global energy demand.Futures dropped as much as 1.6% in New York on Tuesday. Manufacturing in the world’s largest economy has slumped and the World Trade Organization cut its forecast for commerce to a decade low. The bleak economic picture overshadowed a plunge in OPEC crude output last month driven almost entirely by crippling attacks on Saudi Arabian oil installations.“The market is trying to re-calibrate following what happened over the course of the past several weeks,” Michael Tran, head oil strategist for RBC Capital Markets, said by phone. “The bottom line here is that investors aren’t going to short the market given the degree of the geopolitical risk in the market.”Stocks fell and Treasuries rose as investors fled riskier assets including commodities and equities. Traders’ attention has turned to the U.S.-China trade war and its implications for global energy demand. High-level talks between the world’s two largest economies are expected to take place within weeks.West Texas Intermediate for November delivery fell 83 cents to $53.24 a barrel at 12:01 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Brent for December settlement fell 60 cents to $58.65 on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a $5.45 premium to WTI for the same month.Asian manufacturing sentiment remained mostly bleak in September due to the trade conflict and waning demand. The euro area’s manufacturing sector slumped last month.In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management’s factory index slipped to 47.8 in September, the lowest since June 2009. The figure missed all estimates in a Bloomberg survey that had called for an increase from August’s 49.1.“In view of subdued global economic prospects and rising U.S. oil production, any concerns” about oil supply tightening have evaporated, said Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.&#92;--With assistance from Grant Smith and Sharon Cho.To contact the reporters on this story: Robert Tuttle in Calgary at rtuttle@bloomberg.net;Jacquelyn Melinek in New York at jmelinek@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Joe Carroll, Catherine TraywickFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crude-oil-holds-losses-global-224808149.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-10-01	2019-10-01 07:59:44	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	Saudi Aramco to Boost Dividend, Seeks Asian Investors for IPO	(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco sought to underpin the targeted $2 trillion valuation for its initial public offering by increasing dividends, paying less tax and finding cornerstone investments from major Asian oil producers.The moves, which came as the state-run company said it had restored all output halted by attacks on its main crude-processing facility last month, show preparations are accelerating for the listing, with the aim of offering shares on the Saudi bourse as soon as November.The IPO is the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s plans to revamp the Saudi economy and release billions in capital for the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund. The efforts to make Aramco a more appealing investment and guarantee demand for shares come amid skepticism that the prince’s valuation is attainable.Should the kingdom meet that target, the proposed payout of $75 billion next year would still leave dividend yields below those already offered by competitors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. While Aramco is the world’s most profitable company and produces about 10% of the world’s oil, it also carries greater risks, as illustrated by the drone and missile strike on key facilities in September.Growing DividendsThe 2020 payment is part of plan for a growing, progressive dividend to investors, according to a corporate presentation posted on the company’s website on Monday.Dividends of $75 billion would give investors a yield of 3.75% if the company achieves its $2 trillion valuation. Although a decent payout in a low-interest rate world, it’s a lower dividend than other Big Oil firms: investors in Shell receive 6.22%, while Exxon pays out 4.9%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Equity investors will also receive only slightly higher returns than bond investors -- the yield on the company’s 2029 bond is about 3%.Aramco could boost the dividend still further with one-time rewards to shareholders. It paid out a $20 billion special dividend in the first half of the year on the back of an “exceptionally strong financial performance” in 2018, the company said in August, though that payment caused its cash pile to drop markedly.In a bid to reassure potential investors, the company also said that if the total dividend falls below $75 billion between 2020 and 2024 it will prioritize payouts to non-government shareholders.Cornerstone InvestorsAramco has approached Asian state oil producers including Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd., Sinopec Group and China National Petroleum Corp. about potential cornerstone investments in the IPO, people with knowledge of the matter said. The Gulf energy giant and its advisers have also reached out to China’s sovereign wealth fund and state-owned entities from the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, including Abu Dhabi sovereign fund Mubadala Investment Co., as well as Canadian pension funds, the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private.To read more about Aramco’s existing ties with major Asian producers, click here.Deliberations are at a preliminary stage, and Aramco hasn’t yet received any firm commitments, the people said. Aramco’s advisers are arranging meetings with some potential investors this week and next week, according to the people. The funds could decide against buying into the offering, they said.Aramco is leaning on business partners and friendly governments to help achieve its preferred valuation even after oil prices fell more than 25% over the past year. It’s casting a wide net to attract enough demand as it accelerates preparations for the listing in Riyadh. An original plan to list the company on an international exchange at the same time was dropped last year after international investors balked at the valuation.Tax ChangesThe third plank of Aramco’s pitch to investors was a changed schedule for royalty tax on oil production. Payments will be lower when oil is below $70 a barrel, but higher above that level.Under a new royalty structure effective from January, Aramco will pay 15% for Brent prices up to $70 a barrel, 45% for Brent prices between $70 a barrel and $100 a barrel, and 80% on Brent prices above $100 a barrel. The current tax regime, introduced in January 2017, started at 20% and peaked at 50%.The new royalty structure will be a significant boost at today’s oil prices -- it’s equivalent to about $3 a barrel on each of the 9.9 million barrels the company produces daily.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Matthew Martin in Dubai at mmartin128@bloomberg.net;Anthony DiPaola in Dubai at adipaola@bloomberg.net;Elffie Chew in Kuala Lumpur at echew16@bloomberg.net;Vinicy Chan in New York at vchan91@bloomberg.net;Steven Yang in Beijing at kyang74@bloomberg.net;Matthew Monks in New York at mmonks1@bloomberg.net;Jasmine Ng in Singapore at jng299@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Will Kennedy at wkennedy3@bloomberg.net, James Herron, Christopher SellFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/saudi-aramco-plans-75-billion-121228751.html?.tsrc=rss

Their tasks include extracting pipeline assets from the parent companies of the state’s three listed oil and gas firms -- PetroChina Co., China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, and Cnooc Ltd. -- and setting up a new entity to hold the assets, the people said.The national pipeline company would be provisionally named China Pipelines Corp., people familiar with the matter have said. Under the plan, state-controlled and private funds will inject capital sufficient to lower the combined stake held by the three oil majors to about 50%. The company may then file for an initial public offering, while details of the share sale could still change, the people said at that time.China’s State-owned Assets Supervision & Administration Commission is expected to be the biggest shareholder in the new company, while the three oil giants will also have stakes, one of the people said.The creation of the company is part of President Xi Jinping’s drive to streamline industrial capacity, especially among state-owned enterprises. The country has been considering centralizing pipeline operations since at least 2014, aiming to spur wider natural gas distribution and upstream exploration.PetroChina owns 76% of the roughly 65,000 kilometers (40,000 miles) of midstream natural gas pipelines, while 10% is held by Sinopec and 6% by China National Offshore Oil, analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG said in a June report. The remaining are owned by provincial governments or independent operators, they said.Representatives for CLSA, the parent companies of Sinopec and PetroChina declined to comment, while Sasac and the parent of Cnooc didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

European and U.S. equities pared earlier declines as a spokesman for China’s Commerce Ministry signaled that the country wouldn’t immediately retaliate against the latest U.S. tariff increase, saying it was more important to discuss removing the additional duties.Crude futures have pared their monthly loss this week amid a drop in U.S. stockpiles to the lowest since October, yet record American oil production has tempered price gains.“These gains still remain fragile,” said BNP Paribas Head of Commodity-Markets Strategy Harry Tchilinguirian. “It would not take much in terms of negative economic news tied to U.S.-China trade relations to send the oil price back down.”West Texas Intermediate for October delivery advanced 32 cents, or 0.6%, to $56.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 9:03 a.m. local time, after earlier falling as much as 35 cents.Brent for the same month slipped 0.3% to $60.30 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a $4.25 premium to WTI.American crude stockpiles fell by 10 million barrels last week, the most since mid-July, according to the Energy Information Administration.

2019-08-19	2019-08-19 08:55:52	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	Oil Refiners Go From Profit Pain to Gain on Ship-Fuel Rules	(Bloomberg) -- The imminent overhaul of global ship-fuel regulations is finally delivering a long-awaited benefit to Asian oil refiners.Profits from turning crude into diesel in the second half of 2019 are forecast to be about 31% higher than the first six months, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Margins have already expanded around 40% since late April as International Maritime Organization rules that prohibit ships from using dirty fuel from Jan. 1 are set to bolster diesel demand, while cutting fuel oil use.It’s taken a while though. In the first half of the year, margins were in freefall as a slew of refinery startups in Asia flooded the market and the trade war between Washington and Beijing weighed on demand. Refiners in China, South Korea and Taiwan were forced to reduce operating rates due to poor margins and a fuel glut. Output cuts from OPEC+ also squeezed the flow of heavier crude, raising the costs for many Asian buyers that rely on Middle Eastern oil.“Diesel will be a beneficiary of the transition,” Nikhil Bhandari, an analyst at Goldman, said by phone. “The impact of IMO 2020 to the spot refining margins we believe will start from the fourth quarter of this year.”See also: Fitch Solutions Sees Large Spike in Diesel Price Due to IMO 2020The new IMO rules have been in the pipeline since 2016, but have started to throw oil markets around the world into disarray as they draw near. Goldman described the transition as one of the largest one-time reductions in sulfur specification in the history of energy fuel markets. While shippers will still be able to use dirty fuel if they add special pollution kits, many are adopting a wait-and-see mode to installing the equipment.Diesel MarginsIn Singapore, diesel crack spreads are forecast to average $17.60 a barrel during the second half of the year, compared with $13.40 during the first six months, according to Goldman, provided the global economy doesn’t fall into recession and crimp demand. Diesel cracks are forecast to improve further to about $19 in 2020, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Profit margins from cracking Dubai oil into diesel was at $16.14 at 4:30 p.m. Singapore and has averaged $16.39 so far this month.Tighter gasoline supply will also support an overall improvement in Asian refining margins, Goldman said. Heavy residue like vacuum gasoil can be used more as IMO-compliant fuels, meaning less volumes will be cracked into gasoline, the bank said.China’s biggest refiner China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, and India’s Reliance Industries Ltd., are among Asian processors that are poised to benefit from IMO 2020, according to Bernstein. Sinopec’s margins are likely to be boosted by about 40% next year from the second quarter.Improving margins are also starting to boost demand for low-sulfur crudes with a high diesel yield. A shipment of Russia’s Sokol was recently sold at about $5.80 a barrel premium to its benchmark price, the strongest since May, while an Australian Pyrenees grade was sold at a premium of about $14.50, compared with early-2017 when it traded as low as $1.60.“Gasoil has been strong in Asia and Chinese domestic margins are also picking up,” said Senthil Kumaran, Singapore-based senior oil analyst at industry consultant FGE. “Refining margins are robust, encouraging refiners to run at elevated levels in the coming quarters.”(Updates with diesel cracking margin price in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sharon Cho in Singapore at ccho28@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Serene Cheong at scheong20@bloomberg.net, Ben SharplesFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-refiners-profit-pain-gain-014013111.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-09	2019-07-09 13:48:18	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	Aramco Awards $18 Billion in Deals for Work at Oil Fields	(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest crude exporter, awarded $18 billion in contracts to boost output capacity at two offshore oil fields even as the kingdom and its OPEC partners restrict production.Saudi Arabia’s state oil company will add a combined 550,000 barrels a day of crude-production capacity at its Marjan and Berri fields, it said Tuesday in a statement. It will raise capacity for natural gas output at the deposits by 2.5 billion standard cubic feet a day. Aramco awarded 34 contracts, with half of them going to Saudi firms, according to the statement.McDermott International Inc., Saipem SpA of Italy, Norway-listed Subsea 7 SA, Tecnicas Reunidas SA of Spain and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. were among the companies that won contracts, according to a photo that Aramco provided of the signing ceremony. India’s Larsen & Toubro Ltd. and Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. of South Korea also secured deals.The statement itself didn’t identify the 16 companies that were awarded contracts, nor did it specify when the Marjan or Berri projects would be completed.Spare CapacityAramco, known officially as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., plans to bring about 1 million barrels a day of oil capacity online by 2023 in order to compensate for reductions at some other fields. Aramco plans to maintain production capacity of 12 million barrels a day even though it regularly pumps about 10 million barrels daily.Saudi Arabia, with the world’s biggest reserves of conventional crude, has long drawn on its prolific deposits to help balance global oil markets. Riyadh seeks to keep some spare capacity ready and available for rapid use in order to respond quickly to any shortages. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia agreed this month to extend production cuts into 2020 to try to prop up prices amid surging U.S. supplies.“These two programs will significantly enhance Saudi Aramco’s oil production and gas processing capabilities,” Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said in the statement. The field expansions will help meet “growing long-term demand for petroleum,” he said.Marjan’s development will add capacity of 300,000 barrels a day of Aramco’s Arabian Medium crude blend, according to the statement. The Berri project will contribute 250,000 barrels a day of additional capacity for Arabian Light crude. Aramco produces more Arabian Light than any other grade.(Updates with names of contract winners in third paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Anthony DiPaola in Dubai at adipaola@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nayla Razzouk at nrazzouk2@bloomberg.net, Bruce Stanley, Mohammed Aly SergieFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aramco-awards-18-billion-contracts-123848350.html?.tsrc=rss

Now, as the six-month waivers allowing buyers to ship limited quantities approach their expiry, the Saudis are pursuing aggressive output cuts, U.S. sanctions on Venezuela have further squeezed supplies and OPEC producers burned by last quarter’s oil slump are defying Trump’s call for lower prices.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-oil-waivers-rocked-market-015249927.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-02-06	2019-02-06 14:54:24	SNP	China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation	The Oil Majors Are the Only Oil Stocks to Consider Now	"When oil was discovered in Ohio, way back in the 1870s, refineries could not process it. Ohio oil had different chemical properties than the Pennsylvania oil refiners were accustomed to. Finding a solution, and keeping it to himself, helped John D. Rockefeller gain control of the resource and create the Standard Oil empire.

His other secret weapon? Pipelines. Pipelines transport oil at a lower cost, and with greater safety, than anything else. Building and controlling the pipeline networks gave Standard Oil control of the market.

Most U.S. oil majors are descended from the Standard. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) originally combined Standard Oil of New Jersey with a Texas oil producer, Humble Oil & Refining. XOM was originally Standard Oil of New York.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Something like that Ohio problem is hitting refiners now, and oil majors are taking advantage. That's why, despite low oil prices, oil stocks Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A, NYSE:RDS.B). XOM and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) all reported big quarterly profits last week.

### Oil Prices Vary

Oilprice.com lists hundreds of different grades of oil. Most trade within a narrow range, based either on what's called Brent Crude, which comes from the North Sea and is considered a &quot;world&quot; price, or West Texas Intermediate, which is considered the &quot;U.S.&quot; price.

But it's not that simple.

  * 7 Stocks That Won Super Bowl Sunday 



Depending on pipeline capacity, and the chemical properties of the oil, the price can vary considerably. What's called &quot;Western Canada Select,&quot; bitumen mined in Alberta and then mixed with natural gas liquids for transit, sells in the low-40s per barrel. &quot;Bonny Light&quot; oil from Nigeria, easily refined, collected offshore, transported by tanker and part of OPEC, sells for over $63.50 per barrel.

There are even big opportunities in domestic oil. High-sulfur &quot;sour&quot; oils from Texas usually often trade at under $40 per barrel, but those prices are rising as refiners scramble to replace Venezuela supplies creating vast trading profits.

Then there's the fact that the prices quoted may not be accurate. The industry and the Department of Energy have recently differed by as much as 400,000 barrels on the amount of U.S. oil in stockpiles.

### Take It Away

International oil prices vary based on the cost of transport. Tighter supplies from OPEC can buoy U.S. oil prices, but only if traders can find tankers to transport it to where it's needed.

Early in this decade, when oil prices were high, trucks and trains were needed to get supplies from North Dakota's Bakken formation. It was a scramble Rockefeller himself would have detested, but the result was that Bakken oil traded at a big discount to Texas oil, even though the products were nearly identical.

Today, supplies in the Permian have overwhelmed the pipelines and, until new pipelines are completed, it's this &quot;good&quot; oil that's trading at a discount.

### The Oil War

There is another opportunity for the majors, which is the use of oil as a weapon of war. The Trump Administration is now using oil as a weapon against Iran and Venezuela.

Europe can sidestep the Iranian sanctions with special payment mechanisms but the problem is more acute in Venezuela, where getting oil out of the ground requires naphtha, about 90,000 barrels each day, to dilute the oil and let it flow. Venezuela had been getting naphtha from the U.S., mainly from those Gulf Coast refineries. Lack of naphtha could also take Venezuela off the market entirely until the crisis is past, which is what the Administration wants.

Whatever the solution, taking Venezuela oil out of the market also takes some U.S. refineries out of it. Higher gas prices and higher refinery profits may follow.

### The Bottom Line on Oil Stocks

Getting around sanctions and transport bottlenecks is more profitable today than ever before.

Chinese oil refiner China Petroleum & Chemical (NYSE:SNP) learned this the hard way last quarter. It lost $688 million during the quarter because it's just a refiner, without access to the supplies, pipelines and tankers that can help it arbitrage lower prices.

That's why the big winners among today's oil stocks are the oil majors, especially the U.S. majors, and they are your best oil stocks to buy right now.

Oil plunged sharply in late November and December, prompting speculation that Unipec may have contributed to the drop as it unwound contracts.  The Unipec blunder, compounded by other charges, prompted Sinopec to release Friday a full-year net income estimate that’s below expectations, according to analysts at Sanford C.

The moves highlight the divergent ways nations are reacting to temporary exemptions from U.S. sanctions on Iran.  China’s decision to pursue lucrative deals with Tehran and deepen its presence in Iran contrasts with a retreat by Italy and Greece stemming from fear that financial transactions and physical trade with Iran have become too difficult.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e41bc60f-b4f3-39cc-9b4d-4e915c4153fc/%5B%24%24%5D-china-offers-iran-%243.html?.tsrc=rss

The port facilities in the cluster of islands around Zhoushan have annual marine fuel sales of 3.6 million tonnes, less than a tenth of the record 50.6 million tonnes of shipping or bunker fuel Singapore sold in 2017.  Zhoushan, though, was ranked fourth in global container traffic in 2016, according to the World Shipping Council, and it sits 150 km (90 miles) from the world's biggest container port at Shanghai, and within a day's voyage of other major ports including Ningbo and Nanjing.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-zhoushan-singapore-marine-hubs-231505692.html?.tsrc=rss

The sources did not specify volumes, but based on the prevailing supply contract between the top Chinese refiner and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), its loadings would be reduced to about 130,000 barrels per day (bpd).  This would be 20 percent of China's average daily imports from Iran in 2017, dealing a blow to Tehran, which has counted its top oil client to maintain imports while European and other Asian buyers wind down purchases to avoid U.S. sanctions.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-sinopec-halves-iran-oil-105811300.html?.tsrc=rss
