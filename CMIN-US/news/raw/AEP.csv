2021-01-06	2021-01-06 13:29:30	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	How Does American Electric Power's Debt Look?	Shares of American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) fell by 10.47% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt American Electric Power has.American Electric Power's Debt According to the American Electric Power's most recent financial statement as reported on October 22, 2020, total debt is at $32.80 billion, with $28.16 billion in long-term debt and $4.64 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $409.70 million in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $32.39 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. American Electric Power has $78.69 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.42. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Why Investors Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

Biden Win Would Prop Up American Electric Power's Renewable Energy Plans, CEO Says	"American Electric Power Company Inc (NASDAQ: AEP) CEO Nick Akins discussed his company's clean energy plans with CNBC's Jim Cramer on the ""Mad Money"" show, Monday.What Happened: The power distribution giant reported a decent earnings quarter last week with slightly higher-than-expected earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter. Atkins said the company is carrying on with its capital expenditures regardless of what is going on with the economy.The economy's commercial and industrial segments are bouncing back as people start moving out of their houses and the economy opens.The company has been committed to increasing power generation from renewable energy, which can be seen in its latest 50-MW output purchase from Columbus Solar Park.Commenting on how the November presidential election impacts the company's renewable energy plans, Atkins said American Electric would continue with its clean energy plans regardless of the election outcome as shareholders expect them to move in that direction.""If a Biden administration comes in, we certainly expect more aggressiveness in terms of the targets, but we're already moving forward very quickly, and we'll continue to focus on that as we move forward,"" Atkins said.Why It Matters: The Democratic presidental nominee has a $1.7 trillion plan to address climate change compared to President Trump, who wants the growth of both oil and coal industries, CNBC reports.Atkins said that American Electric has reduced carbon emissions by 65% in the last two decades and they expect to reduce 70% further by 2030.To achieve sustainable energy goals, the company plans to invest more than $2 billion in renewable energy by 2024 by building more wind and solar capabilities and creating a modern power grid.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Asian Markets Today: Shares Plunge After Wall Street's Decline  * Hasbro Shares Fall As Margin Improvements Fail To Impress(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Reminds Investors That Class Action Lawsuits Have Been Filed Against STAAR Surgical, Baidu, Alteryx, and American Electric Power and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm	NEW YORK, Sept. 23, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of STAAR Surgical Company (NASDAQ: STAA), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU), Alteryx, Inc. (NYSE: AYX), and American Electric Power Company, Inc. (“AEP”) (NYSE: AEP). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.  STAAR Surgical Company (NASDAQ: STAA)Class Period: February 26, 2020 to August 10, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 19, 2020STAAR designs, develops, manufactures, and sells implantable lenses for the eye and companion delivery systems used to deliver the lenses into the eye. STAAR’s primary products are: (1) “implantable Collamer® lenses,” or “ICLs,” used in refractive surgery; and (2) intraocular lenses, or “IOLs,” used in cataract surgery.On August 5, 2020, after the markets closed, STAAR announced its financial results for the quarter ended July 3, 2020, reporting a net loss of $0.03 per share, versus net income of $0.08 per share in the prior year quarter, among other things.On this news, the company’s share price dropped approximately 10%, from a closing share price of $61.81 on August 5, 2020, to a close on August 6, 2020 at $55.86.On August 11, 2020, analyst J Capital Research Limited published a report stating that “[w]e think STAAR Surgical has overstated sales in China by at least one-third, or $21.6 mln. That would mean that all of the company’s $14 mln in 2019 profit is fake.” J Capital stated that the report was based on “over 75 interviews,” as well as visits to STAAR locations in China and Switzerland.On this news, STAAR’s stock price sharply declined, closing at $48.25 on August 11, 2020, down approximately 6.2% from its August 10, 2020 closing price of $51.42.The complaint, filed on August 19, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts to investors.

Reminds Investors That Class Action Lawsuits Have Been Filed Against American Electric Power, OneSpan, Qutoutiao, and Vaxart and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm	NEW YORK, Sept. 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (“AEP”) (NYSE: AEP), OneSpan, Inc. (NASDAQ: OSPN), Qutoutiao, Inc. (NASDAQ: QTT), and Vaxart, Inc. (NASDAQ: VXRT). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.  American Electric Power Company, Inc. (“AEP”) (NYSE: AEP) Class Period: November 2, 2016 and July 24, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 19, 2020On July 25, 2020, the Columbus Dispatch published an article titled “Columbus utility giant AEP funded dark money spending in HB 6 campaign,” reporting on the Company’s actions in connection with “campaigns now at the center of a racketeering and bribery case . . . .”On this news, shares of AEP shares fell $4.79 per share, or over 5%, to close at $83.26 per share on July 27, 2020, the next trading day.The complaint, filed on August 20, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company covertly participated in the “the largest public corruption case in Ohio history”; (2) the Company secretly funneled substantial funds to Ohio political organizations and politicians to bribe politicians to pass Ohio House Bill 6, which benefitted the Company and its coal-fired generation assets; (3) the Company partially funded a massive, misleading advertising campaign in support of HB6 and in opposition to a ballot initiative to repeal HB6 by passing substantial sums through a web of dark money entities and front companies in order to conceal the Company’s involvement; (4) the Company aided in subverting a citizens’ ballot initiative to repeal HB6; (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ Class Period statements regarding the Company’s regulatory and legislative efforts were materially false and misleading; (6) as a result of the foregoing, the Company would face increased scrutiny; (7) the Company was subject to undisclosed risk of reputational, legal and financial harm; (8) the bribery scheme would jeopardize the benefits the Company sought by HB6; (9) as opposed to the Company’s repeated public statements regarding a move to clean energy, it sought a dirty energy bailout; (10) as opposed to the Company’s repeated public statements regarding protection of its customers’ interests, the Company sought an extra and state-mandated surcharge on its customers’ bills; and (11) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.For more information on the AEP securities class action case go to: https://bespc.com/AEPOneSpan, Inc. (NASDAQ: OSPN) Class Period: May 9, 2018 and August 11, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 19, 2020On August 4, 2020, OneSpan postponed its second-quarter 2020 earnings release and conference call by one week, attributing the delay to prior period revenue recognition problems relating to certain software license contracts spread out over the quarters from the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2020.  OneSpan further stated that “[t]he net contract assets that originated from a portion of these contracts in prior periods were not properly accounted for in subsequent periods, which caused overstatements of revenue.” On this news, the Company’s common share price fell $0.46 per share, or 1.40%, to close at $32.50 per share on August 4, 2020.Then, on August 11, 2020, OneSpan disclosed that it would not timely file its quarterly report for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, with the SEC; reported that same quarter year-over-year revenues had declined; and withdrew its full-year 2020 earnings guidance, which the Company had affirmed one quarter earlier. On this news, the Company’s common share price fell $12.36 per share, or 39.62%, to close at $18.84 per share on August 12, 2020.The complaint, filed on August 20, 2020, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) OneSpan had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (ii) as a result, OneSpan overstated its revenue relating to certain contracts with customers involving software licenses in its financial statements spread out over the quarters from the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2020; (iii) as a result, it was foreseeably likely that the Company would eventually have to delay one or more scheduled earnings releases, conference calls, and/or financial filings with the SEC; (iv) OneSpan downplayed the negative impacts of errors in its financial statements; (v) all the foregoing, once revealed, was foreseeably likely to have a material negative impact on the Company’s financial results and reputation; and (vi) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the OneSpan securities class action go to: https://bespc.com/OSPNQutoutiao, Inc. (NASDAQ: QTT)Class Period: Securities purchased (a) pursuant and/or traceable to the Company’s September 2018 initial public offering (“IPO”); and/or (b) between September 14, 2018 and July 15, 2020, inclusive (the “Class Period”)Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 19, 2020In September 2018, the Company completed its IPO, selling 13.8 million ADSs at $7.00 per share.On December 10, 2019, Wolfpack Research published a report, alleging among other things, that the Company had overstated its revenues by recording non-existent advances from advertising customers. Moreover, the report alleged that Qutoutiao replaced its third-party advertising agent with a related party, thereby bypassing the agent’s oversight and allowing the Company to “perpetrate the unmitigated ad fraud that [Wolfpack] observed in [its] sample.”On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.12, or nearly 4%, to close at $2.86 per share on December 11, 2019.On July 15, 2020, hosts of a consumer rights gala stated that Qutoutiao had allowed ads on its platform promoting exaggerated or impossible claims from weight-loss products. For example, one such ad offered free weight-loss products valued at $14,300 that would help users lose more than 30 pounds a month.On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.85, or 23%, to close at $2.84 per share on July 16, 2020.The complaint, filed on August 20, 2020, alleges that defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Qutoutiao replaced its advertising agent with a related party, thereby bypassing third-party oversight of the content and quality of the advertisements; (2) that the Company placed advertisements on its mobile app for products whose claims could not be substantiated and thus were considered false advertisements under applicable regulations; (3) that, as a result, the Company would face increasing regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm; (4) that, as a result, the Company’s advertising revenue was reasonably likely to decline; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects, were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.For more information on the Qutoutiao class action go to: https://bespc.com/QTTVaxart, Inc. (NADSAQ: VXRT) Class Period: June 25, 2020 and July 25, 2020Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 23, 2020The class action arises from defendants’ alleged fraudulent scheme to profit from artificially inflating the Company’s stock price by announcing false and misleading information concerning Vaxart’s oral COVID-19 vaccine candidate, including its purported involvement in the government funded “Operation Warp Speed.”In furtherance of the scheme, defendants amended controlling shareholder Armistice Capital LLC’s existing warrant agreements, allowing Armistice to exercise all of its warrants immediately and sell 27.6 million Vaxart shares, reaping profits of approximately $200 million. Defendants also issued millions of dollars in favorable stock options to Vaxart’s most senior executives.On July 25, 2020, details emerged revealing defendants’ deception concerning their alleged pump and dump scheme. In particular, on July 25, 2020, The New York Times published an article entitled, “Corporate Insiders Pocket $1 Billion in Rush for Coronavirus Vaccine,” covering suspiciously timed stock bets that had generated significant profits for senior executives and board members at companies developing vaccines and treatments. Vaxart was featured prominently in the article, and it clarified “Vaxart is not among the companies selected to receive significant financial support from Warp Speed.”On this news, the price of Vaxart shares declined significantly on July 27, 2020 from $12.29 per share to $11.16 per share.The complaint, filed on August 24, 2020, alleges that during the Class Period, defendants engaged in a scheme to deceive the market and a course of conduct that artificially inflated the prices of Vaxart’s securities and operated as a fraud or deceit on Class Period purchasers of Vaxart’s securities by failing to disclose to investors that the Company’s financial results were materially misleading and misrepresented material information. When defendants’ misrepresentations and fraudulent conduct were disclosed and became apparent to the market, the prices of Vaxart’s securities fell precipitously as the prior inflation came out of the Company’s stock price.For more information on the Vaxart class action go to: https://bespc.com/VXRTAbout Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.:  Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York and California.

Specifically, defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose to investors that the Company was overstating and/or mischaracterizing: (1) its sales and growth in China; (2) its marketing spend; (3) its research and development expenses; and that as a result of the foregoing, (4) defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.For more information on the STAAR class action go to: https://bespc.com/STAABaidu, Inc.

2020-07-27	2020-07-27 14:12:07	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	A Look Into American Electric Power's Price Over Earnings	Right now, American Electric Power Inc. (NYSE: AEP) share price is at $86.89, after a 1.30% decrease. Over the past month, the stock spiked by 9.11%, but over the past year, it actually decreased by 2.06%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio.The stock is currently above from its 52 week low by 33.41%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Utilities--Regulated Electric stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.View more earnings on AEPDepending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 17.89 in the Utilities--Regulated Electric industry, American Electric Power Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 23.67. Shareholders might be inclined to think that American Electric Power Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It's also possible that the stock is overvalued.There are many limitations to P/E ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company.

2020-05-15	2020-05-15 10:18:29	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	5 Stable Dividend Stocks to Buy as Fixed Income Vanishes	[Editor's note: &quot;5 Stable Dividend Stocks to Buy as Fixed Income Vanishes&quot; was previously published in January 2020. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]Income in the bond market is rapidly disappearing, and that's a weird concept to try and wrap your head around.For decades -- centuries, even -- investors around the world have bought fixed-income instruments for relatively risk-free income. The concept is simple. You give money to a government or corporate entity who turns around and pays you interest for lending that money to compensate for risk and time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut this simple concept has been flipped on its head recently. Specifically, the &quot;interest&quot; part of the above fixed-income equation has gone out the window. Consider the following:  * The 10-year Treasury yield is around 0.63%.  * The 30-year Treasury yield has plunged to all-time lows around 1.3%.In other words, across the world, the income part of the fixed-income equation is rapidly disappearing. Weird, right?Despite this, U.S. equities are still giving investors income. That is, the S&P 500's dividend yield presently hovers around 2% -- significantly above all-time low levels (roughly 1% in 2000) and also on the upper end of where the S&P 500 dividend yield has hovered over the past 20 years.Big picture, then, while the fixed income market is suffering from disappearing income, some stocks are still paying good income.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Have Nothing But Upside In Their Future The implication? Buy stable dividend stocks that pay more than any other relatively risk-free bond in the world will. As investors grow tired of not even beating inflation by buying a 10-year Treasury note, they will inevitably pile into stocks which: 1) have much higher yields, and 2) have a history of steady and consistent dividend hikes.Without further ado, let's take a look at five dividend stocks that fit this description. AT&T (T)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 7.28%Dividend History: The dividend has consistently increased over the past 34 years.At the top of this list, we have a stock that many consider the blue-chip dividend king: telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T).AT&T has everything investors are looking for in a stable, income-paying stock. Big yield? Check. The stock yields 5.37%. History of dividend hikes? Check. AT&T has consistently hiked its dividend over the past three decades.Stable operations? Check. AT&T provides telecom services that U.S. consumers have become exceptionally dependent on -- indeed, the internet and wireless services which AT&T provides may be the most important utilities outside of water, food and electricity. Healthy catalysts on the horizon? Also, check.AT&T's streaming services should help offset cord-cutting weakness, and the company benefits from the mainstream and widespread deployment of 5G infrastructure and devices.AT&T stock is the quintessential stable dividend stock to buy at the current moment. American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.59%Dividend History: The dividend has consistently increased over the past six years.Next up, we have a utility giant that is best known for its stability and resiliency: electricity services provider American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP).Relative to other &quot;big dividend stocks,&quot; AEP's yield isn't that big. It sits at just 2.98%. But, there are three things to note here.First, that yield still smashes the 10-year Treasury yield.Second, American Electric Power has a long track record of consistent dividend hikes that dates back at least six years, a stretch during which the dividend increased 100%.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That You Can Still Bank On Third, American Electric Power has an equally long track record of consistent and stable revenue and profit growth, which has powered consistent gains in AEP stock over the past decade.As such, what AEP lacks in yield, it makes up for in operational consistency and stability. Consequently, the best way to look at AEP stock is as the best &quot;stable&quot; stock to buy. It just so happens to yield almost 3%, too, which is an added bonus. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.26%Dividend History: The dividend has consistently increased over the past eight years.Third, we have a global chip giant that appears to be on the verge of finding its winning stride again -- Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).Unlike AT&T and American Electric Power, Qualcomm is not traditionally seen as an icon of stability. Just look at a five-year chart of QCOM stock to see why. But, most of the turbulence in QCOM stock over the past five years has been driven by operational noise, namely, a big legal battle with their largest customer, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). That legal battle is now over, and it ended in a favorable outcome for Qualcomm.Consequently, looking in the rear-view mirror here is the wrong way to look at QCOM stock. It's not about what has happened. It's about what will happen. What will happen is good stuff. Qualcomm has locked in Apple as a customer for the next several years.At the same time, 5G phones are launching next year, and it appears pretty much every smartphone provider is leaning into Qualcomm to provide the infrastructure for those 5G phones. As such, Qualcomm will find itself as a big beneficiary of the 5G tailwind. This tailwind should last for several years, meaning that Qualcomm should be in winning stride for the foreseeable future.Ahead of the company regaining its winning stride, the stock still yields an impressive 2.75%. Thus, not only does QCOM stock have a compelling multi-year bull thesis, but the stock is also paying investors to buy into that compelling bull thesis. It's a win-win situation that ultimately gives QCOM the nod as a stable dividend stock to buy here and now. CVS (CVS)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.21%Dividend History: CVS last increased its dividend payout in 2017.Fourth, we have an undervalued, stable stock that is in the midst of a potentially huge breakout -- retail pharmacy giant CVS (NYSE:CVS).It's been a rough few years for CVS stock. On the retail pharmacy side, increased competition has simultaneously pressured current sales trends and depressed investor sentiment regarding future sales trends. On the pharmacy benefit manager side, legislation has similarly pressured sales and profits.Consequently, by mid-2019, CVS stock had dropped to $50 -- the stock's lowest level since early 2013 -- and was trading at under 8x forward earnings.Since then, retail sales trends have improved as CVS has refreshed stores and expanded omnichannel capabilities to overstep the competition. Such improvements should persist as the company expands a local healthcare program which has the potential to dramatically improve core operational performance trends.  * 7 of the Best Consumer Stocks to Buy Right Now At the same time, the White House has scrapped a bill that would've been disastrous for PBMs. And now the outlook on that side of the business is also improving significantly.In response to these positive developments, CVS stock has rallied well past $70 since it's mid-2019 plunge. This rally is just getting started. The stock is still cheap, the yield is still big, the outlook is still improving and the upward momentum is very real. As such, CVS stock appears to be in the first few innings of a huge breakout. Target (TGT)Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com Yield: 2.20%Dividend History: The dividend has consistently increased over the past 51 years.Last, but not least, we have a blue-chip retail giant that is absolutely on fire today: Target (NYSE:TGT).The story at Target is pretty simple. A few years back, the mainstream emergence and adoption of e-commerce caused a traffic exodus out of Target stores. For a short period of time, Target struggled. Then, Target adapted. It built out a big e-commerce operation, refreshed stores to be more tech-savvy, built out omnichannel capabilities, expanded in-store and online offerings and much more.In a nutshell, Target became the quintessential, modern omnichannel retailer that leveraged technology to optimize customer convenience in every way possible.It worked. Over the past few years, Target has fired off its best numbers in a decade. We are talking decade-best sales growth, comparable sales growth, online sales growth and traffic growth. At the same time, margins have been largely stable, so profit growth has been equally robust. TGT stock has naturally rallied big in response to this operational excellence.This rally is far from over. Target has optimally positioned itself so that -- so long as the U.S. consumer remains healthy -- Target will continue to report impressive numbers. The stock isn't terribly expensive at all (17-times forward earnings), the yield remains big (2.12%) and TGT stock has very healthy upward momentum.TGT stock is a stable dividend stock that should stay in rally mode for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long T, QCOM, and CVS.

2020-03-27	2020-03-27 15:18:40	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	U.S. Utilities Line Up Over $15 Billion as Virus Roils Markets	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. utilities have lined up more than $15 billion in cash and credit as uncertainty over the coronavirus strains the short-term debt market.Electricity giants including American Electric Power Co., Duke Energy Corp. and Dominion Energy Inc. have sold bonds, entered into new credit facilities or drawn on existing lines to boost liquidity. It follows a surge in costs in the commercial paper market, forcing companies to look for alternatives.“We expect to continue to see utilities drawing on credit lines,” Shahriar Pourreza, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, said in a research note, citing AEP’s $1 billion credit agreement announced Monday. The move is a conservative stance to shore up funds, he said. “We do not see it in any way a sign of overall liquidity risk.”Utilities have also benefited from their defensive nature to issue new debt as the corporate bond market has been open mostly to the highest-quality investment-grade issuers. Banks have enjoyed similar status in comprising much of the recent supply, as well as frequent telecom and media issuers including Verizon Communications Inc. and Comcast Corp.New York utility Consolidated Edison Inc was the latest to tap the credit market with two bond offerings Thursday totaling $1.6 billion. That’s pushed the total amount sold by power and gas suppliers this month to about $9.6 billion, adding to at least $6 billion in new credit lines with banks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Xcel Energy Inc. is also seeking to sell $500 million in notes.It has come at a higher cost, as the coronavirus sell-off has sent bond prices down. NextEra Energy Inc.’s $1.1 billion sale of five-year notes Tuesday, through its Florida Power & Light subsidiary, priced at 237.5 basis points over comparable Treasuries. That’s more than twice as much as the company agreed to pay in a similar deal a year ago.NextEra declined to comment.Duke was still able to lock in record-low rates in a sale of $550 million in 30-year notes. Last week the company announced it had a new $1.5 billion term loan and borrowed $500 million from an existing line.“The majority of the funding will be used to reduce our commercial paper balances,” spokesman Neil Nissan said by email. “When the short-term funding markets return to a more stable environment, we may elect to rely on commercial paper like normal.”Other deals include AEP’s $1 billion credit agreement, which the company will use in part to pay down short-term debt. “We took these actions to fortify our liquidity in the challenging markets,” AEP spokeswoman Melissa McHenry said by email. The company earlier this month also raised almost $1.2 billion through bond offerings.Dominion tapped $1.2 billion in new bank lines while selling $750 million in notes last week, although the bonds were already part of its 2020 financing plans, spokesman Ryan Frazier said.“Yet given market volatility, Dominion Energy has taken prudent steps to increase liquidity via other financing transactions,” he said, noting that Dominion has no plans to drawn on its $6 billion master credit facility.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-utilities-line-14-billion-160915814.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-23	2020-01-23 20:00:00	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	Old Electric Car Batteries May Help Cut Costs of Storing Power	(Bloomberg) -- As major players jostle for market share in large-scale power storage, American Electric Power and Nissan Motor Co. are testing new technology that re-uses old electric vehicle batteries to slash costs.The pilot study in Ohio will road test technology that could lower system costs by about a half and extend the life of lithium-ion batteries by about a third, according to its Australian developer.Costs of energy storage systems are falling globally on technology improvements, larger manufacturing volumes, increased competition between suppliers and as the sector adds more expertise, BloombergNEF said in an October report. That’s driving an expansion in investment in projects to store power, with as much as $5 billion worth of deals possible this year for systems paired with renewable energy, according to the forecaster.American Electric’s Ohio study is using expired Nissan Leaf car batteries and is intended to test the innovations at scale after laboratory work in Australia and Japan.Results so far appear promising, Ram Sastry, American Electric’s vice president, innovation and technology, said by phone. “It’s in a facility that we own, but connected to the real grid.” he said.The technology is developed by Melbourne-based Relectrify and uses old, or second-life, vehicle batteries and reduces the number of components needed, the company said Friday in a statement. That can reduce costs for key parts of typical industrial or grid storage systems to about $150 per kilowatt hour, it said.That compares with a current average price for similar technology using new batteries of $289 a kilowatt hour, according to the BloombergNEF 2019 Energy Storage System Costs Survey.Companies like BMW AG and Toyota Motor Corp. are already putting re-used cells to work in applications including renewable energy storage, electric vehicle charging, and to power street lights and homes. About three-quarters of vehicle batteries are eventually likely to be reused, according to London-based researcher Circular Energy Storage.Cheaper energy storage with batteries could provide an alternative to adding more capacity at electricity substations, or building more transformers. It could also be harnessed to provide backup power and bolster reliability for consumers, according to American Electric’s Sastry.“There are many use cases that we have for batteries that are predicated on the cost,” he said. “If the battery goes lower in cost, it can compete with the wires.”Yet even as the price of lithium-ion battery cells has fallen, it’s been difficult to reduce costs of components such inverters. “The inverter is the Achilles heel of energy storage,” said Bradley Smith, president of Covington, Louisiana-based Beauvoir Consulting Services and previously an executive developing second-life battery products at Nissan.Relectrify’s system reduces the need for separate electronics for both the inverter and battery management system, lowering costs, Smith said.The technology can also extend the lifespan of either reused or new batteries by offering more precise management of individual cells, according to Valentin Muenzel, CEO of Relectrify, a 14-person firm launched in 2015 that’s collaborated with companies including Volkswagen AG and International Business Machines Corp.Some potential end users remain wary of re-using lithium-ion batteries over concerns about their longevity and costs of re-purposing cells, according to BNEF’s head of clean power Logan Goldie-Scot.“Many customers are not yet comfortable with second-life batteries even at a steep discount,” he said. Tesla Inc. has in the past suggested it will favor recycling spent packs from vehicles to recover raw materials, rather than seek to re-use the cells first.Relectrify, which is holding talks with battery manufacturers and distributors, sees potential to eventually help improve performance of batteries for the auto sector, in addition to energy storage.“We see stationary storage as the low hanging fruit,” Muenzel said. “We’re already getting demand for use in some mobility applications and we expect that is an area that will continue to grow with time.”To contact the reporter on this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/old-electric-car-batteries-may-200000590.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-17	2020-01-17 21:33:13	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	These 3 Market Giants Get a Thumbs-Up Ahead of Earnings	Once again, we’re heading into earnings season. All publicly traded companies are required by law to disclose their revenues, earnings, and other financial data quarterly, and the reports generally start coming in a few weeks after each calendar quarter ends. And now it’s time for the Q4 2019 reports to start coming in.Earnings season always generates a spate of analyst predictions, and this time is no different. Looking back, market watchers note that 2019 saw a series of lackluster quarters – that nevertheless did not impede stock performance. Companies compensated by reducing their forward guidance and then clearing that lower bar.So far, it seems that this is likely to happen once again. Bank of America’s securities strategists wrote, “We expect to see a 2% beat in 4Q earnings. Estimates have reset sufficiently, in our view.” At the same time, analysts are expecting stock prices to continue rising, with any pullback likely to be both shallow and short-lived.Ahead of the earnings releases, three market giants have received recent upgrades or price-target hikes from top analysts. Rating upgrades are important, as they indicate a positive change in the likely direction a stock will take – and their timing is important, too, as an upgrade shortly before an earnings release will push investor expectations. Using TipRanks' Stock Comparison tool, we lined up the three alongside each other to give us an idea of what the Street thinks is in store for the trio in the year ahead. American Electric Power (AEP)American Electric Power is one of the largest electricity providers in the country, with over 5 million customers in 11 states, some 26,000 megawatts of generating capacity, and a market cap of $47 billion. AEP is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings on February 20.Ahead of the print, the company is expected to show EPS of 62 cents, down 10 cents from Q4 2018. In the last three quarters, AEP has beaten the forecasts by an average of 6.7%. For the full year 2019, EPS is estimated at $4.18. In Q3 2019, the last reported, AEP showed strong results. The Q3 EPS, $1.46, was far ahead of the $1.33 predicted.Like many utilities, AEP pays out a dividend to shareholders. The 70-cent quarterly payment annualizes to $2.80, with a yield of 2.9%. This beats the average S&P yield by a wide margin, and makes the stock more attractive despite a relatively low upside potential (more below). Better for investors, the company has a history of steadily increasing the dividend, and at 48%, the payout ratio indicates both sustainability and room for further dividend growth.A reliable business base and solid earnings gave Shelby Tucker, 4-star analyst with RBC Capital, reason to upgrade his rating and price target on AEP. In his comments on the stock, Tucker pointed out the “robust rate base and earnings growth,” and noted, “We view AEP as having best value in the same peer group of quality utilities and see it trading at an improved multiple.”Tucker moved his rating up to Buy, and increased his price to $103 (from $96). His new target suggests a modest, but likely reliable, upside of 5% for the stock. (To watch Tucker’s track record, click here)All in all, American Electric has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. This is based on 9 recent stock reviews, including 5 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. Tucker’s upgraded Buy is the most recent of those ratings. Shares have an average price target of $97.25; this implies a minimal downside from the $98.55 trading price. (See American Electric stock analysis at TipRanks)Apple, Inc. (AAPL)Apple needs no introduction. Tim Cook's baby is a giant in every sense of the word. It is the world’s largest publicly traded company, and in summer of 2018 was the first company to every exceed a $1 trillion market cap. Apple is currently valued at $1.37 trillion. The company has a reliable – and loyal – customer base over 900 million strong, and saw over $265 billion in revenue in 2018.2019 was challenging for Apple. A series of headwinds – the US-China trade tensions, maturation of the smartphone replacement cycle, slowing iPhone sales – combined to push earnings down and forced management to seek alternate strategies to maintain revenue growth. During the year, Apple shifted toward an emphasis on its Services and Wearables segments, along with revamping the Mac and iPad lines, to compensate for the decline in iPhone sales, and that strategy is bearing fruit. Outside factors – the switch to 5G, with its concomitant necessity for customers to upgrade devices, and the apparent success of President Trump’s tariff strategy in forcing China into trade negotiations – are also looking better for Apple as 2020 opens.Q3 2019 showed that Apple’s new strategy is working. While iPhone sales were lower than expected, 18% growth in Services and 54% growth in Wearables powered an overall gain in total revenue, to $64 billion. The $3.03 EPS was 6.7% above the forecast.Looking ahead to Q4, analysts are sanguine. The final quarter is normally Apple’s strongest, and EPS is expected at $4.53. Since the December 2018 quarter, Apple has beaten earnings forecasts by increasing margins in each report.Canaccord analyst Michael Walkley sees plenty of reason for optimism as Apple gears up for its January 28 earnings release. He points out Apple’s market leading Wearables position, with strong growth in the Air Pods and Watch, and says as well, “We believe Apple’s ecosystem approach, including an installed base that exceeds 1.4B devices globally, is leading to record services revenue, and we expect the higher margin services revenue growth to continue outpacing total company growth. We are also encouraged by the strong demand for the iPhone 11 lineup and believe Apple will maintain its market share leadership of premium-tier smartphones that could be bolstered by a 5G upgrade cycle.”Walkley upgraded Apple to a Buy, and set his price target at $355, implying an upside of 11%. (To watch Walkley’s track record, click here)Overall, Apple’s 34 analyst ratings add up to a consensus view of Moderate Buy. The breakdown is 20 Buys, 11 holds, and 3 Sells. Apple’s rapid share appreciation in the past month has pushed the stock price above the average target, and the analysts have yet to adjust. Shares are selling for $318.73, while the average target is still at $296. (See Apple’s stock analysis at TipRanks)Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)It makes sense to talk about Qualcomm along with Apple. The chipmaker is Apple’s main supplier of smartphone modem chips, a factor that will be integral to both companies’ positioning in the global switch to 5G networks. In addition, Qualcomm and Apple ended a long-running legal battle last year with an agreed settlement that saw Qualcomm on the receiving end of a large – and undisclosed – lump sum.2019 was volatile for Qualcomm, as it was for much of the chip industry, but the company’s settlement with Apple and subsequent agreement to once again displace Intel as Apple’s prime modem chip supplier, gave the company a boost. QCOM shares ended the year with an impressive annual gain of 59%.In 2H19, QCOM saw gains when it beat earnings estimates in calendar Q3. Despite year-over-year drops, both the top and bottom lines exceeded forecasts. At the bottom line, the 78-cent EPS was well ahead of the Street’s 71-cent forecast, while the top-line $4.81 billion in revenues beat expectations by 2.3%. For calendar Q4 2019, QCOM is again expected to show a 71-cent EPS when the company reports on February 5.Canaccord’s Walkley, quoted above, looked at QCOM shares, too, and had this to say: “Given … 75 plus 5G licenses, we believe Qualcomm has a strong chance to maintain its current licensing business and is well positioned to benefit with 5G network builds ramping around the world. Further, we believe the recent Apple settlement and Samsung and LGE renegotiations protect a strong portion of Qualcomm’s long-term licensing business model.”In line with his optimism, Walkley reiterated his Buy rating on the stock and increased his price target to $115. His new price target suggests an upside potential of 20%.

Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up about 28%. If the index were to trade flat into the end of the year, then 2019 would go down as the best year for the stock market since 2013, and the third-best year of the 2000s.But the stock market has also had a volatile 2019. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 has experienced more than 10 pullbacks of 2% or greater. By itself, that's not shocking. But what is shocking is that pretty much all of those 2% pullbacks have had the same culprit: the U.S.-China trade war.So, while I think U.S.-China trade tensions will ease going forward and the markets will consequently power higher, I also recognize that the trade war isn't over. Flare-ups will happen throughout 2020. Each one of those flare ups will be followed by a harsh stock market correction.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Hot Stocks for 2020's Big Trends Given that, I don't blame you if you want sit out all the volatility and buy safety stocks in 2020 that don't have trade war exposure. If you're in that boat, this gallery is for you. I've hand picked a group of five safety stocks to buy for their strong internal fundamentals and lack of external trade war exposure. Safety Stocks to Buy: AT&T (T)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com The core reason to be attracted to telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) in the midst of the U.S.-China trade war is that this company provides various wireless and wired communication services which consumers in the U.S. need (and will continue to pay up for), regardless of the global trade situation. Broadly, then, no matter how the trade war plays out, AT&T's revenue and profit trends should remain relatively stable, leading to a relatively stable AT&T stock price.Further, AT&T stock has two huge catalysts on the horizon which could propel shares higher in 2020. First, there's the big mainstream 5G push, which will lead to increased demand for AT&T's wireless services at more favorable price points, as well as an increase in the number of connected devices in AT&T's wireless network. Second, there's the big streaming push with HBO Max. If that service gains healthy momentum in the streaming world, then the company will have found a cure for its cord-cutting headwinds, and the stock will benefit from multiple expansion as secular cord-cutting fears disappear -- just see what happened with Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock and Disney+.Of course, any mention of T stock as a safety stock would be incomplete without mentioning that: 1) this stock is incredibly cheap at just 11-times forward earnings, and 2) the stock also has a huge dividend yield that is north of 5%. Facebook (FB)Source: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com Perhaps shockingly, social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) makes this list of safety stocks to buy without trade war exposure because, at its core, this company does not have much trade exposure.Facebook doesn't operate in China, so there are no levers China can pull here to hurt Facebook. Further, FB's properties will remain highly engaging in all other countries that they do operate in, regardless of the trade situation. That's because Facebook provides entertainment and communication services which consumers deem as central to their day as brushing their teeth or combing their hair. So long as consumers remain engaged, advertisers will continue to pour money into the Facebook ecosystem to chase that engagement.Sure, there's the risk that escalating trade tensions depress capital spending plans. Advertising is part of those capital spending plans. In theory, if the trade war gets really bad, Facebook ad budgets could get hit. But that has yet to happen. It's unlikely to happen anytime soon, because cutting Facebook ad budgets is something no one wants to do unless things get really ugly. Things won't get really ugly in 2020. If anything, trade conditions will improve.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Dominated Thanksgiving Shopping In the big picture, then, FB stock is actually well shielded from trade war volatility. At the same time, this is a 20%-plus revenue and profit growth company trading at less than 25-times forward earnings, an attractive combination which implies minimal valuation risk and huge upside potential. American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com The three big reasons to like U.S. utility company American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) so long as the U.S.-China trade war wages on are that this company: 1) has minimal trade exposure, 2) is characterized by unparalleled stability, and 3) has attractive safety stock characteristics.American Electric Power is a U.S. utility company which provides electricity and power services to U.S. consumers. They don't operate outside of the U.S. This 100% domestic focus shields the company from international trade war noise.At the same time, the electricity and power services which AEP provides are necessary, with unwavering demand. That is, regardless of how the U.S.-China trade situation plays out, U.S. consumers will forever need and pay up for electricity and power services. Demand isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Neither are AEP's revenues or profits. This financial stability creates tremendous support for AEP share price stability.Lastly, AEP stock trades at a reasonably 21-times forward earnings multiple, has a rock solid 3% dividend yield, and is supported by stable and sizable cash flows. These ideal safety stock characteristics imply that investor demand for AEP stock during turbulent times will remain strong. Walmart (WMT)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Investors may be shocked to see global retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) on this list. After all, Walmart does operate in the retail world, and tariffs do have a direct negative impact across the entire retail world in the form of higher input prices.Walmart is no exception here. The higher tariffs go, the higher Walmart's input costs will go, and the more that will either: 1) weigh on Walmart's margins, or 2) push up Walmart's shelf prices. But if you zoom out, it's easy to see that Walmart is actually a winner here.One of two things will happen in 2020. Either U.S.-China trade tensions will meaningfully de-escalate, or they won't. If they do, Walmart will continue to fire on all cylinders through sustained omni-channel and e-commerce expansion. If they don't, tariffs will pressure the entire retail sector. But, consumers won't stop shopping. They will just become more price-sensitive. The more price-sensitive they become, the more likely they are to shop at off-price stores, and Walmart is king in the off-price category.This is exactly why WMT stock was a huge out-performer during the last economic downturn. Consumers don't stop shopping when times get tough. They just shop smarter.  * 9 Tech Stocks You Wish You'd Bought During 2019 Big picture, then, it looks like WMT stock is a strong safety stock to buy, because it will outperform regardless of which way the trade war swings. McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com Last, but not least, on this list of safety stocks to buy without trade war exposure is global fast-casual food giant McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).The bull thesis on MCD stock as a safety stock is pretty simple. Regardless of how the trade war progresses, consumers globally still need to eat. Consequently, they will still visit McDonald's stores. Further, if trade tensions do escalate, that will cause broad consumer concern, which will in turn force consumers to become more price-sensitive. The more price-sensitive they become, the more they will cut back on costs. One way to cut back on costs? Stop going to expensive restaurants, and start going to McDonald's.As such, much like Walmart, McDonald's is supported by this fact that consumers don't stop buying things when times get tough -- they just start buying cheaper things.Also of note, tariffs have not created much noise in McDonald's financials, nor will they anytime soon. The word tariff wasn't mentioned even once during the company's most recent earnings call. Nor was the U.S.-China trade war. This lack of financial noise will help keep MCD stock shielded from trade-war-induced market volatility in 2020.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long T, FB, and WMT.

2019-11-27	2019-11-27 21:53:13	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	Nasty Midwest Storms, Gusty N.Y. Winds Roil Holiday Plans	(Bloomberg) -- Flooding rains, heavy snow and gusty winds across the U.S. are disrupting travel on one of the busiest days of the year and threatening to keep Thanksgiving Day parade balloons from flying in New York City.Two large storms were hitting as close to 55 million people were expected to take to the roads and air ahead of the U.S. holiday Thursday, according to AAA. Areas around Denver received 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 centimeters) of snow, causing treacherous road conditions and complicating air travel.Both coasts are facing weather issues. In New York City, winds could reach 25 miles (40 kilometers) per hour on Thursday, threatening to ground the massive balloons at Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade. In Oregon and California, a powerful Pacific Ocean storm may bring snow by the foot across the Sierra Nevada mountains and torrential rains to Southern California that could touch off mudslides, said Brian Hurley, a senior branch forecaster at the U.S. Weather Prediction Center.“Where it is not snow, it is going to be very windy,” said Dan Pydynowski, a meteorologist at AccuWeather Inc. “In a place like Chicago, they are already seeing wind gusts of 50 miles per hour. Those winds will spread eastward tonight and tomorrow.”High winds have already knocked out power to more than 210,000 homes and businesses in the Midwest and another 60,000 in Northern California, according to utility websites. American Electric Power Co. reported 38,000 customers without power and warned that outages had “the potential to climb” amid high winds.Macy’s BalloonsNew York was warm and cloudy before the winds were forecast to arrive Thursday, when ground crews will use ropes to guide huge balloons through the heart of Manhattan. “The Macy’s balloons will be a concern,” Hurley said.Macy’s Inc. said in a statement it will meet with the New York Police Department early Thursday to determine which balloons -- including those in the shape of SpongeBob SquarePants, Snoopy, Pikachu and other characters -- will fly.“Each is designed to fly at different heights and angles based on their shape and scale and the exact wind conditions along the route,” the company said in an email. “The decision on adding the balloons to the lineup is made by NYPD and Macy’s officials just prior to the start of the parade.”None of the giant balloons are allowed to fly if there are sustained winds exceeding 23 mph or gusts of more than 34 mph on the route.Meanwhile, more than 100 U.S. flights were canceled and 2,000 flights were delayed Wednesday, according to the website for FlightAware. Treacherous road conditions contributed to at least one fatal accident, when three tractor-trailers and a pickup truck collided on Interstate 70 west of Denver, according to state police.Read More: California’s Wildfire (and Blackout) Season Is Coming to a CloseIn California, snow could fall at lower elevations, making travel along Interstate 5 -- a north-south artery -- difficult.“There will certainly be impacts in both air and ground travel in a lot of California,” AccuWeather’s Pydynowski said.Traffic may be especially snarled this year, with estimates of more drivers taking to the roads solo with fuel prices basically flat compared with last year.(Updates with AEP power failures in fifth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Christopher Martin, Vincent Del Giudice and Naureen S.

Investors tend to seek them out when recession fears creep (like they are right now), and they also tend to perform well when interest rates decline.Several countries have shown signs of economic weakness, sparking worries about a global recession. The U.S.-Chinese trade war hasn't helped, blunting the growth of the planet's two largest economies. And Derek Horstmeyer, an assistant finance professor at George Mason University, points out what many experts have said about the yield curve's recent inversion. Namely, he calls it a &quot;strong signal that we are in the late stages of economic expansion and may indeed be headed for a recession within the next 18 months.&quot; That's a boon to safe-haven sectors such as utilities and consumer staples, as what they produce is always in demand, no matter what the economy is doing. Utility stocks, with their high returns on assets and high dividends, should be considered given that they &quot;tend to do well in late-cycle periods,&quot; Horstmeyer says.The utility sector also is attractive as interest rates fall, says Robert Johnson, a finance professor at Creighton University. &quot;The dividend yield on the utility sector is especially attractive in this abnormally low-interest-rate environment as the yields on utility stocks exceed the yields on long-term U.S. government debt by a substantial margin,&quot; he says.Here are 11 utility stocks and fund to buy for safety and income. This list includes a few standouts in the sector, as well as several ways to diversify your risk while collecting these stocks' above-average dividends.

2019-08-21	2019-08-21 11:37:38	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	5 Utility Stocks to Buy for an Extra Durable Portfolio	[Editor's note: This story was published in July 2018. It has since been updated and republished.]Utility stocks were supposed to be yesterday's favorite investment. The theory regarding utility stocks was simple: Robust economic growth coupled with a full labor market was supposed to spark rising inflation.The Fed was supposed to fight rising inflation with rate hikes. Fixed income yields were supposed to rise. Utility stocks, which were long viewed as bond substitutes in an era of ultra-low interest rates, were supposed to fall.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut that theory hasn't fully materialized into reality.The result? Utility stocks haven't lost their shine. With inflation relatively contained and investors ducking into safety, stocks in utilities are still attractive assets to own for dividend yield hunters. Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund(NYSE: XLU), a utilities ETF, has jumped  13.5% in 2019.The markets' recent volatility has contributed to the XLU's gain, as investors flee toward any safe haven. Not to mention, a number of other catalysts are in play.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill Inflation isn't soaring higher because technology giants are suppressing inflationary pressures (just think about the downward pressure Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is putting on all consumer goods prices). This trend won't reverse any time soon, and thus, inflationary pressures should remain subdued for the foreseeable future. With those forces subdued, utility stocks have room to rally.With that said, what are the best utility stocks to buy for your portfolio? Here's a list of five stocks that I think are worth a look: American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Shutterstock Considered one of the industry's heavyweights, American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) is a massive electric utility company that delivers electricity to more than five million customers across eleven states.Over the past three months, AEP stock is up 4.8% and it's up a whopping 24% year to date.The business right now is doing pretty well, as robust economic strength in the company's core markets has boosted the business. Overall, sales and earnings are both trending higher at a healthy rate. Sempra Energy (SRE)Source: Shutterstock   Another one of the industry's heavyweights is Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE), the multi-faceted energy company that provides energy services to more than 40 million customers globally across Southern California, Texas, Chile and Peru. In 2019, SRE stock is up nearly 31%. Sempra's business is doing well: Both revenues and earnings are trending higher amid a favorable economic backdrop.Plus, the company is continuing its energy diversification efforts by expanding its liquid natural gas (LNG) business, something which the company feels can help fuel sustainable long-term growth.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential The dividend yield on SRE stock sits right around 2.8%. That isn't great, but it's right around where the yield has been over the past several years. Duke Energy (DUK)Source: Shutterstock Next up is electric power and gas utility giant Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). Much like the other names on this list, Duke's operations are stable and healthy. That said, DUK stock is up more than 7% year-to-date with a dividend yield of 4.15%.Business remains fine, mostly thanks to favorable weather and strengthening economic conditions. And Duke's revenues and earnings have been trending consistently higher at a slow and stable rate.This level of growth should persist for the next several years as economic conditions remain solid. American Water Works Company (AWK)Source: Shutterstock Although electricity and power are very important utilities, another utility of equal importance is water, and that is where American Water Works Company (NYSE:AWK) comes into the picture.American Water provides waters services to 15 million people across 46 states and Canada. That makes American Water the largest and most diverse publicly traded water company.Moreover, American Water is planning on spending a whole bunch of money over the next several years to modernize water distribution infrastructure, an investment that will likely lead to rate hike approvals and robust long-term earnings growth.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On AWK stock has a dividend yield of 1.62%. That isn't great. But, what the company lacks in dividend yield, it makes up for in earnings growth, which should be able to run around 10%-per-year for the next several years. It's already up nearly 40% this year. That combination of healthy earnings growth and stable yield should make AWK stock a winning investment. NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: Shutterstock Perhaps the utility stock with the most long-term earnings-growth potential on this list is NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). That is because not only does NextEra operate a massive utility business like the other utility players on this list, but the company is also a leading player in renewable energy and battery storage.Over the past decade, this company has grown earnings and dividends at an 8%-per-year clip, and that robust growth should continue so long as the company's renewable business continues to scale.The one thing to be worried about when it comes to NEE stock is that the dividend yield is at 2.4%, which is a five-year low. But earnings growth is robust, and it is large enough to compensate for a historically low dividend yield.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN and AWK.

2019-08-08	2019-08-08 15:21:00	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	4 Safe Stocks to Buy Amid Trade War Turbulence	The U.S.-China trade war is on and that makes finding good, safe stocks to buy much more difficult than before.Over the past few months there was a semantics debate over what exactly the trade tensions between the U.S. and China should be labeled as. Is it a full blown trade war? Or is it just a trade dispute, or trade skirmish?Today, that question seems fully answered. U.S. President Donald Trump upped the ante in early August by promising to introduce a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods by September. China responded in force, suspending the purchase of new U.S. agricultural products and devaluing its own currency to decade lows against the U.S. Dollar.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs such, there's no question about it. With both sides upping the ante to much more serious levels than before, the U.S.-China trade war is fully here.Stocks dropped in response. Big time. In just a few trading days, the S&P 500 dropped more than 5%. As of this writing, it looks likely that the market's decline will run into 10%-plus territory within the next few trading days. Thus, in a matter of a few trading days, stocks have gone from making new all-time highs, to being in correction territory.That is the definition of volatility. And when volatility comes roaring back into markets, investors flock to safety. Common financial safe havens included Treasuries (which have been rally in mode) and gold (which just made a six year high).Another financial safe haven is the class of high quality, high moat, big dividend stocks that won't be hit hard by this trade war drama. As such, I fully expect those &quot;safe stocks&quot; to out-perform so long as trade war drama hangs around.  * 10 Internet Stocks Getting Hammered Which stocks fall into the safety stocks category? Let's take a closer look at four safe stocks to buy amid the recent trade war turbulence. Safe Stocks to Buy Amid Trade Turbulence: AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock The first safety stock on this list is a telecom giant with a big yield, stable operations, minimal trade war exposure and huge forthcoming catalysts on the horizon.AT&T (NYSE:T) is one of America's largest telecom companies. As a U.S. telecom giant, AT&T's operations won't be disrupted by a trade war. Consumers will still need internet service and mobile coverage, and will be willing to pay up for it so long as labor conditions remain favorable (which they do). Furthermore, T stock has a 6% yield which: 1) is pretty much higher than every other blue-chip yield in the market, and 2) looks really attractive next to a 10-Year Treasury yield that is below 2%.Also of note, AT&T has huge catalysts on the horizon that could breathe life back into this sluggish stock. First, AT&T is set to launch HBO Max soon, and this streaming service has enough content firepower from the Time Warner acquisition to make noise in the streaming landscape. If so, AT&T could pivot its negative cord-cutting narrative, into a positive streaming sub growth narrative. That will put upward pressure on AT&T stock.Second, 5G smartphones are coming soon, and when they finally go mainstream in 2020, that will provide a huge tailwind for the entire wireless industry, telecom providers like AT&T included.With those two big catalysts on the horizon -- and with AT&T's core fundamentals intact -- T stock looks like a solid and safe stock to pick up with trade tensions heating up. American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Shutterstock The second safety stock on this list is a utility company with a core business almost entirely unrelated to the trade war, a big yield that looks even better with interest rates so low and a history of operational and financial stability that bodes well for this stock during turbulent times.U.S. utility giant American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) stock thrives in the overlap of stability and yield. On the stability side, American Electric Power provides electricity services in the U.S., so they basically provide a secular demand service in the world's strongest and biggest economy. That positioning lends AEP stock to unprecedented stability. That's exactly what you get with American Electric Power. Over the past decade, this company has a done nothing but report consistent and healthy revenue, profit and cash flow growth.On the yield side, AEP stock has a big yield (3%), which has been impressive for a long time (it has been above 3% for over 30 years) because of consistent dividend hikes (the dividend has gone from ~40 cents at the beginning of the decade, to nearly 70 cents today).  * 7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5% Broadly, then, AEP stock thrives in the overlap of stability and yield. That overlap is exactly where investors will flee if things get uglier in the stock market. As such, AEP stock looks like one of the safer stocks to buy if trade turbulence persists. Disney (DIS)Source: Shutterstock The third safety stock on this list is a media giant that, while possessing some trade war exposure, is mostly a company with enduring strengths that will withstand and outlast the trade war. It's also just months away from its biggest upward catalyst in recent memory.Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock isn't exempt from the trade war. The company has a big parks business. That parks business is somewhat dependent on good trade relations, both because tourism drives a big chunk of revenue for domestic parks and because the company has a ton of international parks, too. There's also the big studio business, which similarly has considerable international exposure.But, it's tough to see DIS stock really getting hit hard in this trade war. Currency headwinds will hurt, but outside of that, Disney has strong enough brand equity and strong enough global consumer demand to withstand and outlast trade war drama. Chinese consumers won't quit going to Disney parks in China. Tourism might take a hit in the U.S., but domestic traffic trends should remain favorable. Also, nobody in the world is going to stop going to the movies because of this trade war.As such, Disney's secular growth drivers are strong enough to &quot;beat&quot; the trade war. Plus, DIS stock is heading into its biggest catalyst in recent memory with the launch of Disney+ in late 2019. That catalyst will make or break DIS stock -- regardless of the trade war. I think it is quite likely to make DIS stock, as Disney+ has enough content firepower, has been hyped up enough and is cheap enough to immediately gain significant traction.If so, DIS stock will only head higher over the next 12 months. Tyson Foods (TSN)Source: Shutterstock While searching for safe stocks to buy, investors might consider this next pick a prime target. It's a food giant that will largely keep doing &quot;business as usual&quot; amid trade war drama. It's a stock that has a big yield and the company looks ready for a breakout to the upside.Much like Disney, food giant Tyson (NYSE:TSN) isn't exempt from the trade war. On the contrary, this is a global business with sizable trade exposure. The company sells products in America, Canada, China and the rest of the world. That means demand could be adversely impacted tariffs. It also means that a strong dollar could really take a bite out of the financials.But, let's zoom out. What does Tyson sell? Food. Will people stop eating because of the trade war? No. Thus, whatever demand headwinds do arise here, will be very small for TSN stock.  * 10 Stocks to Buy on the Trade War Dip At the same time, Tyson just announced a portfolio of next-generation protein products that will hit shelves over the next few months, including Raised & Rooted plant-based chicken nuggets. These next-gen protein products will both improve the underlying financial trends as well as provide a lift to investor sentiment. That combination should ultimately push TSN stock higher, even amid trade war drama.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long T, AEP and DIS.

2019-08-02	2019-08-02 18:30:55	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	7 Big Dividend Stocks to Consider In a Low-Rate World	One of the biggest themes of financial markets in 2019 has been plunging rates. The 10-Year Treasury yield (alongside pretty much every other fixed income rate) has plunged in 2019, dropping from 2.7% on Christmas Eve 2018, to just over 2% in late July 2019.Source: Shutterstock The catalyst? Slowing economic expansion across the globe, which central banks want to curb. As such, central banks around the world project to cut rates in an insurance move to prolong the current economic expansion. Rates have plunged in anticipation of these cuts.Will rates stay lower for longer? Probably. The Federal Reserve will likely cut rates a few times in the back half of 2019 to prolong the current economic expansion and breathe life back into the sluggish industrial economy, which has been hurt by rising geopolitical tensions. As such, the plunging rates theme of 2019 projects to turn into a consistent low rates theme in the second half of 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are two big implications for equities in a low rate world. First, equity valuations will move higher, since lower fixed income yields justify lower earnings yields, and therefore, a higher equity multiple. Second, investors will flock to stable dividend stocks, since many of those stocks are now yielding more than fixed income instruments.Consequently, investors should do two things here. One, stay long the stock market. The environment remains favorable for stocks to go higher. Two, consider playing defense by buying some dividend stocks. So long as rates remain low, these stocks should have huge investor demand.  * The 10 Best Index Funds to Buy and Hold With that in mind, let's take a look at seven big dividend stocks investors should consider in today's rate world. Big Dividend Stocks to Consider: CVS Health (CVS)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrDividend Yield: 3.6%Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~5.5%The Thesis: The bull thesis on CVS Health (NASDAQ:CVS) is pretty straightforward. This company breaks down into two parts: consumer pharmacy and PBM. On the consumer pharmacy side, fundamentals have been depressed by competition. But, the company is rapidly expanding the value prop of its already extensive retail footprint, integrating technology and data to create things like HealthHUBs and minute clinics, the sum of which should drive continued share expansion and healthier revenue growth trends.On the PBM side, fundamentals have similarly been depressed by the growing threat of government regulation. But, the White House recently scrapped plans for a drug rebate plan that would've been disastrous for PBMs like CVS. As such, headwinds on the PBM side should ease going forward.Broadly, the fundamentals on both the consumer pharmacy and PBM sides of CVS are set to improve, and as they do, depressed CVS stock (3.6% yield with a mid single-digit projected earnings growth rate) should take off. AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5.9%Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~5%The Thesis: As is the case with the bull thesis for CVS, the bull thesis on AT&T (NYSE:T) hinges on the idea this company's darkest days are behind it, and that things will get better going forward.The big headwind which has killed AT&T stock over the past several years has been cord cutting. AT&T makes a bunch of money from cable subscription and related fees. But, consumers have rapidly pivoted from linear to streaming TV, and in the process, have cancelled their cable subscriptions. AT&T's growth trends have consequently suffered, as growth in wireless hasn't been sufficient to offset wired losses.But, both the wired and wireless businesses should improve from here. On the wired side, AT&T has enough content with the acquisition of Time Warner (think HBO, Cinemax, CNN, so on and so forth) to launch a compelling streaming TV service, which should attract enough subs to help offset the cord cutting headwind. Meanwhile, on the wireless side, 5G is coming, and it increasingly appears that the 5G tailwind will provide a big boost to the entire wireless industry, AT&T included.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long Net net, AT&T's depressed fundamentals should improve over the next few years. As they do, AT&T stock will bounce back. American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3%Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~6%The Thesis: The bull thesis on utility giant American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) is very simple, and it centers around two things: yield and stability.On the yield side, this is a stock with a 3% yield that 1) has consistently sported a yield above 3% for the past 30-plus years, and 2) has consistently hiked its dividend from ~40 cents at the beginning of the decade, to nearly 70 cents today. Meanwhile, on the stability side, American Electric Power is a company that 1) operates in the secular demand electricity services industry, and 2) has a track record of consistent and healthy revenue, profit and cash flow growth over the past decade.Broadly, then, American Electric Power is all about yield and stability. Investors buy shares, get their yield, and don't have to worry much about the stock. Over the past decade, AEP stock has risen nearly 200%. During that massive 200% rally, the stock never once fell into bear market territory (a 20% draw-down from recent highs).As such, if you're looking for yield and long-term stability, AEP stock is the cream of the crop. McDonald's (MCD)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.1%Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~8%The Thesis: When it comes to McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), the bull thesis is secular in nature. Long story short, this is the world's largest and favorite fast food chain, built on two value props that will never go away -- unprecedented convenience and low prices.McDonald's has consistently innovated and iterated over the past several years to continue to dominate those two value props. They have reinvented their menu to offer more relevant, healthier options, at still low prices. They have heavily invested in technology and data to implement digital ordering kiosks, refreshed drive-thru infrastructure and much more, all of which has simply shortened wait times and enhanced customer convenience.As such, McDonald's has continued to dominate on price and convenience over the past several years. In so doing, the company has driven consistently positive comparable sales growth, which has in turn driven MCD stock higher.  * 7 Charts That Should Concern Marijuana Stock Investors All signs indicate this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. McDonald's is doubling down on fresh beef options throughout its menu, and management is leaning more heavily into data to enhance business efficiency. For the foreseeable future, then, McDonald's should continue to dominate on price and convenience. Continued dominance on those two fronts will support positive comps over the next several years, which will support MCD stock continuing to make new highs. Target (TGT)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 2.9%Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~6%The Thesis: There are two pieces to the bull thesis on Target (NYSE:TGT) stock: a near-term bull thesis, and a long-term bull thesis.In the near term, Target's revenue trends are firing on all cylinders right now because the company has successfully built out an e-commerce business while expanding its omni-channel capabilities. These two things together have driven Target's strongest streak of comparable sales growth in over a decade. But, building out e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities isn't cheap. It requires huge investments. Those huge investments have weighed on margins over the past few quarters.They are now starting to phase out (since Target's omni-channel capabilities have already been mostly developed), and as these investments completely phase out over the new few quarters, Target's robust top-line growth will be joined by equally robust margin expansion and profit growth. This reinvigorated profit growth will drive TGT stock higher.In the long term, Target has shown an impressive ability to innovate and adapt to the dynamic retail landscape. This should give investors confidence that -- no matter how consumption habits change over the next several years -- Target should be able to leverage its huge reach and resources to adapt to those consumption changes. Consequently, in the long run, Target should grow alongside the U.S. consumer economy, meaning that revenues, profits and the stock should all trend higher over time. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Coca-ColaDividend Yield: 2.9%Projected Long Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~7%The Thesis: When it comes to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), you buy KO stock for three reasons.One, this company is the king in the secular growth global beverage industry, which has stable and enduring demand drivers. No matter what, consumers around the world have to drink. And when they choose to buy a drink, chances are high they are going to buy a Coca-Cola product, considering that Coca-Cola owns about 40% of the global non-alcoholic beverage market.Two, Coca-Cola has found a winning formula to stay atop the non-alcoholic beverage market. Coca-Cola uses data to identify up-and-coming beverage trends. They invest in the small beverage brands that have the most exposure to those trends. They then test those brands by putting them selectively into their global distribution channel. If one of those brands does really well, Coca-Cola acquires the whole brand, and launches that brand everywhere. In so doing, Coca-Cola has discovered a strategy wherein no matter how beverage market trends change, Coca-Cola will always be the company that sits atop the industry.  * 7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy as the Boom Ends Three, KO stock is a symbol of stability with a big yield. KO stock isn't volatile. At all. And, in the absence of volatility, the stock pays investors a nice near 3% yield. This combination of stability and yield makes KO stock a solid investment for any investor. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3.3%Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate (from YCharts): ~18.5%The Thesis: Global chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is about to enter a golden era over the next several years. Thanks to a renewed multi-year licensing agreement with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm is once again the single most dominant player in the mobile phone chip market.That's a favorable position to hold in 2019. In the back half of 2019 and into 2020/21, 5G coverage is set to go mainstream. That's a big deal. 5G isn't just a step up from current coverage standards -- it's an entire new level of coverage that will enable an entire new set of possibilities in today's smart device dominated world. As such, it will present a tremendous earnings growth opportunity for Qualcomm, which is why analysts project this company to grow earnings at nearly a 20% compounded annual pace over the next few years.If Qualcomm can capitalize on the huge 5G opportunity in front -- they should be able to, given their dominant position in the market -- then QCOM stock will head higher over the next several years. A stock with a 3.3% yield and a ~20% projected EPS growth rate is simply too attractive for most investors to pass up on.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long CVS, T, MCD, TGT and QCOM.

2019-06-12	2019-06-12 18:26:24	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	7 U.S. Stocks to Buy With Limited Trade War Exposure	Global financial markets are in rally mode after the U.S. and Mexico struck an immigration agreement to avert tariffs between the two countries. But, the global trade war is far from over. The U.S. and China have struck no such deal, and as of this writing, the big and ugly trade war between those two countries projects to get even bigger and uglier.So long as this trade war hangs around, it will provide a drag on financial markets.But, it won't provide a drag on every stock. Not every company has exposure to China, trade and tariffs. Some companies are null to mitigated exposure to those things, and as such, won't be weighed down as much by a trade war. They will continue to report solid and healthy numbers, and their stocks will rally in response.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs such, these are the stocks you want to buy for the foreseeable future, or so long as the trade war persists.  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10 Which stocks fall into this basket of stocks to buy for their limited trade war exposure? Let's take a closer look. Facebook (FB)Source: Shutterstock The great thing about Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in the current environment is that you have a $70 billion services revenue business, growing at a 20%-plus rate, that is blocked in China. At the same time, FB stock trades at just 23-times forward earnings.That's a healthy combination that should power over-performance in FB stock so long as the trade war sticks around. To be sure, Facebook isn't entirely exempt from the trade war. The higher tariffs go, the higher prices go for U.S. corporations. Most of those corporations can't afford to pass price hikes onto consumers, so they will absorb the tariff hit. In order to offset that hit, they may look to cut down on spend, including cutting back the ad budget.But, even if that happens, the Facebook ad budget likely won't get cut. Smaller, more experimental ad channels, like Snap (NYSE:SNAP) or Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), could get hit. Facebook won't, though, because it's the tried-and-true digital ad channel.All in all, then, Facebook is well isolated from trade war risks, and the business is still growing at a 20%-plus rate while the stock trades at a relatively cheap multiple considering that 20%-plus growth. Ultimately, that makes FB stock a good buy here. Five Below (FIVE)Source: Shutterstock Retail is broadly a bad place to be during the trade war, since a majority of U.S. retailers source their product from countries with lower labor costs, with the biggest of those countries being China. As such, retailers are at the epicenter of tariffs on China imports.But, discount retailer Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) is different from other retailers. First, this is a U.S.-focused retailer, so all of its sales happen in the United States. Second, this is a very strong and popular retailer, with comparable sales consistently running positive for several years. Third, this is a hyper-growth retailer, as the company is growing its store base by about 20% per year.Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, Five Below has successfully leveraged price hikes and renegotiated supply contracts to offset the impact of tariffs. As a result, sales growth has remained healthy, margins have remained resilient and both of those dynamics project to persist for the foreseeable future.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets In the big picture, then, FIVE stock is a good buy here because this is a super strong retailer that is successfully side-stepping tariffs. American Electric Power (AEP)Source:  Riccardo Annandale Via UnsplashThe trade war promises to bring economic and financial market volatility. When economic and financial market volatility are on the rise, investors do two things: they hunt for stability, and they hunt for yield.U.S. utility giant American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) provides both of those things. American Electric Power is arguably one of the most stable public companies in America, as the company provides electricity services to millions of Americans, none of whom are going to stop paying for said electricity services anytime soon because they all need electricity to survive in the modern world. Meanwhile, AEP stock simultaneously offers investors a healthy 3% yield, which looks exceptionally attractive next to a depressed 10-Year Treasury yield and in the face of slowing corporate earnings growth.All in all, AEP stock looks good here as a defensive play for risk-adverse investors looking to mitigate volatility and trade war exposure. Netflix (NFLX)Source: Shutterstock Much like Facebook, the great thing about Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the current environment is you have a hyper-growth services business that is blocked in China.Netflix is at the epicenter of the secular growth, over-the-top video mega-trend, which is sweeping across the globe. As a result, Netflix is growing revenues at a robust 20%-plus rate, with rapidly expanding margins, too. Importantly, this growth narrative has zero exposure to China, since Netflix is outright blocked in China.  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10 Overall, then, Netflix stock gives investors exposure to a secular, 20%-plus revenue growth story without any exposure to the volatile and trade-impacted Chinese market. Demand for that exposure will go up so long as the trade war sticks around. As such, so long as the trade war persists, so will the uptrend in NFLX stock. Alphabet (GOOG)Source: Shutterstock Global internet search giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) falls in the same boat as Facebook and Netflix -- it's a hyper-growth services company with zero exposure to China.Much like Facebook and Netflix, Alphabet is a 20%-plus growth internet company supported by secular growth tailwinds in global urbanization and digitization. At the same time, the company makes most of its revenues from its services businesses (digital ads and cloud), and very little revenue from the hardware businesses like Google Home. Also, Google search and YouTube -- the two cores of Alphabet -- don't exist in China.In other words, as is the case with Facebook and Netflix, Alphabet offers investors exposure to a secular, 20%-plus global internet growth narrative with limited trade, tariff and China exposure.That is the exact type of exposure investors will flock to so long as the trade war persists, meaning that GOOG stock should fare well even in the face of rising trade tensions. Shopify (SHOP)Source: Shopify via FlickrSticking in the secular growth services theme, next up we have e-commerce solutions provider Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).Shopify provides e-commerce solutions to retailers of all shapes and sizes, so that they can create online stores and have the tools to succeed in an omni-channel commerce world. This growth narrative has caught fire over the past several years as the sharing economy has gained mainstream traction, and as e-retail has become increasingly decentralized and democratized. This narrative projects to remain on fire, too, as Shopify still only accounts for a fraction of the global retail sales pie.The trade war won't impact this narrative at all. Even if tariffs go up a whole bunch, and retailers are looking at higher input costs, they won't pull their Shopify spend. Why? Because Shopify is the platform that makes everything work for these retailers. Without Shopify, they don't have the tools to succeed in the digital world. Without those tools, retailers will suffer, meaning subscription revenue projects to keep rising for a lot longer. At the same time, consumers won't stop shopping in the digital channel, so transaction revenue will continue to march higher, too.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy Under $10 As such, regardless of which way the trade war plays out, Shopify's growth narrative should remain broadly robust for the foreseeable future. This sort of unstoppable growth narrative is the exact type of narrative investors want exposure to at this point in time. Okta (OKTA)Cloud identity platform Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) falls into the same boat as Shopify. This is a secular growth, small-cap services company with tremendous momentum at the moment, and this momentum will not be derailed by trade disputes.In a nutshell, Okta sells a cloud security solution that enables individuals to securely sign into any enterprise software system. This unique method of tackling digital and cloud security has gained traction and popularity over the past several years. As it has, Okta's growth trajectory has accelerated higher. Last quarter, the company reported 50% revenue growth.The trade war won't disrupt this growth narrative. First, Okta is a services business with minimal exposure to China. Second, digital security is increasingly becoming the most important and central feature of any enterprise, so a U.S. economic slowdown likely won't impact security spend on platforms like Okta by that much.In total, Okta is a hyper-growth internet services company with mitigated trade exposure, and it's a company that provides high-value services with resilient demand. That's a winning combination in today's market.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long FB, PINS, FIVE, AEP, NFLX, GOOG, SHOP and OKTA.

2019-06-12	2019-06-12 15:50:26	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	3 Utility Stocks With Years of Dividend Growth	There's a lot on investor's plates these days. Issues with trade, lower economic data and the inverted yield curve are just a few of the problems everyone is facing today. As a result, many investors, especially older investors near or in retirement, have started think about portfolio security. Thankfully, utility stocks satisfy this growing need for safety … you just need to know the right ones to pick.For one thing, utility stocks generally feature stable earnings. Consumers need to heat their homes and keep the power on no matter what the economy is doing. Because of this, many utility stocks pay some hefty dividends. And those dividends can help lower volatility, reduce losses and provide a guaranteed return for investors.But not all utility stocks are cut from the same cloth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere have been some dividend blow-ups in the sector, as a few have become over-leveraged and focused on the wrong operating areas. That means investors must choose to buy utility stocks with long dividend histories -- through thick and thin -- to get the perceived safety of the sector.  * 10 Smart Dividend Stocks for the Rest of the Year With that in mind, here are three utility stocks with years of dividend growth behind them. UGI Corp (UGI)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 2.28%When it comes to utility stocks, the sector owes a few thanks to UGI Corporation (NYSE:UGI). The firm was the first to adopt the now commonplace utility holding company model. That is, holding a series of regulated assets -- like power generation and transmission lines -- to provide cash flows for investment in non-regulated ones. And as the &quot;O.G.&quot; in that regard, UGI has become the master at it.For starters, UGI owns plenty of boring electric and gas operations in the Northeast. These utility holdings churn out plenty of steady cash flows for the utility. The trick is that UGI has smartly used these holdings to build-out an impressive system of tangential assets that provide much bigger profit potential. This includes natural gas pipelines and a global distribution network for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). More recently, the firm simplified that structure by buying out all the units of its propane MLP AmeriGas (NYSE:APU).This wide-ranging asset base has been stellar for UGI's bottom line. Last year was one of the firm's best fiscal years ever and last quarter continued that growth. Because of the continued success of its holding company model, UGI has been able to pay a dividend for the last 135 years. Moreover, it has been able to raise its dividend for the last 32 years straight. The last increase was a whooping 15.4% jump.All in all, for investors looking at utility stocks, UGI needs to be at the top of your list. American Electric Power (AEP)Source:  Riccardo Annandale Via UnsplashDividend Yield: 3.01%For utility stocks, size matters. A huge operating base means plenty of customers paying for service and that results in a stable base of cash for dividends to be paid out from. That is exactly what mega-utility American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) does in spades.AEP is one of the largest electric companies in the entire country. The firm's 26,000 megawatts worth of generation capacity serves more than 11 states and 5.4 million customers. That's a lot of utility bills to pay. And it's that fact that keeps the lights on at AEP. Last year, American Electric managed to pull in more than $16 billion in revenues from its widespread operations.These revenues have continued to translate into solid earnings-per-share growth and dividend payments. AEP has paid a dividend since its founding in 1910 and since 2003, the utility stock has managed to increase its payout by 91%.The best part is, the dividends could keep growing.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession The problem for AEP has long been its reliance on coal. It's an old utility. But thanks to recent regulatory moves by the Trump Administration, AEP has more time to decommission and add new capacity to its umbrella. This will help prevent the firm from spending big to fix the problem instantly. That means there will be plenty of cash leftover for dividends. American Water Works Company (AWK)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.73%Often, investors will flock to electric or gas distributors when focusing on utility stocks. However, for long-term dividends, the water sector can't be beaten. Many of the top water utility stocks have been paying dividends since the 1800's. This includes American Water Works Company (NYSE:AWK).But AWK isn't like most water utilities. It's the water utility. The firm is the largest water utility providing clean water and wastewater services to more than 15 million people across 46 states and Canada. None of its rivals can match that size and scope. Because of this, AWK has been an earnings and dividend machine, especially over the last few years. Since 2014, EPS have grown at a compounded annual rate of 8.3%, while dividends have increased by over 10% annually.The best part is that American Water has a plan to boost that further.Given how essential it is for life, water utilities are some of the most regulated. However, AWK is undergoing a big spending spree to modernized and upgrade its grid. That spending is exactly what regulators like to see before granting an increase in rates. And given a lot of that spending is on tech upgrades to reduce waste, margins should be quite nice for AWK.That'll help turn its 1.75% yield into something greater.At the time of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-06	2019-06-06 18:39:35	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	7 Stocks to Buy That Don’t Care About Tariffs	May was a red month for global equities as escalating trade tensions and the worry of slowing economic growth pushed investors to sell risky assets and pile into the bond market. As a result, stocks fell sharply in May, while bonds rallied.But while the May market selloff was broad, it didn't take down every single stock in the market. Instead, there were a handful of stocks which actually rallied in May and recorded new all-time highs while the market was plunging.What was so special about this group of stocks? For one reason or another, these stocks just didn't and still don't care about tariffs. Some of these stocks are defensive in nature, so they rallied as investors tried to play defense. Others don't have much exposure to the trade war. And some of these stocks are supported by businesses with more than enough growth momentum to offset any trade-related weakness.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBroadly, these stocks ignored rising trade conflicts and marched higher.They will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As such, as global trade conflicts stick around over the next few months, the smart move is to pile into the stocks which can head higher even against that dour backdrop.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets Which stocks are those? Let's take a deeper look at 7 stocks to buy that don't care about tariffs. Okta (OKTA)Investment Style: Secular Growth% Gain Since May 1: 17%At All-Time High? YesBull Thesis: You want to buy hyper-growth cloud company Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) here because this is a secular growth stock with a robust growth narrative that simultaneously isn't slowing, lacks exposure to trade headwinds, and could actually benefit from a domestic economic slowdown.In a nutshell, Okta provides identity-based cloud security solutions for enterprises. This growth narrative is on fire right now (Okta reported 50%-plus revenue growth last quarter), and won't slow anytime soon. There are no trade headwinds here since Okta is a service business, and services have been exempt from trade talk thus far. Further, security spend is one thing that probably won't get hit in an economic slowdown, so this company's business model is fairly resilient to economic slowing.Overall, then, Okta is a red hot growth stock to buy now as it should remain red hot for the foreseeable future. American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Robert via FlickrInvestment Style: Defensive% Gain Since May 1: 5%At All-Time High? YesBull Thesis: With respect to utility giant American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP), AEP stock looks good here because this company is as stable as it gets, is relatively resilient to an economic slowdown, and lacks exposure to anything trade-related, while the stock's yield is big and increasingly attractive as fixed-income yields plunge.When it comes to operational stability, American Electric Power is second to none. The company provides electric services to U.S. consumers. Demand for those services will not wane anytime soon. Further, trade is a non-issue here, and the stock has a nice big 3% dividend yield, which is presently as far above the 10-Year Treasury yield as it has been since late 2017.  * 7 Ways to Make Berkshire Hathaway Stock More Attractive Overall, AEP stock is a stable stock with a big yield, and as such, is a high quality defensive stock to buy in today's volatile market. Dollar General (DG)Source: Shutterstock Investment Style: Defensive & Stable% Gain Since May 1: 5%At All Time High? YesBull Thesis: You want to buy off-price retail giant Dollar General (NYSE:DG) here because the company is firing on all cylinders today and should continue to fire on all cylinders for the foreseeable future -- even if the U.S. economy slows meaningfully.Retail had a rough start to 2019. The consumer weakened in the first quarter of 2019, and retailers felt that weakening. Across the sector, retailers put up ugly first quarter 2019 numbers. Not Dollar General. The dollar store giant's first quarter numbers were really good. Why the discrepancy? Because although the consumer may have weakened in early 2019, the off-price retail strategy still worked, mostly because the consumer's affinity for lower prices doesn't go lower when times get tough.If anything, it goes up. As such, with economic turbulence on the horizon, Dollar General has visibility to gain share and traffic over the next few quarters. That makes DG stock a solid buy here. Coupa (COUP)Investment Style: Secular Growth% Gain Since May 1: 14%At All-Time High? YesBull Thesis: Hyper-growth cloud company Coupa (NASDAQ:COUP) looks good here because this company is firing on all cylinders right now with a solution that could become increasingly attractive in an economic slowdown and in a market supported by secular growth tailwinds which won't let up anytime soon.Coupa offers a cloud-based enterprise solution which is broadly aimed at helping companies become more efficient with their spend. Enterprises really like the Coupa solution. That's why this company has reported 30%-plus revenue growth for the past several quarters. Demand won't falter because of a slowing economy. If anything, a slowing economy will push demand higher since companies will increasingly want to optimize spend when dollars become more scarce.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% As such, this is a hyper-growth cloud company that should remain on a healthy growth trajectory for the foreseeable future. That makes COUP stock a good buy here. Coca-Cola (KO)Source:  Chris Nielsen via FlickrInvestment Style: Defensive% Gain Since May 1: 5%At All-Time High? YesBull Thesis: When it comes to beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), you buy KO stock here for largely unparalleled defense to a global economic slowdown on top of a big yield which is becoming increasingly attractive as yields elsewhere plunge.Consumers need to drink. Regardless of the economic backdrop -- super fast growth, super slow growth, or something in the middle -- consumers across the globe need to drink. Coca-Cola is the heartbeat of the global beverage industry. As such, regardless of how the global economy develops over the next several quarters, Coca-Cola's numbers should remain largely stable and resilient to any slowdown. At the same time, KO stock has a juicy 3% dividend yield which is as far above the 10-Year Treasury Yield as it's been since mid-2017.Thus, in the big picture, Coca-Cola is a big and stable company with a big and stable yield. That combination makes KO stock a strong defensive stock to buy in volatile times. Shopify (SHOP)Source: Shopify via FlickrInvestment Style: Secular Growth% Gain Since May 1: 19%At All-Time High? YesBull Thesis: E-commerce solutions provider Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is on fire right now, and you want to buy SHOP stock here because this fire won't die anytime soon, regardless of how the economic currents change.Shopify is enabling an entire new generation of individual and small-to-medium sized retailers to compete in the direct retail channel with the likes of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). This growth narrative has caught fire over the past few quarters as the e-retail market has become increasingly decentralized. This fire won't die anytime soon. The secular growth narrative of Shopify pioneering a new era of decentralized direct retail is simply too powerful to be weighed down by tariffs. That's why this company reported 50% gross merchandise sales growth last quarter in the face of tariffs.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far So long as this secular growth narrative maintains robust momentum, SHOP stock will continue to march higher. Roku (ROKU)Source: Shutterstock Investment Style: Secular Growth% Gain Since May 1: 60%At All Time High? YesBull Thesis: You want to buy OTT video platform Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) here because the company's secular growth narrative is powerful enough to offset slowing economic growth headwinds, and such headwinds could actually provide a lift to the company's user growth.The big idea at Roku is that this company is becoming the cable box of the OTT video world. That world is rapidly growing, and it won't stop growing because of an economic slowdown. If anything, growth will be supercharged by a slowdown. Consumers will finally be moved to cut expensive cable packages in bulk, and pivot towards much cheaper streaming options.

2019-06-03	2019-06-03 18:57:03	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	6 Big Dividend Stocks to Buy as Yields Plunge	A lot happened in financial markets in May. One of the more important things that happened was in the bond market. Fixed income yields plunged in May on concerns that the global economy is slowing and will continue to slow as trade tensions between the U.S. and China remain elevated. Specifically, the 10-Year Treasury Yield has dropped below 2.3% in late May, after peaking right around 3.3% in late 2018, and is now at its lowest level since late 2017.One implication of plunging yields is that stocks with big dividend yields become more attractive. Why? Because the lower yields go, the higher dividend yields are relative to those fixed income yields. Thus, when yields plunge, investors tend to flock into dividend stocks with big yields.  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault Because of this dynamic, plunging yields create a good opportunity to buy into dividend stocks with big yields. Which stocks should be on your list of stocks to buy? Let's take a look at six big dividend stocks to consider as yields plunge.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock Yield: 6.4%First, we have telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T), a company with an unparalleled yield and enormous financial stability.There are three big reasons to like AT&T here. The first reason is that the stock has a big 6.4% dividend yield, which is nearly triple the yield on a 10-Year Treasury Note and above the yield of most every other notable stock. The second reason is that the company provides telecommunications services with enduring and stable demand, and long-term revenues and profits have significant visibility. And, the third and final reason is that the forthcoming 5G boom in 2019/20 should provide a nice lift to the company's numbers, which should push estimates higher and drive multiple expansion.Thus, with a big yield, healthy stability and strong catalysts, AT&T stock looks like it can and should move higher over the next few months. This is especially true against the backdrop of plunging yields, since that dynamic makes AT&T's 6.4% yield seem that much more attractive. American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Robert via FlickrYield: 3.1%In terms of big yield coupled with stability, the cream of the crop in the stock market is utility giant American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP).American Electric Power is an electric utility company that delivers electricity and power services to more than 5 million customers across 11 states. Demand for these services is inelastic relative to economic changes -- regardless of the macroeconomic backdrop, consumers will need and pay up for electricity and power services, especially in today's digitally connected world. Consequently, there is largely unparalleld financial stability inherent to the AEP story.But, AEP is much more than just stability. The company has a solid track record of growing revenues and profits through price hikes and market expansion. There's also a 3.1% dividend yield on the stock, too, which is more than 80 basis points above the 10-Year Treasury yield.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Impacted by the Mexican Tariffs All in all, then, if you're looking for a big yield with a lot of stability, AEP is the way to go. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)Yield: 3.2%If you're hunting for yield but don't want to compromise on long-term profit growth, a solid option is beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).Coca-Cola has been on the mountain top of the global beverage market for what seems like forever. That's because this company has found a winning strategy that keeps Coca-Cola the most relevant player in the market. This strategy includes identifying hot and upcoming beverage trends, acquiring the hottest players in that market, and giving those players global distribution. This strategy broadly ensures that Coca-Cola grows with the global beverage industry by capitalizing on every relevant trend.This industry will continue to grow at a healthy low to mid single-digit rate over the next several years. Coca-Cola will grow revenues and profits in line with that rate. Meanwhile, there's a 3.2% yield here, so investors will get slow and steady profit growth on top of a healthy yield.Overall, KO stock looks good here for investors hunting for yield and growth at the same time. Target (TGT)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Yield: 3.2%The retail sector has been getting hammered recently, but one big retail company that has weathered the storm and has a big yield, too, is Target (NYSE:TGT).To be clear, Target is not mall retail. Mall retailers are getting killed in early 2019 as the entire sector has reported broadly disappointing numbers. But, Target is not a part of that group. Target is an off-mall, off-price, all-in-one retailer with a rapidly growing e-commerce business and rapidly expanding omni-channel presence. Because of this, Target is not being hurt by the e-retail wave. Instead, Target has aligned itself with this trend, and is now firing off decade-best growth numbers.This will persist because Target is just getting the ball rolling on the omni-channel front. Target is still building out delivery and pick-up options everywhere, and as those capabilities expand, Target's growth will remain red hot. Margins will stabilize as wage hike initiatives move into the rear-view mirror. Thus, revenue and profit growth project to be healthy for the foreseeable future.  * 10 Heavily Shorted Stocks to Sell -- Because the Bears Are Right Meanwhile, TGT stock has a 3.2% yield which will help supercharge returns for investors. As such, much like Coca-Cola, Target offers investors a nice mix of yield and growth. International Business Machines (IBM)Source: Shutterstock Yield: 4.9%The technology revolution has seemingly moved past International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), but this company is getting its act together, and the stock has a huge yield and should do well here as yields plunge.IBM doesn't exactly have that growth sparkle that many of its faster growing tech peers do. Even the company's cloud business has stalled out over the past several quarters. But, the company has acquired Red Hat, and in so doing, will add some sparkle into this growth narrative and juice up the growth rates. This extra juice in the growth narrative, coupled with a near 5% yield against the the backdrop of a 2.3% 10-Year Treasury yield, creates a favorable dynamic for IBM stock to head higher from here.To be clear, IBM stock isn't the type of stock you want to buy and hold forever. But, with yields on the comedown and the company's growth rates on the come-up, this stock should do well for the foreseeable future. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Shutterstock Yield: 3.8%Last, but not least, on this dividend stocks to buy list is chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).QCOM stock has been on a roller coaster ride over the past several weeks. First, there was the huge Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) settlement, which caused the stock to soar on the fact that Apple revenue was coming back into the system for the foreseeable future. But, that rally was ultimately short-circuited by a negative FTC ruling, which basically said that Qualcomm's patent licensing practices need to change because they violate antitrust law. QCOM stock dropped big on that news.But, in the big picture, the Qualcomm narrative is improving. The 5G boom is right around the corner, and Apple waving the white flag with Qualcomm basically says that Qualcomm is the only relevant 5G chip supplier. Further, the Apple deal does bring in a bunch of Apple revenue over the next several years. The FTC ruling is a negative, but that story still isn't finished, and the near term, tangible financial impact is relatively muted.  * 5 Stocks Under $10 With Big Upside Potential Consequently, QCOM stock should rebound here, mostly because the fundamentals are improving, but also because the stock's 3.8% yield looks really attractive next to a 2.3% 10-Year Treasury yield.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long T, AEP, TGT and QCOM.

2019-05-15	2019-05-15 18:24:56	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	4 Dividend-Focused Utilities Pushing Higher	U.S. equities are rebounding on Wednesday thanks to another positive headline out of the President Donald Trump Administration. Specifically, it sounds like a decision on possible tariffs on auto imports from Europe will be delayed. Ostensibly, this is to clear the way to concentrate on the standoff with China and give the markets enough good news to keep prices stable.So far, it appears to be working. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is rebounding back above its 200-day moving average, the third day of testing this critical support level, and looks set for a challenge of overhead resistance near the 26,000 level. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite looks even better, attempting to climb back above the 50-day moving average thanks to big gains in the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market But its the income-oriented stocks that are catching my eye as investors pile into defensive names on the expectation that we've yet to see the last of this latest bout of volatility. Here are four names to watch:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Utility Stocks to Buy: American Electric Power (AEP)Shares of American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) are pushing up and out of a three-month consolidation range as it continues a steady long-term uptrend that goes back to the 2009 bear market low. Two days ago, as the Dow plunged below its 200-day moving average for the first time in months, AEP stock was pushing to a new record high.Shares carry a 3.1% dividend yield. The company is scheduled to next report results on July 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1 per share on revenues of $4.1 billion. When the company last reported on April 25, earnings of $1.19 per share beat estimates by eight cents on a 2.5% rise in revenues. Aqua America (WTR)Shares of water utility Aqua America (NYSE:WTR) have also been flirting with new highs in recent days, jumping up and over resistance that's been in play since late 2017. The company, based in Pennsylvania, pays a 2.2% dividend yield. Analysts at Coker Palmer recently defended the name after soft quarterly results, noting it was more about timing discrepancies than softness in the underlying business.  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk The company is scheduled to next report results on Aug. 1 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 39 cents per share on revenues of $226.9 million. When the company last reported on May 2, earnings of 28 cents per share missed estimates by two cents on a 3.5% rise in revenues. Consolidated Edison (ED)Like the other names presented here, Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) shares are using the current market volatility to push to new record highs, jumping over resistance from prior highs set in late 2017 as it exits a three-month consolidation range. The stock pays a 3.5% dividend yield. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently upgraded shares to &quot;buy,&quot; and set a $94-a-share price target.The company will next report results on Aug. 1 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 61 cents per share on revenues of $2.8 billion. When the company last reported on May 2, earnings of $1.39 beat estimates by three cents on $3.4 billion in revenues. Southern Company (SO)Shares of power utility Southern Company (NYSE:SO) are also pushing to new highs this week, breaking up and out of a three-month consolidation range. This caps a near-30% rise off of its late December low, breaking free of a sideways channel that went back to 2016. Evercore ISI analysts recently upgraded the stock, which carries a dividend yield of 4.6%.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Trade War Reignites The company will next report results on Aug. 7 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 71 cents per share on revenues of $5.1 billion. When the company last reported on May 1, earnings of 70 cents per share missed estimates by two cents on a 15.1% decline in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

ChargePoint sounds alarm on electric vehicle charging standards	A leading operator of charging stations has sounded the alarm on a proposed technical standard that it says could hamper mass adoption of electric vehicles by making it harder to charge them at home or at work.  ChargePoint, which plans to run 2.5 million charging stations by 2025, says the standard would perpetuate an old 'gas station' model that automakers are backing as they launch mass production of battery-powered cars.  As well as being less convenient for users, that could give too much pricing power to utilities, limiting the flexibility of charge station owners, ChargePoint says.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chargepoint-sounds-alarm-electric-vehicle-151024336.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-09	2019-05-09 13:08:13	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	6 Stable Stocks Worth Buying for Protection	The stock market has had a record run in 2019, with the S&P 500 rising 17% year-to-date, and it's still just early May.Of particular importance, the big 2019 rally in stocks has been characterized by unusual placidity. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 has dropped 2% or more off its highs only three times, with the biggest downdraft being a 2.5% correction at the very beginning of the year. Historically speaking, the stock market usually experiences 5%-plus pullbacks roughly three to four times a year. Thus, relative to the past, the 2019 rally in stocks has been unusually calm.Investors shouldn't be lulled to sleep by this placidity. You can count on volatility rearing its ugly head in stocks as much as you can count on the sun rising every morning. Thus, volatility is coming to the stock market. It isn't a matter of if. It's a matter of when.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA good rule of thumb in investing is as follows: when the good times are rolling, prepare for the bad times. Why? Because volatility rearing its ugly head usually happens out of the blue. The bust usually follows a boom.  * 7 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Stay Far Away From With this in mind, let's take a look at seven stable stocks worth considering for protection from the next stock market pullback, which history says is due soon. McDonald's (MCD)Source: Shutterstock Beta: 0.35Yield: 2.2%At the top of this is fast-casual restaurant giant McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) for three reasons: low beta, high yield, and a long history of dominance in a stable growth restaurant category.First, this stock has a very low beta at just 0.35. By itself, that's a low beta. But it is especially low considering McDonald's also gives you consistent and steady revenue and profit growth on top of that low beta. In other words, you have stable growth with mitigated historical volatility.Second, there's the 2.2% dividend yield, which is above the market average. That 2.2% yield, too, looks really good on top of consistent and steady revenue and profit growth.Third, McDonald's has, still does, and will continue to dominate the global stable growth restaurant category. Broadly speaking, McDonald's is the king of high convenience and low prices, and at the end of the day, those are the only two things that truly matter in fast food. McDonald's is continuing to invest and innovate to maintain those price and convenience advantages. So long as they do, this company will be the dominant player in the global restaurant industry, and MCD stock will be a steady riser. American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Shutterstock Beta: 0.17Yield: 3%When it comes to avoiding volatility, few stocks do it better than utility stock American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP).When it comes to high-yield utility stocks with stable fundamentals, American Electric Power is in a league of its own. The company provides electricity services to more that 5 million Americans across 11 states. Demand therein is exceptionally stable, because consumers will forever need electricity services. Ultimately, the business supports steady and consistent revenue and profit growth in a long term window.Further, the beta on AEP stock is ridiculously low at 0.17, meaning that the stock has exceptionally limited systemic risk (if the market drops, it doesn't necessarily mean AEP stock is going down with it). The yield is robust at 3%, meaning investors get paid to inherit limited risk on steady profit growth.  * 4 IPOs That Have Fallen Flat All in all, AEP stock is one of the best stable stocks to buy if you're looking for safety and protection. Disney (DIS)Source: Baron Valium via FlickrBeta: 0.68Yield: 1.3%Media giant Disney (NYSE:DIS) is one part growth stock and one part stable stock, and that makes it an attractive stock to own for investors seeking to mitigate risk without compromising too much on the potential return side of things.On the growth side, Disney is pivoting aggressively from linear television to internet television, and in so doing, is creating a streaming service that puts at least one part of the company on a potential supercharged Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) growth trajectory. If this streaming service takes off, this stock could fly high as cord-cutting concerns are laid to rest, and investors turn their attention towards streaming subscriber additions.At the same time, Disney is a stable stock because it's a media giant with a portfolio of high-quality content with enduring appeal. Regardless the channel of consumption, consumers always find a way to watch Disney content. That has been the case for several decades. It will remain the case for the next several decades, too. Consequently, stable and enduring demand is the backbone of DIS stock.Ultimately, this combination of stability and growth potential makes DIS stock a top-notch stock to consider for protection against a market downturn. Stable Stocks Worth Considering: AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock Beta: 0.81Yield: 6.6%Over the past several years, shares of telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) have been dragged lower by a huge and growing debt load, slowing growth in its core business, and concerns regarding the longevity of its services.All these concerns have plunged AT&T stock into dirt cheap valuation territory. The dividend yield is up at 6.6%, which is essentially a five year high. Meanwhile, the forward earnings multiple is around 8.5, and that's near a five year low. In other words, you have a single-digit P/E multiple stock trading at a five year low valuation, with a dividend yield that is nearing 7% and at five year high levels.At those valuation levels, AT&T simply needs stabilization in order for the stock to work here. Stabilization is exactly what will happen over the next several years. Sure, cord cutting will persist. But the company will more aggressively pivot into building out DirecTV Now, and simultaneously up internet connectivity costs to offset cord cutting weakness. Meanwhile, the 5G boom will provide a nice tailwind for the wireless business, which should help offset continued wire-line weakness.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks That Are Bleeding Cash Broadly, operations should be stable going forward, and stable operations on a single digit P/E stock with a near 7% yield is an attractive combination. Intel (INTC)Source: Shutterstock Beta: 0.41Yield: 2.4%Semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) often gets thrown into the growth stock category given its exposure to secular growth markets. But Intel is just as much &quot;stable stock&quot; as it is &quot;growth stock&quot;, and that makes INTC a winning pick for defensive investors still looking for healthy return potential.In the big picture, Intel is the 200-pound gorilla in the semiconductor market. They pretty much dominate everywhere it matters, and project to keep dominating as the market extends into data-centers, AI, machine learning, so on and so forth. Thus, demand for Intel's chips projects to remain stable for the foreseeable future.At the same time, secular growth drivers in data and AI markets could turn stable demand into stable and growing demand. That dynamic, on top of a stock with a 0.41 beta and 2.4% yield, should produce healthy risk-adjusted returns for investors. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)Beta: 0.29Yield: 3.2%Last, but not least, on this list global beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Much like McDonald's, Coca-Cola is a strong defensive buy for three reasons: low beta, high yield, and stable fundamentals.KO stock has a low beta of 0.29, and that low beta comes on top of a company that is able to produce healthy and consistent profit growth year after year. Further, the dividend yield stands north of 3%, which is equally impressive considering the underlying profit growth trajectory.This stable profit growth at Coca-Cola is supported stable growth fundamentals underlying the business. Long story short, consumers need to drink, and Coca-Cola gives them what they want to drink. For a long time, that was sugary carbonated beverages, so Coca-Cola made a wide variety of Coke-based products. Now, its athletic drinks, teas, and sparkling waters, so Coca-Cola has acquired a wide variety of drinks in those categories, and given them global distribution.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips Net result? Revenues and profits have remained on a healthy uptrend, despite an adverse change in consumer preference. This trend should broadly continue, so as long as consumers have a need to drink, Coca-Cola should remain a steady grower.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long MCD, AEP, DIS, NFLX, T, and INTC.

2019-04-18	2019-04-18 16:31:23	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	7 Healthy Dividend Stocks to Buy for Extra Stability	[Editor's note: This story was previously published in February 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]The stock market is on fire right now. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up 16%, and it isn't even May yet.While I've been bullish on this 2019 stock market turnaround for some time now, I also realize that there are still risks out there which could subdue the current rally in stocks. U.S. and China trade talks are progressing, but there's no resolution yet. The global economy remains healthy, but it is slowing. Consumer confidence remains high, but it is dipping. Earnings remain strong, but costs are rising, margins are dropping and earnings growth is slowing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOverall, the current economic backdrop for stocks is bullish, but it has risks. Right now, valuations seem to reflect reality. Thus, the outlook for continued gradual gains is healthy.But with stocks set to slow, now is a good time to start buying into dividend stocks. These stocks tend to outperform when the broader stock market slows since they are seen as protection from volatility. Further, dividend stocks could get a nice boost in 2019 if the Fed remains cautious, doesn't hike, and rates largely remain low.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees Overall, now seems like a good time to add some stability to the portfolio through dividend stocks. With that in mind, here's a list of seven healthy dividend stocks to buy in 2019. AT&T (T)Telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) has been burdened by a huge and growing debt load, and slowing operations in its core wire-line businesses.AT&T stock remains at an attractive entry point for dividend investors. The dividend yield is 6.37%. That's near a five-year high. The forward earnings multiple is 8.8. That's near a five-year low.In other words, around $32, AT&T stock is cheap. It won't remain cheap for long. More aggressive pushes into the streaming market will ultimately offset cord-cutting weakness, and the mainstream deployment of 5G coverage in 2019 will help boost profits in the wireless business. Overall, the fundamentals will stabilize in 2019, and once they do, AT&T stock will rally in a big way. Intel (INTC)With a mere 2.35% dividend yield, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) may seem like a surprise entry on this list. But, you don't buy Intel stock for the yield. You buy Intel stock for growth at a reasonable price and you get a 2.35% yield on top of that.At its core, Intel stock is the cheapest and most stable way for investors to gain exposure to all of tomorrow's most relevant growth markets. You name it, Intel has exposure to it through its portfolio of chips. Data-centers? Intel is the biggest supplier. Internet-of-Things? Intel has a huge presence there. AI? Intel is at the front of that innovation frontier. Autonomous driving? Intel has scored multiple self-driving partnerships.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees Overall, Intel stock has a ton of long-term growth potential through its multi-faceted exposure to multiple secular growth markets. Yet, the valuation today remains exceptionally reasonable, at just 11.4 earnings. Thus, Intel stock is big growth at a reasonable price, and there's a 2.35% yield to boost investor returns. Target (TGT)Much like Intel, Target (NYSE:TGT) is a typical growth at a reasonable price stock. But, it's also a strong dividend stock, with a dividend yield that currently sits just under 3.2%. Thus, with Target stock, investors get the best of both the growth and stability worlds.The fundamentals are currently favorable for Target stock. The U.S. consumer remains largely healthy. There has been some weakness in the consumer with rising rates and stock market volatility, but such weakness hasn't been enough to derail the consumer. Moreover, Target has been on fire in terms of building out omnichannel commerce initiatives and expanding its product portfolio. The combination of these efforts has made Target one of the hottest stories in the entire retail world.Target stock trades at just 13.4 forward earnings with a near 3.2% yield. Thus, the stock is cheap against a favorable operating backdrop. That combination will ultimately lead to Target stock becoming a winner in 2019. American Electric Power (AEP)On more of the pure dividend play side is utility giant American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP).When it comes to the fundamentals, you won't find many stocks supported by more stable fundamentals than AEP. American Electric Power is a massive electric utility company that delivers electricity to more than 5 million customers across eleven states. Demand for electric service is much like demand for water -- it's not away any time soon, regardless of which way the economy swings. As such, the demand drivers here are stable, as are the company's revenues and profits.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees Meanwhile, AEP stock sports a 3.2% dividend yield. With rates on hold, that yield is more attractive today than it was a few months ago, when the Federal Reserve was consistently hiking rates. Thus, so long as the Fed remains on hold in 2019, AEP stock should outperform as dividend stocks come back in favor. Disney (DIS)Although Disney (NYSE:DIS) isn't a utility company like American Electric Power, it does benefit from similar stability in demand, revenues and profits.Disney doesn't offer electric services. But, it offers other things that the consumer arguably can't live without -- the world's greatest movies and theme parks, robust access to live sporting events, and a handful of quality TV shows and channels. Demand for these services and goods is stable in the big picture. To be sure, cord cutting is hurting the company's traditional media business. But, even that major headwind hasn't really depressed revenues and profits that much, and DIS stock has simply traded sideways as a result (as opposed to falling by a bunch).In 2019, that headwind will disappear with the launch of a Disney streaming service. As that headwind disappears, this stock will rally from a current valuation low that comprises a 20 forward multiple and 1.6% dividend yield. Thus, calendar 2019 could be a big breakout year for DIS stock.  Exxon Mobil (XOM)A highly underrated dividend stock that could have a big 2019 is Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM).The recovery in oil prices in early 2019 has led to a sharp recovery in shares of XOM. Many analysts expect this to continue. Global demand appears to be firming up thanks to stabilizing economic conditions. Meanwhile, the world's major oil suppliers seem increasingly committed to synchronizing production cuts. Firming demand coupled with falling production should lead to a rally in oil prices, which in turn should lead to a rally in XOM stock.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees This is especially true considering the valuation underneath XOM stock today. The yield is at 4.1%. That's a multi-year high. The forward multiple is 15. That's near a multi-year low. As such, you have a cheap stock with improving fundamentals. That's a winning combination that should power XOM stock higher in 2019. McDonald's (MCD)Very few companies have performed as consistently well as McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) over the past several years.During that stretch, McDonald's has reinvented itself as a consumer-friendly company more aligned with today's healthy eating trends. They've subbed out frozen patties for fresh patties. They've added premium and healthier items to the menu. There has been a huge emphasis on quality chicken offerings. There has also been a big push into the breakfast game. And, they've done all this while sustaining industry-low prices and industry-high convenience.All these initiatives have powered consistently robust results at McDonald's. Net result? MCD stock has rallied in a big way. It will continue to do so. The fundamental drivers remain healthy. The stock remains reasonably valued (22 forward earnings and a 2.45% yield). As such, MCD stock will remain on a winning trajectory for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long T, INTC, TGT and DIS.

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is positive 
  * ETFs holding this stock have seen outflows over the last one-month 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output in this company's sector is contracting



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for AEP with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting AEP.

## Money flow

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Positive

2019-01-31	2019-01-31 18:14:25	AEP	American Electric Power Company, Inc.	7 of the Best Stocks to Buy for a Dovish Federal Reserve	"What a difference a month can make! For years, the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled its intentions to raise benchmark interest rates to cull prior monetary excess. Up until last December, the Fed maintained its hawkish stance. However, an about face suddenly brings up a new question: With this change, what are now the best stocks to invest in?

No one can overstate how important this announcement is for Wall Street. Upon the dovish shift, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.8% against the prior session. Before the Fed's change of heart, the markets traded relatively sideways. But with this fundamental overhang out of the way, the list of best stocks to buy just got bigger.

While the sudden swing may have taken investors off-guard, in fairness, the Fed didn't have much choice. Yes, the domestic economy is doing well, especially compared to international markets. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell didn't anticipate the continued economic hostilities between the U.S. and China.

As a result, the central bank had to respond in a way that wouldn't upset the markets' delicate balance. However, China isn't the only concern. Other pressing issues include surging dollar strength, recently softening consumer sentiment, and a tough housing market. With the Fed now acknowledging these headwinds, it's breathing new life into the best stocks to buy.

But don't think that the Fed has gone rogue. Powell expressed the importance of &quot;patience.&quot; In other words, if inflation isn't rising dramatically, there's no need to overreact. This prudent approach should help navigate our economy and calm unnecessary jitters in the markets.

  * 7 Stocks With Too Much Riding On China 



Plus, the Fed symbolically waved the green flag. So here are seven of the best stocks to buy off this dovish policy:

### American Electric Power (AEP)

Typically, utility firms don't immediately come to mind as among the best stocks to buy for a dovish Fed. If Powell is genuinely concerned about dollar strength, he's not going to mind the currency weakening against its international competitors. However, such a move raises energy and commodity costs, thus impacting names like American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP).

But here's the thing: as a utility company, AEP stock enjoys consistent, recurrent demand. In fact, as we dive further into the information age, we're going to see increased demand for utilities, not less. So a rise in costs due to an inflationary dollar won't hurt AEP's profitability. Instead, they'll just pass on the costs to the consumer without consequence.

That might sound cynical, but I'm speaking with positive intentions. For one thing, American Electric Power is a well-run organization with an eye towards future industry developments. Moreover, AEP stock features a nice 3.4% dividend yield.

Even if the markets stumble against the Fed's best efforts, AEP will still bring something to shareholders.

### Exxon Mobil (XOM)

While President Donald Trump loved boasting about the markets when they were moving higher, individual stories forwarded questionable results. For instance, several construction-related companies like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) took off when Trump won, presumably because of the border-wall project. But for others like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), they have a more nuanced perspective.

Immediately following the election, XOM stock enjoyed a massive burst of bullishness. However, that sentiment quickly faded once 2017 rolled around. Despite some big, singular moments, Exxon Mobil has largely disappointed shareholders. Later in the fourth quarter of 2018, macroeconomic concerns dropped XOM from most people's short list of best stocks.

Trump must take responsibility for some of the bearishness. Throughout his presidential campaign, he sharply rebuked former Fed Chair Janet Yellen's accommodative monetary policies. But with the world's most powerful central bank reversing course, XOM stock has a chance to rebound.

### Qualcomm (QCOM)

In recent years, technology firm Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has given shareholders fits. In one moment, the company appears like one of the best stocks ever. But after a brief spell, QCOM stock comes crashing down to earth, only to repeat the cycle later.

Most recently, the tech icon slipped on the worsening U.S.-China trade war. But another overriding headwind has worried shareholders: a rising dollar. As the greenback gains in strength, it limits Qualcomm's competitiveness overseas. More than once, we've heard the impact about unfavorable currency exchange rates during an earnings report.

For QCOM stock, this matter takes on a greater urgency. Last year, 67% of total revenue came from China, including Hong Kong. The Chinese already play tough, and some would argue dirty. A currency headwind is therefore the last thing you want as a Qualcomm stakeholder

But if I'm reading the Fed correctly, the central bank understands these challenges. If so, QCOM stock may have received a lifeline.

### DR Horton (DHI)

Prior to the Fed coming to their senses (as some might argue), homebuilder DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) was among the worst stocks to buy for purely understandable reasons. The fallout from the sub-prime-mortgage crisis has made home ownership increasingly difficult. But with a hawkish monetary policy, DHI stock appeared dead in the water.

Indeed, shares slipped badly in the beginning of 2018, then meandered aimlessly until another big drop. Based on the technical charts, it's difficult to argue against a correlation between DHI stock and Fed policy. But when Powell released his statements, DR Horton suddenly found a second wind.

Undoubtedly, real estate has a long way to go. A substantial headwind comes from the millennial demographic, which haven't warmed to home ownership like prior generations. Surely, the Fed's dovish stance won't change this factor overnight. However, it does give DHI stock a chance.

### LGI Homes (LGIH)

Similar to DR Horton, LGI Homes (NASDAQ:LGIH) fell off most people's list of best stocks to invest in for 2018. From the get-go, LGIH stock experienced significant volatility. Eventually, the narrative completely collapsed in September, sending shares down into the doldrums.

That said, LGI Homes has started to win back the investors it lost during last year's pummeling. Against the January opener, LGIH stock has gained over 29%. And of course, with the Fed backing off from its hawkish threats, shares don't have the overhang to worry about.

Additionally, LGIH has one potential ace up its sleeve: Chinese buyers. As China's wealthy class increases in number, the astute among them are seeking stable investments to protect their money. Western real estate, particularly in the U.S. market, appeals for obvious reasons.

A critical advantage that LGI levers is location, location, location. Primarily featuring in the coastal areas, as well as burgeoning inland markets, the company offers an exceptionally-attractive portfolio.

### AngloGold Ashanti (AU)

It's a predictable but generally reliable strategy: when the economy hurts, gold is king. Even with the Fed addressing fundamental headwinds, precious metals can have a viable place in your portfolio. That's because a dovish monetary policy is usually inflationary for the dollar, thereby driving gold prices.

But if you don't want the hassle of physical bullion, miners can be some of the best stocks to invest in. Among them, AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE:AU) stands out sharply. AU stock has gotten off to a strong start in 2019, gaining over 10%. That was before the Fed changed its outlook. With a dovish policy, AU could jump even higher.

  * 7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019 



Better yet, a bullish market in gold should help boost AngloGold's financials. After commodities and energy got blitzed in the middle part of this decade, AU stock is on the recovery track. With the Fed aligning with AngloGold's interests, we're in for an interesting 2019 and beyond!

### Sibanye Gold (SBGL)

If the Fed maintains its dovish monetary policy -- or even magnifies it -- you'll want to consider Sibanye Gold (NYSE:SBGL). Despite its name, SBGL stock is more than just a gold miner. With its acquisition of Stillwater Mining, Sibanye has exposure to the critical platinum market.

Often times, the best stocks to buy achieve that lofty status due to their potential for strong demand. However, with SBGL, the supply-demand picture is already extremely favorable. To illustrate, all the platinum that has ever been mined could fit inside an average living room.

What's more, platinum has significant industrial, technological and biochemical uses. Naturally, if platinum is used for these purposes, it's difficult if not impossible to recover. That only boosts mining companies like SBGL that specialize in this precious metal.

Still, like any player in this sector, you want to approach cautiously. Sibanye Gold has sharply rising debt levels, which may not be suitable for conservative investors. But if you want to speculate on the Fed, SBGL stock has the right stuff.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long gold and platinum.
