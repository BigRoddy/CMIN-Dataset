BP Exploring Algeria Assets’ Sale to Eni – Report	Reuters reported that according to unidentified sources BP (BP) is in talks with Eni as it looks to offload its oil and gas assets in Algeria. The two companies are in talks for an outright sale. A potential deal could also result in BP receiving stakes in Eni’s assets around the world. A divestment deal will allow BP to dispose of its Algerian assets, having struggled to do so since 2019. The company currently holds a 45.89% stake in the Amenas natural gas plant and a 33% stake in the Salah gas plant. A sale of the Algerian assets comes when Europe’s top energy companies are divesting oil and gas portfolios amid increased focus on clean energy. The companies are also looking to refocus their businesses to address falling margins and rising debt. (See BP stock analysis on TipRanks) Additionally, BP and Eni are in talks as they seek to form a joint venture that will oversee their operations in Angola. They are also believed to be exploring the possibility of creating a joint venture in Algeria similar to the Angolan model. Separately, Lightsource bp, a 50-50 joint venture with BP, has entered into a strategic partnership with INSUN to develop five utility-scale solar projects in Portugal. The €900 million solar investment projects should add 1.35GW of low carbon, renewable power once complete. Two weeks ago, Mizuho analyst Daniel Boyd reiterated a Hold rating on the stock. The analyst has also raised his stock price target to $33 from $30, implying 25.81% upside potential to current levels. The raise comes on a growing belief that oil prices will power through the $70 a barrel level on increased demand which is expected to hit pre-pandemic levels in Q4. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Hold based on 4 Buy, 3 Hold, and 2 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $30.12 implies 14.83% upside potential to current levels. BP scores an 8 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting it is likely to outperform the overall market.

BP Nears Sale of U.K. North Sea Asset to Tailwind	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc is in advanced talks to sell its 28% interest in the Shearwater field in the U.K. North Sea to Tailwind Energy Ltd., an explorer backed by trading house Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., people familiar with the matter said.The companies may reach an agreement in the coming days, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. BP had last year agreed to sell the Shearwater and Andrew projects to Premier Oil Plc in a deal valued at $625 million, but this was pulled following a reverse takeover of Premier by Chrysaor Holdings Ltd.BP also has the Andrew field, and another project called Vorlich, on the block. Tailwind’s interest is limited to Shearwater, which is operated by Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the people said. No final agreements have been reached for Shearwater and the talks could falter, they said.A representative for BP declined to comment, while Tailwind didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.After the deal with Premier Oil collapsed, a handful of smaller energy companies had shown interest in the assets, Bloomberg News reported in March. Part of an important hub in the North Sea, Shearwater produces about 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, having peaked in 2004 when it pumped more than 160,000 a day.Tailwind was formed in 2016 to acquire oil and gas assets that large companies were offloading from their books. It bought Shell and Exxon Mobil Corp.’s stakes in the central North Sea Triton cluster in 2018 and purchased EOG Resources Inc.’s offshore assets in Britain the same year.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-nears-sale-u-k-171039453.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-07	2021-05-07 08:27:27	BP	BP p.l.c.	Big Oil Braces for Climate Votes as Investor Pressure Mounts	(Bloomberg) -- As Europe’s oil majors prepare to host their annual shareholder meetings, one topic is garnering almost all the attention.Climate change looms large for Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Total SE, with investors at all three energy giants calling for greater action. Shareholder resolutions on cutting carbon emissions are set to dominate this month’s AGMs, even as the companies talk up their own, competing proposals.Key activist group Follow This, which has been a thorn in their side in recent years, is putting forward a motion at BP on May 12 and Shell six days later, urging the companies to set emission goals aligned with the Paris Agreement.Shell’s board has snubbed the idea, insisting its own plan to pump less oil, produce more gas and renewables, and slash emissions over the next 30 years is “more comprehensive.” BP is also asking investors to reject the resolution.Since the votes are non-binding, they’ll have only a limited impact on strategy, yet they ratchet up pressure on companies still reliant on fossil fuels to fund the shift to cleaner energy. Shell agreed in February to put its transition plans to a vote, while Total pledged the same in March.“This has all come along faster than everyone expected,” and the imminent votes give “very little time to review the commitments,” said Shu Ling Liauw, lead global analyst at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility. “It’s a bit of game theory and opportunism to cement themselves as having endorsed climate plans,” but “that doesn’t mean there’s substance.”Support among investors remains mixed. In the Netherlands, resolutions tabled by Follow This -- which was founded by Dutch campaigner Mark van Baal -- have been backed by several large players such as NN Investments and Aegon NV. Yet advocates among the biggest U.S. investors are harder to come by. BlackRock Inc., for example, has always voted against the group’s proposals.Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, which has a 1.4 billion-pound ($2 billion) stake in BP, said Friday that it, too, would side with the U.K. company.At Shell, smaller shareholders such as London-based Sarasin & Partners LLP and U.K. local authority pension funds have said they’ll favor Follow This over the company’s transition plan. But the main proxy advisory firms -- Glass, Lewis & Co. and Institutional Shareholder Services -- are standing by the oil majors and urging clients to reject the resolutions at both Shell and BP AGMs.Net ZeroIn recent years, large oil companies have outlined plans to cut carbon output, with Europe’s top three all declaring “net-zero” targets for 2050. Yet according to Climate Action 100+, an investor group with $54 trillion under management, none of the majors have fully disclosed how they’ll erase their net emissions.“Companies need to show us what they can do,” said Adam Matthews, chief responsible investment officer at the Church of England Pensions Board, which engages with Shell on climate matters on behalf of CA100+. “There are legitimate questions about the path” to net-zero at the Anglo-Dutch firm, though “the goal is clear and unambiguous, and Shell is accountable for delivering that target,” Matthews wrote in an article last month.The promise of change is also no longer enough for London-based Epworth Investment Management Ltd., which manages investments for the Methodist Church and has recently exited all oil and gas. Chief Executive Officer David Palmer has called Shell’s emission targets “uninspiring,” concluding that “we cannot say that Shell is aligned with the objectives of the Paris Accord.”While Epworth may be a minnow next to BlackRock, which holds a stake of more than 3 billion pounds in Shell, it touches on the use of divestment as a tool to pressure companies. It also calls into question divestments made by the majors themselves -- asset sales that shift some emissions off their books by simply transferring them to another operator.“We’ve actually got to follow these emissions and make sure that we’re sorting out a transformation, not just a ‘prettification’ of our portfolios,” said Anne Simpson, director of board governance and strategy at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and chair of CA100+.CalPERS has voted in favor of Follow This resolutions in the past and has called for additional board changes at U.S. major Exxon Mobil Corp. Speaking in a webinar, Simpson said: “We’ve got to move this dialogue from the advisory, shareholder-proposal world and into board accountability.”(Updates with Norway wealth fund’s voting intentions in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-braces-climate-votes-082727880.html?.tsrc=rss

BP woos investors with share buybacks as profits soar	BP is returning cash to its legions of shareholders through a $500m (£360m) share buyback scheme after profits were boosted by the global economic recovery. The oil behemoth made a profit of $2.6bn for the first three months of 2021, triple what it earned a year earlier. Much of this improvement was driven by BP's gas trading division, which benefited from market swings in North America and higher crude prices. Oil fell sharply last year when demand was crushed by Covid lockdowns around the world, with Brent crude dropping as low as $21 a barrel. It has since recovered to pre-pandemic levels of about $66. Bernard Looney, chief executive, said the results showed that BP can still throw off money to benefit its thousands of retail investors, even while seeking to slash carbon emissions from its drilling operations to net zero by 2050. He said: “The main question on investors’ minds was whether it was possible for us to deliver competitive cash returns while cutting debt and transitioning the company for a low-carbon future and that is understandable. “People were questioning this and today’s results are important because it shows we can do both, that we've nailed that.” The energy giant has reduced its debt pile by more than $18bn over the past year to $33bn - meaning its debt reduction plan is one year ahead of schedule - through cost cuts and the sale of oil fields. BP used to burn up to $26bn a year in capital spending as it sought to find and develop new sources of fossil fuels, but that has been halved.	https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-woos-investors-share-buybacks-091243844.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-04-27	2021-04-27 07:49:38	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP Lures Investors With Share Buybacks After Trading Windfall	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc set out to win back shareholders after a difficult year, saying it will begin share buybacks after “exceptional” natural gas trading buoyed earnings.The gesture, which was flagged earlier this month, is aimed at investors who have shown little love for the company since it cut its dividend by half last year. After lagging its European peers for much of 2020, BP re-jigged its priorities to put boosting shareholder returns ahead of other goals.“It’s a story of delivering on our promise of competitive cash returns for our shareholders, while at the same time transitioning the company for the future,” Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney said in a Bloomberg television interview on Tuesday. “It’s been a strong quarter for the company financially.”BP shares rose as much as 3.6% and were trading 1.2% higher to 300.20 pence at 8:48 a.m. in London.The London-based company’s buybacks will begin at a modest pace, with $500 million of repurchases in the second quarter to offset dilution from the vesting of employee share awards. BP said it will return at least 60% of surplus cash flow to shareholders this year, of which it generated $1.7 billion in the first quarter. It will outline these plans when it publishes its next earnings.“The message is clear: buybacks are up and running almost a year early,” Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. analyst Oswald Clint wrote in a research note. Bernstein estimates a further $1.5 billion to $2 billion of buybacks could be possible later this year.BP’s first-quarter adjusted net income rebounded to $2.63 billion, up from $791 million a year earlier, before the full impact of the pandemic hit. That surpassed the average analyst estimate of $1.51 billion. It was the highest profit since the second quarter of 2019.The strong earnings were driven in part “by an exceptional gas marketing and trading performance,” according to the statement. BP has a large natural gas business in North America, where the market went through massive gyrations in February due to the big freeze in Texas.“We were well positioned for colder-than-normal weather in the U.S. and in Asia,” Looney said, referring to the Texas freeze in February, and adding the company also profited when a cold snap hit Asia in January, sending liquefied natural gas prices to a record high. The company’s buyback plans don’t depend on trading results, he said.The gas and low-carbon energy segment, where BP reflects its trading results for the fuel, reported underlying profit before interest and tax of $2.27 billion in the first quarter, up from $154 million in the fourth quarter and $847 million a year earlier.BP has identified the expertise of its traders, who buy and sell large volumes of fossil fuels every day, as a key way to boost returns as it transitions to selling more renewable electricity. The company is investing in electric car charging networks in Europe and seeking permission to become a retail electricity provider to homes and businesses in several U.S. states.Net debt was $33.31 billion at the end of the first quarter, falling below its target threshold of $35 billion as much as a year earlier than expected. Higher crude prices and the proceeds from asset sales, including a stake in an Omani gas field and the sale of an interest in tech firm Palantir Technologies Inc, helped BP achieve its debt goal.“We generated around $11 billion of cash inflow in the first quarter, enabling us to reach our $35 billion net debt target significantly ahead of plan,” Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss said in the statement.(Updates share moves, add Bernstein quote in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-aims-win-back-investors-062617063.html?.tsrc=rss

BP to resume share buybacks as profit soars on strong oil, gas trading	BP's profit more than tripled to $2.6 billion in the first quarter thanks to stronger oil prices and bumper revenue from natural gas trading, paving the way for the energy company to start buying back its shares.  The jump in profits from a year earlier comes as BP says it expects oil demand to recover in 2021 due to strong growth in the United States and China as COVID-19 vaccination programmes accelerate.  Helping it deliver on its earlier promise to buy back shares, net debt fell below the company's $35 billion target sooner than expected, dropping $5.6 billion from the end of December to $33.3 billion at the end of March, chiefly due to around $4.8 billion worth of disposals and higher oil prices.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-profit-soars-strong-oil-063416804.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Wants to Sell Power to Homes in Five States in Renewable Push	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc wants to be your power supplier, too.The oil and natural gas giant is seeking permission to become a retail electricity provider to homes and businesses initially in Illinois, Ohio, Texas, California and Pennsylvania, according to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission filing issued last week. BP Energy Retail’s affiliates own or control more than 2,000 megawatts of wind generation.“It gives BP a huge new branding opportunity,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s energy program. “They are already a massive power trader. Locking up tens of thousands of retail customers helps boost their trading by locking in a bunch of customers with fixed supply contracts.”The move isn’t wholly unexpected as the global push to electrify everything from cars to home heating and invest in renewable energy to combat climate change is breaking down traditional energy silos. BP, the largest physical gas marketer in North America, has branded retail gasoline stations across the country and is already a significant wholesale power trader. Two years ago, rival super major Royal Dutch Shell Plc. said it aims to become the world’s single largest power generator.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-wants-sell-power-homes-162026311.html?.tsrc=rss

Big Oil Sees Cash Rolling In, But Investors Won’t Get It Yet	(Bloomberg) -- After one of the most difficult years in the oil industry’s history, crude prices have recovered and major producers are finally generating spare cash. Investors really want to get their hands on it, but most are likely to be disappointed.That’s because the pandemic has created a legacy of debt for the world’s biggest international oil companies, many of which borrowed to fund their dividends as prices crashed.For Exxon Mobil Corp. and Total SE, which bore the financial strain of maintaining shareholder payouts last year, any extra cash will go to easing debt. Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc have said they want to resume buybacks, but not yet. Only BP Plc is dangling the possibility that shareholder returns could improve soon, after a year and a half of flip-flopping over its payout policy.The coming week’s first-quarter results should show a significant improvement in both profit and cash flow after a dire 2020, but probably nothing that will change investors’ disenchantment with the oil majors.“They have limited appeal as long-term investments because they can’t demonstrate that they can deliver cash flow on a sustainable basis and return it on a sustainable basis,” said Christyan Malek, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s head of EMEA oil and gas. “The key is consistency. We haven’t had any.”The first quarter will be an inflection point for the industry, according to JPMorgan. Company data and estimates compiled by Bloomberg show free cash flow -- what’s left after operational spending and investment -- is set to rebound to $80 billion for the five supermajors this year, compared with about $4 billion in 2020.Shell will be the top of heap with about $22 billion, Exxon will total $19 billion and even lowest-ranked BP will have about $11 billion. That will be enough for each of the five majors to cover their planned 2021 dividends and together have more than $35 billion left over.It’s unclear how much of that could make it into the pockets of shareholders.“Priorities for deployment of Europe’s oil majors’ strong first-quarter free cash flow will vary,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Will Hares. “BP has achieved its debt target and is set to announce resumption of buybacks. Shell has announced a small dividend bump, though is unlikely to resume buybacks given its $65 billion net debt target.”BP’s BuybacksAfter raising its dividend by 2.4% in February 2020, then cutting the payout by half just six months later, BP has come under pressure to prove it can deliver reliable returns to shareholders.The London-based firm’s shares are the worst performing in its peer group over the last 12 months. Even its Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney has acknowledged that investors are questioning whether BP can pull off its reinvention for the low-carbon age.Earlier this month, BP managed to set itself apart from its peers in a positive way, giving the clearest signal of impending buybacks. The company said it had achieved its target of reducing net debt to $35 billion about a year sooner than expected and will give an update on the timetable for stock repurchases on Tuesday, when it opens Big Oil earnings season.That’s a significant increase in the urgency of improving shareholder returns. Back in August, BP put its goal of returning 60% of surplus cash to investors fifth on the priority list after funding the dividend, reducing net debt, shifting expenditure into low-carbon projects and spending on core oil and gas assets.Debt ReductionBP’s European peers, whose shares have performed better in the past year, aren’t moving so fast.France’s Total, which was the only oil major in the region to maintain its dividend last year, has said that any extra cash that comes from higher oil prices will be used to cut debt. Its next priority will be to increase investment in renewables to about 25% of its overall budget. Buybacks will only come after that.Shell announced a 4% increase in its dividend in October, after cutting the payout by two thirds earlier in the year. It has a target of reducing net debt by $10 billion before it returns any extra money to shareholders. Banks including Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc predict that won’t happen until 2022, since net debt rose in the last quarter of 2020 to $75 billion.Unlike BP and Shell, the North American majors managed to make it through 2020 with their payouts intact, but at a high cost. Exxon’s debt pile surged 40% during the pandemic to $73 billion, prompting Moody’s Investors Service to downgrade the company’s bonds twice in the past 12 months.The Texas-based giant expects to return to profit in the first three months of 2021 after four straight quarterly losses. The company has said it will maintain its $15 billion annual dividend while paying down debt if oil and gas prices remain at current levels. JPMorgan sees Exxon’s free cash flow rebounding to $19.6 billion this year, giving it a sizable surplus with which to reduce borrowings.Of the five supermajors, Chevron has the best balance sheet and “strong prospects” for a share buyback, according to HSBC analyst Gordon Gray. The California-based company said in March that it should generate $25 billion of free cash over and above its dividend through 2025 if Brent crude remains at $60.The oil majors’ focus on pleasing investors and healing their financial wounds comes largely at the expense of investment in their core business.As the pandemic unfolded last year, the companies slashed their spending to the lowest combined level in 15 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. The stranglehold will continue this year, with capital expenditure set to rise only slightly despite oil’s recovery.Chevron and Exxon have both locked in spending plans at radically reduced levels all the way through 2025. Total has marginally raised its capital investment budget for this year, while BP and Shell have put a firm ceiling on expenditure.So while the combination of higher oil prices, rock-bottom spending and asset sales is delivering the surge in cash flow that will help solve the supermajors’ short-term problems, it may be creating a long-term headache. Shell acknowledged earlier this month that it’s not investing enough in new projects to offset the natural decline in production from its existing oil and gas fields.The majors are “slaking the shareholders’ thirst for cash returns,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. In the long term “capex cuts, debt and disposals could do as much if not more harm than good, and none are really sustainable.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-sees-cash-rolling-040000201.html?.tsrc=rss

The burning of gas in this way is prevalent in the Permian because most producers there drill for more profitable oil and often incinerate the gas that comes as a byproduct, it added.“We will be producing oil and gas for decades, but it will be a certain kind of oil and gas,” Dave Lawler, the chairman of BP America Inc., is quoted in the WSJ. “It’s a highly profitable barrel and it’s a responsibly produced barrel.”READ: BP Cleans Image With Oil Asset Sales While Emissions Stay BehindThe investment reflects the ever-growing pressure on the industry to reduce its carbon footprint and contributions to climate change.

2021-04-16	2021-04-16 17:06:02	BP	BP p.l.c.	Eastern Canadian Oil Heads to U.S. West Coast in Unusual Demand Shift	(Bloomberg) -- Canadian oil sellers are sending exports to the U.S. West Coast, an unexpected move prompted by the staggered global demand recovery from the pandemic.For the second time this month, a tanker will load crude from eastern Canada’s oil-rich Newfoundland province and head to the U.S. West Coast, shipping fixtures compiled by Bloomberg show. The BP Plc-booked Aquasurazo is set to receive supplies this weekend destined for the Cherry Point refinery in Washington. Last week, a Chevron Corp.-chartered vessel loaded at the same province and is en route to deliver crude to plants in California.The rare voyages reflect the changing needs -- albeit temporary -- of the largest buyers of Newfoundland’s crude. While a swift vaccine rollout is boosting consumption in the U.S., demand remains muted in Europe with various lockdown restrictions in place. Canada is also facing similar confining measures. The shifts in consumption are resulting in growing piles of unsold supply in the Atlantic Basin. “The Atlantic Basin imbalance and continued lockdowns in Canada are creating a temporary crude market dislocation,” said Zachary Rogers, director for Global Oil Service at Rapidan Energy Group. “Even faraway refiners would buy it at the right differential.”The Newfoundland cargoes, each about 600,000 barrels, are set to arrive on the West Coast in May. California, the nation’s most populous state, is on a path to reopening and is expected to drop most virus restrictions this summer. In the past, oil exports from the province to the U.S. have targeted the East Coast and Gulf Coast, according to Statistics Canada.Meanwhile, inventories are ballooning in the Atlantic Basin where West African and North Sea sellers are facing unusually weak demand from their typical buyers in Europe and Asia. In addition to lockdown measures, consumption is also weak with seasonal maintenance taking place at refineries.Last week, Eastern Canadian refineries that would use Newfoundland crude were running at 69% of their capacity, up from 58% a year earlier but down from 87% in early April of 2019, long before the pandemic struck, Canadian Energy Regulator data show. “East Canadian oil is traveling to further to find a home,” said Randy Giveans, senior vice president of Equity Research for Energy Maritime at Jefferies LLC. The long trip, which is expected to include transiting the Panama Canal, isn’t cheap and sellers would have discounted prices to offset the extra cost, he said.BP said it does not comment on its day-to-day operations.(Updates with Canadian refinery runs in the seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eastern-canadian-oil-heads-u-171640357.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Poised to Restart Buybacks After Reaching Debt Goal Early	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc said it already achieved its $35 billion net-debt target, reaching the threshold at which it has said it can restart share buybacks about a year earlier than expected.The news reflects an accelerated pace of asset sales and improved business performance, with BP’s trading division capitalizing on dramatic moves in energy markets. It marks a potential turning point following a tumultuous year for the industry, in which fuel sales and refining margins were hammered by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.So far this year, a “very strong” business performance driven by trading, prices and “resilient operations” has brought borrowings down, the London-based oil giant said Tuesday. Having reached its debt goal, “BP is committed to returning at least 60% of surplus cash flow to shareholders by way of share buybacks.”The move will be a boon to investors, many of whom had seen peer Royal Dutch Shell Plc as being ahead of the game in returning cash to shareholders, having slightly raised its dividend only two quarters after it was slashed. BP cut its payout last August, a policy u-turn after boosting it just a few quarters earlier.BP’s shares rose 3.4% to 299.75 pence as of 9:46 a.m. in London, extending their gain this year to 18%.“Given where the stock price is, we expect more than 60% of surplus free cash flow to be allocated to buybacks,” Oswald Clint, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd., said in research note. The energy company also made a strong profit from liquefied natural gas trading in the first quarter, he said.Energy ShiftWhile the market welcomed BP’s announcement, the firm’s value is still down by a third from pre-pandemic levels. That reflects struggles on several fronts, from the lingering effects of the virus crisis to the overhaul of the business amid the energy transition. BP has labored over the past year to convince investors that it can generate high returns while slashing emissions and ramping up clean-energy investments.It’s also selling a raft of assets -- including a stake in a large Omani gas project and an interest in data firm Palantir Technologies Inc. -- and plans to offload $25 billion worth by 2025. BP received around $4.7 billion from disposals in the quarter through March, and now expects such proceeds in 2021 to be at the top end of its $4 billion to $6 billion range, it said Tuesday.See also: BP Is Said to Field Final Offers for North Sea Energy AssetsBP is among a number of oil majors and independent commodity trading houses to profit from the large swings in prices during the pandemic. The company doesn’t break down how much money its trading unit makes, but Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney has said the division will be key in boosting returns from investments in renewables, which are typically 5% to 6%.BP’s net debt at the end of 2020 was $38.9 billion. It said at the time that the figure would likely increase in the first half of 2021. In February, BP estimated that it would meet its $35 billion debt target between the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022.There’ll be a further update on debt and buyback plans at BP’s first-quarter results on April 27.(Updates with analyst comment in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-poised-restart-buybacks-reaching-062442976.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-30	2021-03-30 04:01:05	BP	BP p.l.c.	Big Oil’s Secret World of Trading	"(Bloomberg Markets) -- It was a bleak moment for the oil industry. U.S. shale companies were failing by the dozen. Petrostates were on the brink of bankruptcy. Texas roughnecks and Kuwaiti princes alike had watched helplessly for months as the commodity that was their lifeblood tumbled to prices that had until recently seemed unthinkable. Below $50 a barrel, then below $40, then below $30.But inside the central London headquarters of one of the world’s largest oil companies, there was an air of calm. It was January 2016. Bob Dudley had been at the helm of BP Plc for six years. He ought to have had as much reason to panic as anyone in the rest of his industry. The unflashy American had been predicting lower prices for months. He was being proved right, though that was hardly a reason to celebrate.Unlike most of his peers, Dudley was no passive observer. At the heart of BP, far removed from the sprawling network of oil fields, refineries, and service stations that the company is known for, sits a vast trading unit, combining the logistical prowess of an air traffic control center with the master-of-the-universe swagger of a macro hedge fund. And, unknown to all but a few company insiders, BP’s traders had spotted, in the teeth of the oil price collapse, an opportunity.Over the course of 2015, Dudley had acquired a reputation as the oil industry’s Cassandra. Oil prices had been under pressure ever since Saudi Arabia launched a price war against U.S. shale producers a year earlier. When crude prices started falling, he confidently predicted they would remain “lower for longer.” A few months later, he went further. Oil prices, he said, were due to stay “lower for even longer.”On Jan. 20, 2016, the price of Brent crude oil plunged to $27.10 a barrel, the lowest in more than a decade. It was a nadir that would be reached again only in March 2020, when the Saudis launched another price war, this time targeting Russia, just as the coronavirus pandemic sapped global demand.When Dudley arrived in the Swiss ski resort of Davos for the World Economic Forum on Jan. 21, 2016, the industry was braced for more doom and gloom. Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, the BP chief executive officer made his way through the snowy streets. After one meeting, he was asked—as usual—for his oil forecast by a gaggle of journalists. “Prices will remain low for longer,” he said. This time, though, his by-then-well-known mantra came with a kicker: “But not forever.”Few understood the special significance of his comment. After months of slumping oil prices, BP’s traders had turned bullish. And, in complete secrecy, the company was putting money behind its conviction.Shortly before flying to Davos, Dudley had authorized a daring trade: BP would place a large bet on a rebound in oil prices. Although its stock is in the FTSE 100 index and owned by almost every British pension fund, this wager, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, has remained a closely guarded secret until now.BP was already heavily exposed to the price of oil. What the traders wanted to do was double down, to increase the exposure by buying futures contracts much as a hedge fund would. BP’s trading arm—staffed by about 3,000 people on its main trading floors in London, Chicago, Houston, and Singapore—argued that the price had fallen so far that it could only go up. And Dudley agreed.Quietly, BP bought Brent crude futures traded in London. It was a “management position”—a trade so large it couldn’t be the responsibility of any one trader and had to be overseen by the company’s most senior executives.The optimistic coda Dudley attached to his catchphrase in Davos proved prescient. By early February, oil was up by a third, trading above $35 a barrel. By the end of May, it was more than $50 a barrel.That’s when the company started to count the profits. The trade “made a lot of money,” says a former BP executive with direct knowledge of it. Another executive, who also was involved, put the payout at about $150 million to $200 million, declining to provide an exact figure. Publicly, however, BP —whose vast size means it’s not obligated to disclose even a windfall of that scale­­—said almost nothing.BP’s trades in the midst of the 2016 slump are a ­demonstration of one of Big Oil’s best-kept secrets. The company and its rivals Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SE aren’t just major oil producers; they’re also some of the world’s largest commodity traders. Shell, the most active of the three, is the world’s largest oil trader—ahead of independent houses such as Vitol Group and Glencore Plc.Massive trading floors that mirror those of Wall Street’s biggest banks are becoming increasingly important to the oil companies, which are driven by fears that global oil demand could start to drop in the next few years as climate change concerns reshape society’s—and investors’—­attitudes toward fossil fuel producers. No longer looked down upon as handmaidens to the engineers who built Big Oil, the traders are increasingly being seen as their companies’ saviors. The brightest stars can make more than $10 million a year, outstripping their bosses.Like BP’s 2016 trade, much about the oil majors’ trading exploits has never been reported. Bloomberg Markets pieced together the story of these lucrative but secretive operations through interviews with more than two dozen current and former traders and executives, some of which were conducted for The World for Sale, our new book on the history of commodity trading.The oil majors trade in physical energy markets, buying tankers of crude, gasoline, and diesel. And they do the same in natural gas and power markets via pipelines and electricity grids. But they do more than that: They also speculate in financial markets, buying and selling futures, options, and other financial derivatives in energy markets and beyond—from corn to metals—and closing deals with hedge funds, private equity firms, and investment banks.As little known as their trading is to the outside world, BP, Shell, and Total see it as the heart of their business. In a conference call with industry analysts last year, Ben van Beurden, CEO of Shell, described the company’s trading in almost mystical terms: “It actually makes the magic.”And the wizardry pays off: In an average year, Shell makes as much as $4 billion in pretax profit from trading oil and gas; BP typically records from $2 billion to $3 billion ­annually; the French major Total not much less, according to people familiar with the three companies. In the case of BP, for instance, profits can equal roughly half of what the company’s upstream business of producing oil and gas makes in a normal year, such as 2019. In years of low prices, like 2016 or 2020, trading profits can far exceed those of the production business. Last year, both BP and Shell made about $1 billion above their typical profit target in oil and gas trading.One reason profits are so high is because the three companies can reduce their trading tax bill by routing their business through low-tax jurisdictions—a strategy not available to their oil pumping and refining businesses, which are rooted in physical infrastructure in particular countries. Shell, for example, concentrates all its trading of West African and Latin American crude via a subsidiary in the Bahamas. With just 36 traders in Nassau, Shell reported profits in the Bahamas of $847.5 million in 2019. Yet it didn’t pay a single dollar in taxes on those gains.Even better for the trio, trading profits tend to soar when markets are oversupplied, as was the case in 2015-16 and again in 2020, helping to cushion the blow of low prices on the traditional business of pumping and refining oil. Trading also gives them an edge over their U.S. rivals, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., which for historical and cultural reasons have eschewed trading.For most shareholders, however, the trading business is a black box. ""It is impossible to show exactly what we are doing, unless we want to completely open up our entire trading book, which is something we simply cannot do,"" Shell's van Beurden said last year when asked how much money the trading unit made. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanné, asked a similar question, replied more bluntly: “The oil trading is a secret.”What isn’t a secret is the size of the trades. Together the three companies trade almost 30 million barrels a day of oil and other petroleum products, equal to the daily production of the entire OPEC cartel. Shell alone trades about 12 million barrels a day. That’s physical trading. The paper volumes are much larger. Total, for example, trades 6.9 million barrels of physical oil a day, but the equivalent of 31 million barrels of oil derivatives such as futures and options.With trading comes risk. The business “suits people who have a real commercial bent, a real desire to make money for the company,” Andrew Smith, head of trading at Shell, says in a recruiting video. They must be fearless, too: “They also have to be comfortable with taking risk. There are very few risk-free trades. Some days we make money; some days you’d lose money,” he says.BP, Shell, and Total declined to comment for this article.The history of Big Oil and trading goes back to the industry’s origins. Shell started life in London in the 19th century as an oil trader—“Shell” Transport & Trading Co.—and only later got into oil production. Then, in the first half of the 20th century, oil trading simply ceased to exist as the biggest producers squeezed others out of the picture.A few large companies came to dominate the industry, underpinned by their agreements to divvy up the oil resources of the Middle East. These companies, BP and Shell among them, were known as the Seven Sisters. Outside their ­oligopoly, there was very little left to buy or sell.BP was emblematic of the era. The British group had grown out of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co., established after oil was first struck in Iran in 1908, and by the early 1970s it could rely on a gusher of oil from its Iranian assets that provided much of the total 5 million barrels a day that it was pumping around the world. BP didn’t need to trade. Instead the nerve center of its business was the dull-sounding “scheduling department,” charged with arranging for BP barrels to be transported in BP tankers into BP refineries and sold into BP fuel stations.Already early traders such as Marc Rich, who founded the company that is today Glencore, were finding ways to trade oil outside the control of the Seven Sisters on the nascent spot market. The big oil companies regarded trading as beneath them and looked down on the upstarts, but they would soon be forced to think differently.The Iranian revolution of 1979 at a stroke dispossessed BP of much of its oil production. The company was forced to turn to the spot market that it had long disdained to buy the oil its refineries needed.Soon BP was doing much more than just buying oil for its own refineries. Andy Hall, then a young graduate working in its scheduling department in New York, would go on to be one of the most successful oil traders in history after leaving BP. He recalls that he started buying any oil that looked cheap, whether BP needed it or not, figuring to resell it at a profit. “We basically started trading oil like crazy,” he says.The oil price slump of the late 1990s set the stage for what the three large trading businesses would become as a wave of consolidation swept through the oil industry.When Exxon merged with Mobil, which had had a successful trading business, the nontrading culture of Exxon ­prevailed. The same happened when Chevron took over Texaco. The Americans were pretty much out of the trading business.Meanwhile, BP bought Amoco, which had a large trading unit, expanding its reach. The merger of French companies Total and Elf—both large traders—further consolidated Total’s trading business. Shell, too, reorganized and centralized its trading unit.By the time the wave of consolidation was over in 2000, the European trio emerged as the kings of oil trading. Their timing was exquisite: Commodity trading was about to enjoy an enormous boom as skyrocketing Chinese demand spurred a decade-long supercycle in prices. Big Oil’s trading floors would be at home at JPMorgan Chase & Co. or UBS Group AG. Rows of desks sprouting vast arrays of flashing multicolored screens stretch out almost as far as the eye can see. The traders are arranged according to their market or region of focus, each desk representing a trading “book,” a little empire of supply contracts and derivatives deals.The floors don’t just look like Wall Street’s—they’re often located alongside them. BP’s London trading base isn’t at the company’s head office near Buckingham Palace, but in the banking hub of Canary Wharf. In Chicago its traders occupy the historic floor of the former Chicago Mercantile Exchange building.All in all, BP, Shell, and Total employ about 8,000 people in their trading divisions, a small fraction of their overall workforce of 250,000. The traders have more in common with the investment bankers across the road than they do with their colleagues sweating on oil rigs in Nigeria or mapping fields off the coast of Brazil. “Trading is a very uber-competitive environment,” Christine Sullivan, a 30-year veteran of Shell trading, says in one of the company’s ­recruiting videos. “Every day I can see the impact I’ve made to the bottom line. You see that moving up, hopefully, on a daily basis, and it just makes you want to do more.”Big Oil’s bosses like to say that speculation isn’t part of the business model of their trading units. That’s not really true. Within BP’s trading division, for example, there was for a number of years a pot of money traded, effectively, by a computer. The so-called Q Book was devised in the 1990s by two of BP’s in-house math whizzes—Chris Allen and Gordon Izatt—long before algorithmic trading became a dominant force in financial markets.The Q Book algorithm traded dozens of commodity futures including gold and corn, according to people with knowledge of it. And while BP shut down the Q Book a few years ago, it still has a unit that resembles an in-house hedge fund: The so-called Alpha One Book, run by Tim Hayes, aims to make money betting on financial commodity markets. At Shell and Total, there are similar groups.Even so, big speculative wagers on the direction of the price of oil, like the one BP took in 2016, are rare. The day-to-day job of the traders is a little like the role of the scheduling department of bygone eras, but with a healthy dose of entrepreneurial spirit thrown in.Their role gives them a huge position in the markets and opens up all kinds of opportunities to maximize profits. Last year, for example, Shell’s traders realized that the spreading coronavirus pandemic would have a catastrophic impact on international travel. They decided to bet that demand for jet fuel would collapse. It was a wager almost no other trader in the market could make on the scale that Shell did: Jet fuel is a niche market, dominated by refineries and airlines, and the market for jet fuel derivatives isn’t liquid enough for most traders to bet on easily.But Shell was well poised. It owns the Pernis refinery in Rotterdam—the largest in Europe, each day pumping out enough gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to keep half of the cars, trucks, and planes in the Netherlands moving. It supplies jet fuel to Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport.In early 2020, before air travel shrank, Shell’s traders tweaked Pernis’s production, cutting out jet fuel entirely while increasing output of other refined products. Shell still had contracts to supply jet fuel, however, so the company was left with a big short position: It would have to buy jet fuel in the market to deliver to its customers, whatever the price, if the company’s traders were wrong about the pandemic. If the price went up, Shell stood to lose millions.Of course, the traders weren’t wrong. Jet fuel demand soon plunged 90% in northwestern Europe. Across Europe, prices fell from $666 a ton at the beginning of the year to $125 a ton by late April. “We could buy jet fuel, make money on that particular trade, and then again reconstitute the products coming out of the refinery to make money elsewhere,” Shell’s van Beurden explained in an earnings call with investors in July. “That’s no ordinary trading. That is actually optimizing market positions that we know better than anybody how to take advantage of.”Shell didn’t disclose how much money it made on that single trade, but people familiar with the company said that in just the second quarter of 2020, the jet fuel traders made as much as they usually do in a whole year.“Inside Shell and BP, the traders are their Navy SEALs,” says former Shell oil analyst Florian Thaler, now head of OilX, an industry data analytics company. For their skills, traders are highly paid.For years their remuneration packages were a closely guarded secret. Then in 2006 a BP trader sued the company in the U.S. in a pay dispute. The legal fight that followed exposed the riches of Big Oil trading. The trader, Alison Myers, revealed that, on top of her regular annual salary of $150,000 for 2006, she was due a $5.5 million performance bonus—three times what BP’s then-CEO John Browne took home the same year.The legal battle revealed that others at BP did even better. The company said other traders took higher bonuses not only because their desks made more money, but also because speculative traders were generally better paid. “The market value of paper traders was higher than the value of physical traders,” BP said in a court filing.Since then, bonuses have only gone up. Nowadays many traders take home from $1 million to $10 million a year, and a handful even more. Every year at BP a list goes to the board for approval. It contains the names of the dozen or so traders whose bonuses are higher than those of the CEO, according to two people familiar with the process.At the top of the list typically sits the lead trader of the Cushing Book—the one responsible for buying and selling oil at the Oklahoma town that serves as the delivery point for the West Texas Intermediate benchmark. In a good year, this trader can make as much as $30 million, an amount that would outstrip the $23 million that David Solomon, the boss of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., took home in 2019.The immense scale of the oil companies’ trading units gives them outsize clout. Shell, as Bloomberg News has reported, has in the past made bold trades that, while not illegal, have violated the unspoken rules governing this lightly regulated market. On one occasion in 2016, for example, Shell bought roughly 70% of the cargoes of North Sea crude available for a particular month, triggering wild price gyrations while squeezing out other traders who privately complained to Shell.At times, Big Oil traders have broken the rules outright. In 2007, BP paid more than $300 million to settle charges that it manipulated U.S. propane markets, for example. At the time the fine was one of largest ever for alleged market manipulation in commodities. Earlier, U.S. regulators fined Shell $300,000 for manipulating U.S. oil futures markets in 2003 and 2004 and $30 million for manipulating natural gas markets in 2000 and 2002.Still, constrained by the sheer size and high public profiles of the companies they work for, BP, Shell, and Total traders are nowhere near as swashbuckling as their counterparts at independent houses, who, history has shown, have been more willing to make a foray into countries where corruption is rife and where buying oil sometimes involves suitcases full of cash.That means the oil giants have left many of the juiciest deals to the independents. Brian Gilvary, a former BP head of finance, puts it this way: “Is there value available to us that could be captured over and above what we capture today? Absolutely. Are we prepared to take the risk associated with that? Definitely no. I can give you a list of countries, but you know where they are.”In the last few years, Big Oil has muscled more and more into the realm previously dominated by big banks. When, after the 2008-09 financial crisis, the U.S. Congress attempted to tighten regulations around the vast and opaque market for swaps—a form of bespoke derivatives traded ­bilaterally—the process revealed for the first time the scale of the oil companies’ role in the financial markets.The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act on financial reforms required all major players in the swaps market to register themselves. There were the usual suspects: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, ­JPMorgan, and other financial behemoths. And then there were three names that seemed out of place: Cargill, the world’s largest trader of agricultural commodities, BP, and Shell.As Wall Street banks scaled back their presence in commodities in the post-crisis world, Big Oil stepped in. Shell, for example, in 2016 became the first nonbank to move in on what commodity traders at Wall Street banks see as their largest annual deal: helping the Mexican government hedge its exposure to the price of oil.For its part, BP, in a brochure for its trading unit, says, “Our customers also include banks, hedge funds and private equity firms.” The document lists a range of financial ­strategies it can help customers implement—from “options (vanilla & tailored)” to “tiered volume restructure.”With investors of all kinds increasingly unimpressed by the traditional oil-pumping business, trading is ­becoming an ever more important part of the oil companies’ sales pitch. In a virtual meeting with investors in October 2020, Shell’s van Beurden described the company’s trading unit as “absolutely core to the success of our company.” Even Exxon, which long sneered at trading as an unnecessary distraction, has changed its stance, hiring experienced oil traders to start making bets with the company’s money.As BP shifts its investments from fossil fuels to renewable energy, its traders will help it juice the relatively low returns on those investments, Bernard Looney, who last year succeeded Dudley as CEO, said in a presentation to investors in 2020. Renewable energy projects typically generate returns of 5% to 6%, he said, but the company’s expert traders can add about 2 percentage points to that.As steeped as BP may seem to be in the rigs and offshore platforms and snaking pipelines of yesteryear, Looney painted an energy future that encompasses electric cars, hydrogen, and biofuels. “We love complexity like this,” he said. “It is why we have elevated our trading function to the leadership table.”Blas and Farchy cover energy out of London. Their book, The World for Sale: Money, Power, and the Traders Who Barter the Earth’s Resources, was published in the U.K. in February by Random House Business and in the U.S. in March by Oxford University Press.

Alabama Economic Settlement Authority -- Moody's downgrades Alabama Economic Settlement Authority's BP Settlement Revenue Bonds to A2 from A1; outlook revised to stable	Rating Action: Moody's downgrades Alabama Economic Settlement Authority's BP Settlement Revenue Bonds to A2 from A1; outlook revised to stableGlobal Credit Research - 26 Mar 2021New York, March 26, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded the Alabama Economic Settlement Authority's BP Settlement Revenue Bonds, Series 2016-A and 2016-B (Taxable), to A2 from A1, and revised the outlook to stable from negative.  In view of guaranty agreements provided by BP Corporation North America, Inc. (BPCNAI, A3 stable) and by BP itself, the rating on the BP Settlement Revenue Bonds specifically reflects the credit standing of BP.  The bonds' rating will likely remain linked to BP, and it is not expected to pierce the general obligation bond rating of Alabama (Aa1 stable), given the state's ability to take actions that would reduce or even divert the flow of funds to bondholders.RATING OUTLOOKThe outlook is consistent with BP's stable outlook, which is supported by the company's resilience due to efficiency and cash flow protection measures taken in 2020 and its stated commitment to maintain strong financial credit metrics and Moody's expectation that BP's credit metrics will improve notably in 2021-22.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alabama-economic-settlement-authority-moodys-230805302.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-18	2021-03-18 13:57:09	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP's Debt Insights	Shares of BP (NYSE:BP) increased by 28.33% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt BP has. BP's Debt Based on BP's balance sheet as of April 6, 2017, long-term debt is at $72.08 billion and current debt is at $10.65 billion, amounting to $82.72 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $23.48 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $59.24 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. BP has $263.32 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.31. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

Representatives for BP, EnQuest, Ithaca, Serica and Waldorf declined to comment, while a spokesperson for Tailwind didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The interest comes amid an uptick in mergers and acquisitions in the North Sea region, where consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. says activity this year has already surpassed 2020 levels.The BP fields were due to be purchased by Premier Oil Plc last year under revised terms after oil prices crashed and its largest creditor initially blocked the deal. The transaction, which was valued at $625 million, was later dropped following a reverse-takeover of Premier by Chrysaor Holdings Ltd.BP is undergoing a global restructuring after it promised to slash its greenhouse gas emissions and increase investments in low-carbon energy.

2021-03-10	2021-03-10 10:02:54	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP Exited Kazakh Oil Projects to Focus on Renewables Strategy	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc abandoned three oil projects in Kazakhstan after it changed strategy to concentrate on renewable energy and its existing ventures.The European major sent a letter to state-run KazMunayGas in October last year, saying that after 18 months of work to evaluate such offshore blocks as the Bolshoy Zhambyl, Zhemchuzhnaya and Kalamkas Sea it decided not to pursue them with future investments, according to the letter published on KazMunayGas website yesterday.BP agreed to examine Kazakh oil projects in May 2019, a few months before Royal Dutch Shell Plc announced it had exited two crude projects in the Caspian Sea. The retreat from the fields -- both in the area of the giant Kashagan field -- was made as high costs made them uneconomic and reflected an industry-wide push to cut break-even costs. Oil prices tumbled last year as demand was destroyed by Covid-19.Last year BP said it would restructure the company to focus on cleaner energy and shrink its hydrocarbon business by 40% over the coming decade. Since announcing its strategy shift, the major has sold a string of oil and gas assets while making big investments in offshore wind. The company wasn’t immediately able to comment on the matter.BP’s shift in strategy meant capital will be directed on renewable energy and existing hydrocarbon basins, where it currently operates, according to the letter dated Oct. 27, 2020 and signed by BP’s head of business development upstream Andrew McAuslan. As a result of these changes, the firm will no longer pursue investment in the Kazakhstan blocks, it said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-exited-kazakh-oil-projects-100254255.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-08	2021-03-08 14:36:26	BP	BP p.l.c.	Unusual Options Activity Insight: BP	"BP (NYSE:BP) shares experienced unusual options activity on Monday. The stock price moved up to $26.78 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-04-16 Strike Price: $26.00 Volume: 4 Open Interest: 10842 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-03-05	2021-03-05 16:06:30	BP	BP p.l.c.	9 Oil Stocks Betting on a Return to Travel and Normality	With so many fiscal and monetary variables at play, you can’t blame conservative investors from wanting to rotate out of risky equities into safer investments. At the same time, the variables themselves entice a contrarian position for those who can handle potential volatility. If you belong in the latter camp, wagering on oil stocks may be the ticket to success. By now, it’s been roughly a year since most of America went into lockdown, naturally brewing pent-up demand. Therefore, it’s quite possible that we could see a resurgence in travel demand, which may finally help bring oil stocks out of the doldrums. As you know, the energy sector was one of the hardest hit as people were forced to curb their movements. To be fair, the data isn’t 100% encouraging. There’s still a lot we don’t know about how the novel coronavirus pandemic will play out. However, the most important piece of information we have is that daily Covid-19 infections have fallen sharply from early January peaks. In addition, the vaccine rollout has generally been encouraging, contributing to the decline in cases.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Also, a traveler sentiment survey from CouponFollow.com indicates that demand is significant for getting out of the house. So yes, people want to travel, but they want to do so safely. Thus, whenever possible, folks are choosing to drive to their destinations, which bodes well for oil stocks. You’ve probably heard that rising bond yields have unnerved investors, creating recent volatility in the market. But the implication is that possibly – and I do want to emphasize possibly – the labor market is on the mend. 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain If that is the case, you’ll want to consider these oil stocks as people get out and about to do more traveling. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) BP (NYSE:BP) ABB (NYSE:ABB) 3M (NYSE:MMM) Sunoco (NYSE:SUN) Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR) Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) Given the uncertainty of the moment, though, I absolutely want to caution investors that oil stocks are for contrarian speculators only. Perform your due diligence and, don’t risk more than you can afford to lose. Oil Stocks: Chevron (CVX) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com If I had to build a portfolio of oil stocks with which to go against the grain, I’d choose Chevron. As one of the largest energy firms in the world, Chevron covers every aspect of the oil and natural gas business, from exploration and production to refining and transportation to power generation. Therefore, if a recovery happens, CVX stock is well suited for gains. However, if a recovery doesn’t occur, CVX stock probably won’t send you immediately to the poor house. That’s because with the current transportation complex, we’re not going to switch to clean or renewable energy overnight. As well, millions of workers have been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic. People need to gradually return to their normal lives and routines, which for the foreseeable future benefits CVX stock. BP (BP) Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com It doesn’t take a genius to understand that oil stocks don’t necessarily have the greatest reputation. In recent memory, BP represents all that’s wrong with this sector. Back in 2010, the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon oil spill led to the biggest oil spill ever in the U.S. Moreover, it was one of the worst environmental disasters in world history. Indeed, the catastrophe inspired the film “Deepwater Horizon.” When Mark Wahlberg gets involved, you know some stuff is about to go down. No, BP stock is not going to win any ESG (environmental, social, governance) accolades any time soon. However, that’s also part of its “charm,” at least on a technical sense. Over the last five-year period, BP shares are down around 13% while CVX is up almost 14%. 7 Great Dividend Stocks Outside the Energy Sector Cynically, there’s nothing better than another disaster to cover up one’s own. Therefore, BP stock might pleasantly surprise you. ABB (ABB) Source: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com On the surface, ABB may not immediately strike you as a big name among oil stocks. Rather, the Swedish-Swiss multinational firm is arguably best known for its robotics and automation technologies. However, the industrial technology company does significant business with the oil and gas industry, providing various systems and equipment for onshore and offshore oil operations. This was a relevant underlying business of ABB stock before the pandemic. However, in the post-pandemic world, it’s become even more crucial. As I mentioned earlier, oil stocks have been gutted due to the Covid-19 crisis. They’ve got many challenges ahead, and every dollar saved through enhanced efficiencies matters much more than it previously did. Further, ABB stock isn’t completely exposed to the energy market, since the issuing company offers valuable services across multiple sectors. In a variable environment, it pays to have something stable like this. 3M (MMM) Source: ©iStock.com/ndoeljindoel In the same vein as ABB, prospective buyers of oil stocks should consider 3M. True, MMM stock is mostly associated with applied sciences solutions and everyday convenient consumer products, such as the ubiquitous Post-it notes. However, some folks may be surprised to know that 3M provides economically compelling solutions for the oil industry’s three main components: upstream, midstream and downstream. Of course, as people learn to live with the pandemic and venture out, this dynamic improves the bottom line for oil firms. In turn, this should lead to residual demand for 3M’s holistic supply chain services, which could benefit MMM stock. 7 of the Best Warren Buffett Stock Picks of the Past Decade Lastly, 3M is almost the perfect contrarian play on a return to travel. Thanks to its N95 respirator masks – which by the way are slowly starting to become restocked – 3M’s relevance is dual-pronged. Sunoco (SUN) Source: Gergely Zsolnai/Shutterstock.com As I stated near the top, Americans want to travel but many are leery of doing so via public transportation. Instead, they prefer to get to their location in their personal vehicles. That suits Sunoco and SUN stock perfectly. As one of the largest companies of its sector, Sunoco “distributes fuel to over 5,000 gas station locations in more than 30 states.” While I believe in the power of pent-up demand, I also think there’s a risk in assuming that Americans are that dead set on traveling. Rather, I believe most will take gradual steps back to their normal routines – first driving in their personal vehicles, then later trusting public transportation. If so, this dynamic suits SUN stock. Plus, I like that Sunoco has a strong auto racing heritage. With the Super Bowl proving that you can host a major event during this pandemic, Sunoco’s racing-related synergies should rise this year. One last note – Sunoco is a master limited partnership and thus has tax implications you should consider before buying SUN. Phillips 66 (PSX) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Should travel make a comeback, Phillips 66 should warrant consideration in a portfolio of oil stocks. Primarily, the company has several fuel brands under its belt – its namesake Phillips 66, Conoco, 76, JET and Coop. These are “backed by a network of 11 refineries, 200 terminals and 7,000 branded sites,” according to the company’s website. Naturally, as people hit the road, PSX stock should see continued strength in its already robust momentum. Even further down the line, Phillips 66 should be a relevant name, even with the “encroachment” of electric vehicles. 7 Penny Stocks Close To Busting Through the $5 Mark True, EV battery technology is constantly improving, and even more importantly, declining in cost. However, we’re still not quite to the point where EVs are readily accessible to the everyday consumer. Until that changes – and this transition may take longer than we previously thought – PSX stock may provide more smiles to speculators. EOG Resources (EOG) Source: Shutterstock Following the initial devastation of the coronavirus, I was in no mood to entertain the idea of oil stocks. After all, the price of crude dipped to below zero at one point, an unprecedented occurrence. Therefore, I’ll hope you’ll forgive my lack of optimism for companies like EOG Resources. If demand was negative, I didn’t see how that would be net positive for EOG stock. However, the overall resilience and come-back spirit of America pleasantly surprised me – one positive takeaway from an otherwise awful year in 2020. As a result, EOG stock looks considerably more attractive than it was during the Covid lockdowns. True, EOG Resources’ core business of energy exploration doesn’t strike me as socially or politically relevant. While electric transportation is the future, when that future will arrive is anyone’s guess. For the foreseeable future, we still place tremendous value in fossil fuels for their high energy density and that ultimately benefits EOG. Nabors Industries (NBR) Source: Novikov Aleksey / Shutterstock.com Thanks to improved economic sentiment and the implications this has for a return to normal, Nabor Industries has been one of the best-performing energy stocks this year. Since the first trading session in January, NBR stock is up around 107%. While I’m not the biggest fan of buying into momentum, it’s possible that there’s more legs left on this rally. As an oil and gas drilling contractor, Nabors provides various services that keep energy exploration operations running as smoothly and efficiently as possible. Again, exploration doesn’t seem like a natural place to make money, not with the President Joe Biden administration at the helm. 7 Stocks to Sell for March However, we were all a bit surprised – well, not all of us if I may say so myself – when the U.S. Postal Service didn’t choose Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) as the winner to provide next-generation mail carriers. This indicates that the electrification of transportation still has challenges ahead of it. And like it or not, this gives NBR stock a much-needed lifeline. Marathon Oil (MRO) Source: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.com If you really want to speculate with oil stocks, you may want to consider independent energy companies like Marathon Oil. Like virtually every company in this sector, Marathon suffered severely during the lockdowns. As a result, I didn’t want to touch MRO stock with a 20-foot pole. Frankly, I’m not entirely sure how to approach Marathon and other oil stocks, because of the ambiguous nature of this economic recovery. While the labor market has improved since its valley last year, I’m concerned about the rampant speculation in equities and other investment categories. So, MRO stock is questionable. Nevertheless, if you’ve got an iron stomach for volatility, Marathon may still give your portfolio some love. As I’ve explained above, the company’s core exploration business is very much relevant – all the more so as we work our way out of this recession.

BP Ties Up With IBM’s Quantum Network	IBM announced that global energy company BP has joined the tech giant’s quantum network as an industry partner to boost the use of quantum computing in the energy industry. IBM quantum network is a community of more than 130 members, who advance the development of quantum computing and explore practical applications. The partnership will give BP access to IBM’s (IBM) quantum expertise, software and the most advanced quantum computers through the cloud. It also includes a premium 65 qubit quantum computer which is the largest universal quantum system in the industry at present. Notably, IBM is targeting a 1,000 plus qubit system by 2023 end. The two companies will explore the use of quantum computing to address business and engineering challenges and develop potential applications to drive efficiencies and reduce carbon emissions. Quantum computing can be used in diverse areas such as modelling chemistry and build up of clay in hydrocarbon wells, analyzing fluid dynamics in wind farms and optimisation of autonomous robotic inspection of facilities. By the end of 2030, BP seeks to achieve about 50 gigawatts of net renewable energy capacity and reduce its oil and gas production by 40%. Dario Gill, senior vice president and director of IBM Research said, “The energy industry is filled with opportunities to see value of quantum computing use via discovery of new materials that can improve generation, transfer as well as storage of energy.” (See IBM stock analysis on TipRanks). Morgan Stanley analyst Kathryn Huberty on Jan. 22 reiterated Hold rating on IBM stock with a $140 price target implying 16% upside potential. Huberty noted that a shift to shorter duration deals raised questions if customers are willing to commit to the company’s products over a longer timeline. The analyst believes a change in software growth trajectory is essential to build investor confidence for sustainable revenue growth over a longer term for the company. The rest of the Street remains cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 2 Buys and 3 Holds. That’s with an average analyst price target of $137.25, implying 14% upside potential from current levels.

Chevron (NYSE: CVX) kicked off the earnings season last Friday, disappointing Wall Street with its third straight quarterly loss and showing just how brutal the oil price war was. This week, Exxon Mobile Corporation (NYSE: XOM) and BP p.l.c. (NYSE: BP) this Tuesday. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS-A)(NYSE: RDS-B) took Thursday's stage and Total (NYSE: TOT) will report on February 9th. As for this week's news, Exxon reported a fourth consecutive loss, BP plunged to its first annual loss in decades and Shell recorded negative income attributable to shareholders for the first time since the unification of Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and Shell Transport & Trading company in 2005. Regardless of the remaining financial disclosure of Total, 2020 was the far worst year of the 21st century. Giants are in for a complete makeover It seems like that emission-cutting plans will play the main role in 2021 as the entire world is interested in reducing its carbon footprint. The U.S.'s return to the Paris Agreement could bring a strong wind in the green energy sails. Although it looks like a large blow for the oil giants, diversification can boost stock prices, if done properly. However, before the oil industry becomes greener, it will have to face massive asset streamlining and inorganic growth to adapt to the new circumstances. Exxon is feeling the heat Exxon Mobil announced its fourth consecutive quarter in the red, due to an unprecedented coronavirus pandemic which annihilated global oil demand. The report says that Exxon Mobil lost $20.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Earnings per share were 3 cents, excluding items. This is 2 cents higher than what analysts expected and caused shares price to rise by 1.6% on Tuesday. Still, revenues were 4.55% lower than expected, which amounted to $46.54 billion, while Wall Street analysts expected $48.76 billion. As its share price dropped about 26% over the past twelve months, the observers cannot help but wonder if what was once the biggest company in the world is now a dinosaur that cannot transition to the green era. BP's weak results show that recovery has barely begun BP showed us that, despite expectations, the healing of Big Oil's wounds is still far from certain. Although company showed a modest profit, it is just a pale shadow of the previous year's performance. Namely, BP's fourth quarter adjusted net income was $115 million, down from $2.57 billion a year before. The company fell short by $440 million from the average analyst estimate. Cash flow was insufficient to cover dividends and capital expenditure regardless of severe capital expenditure cuts. This raises questions regarding company's ability to sustain the returns to investors. The share price fell 4.5%. Shell raises dividends regardless of the sharp drop in full-year profit Unlike other Big Oil members, Shell reported adjusted earnings of $4.85 billion for the full year 2020, which is 5.83% lower than what analysts expected. The pandemic struck heavily on Shell since 2019 profit was $16.5 billion. Income attributable to shareholders of Shell has fallen by 237% to a loss of $21.7 billion in 2020, unlike a $15.8 billion profit in 2019. Nevertheless, the company announced that it would raise first-quarter dividends to $0.1735 per share, which presents a 4% increase from the previous quarter. Shares of the company have risen by 3% year-to-date, while they plummeted 44% in 2020. This article is not a press release and is contributed by IAMNewswire.

2021-02-02	2021-02-02 13:33:51	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP Drops 4.4% On $5.7B Loss In 2020; Street Is Bullish	BP PLC flipped to a $5.7 billion loss in 2020 from a $10 billion profit in the year-ago period, as lower energy prices, significant exploration write-offs, and depressed demand all dented its performance during the coronavirus pandemic. Shares declined 4.4% in Tuesday’s pre-market trading session. Analysts had been looking for a full-year 2020 loss of $4.8 billion. BP (BP) reported that performance was significantly impacted by lower marketing performance in the downstream segment, with volumes, refining margins and utilization still under pressure due to COVID-19. In the fourth-quarter, BP’s adjusted net income plunged to $115 million from $2.57 billion during the same period a year ago. Analysts had expected the oil major to post $286 million in adjusted net income. Operating cash flow for the quarter, excluding Gulf of Mexico oil spill payments of $0.1 billion, was $2.4 billion. BP announced a 5.25 cents per share dividend for the quarter. “2020 will forever be remembered. Our sector was hit hard as well. Road and air travel are down, as are oil demand, prices and margins,” commented BP CEO Bernard Looney. “We launched a net zero ambition, set a new strategy to become an integrated energy company and created an offshore wind business in the US. We began reinventing bp – with nearly 10 thousand people leaving the company. We strengthened our finances – taking out costs and closing major divestments. We expect much better days ahead for all of us in 2021.” Net debt, which stood at $39 billion at the end of 2020, declined by $1.4 billion over the fourth quarter and $6.5 billion throughout last year. The oil giant targets a net debt level of $35 billion between the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter of 2022, which will trigger the start of share buybacks. This assumes oil prices are in the range of $45-50 a barrel. In addition, BP expects proceeds from divestments and other disposals to amount to $4 billion-6 billion in 2021. Shares in BP have seen some recovery, with a 38% gain over the past three months after losing 37% of their value over the past year as the coronavirus pandemic pushed oil prices to multi-year lows, leading to declines in oil and gas output. (See BP stock analysis on TipRanks) Ahead of the earnings results, MKM Partners analyst John Gerdes this month initiated the stock’s coverage with a Buy rating and a $31 price target. Gerdes expects BP to generate $26 billion of free cash flow during 2021-2025. The rest of the Street has a bullish outlook on the stock, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buy ratings versus only 1 Hold rating. What’s more, the average analyst price target of $29.40 implies upside potential of about 32% over the coming 12 months. Meanwhile, on TipRanks' Smart Score system, BP gets a 2 out of 10, indicating that the stock is likely to underperform market expectations.

BP’s Weak Quarter Shows Big Oil Has Barely Begun Covid Recovery	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc offered more evidence that Big Oil has barely begun to heal the wounds from last year’s historic slump.The Western world’s largest energy producers were supposed to be sailing into the fourth-quarter earnings season with a tailwind from stronger commodity prices, but BP’s miss, Exxon Mobil Corp’s $19 billion writedown and Chevron Corp.’s surprise loss show the enduring impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Earnings fell short of expectations mainly due to weak fuel sales and refining margins.BP eked out a modest profit, but it was just a fraction of typical pre-pandemic levels. Cash flow, which failed to cover dividends and capital expenditure despite deep cuts to both, raised more fundamental questions about the company’s ability to sustain investor returns. Shares fell as much as 4.5%.“This was a challenging end to 2020,” said Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Redburn. “Operating cash flow remains very weak and missed expectations. We will likely see net debt worsen in the first quarter, which will temper expectations of better shareholder distributions.”BP’s fourth-quarter adjusted net income was $115 million, down from $2.57 billion a year earlier and only a slight improvement from the preceding three months. The company fell short of the average analyst estimate of $440 million.Operating cash flow excluding Gulf of Mexico spill payments, a key figure for investors as it determines the sustainability of dividend payments and capital expenditure, was much weaker. It fell to $2.4 billion in the period, down from $5.4 billion in the third quarter.“Tough quarter, clearly, at the end of a really tough year,” BP Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Tuesday. “The full-year results were hit hard by Covid.”BP shares fell 3.4% to 257.9 pence at 12:40 p.m. in London, even as most oil companies rallied with stronger crude prices.With crude prices and refining margins buoyed by the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines and the prospect of an economic rebound, investors had been expecting a grim year to end on a more positive note. Some optimism had already been priced in, with shares of BP and its peers posting double-digit percentage gains since the end of the third quarter of 2020.Yet refining weighed down the company’s performance. BP said the business was affected “significantly” by lower volumes as a result of the pandemic, with continuing pressure on margins.The company is confident that cash flow will increase amid higher oil and gas prices, especially as it ramps up production in large assets such as Shah Deniz in Azerbaijan and Ghazeer in Oman, Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss said in an interview. Auchincloss added that the metric had been lower in the period as a result of severance costs related to its restructuring and the lack of a dividend from Rosneft PJSC, in which it has a 20% stake.Marketing and trading, which came to BP’s rescue earlier in the pandemic, offered little assistance in the fourth quarter, with a particularly weak performance on natural gas.“Weather was warmer in the United States than we thought and colder in Asia than we thought, and that made for some difficult trading conditions,” Looney said. Trading is off to a “very good” start this year, he said.Net debt was down $1.4 billion from the preceding quarter to $39 billion at year-end. Still, BP said it expects the figure to increase in the first half of 2021, driven by payments related to employee severance, the annual Gulf of Mexico oil spill compensation, and the completion of the offshore wind joint venture with Equinor ASA. The ratio of net debt to equity was 31%.BP remains on track to meet its net-debt target of $35 billion between the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022, “which will trigger the start of share buybacks, subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating,” Auchincloss said in a statement.(Adds CFO comments in 11th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-earnings-fall-short-pandemic-071510940.html?.tsrc=rss

Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Tuesday's Q4 earnings announcement. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue BP EPS is expected to be around $0.08, according to sell-side analysts. Sales will likely be near $46.61 billion. In the same quarter last year, BP reported EPS of $0.76 on revenue of $71.11 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin. View more earnings on BP The Wall Street estimate would represent a 89.47% decline in the company's earnings. Sales would be down 34.45% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate -0.03 -1.10 0.26 0.65 EPS Actual 0.03 -1.98 0.24 0.76 Revenue Estimate 49.19 B 42.78 B 79.61 B 68.79 B Revenue Actual 44.25 B 31.68 B 59.65 B 71.11 B Stock Performance Over the past 52-week period, shares of BP have declined 39.78%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are probably a little upset going into this earnings release.

BP Sells Oman Stake to Thai Firm in $25 Billion Divestment Drive	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc will sell a stake in an Omani gas block to Thailand’s national energy firm for $2.6 billion, part of a push to divest billions of dollars of assets and focus more on renewable energy.PTT Exploration and Production Public Co. Ltd. has agreed to pay the sum for 20% of Block 61, according to statements from both companies on Monday.The deal should help BP deliver on its goal of selling $25 billion of assets by 2025, easing its debt burden after the coronavirus pandemic hammered demand for energy. Like other oil majors, the company has also pledged to eliminate most of its greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades.BP’s shares fell to the lowest in around 25 years in October, shortly after it cut its dividend for the first time in a decade and Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney announced a shift toward greener energy. The London-based firm is due to report fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday, when investors will be paying attention to how much progress BP has made in reducing its liabilities.The stock rose 0.1% to 271.65 pence by 11:18 a.m. in London, extending gains this year to 6.6%.The price of the Oman stake is “attractive” for BP compared with historical transactions, analysts at Bernstein including Oswald Clint wrote in a research note. The sale reinforces their view that BP will restart share buybacks as early as mid-2021. The company committed to purchasing its own stock once net debt is trimmed to $35 billion, from around $40 billion at the end of September.JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised PTTEP on the acquisition.Deal ClosingBlock 61 is BP’s biggest asset in Oman and has a combined daily production capacity of 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas and more than 65,000 barrels of condensate, a light form of oil, according to the company.BP began talks with potential buyers in 2020. It expects the deal to close this year, after which it will remain the block’s operator and its biggest shareholder with 40% ownership.Of the remainder, Omani state-run firm OQ will hold 30%; PTTEP, 20%; and Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or Petronas, 10%. Petronas bought its stake from OQ in 2018.PTTEP already has investments in the sultanate, including a stake in Block 6, which is the country’s largest deposit, and state-controlled Oman Liquefied Natural Gas LLC. It’s expanding in the Middle East. In December, it secured a license to explore for oil and gas off the coast of Abu Dhabi in the neighboring United Arab Emirates.Fracking ConcessionBlock 61 has been developed in two phases: Khazzan, which began production in 2017, and Ghazeer, which started operating in October. The block can meet around 35% of Oman’s gas demand, BP said.The concession area contains the largest tight-gas development in the Middle East, the company said. Khazzan and Ghazeer rely on hydraulic fracturing to boost output, the method that kicked off the U.S. shale boom but is rarely used elsewhere.Gas produced at the block, which spans 3,950 square kilometers in central Oman, is piped to the grid to meet the country’s domestic needs and supply its liquefaction plant. BP’s trading arm buys around 10% of the gas produced at Khazzan-Ghazeer in liquid form, under a seven-year supply agreement with Oman LNG that began in 2018.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-sells-oman-gas-stake-074243326.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Sells $2.6B Oman Gas Block Stake To Thailand’s PTT	BP PLC has inked a deal to sell a 20% participating interest in Oman’s gas Block 61 to Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Ltd. (PTTEP) for a total of $2.6 billion. As part of the agreed terms, BP (BP) will get $2.450 billion at deal completion, which is expected during 2021, and another $140 million will be payable subject to pre-agreed future conditions. Upon closure of the sale, the oil giant will remain the block’s operator with a 40% interest. Other stakeholders include Petronas and Oman’s state oil company OQ. Gas from Block 61 is exported for domestic consumption into Oman’s national gas grid. Block 61 covers around 3,950km in central Oman and contains the largest tight gas development in the Middle East. The block has already had two phases of development – Khazzan, which began production in 2017, and Ghazeer in Oct. 2020. The two developments, targeted at developing a total of 10.5 trillion cubic feet of gas resources, have a combined daily production capacity of 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas and more than 65,000 barrels of condensate. PTTEP is Thailand’s national petroleum exploration and production company, with interests in 15 countries, including Oman. “We are committed to bp’s business in Oman – this agreement allows us to remain at the heart of this world-class development while also making important progress in our global divestment programme,” BP CEO Bernard Looney said. The deal is part of BP’s divestment plan, which targets proceeds of $25 billion by 2025. The oil giant recently completed the $5 billion sale of its petrochemicals business to INEOS. Shares in BP have seen some recovery, with a 38% gain over the past three months after losing 37% of their value over the past year as the coronavirus pandemic pushed oil prices to multi-year lows, leading to declines in oil and gas output. (See BP stock analysis on TipRanks) Meanwhile, MKM Partners analyst John Gerdes last week initiated the stock’s coverage with a Buy rating and a $31 price target. Gerdes expects BP to generate $26 billion of free cash flow during 2021-2025, which he noted is about 33% of the company's market capitalization. The rest of the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. What’s more, the average analyst price target of $29.40 implies upside potential of about 32% over the coming 12 months.

Oil Supermajors to Show Worst Is Over With Commodities Rally	(Bloomberg) -- The Western world’s largest oil explorers are sailing into earnings season on the tailwind of strong commodity prices after a 2020 they would rather forget.With crude prices and refining margins buoyed by the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and the prospect of an economic rebound, investors will be watching for signs in Big Oil’s fourth-quarter earnings that higher crude prices will translate into much-needed increased cash flows this year.Some optimism is already priced in. Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc, both of which last year weathered their worst stock-price slumps in decades, are up more than 10% in 2021. Still, the supermajors are largely out of favor: The combined market value of Exxon, Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP is now less than that of Tesla Inc.The challenge for executives during conference calls with analysts and investors will be to strike the right balance between paying back debt, funding shareholder payouts and financing growth plans and energy-transition strategies.Here are five things to watch for when they post fourth-quarter earnings, which are scheduled as follows:1. Cash GenerationWhile higher commodity prices clearly benefit oil companies, the supermajors can be something of a black box in translating those gains into cash flows. Trading, production outages, cargo timing, refinery maintenance and fuel stockpiles can have an big impact on results. Investors will be watching for signs that strengthening prices are bolstering cash reserves.The big oil drillers should be “outsized beneficiaries of the continued reopening trade,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by Devin McDermott wrote in a note to clients. But investors still need to see “visible cash flow” before turning bullish in the medium term.The Morgan Stanley analysts believe cash flow is the single top indicator of stock performance for the supermajors as investors have largely given up on rewarding companies for boosting output, expanding underground reserves or timely project construction. The metric has become increasingly important as companies took on more debt.2. Capital AllocationAll the supermajors aggressively cut spending in 2020 and investors will be wary of any moves to flex this year’s outlays higher in response to increasing prices, particularly in U.S. shale fields.“After years of underperformance, for upstream oil & gas, 2021 can best be described as the proof of concept year,” Barclays Plc analysts led by Jeanine Wai wrote in a note. “The oil macro is arguably serving up free cash flow on a silver platter if management teams can just stay disciplined.”Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth will likely face questions around his appetite for further takeovers, given the company’s relatively strong balance sheet and recent $5 billion purchase of Noble Energy Inc. Meanwhile, Exxon executives will once again be asked about their ability to maintain the third-largest dividend in the S&P 500 Index.For a look at Bloomberg Intelligence’s ESG data, click hereFor BP and Shell, it will all be about shareholder returns. Both companies slashed dividends last year, drawing the ire of investors counting on generous payouts. Shell sought to woo some of them back during the third quarter with a modest dividend increase and the promise of further hikes as well as share buybacks as debt is reduced.BP also has promised to return surplus cash to shareholders, but with more debt and bigger commitments to low-carbon spending, that is further down on their priority list.The European majors have all promised - to differing levels - to ramp up investments into cleaner energy over the next decades. But oil and natural gas are still their bread and butter, meaning that they will have to juggle money flowing into fossil fuels while also diverting capital into less-profitable renewables and shareholder payouts.3. WritedownsExxon’s fourth-quarter results will be marred by its biggest-ever writedown, which the company has warned may be as large as $20 billion. For its part, Shell warned in December of another multibillion-dollar impairment that will bring the tally for the year to more than $22 billion.Shell expects more charges to come this year related to its global restructuring. The firm will cut as many as 9,000 jobs over two years, and has already announced 1,600 workforce reductions in its home countries of the Netherlands and U.K. Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said in October that severance costs tied to the revamp would likely amount to $1.5 billion to $2 billion.4. Demand OutlookWith their giant networks of refineries, terminals and filling stations, the oil majors have a unique insight into global demand patterns, the key signal for oil markets as the world copes with Covid-19. Executives’ comments on anticipated customer behavior will be closely scrutinized with a view to whether the recent price rally will be fleeting or the beginning of another commodity supercycle.Of particular interest will be the outlook for liquefied natural gas in Asia, which saw a stunning price spike in recent weeks due to weather-driven demand for heating fuel. Though many long-term LNG contracts are benchmarked to the price of oil, the spot market is still an important indicator of demand.5. RestructuringThe crisis of 2020 was so severe that the majors’ quickly resorted to huge layoffs to reduce costs, and now investors will want to see what kind of savings have been reaped. Exxon has already indicated it will beat its target of reducing operating expenses by 15%, and 14,000 job cuts also ought to lead to longer-term gains.In Europe, Shell isn’t the only firm to slim down operations. BP said in June that it would reduce its 70,000-strong workforce by 10,000 to help ease $8 billion in annual “people costs.” BP CEO Bernard Looney has stressed that for the company to transition into cleaner energy it needs to be more nimble, and that has meant dismantling the traditional upstream and downstream divisions, and stripping away entire layers of management.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-supermajors-show-worst-over-050002413.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Gets Pushback From Texas Agency It Urged to Ban Gas Flaring	(Bloomberg) -- Last year, BP Plc called on Texas regulators to take bold action to stamp out the routine flaring of natural gas, a harmful environmental practice that’s drawn increasing scrutiny from investors.Yet on Tuesday, it was BP’s turn to get pushback from the Texas Railroad Commission when 121 of its flaring requests were up for consideration. The agency postponed a decision until its next meeting, and its newest member slammed the burning of excess gas as a “waste of our precious resources.”“I am amenable to allowing fair time for flaring to occur in certain circumstances, but limits must be set,” Jim Wright, a Republican who joined the three-member commission this month, said in a statement. Wright’s comments didn’t explicitly name BP, but the London-based company made up the bulk of the permit applications being considered by the agency.The commission had sought to head off criticism that it’s too lenient over flaring guidelines when it adopted new rules in November that require more detailed disclosures when oil companies seek a permit. Yet that didn’t go far enough to temper criticism over the agency’s traditional hands-off approach.Oil producers are allowed to flare natural gas in the first 10 days a well is drilled, but anything beyond that requires a permit from the Railroad Commission. The 121 permits BP is seeking for its shale assets would be good through April 2022 if granted.The regulator routinely receives requests for flaring, which they almost always approve. But BP’s ask is notable for just how many sites it includes, and for how long the company wants permission to flare, said Kelly Mitchell, an oil and gas analyst at Documented, a transparency advocacy group.“This two-year flaring exception is a real world test of its promises to tackle carbon emissions,” she said. “If BP isn’t serious about reducing routine flaring then the Railroad Commission needs to deny this request.”Just a few months ago, BP teamed up with Royal Dutch Shell Plc to call on the commission to pursue a policy that would ban routine flaring. The company has pledged to achieve that goal on its own assets by 2030.BP says the request for flaring permits isn’t inconsistent with those plans. It’s already lowered the rate of flaring on assets the company acquired through its purchase of BHP Billiton’s shale business. The company said it’s “committed to zero routine flaring and will continue to work with the commission on this critical issue.’’In an earlier statement, BP said it has several projects underway to advance its goal of zero routine flaring but that, in the meantime, “exception permits are necessary for our operations as we continue to pursue our ambition.”Just before the Railroad Commission met on Tuesday, Rystad Energy released an analysis on flaring on the Texas side of the Permian. The report, commissioned by the Environmental Defense Fund, found that 40% of the flaring expected in 2025 is avoidable at no cost to operators.The shale boom over the past few years created a massive excess of natural gas, often a by-product of oil in some basins such as the Permian. Although last year saw a sharp drop in flaring as oil drillers shut in output in response to the virus, it’s expected to pick up in future years as production resumes.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-gets-pushback-texas-agency-224740991.html?.tsrc=rss

EV Charging Firm FreeWire Closes Funding Round From Riverstone	(Bloomberg) -- FreeWire Technologies Inc., an electric vehicle charging and power startup, has raised $50 million in a series C funding round.The round was led by energy-focused private equity firm Riverstone Holdings, said FreeWire Chief Executive Officer Arcady Sosinov in an interview Monday. Existing shareholders including the venture arm of BP Plc, Energy Innovation Capital, Trirec and Alumni Ventures Group also participated in the round, Sosinov said.FreeWire has raised $100 million in total funding to date, including the new round, according to Sosinov. The company’s valuation in the new round couldn’t immediately be learned. “One of the reasons we placed our bet here is that FreeWire’s technology is more advanced,” said Riverstone partner Robert Tichio, who will join the company’s board. “Its commercial relationships have even further and deeper penetration than almost all of its public comps.”Six-year-old FreeWire’s products are used to charge electric vehicles and power events and construction sites, its website shows. It plans to have more than 2,500 ultrafast charging stations by 2025.BloombergNEF forecasts that the U.S. will need 330,000 public chargers installed by 2025 to support its base-case scenario of 4.5 million consumer EVs and e-vans on roads. Fast-chargers with integrated storage are becoming increasingly popular because they reduce the cost of updating grid networks and avoid excessive loads caused by EV charging.In Germany, utility provider EON SE has partnered with Volkswagen AG on a similar network of chargers with an integrated battery system.Macquarie Group Ltd. and Volvo AB are among FreeWire’s current shareholders, according to its website.BP’s involvement in the round is the latest among energy companies making bets on green infrastructure and alternative-energy. FreeWire, based in San Leandro, California, has an agreement with BP to install more than $50 million of fast-chargers in the U.K. over the next five years, according to a statement.On Monday, Royal Dutch Shell Plc agreed to buy Ubitricity, which operates the largest public electric vehicle charging network in the U.K. It’s the most recent in a string of such investments by Shell. Total SE has made similar bets, most recently investing in U.S. fuel-cell startup Hyzon Motors through its venture capital arm, Total Carbon Neutrality Ventures.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-charging-firm-freewire-closes-020000058.html?.tsrc=rss

They were as much a sure thing as big banking stocks. Well, we’ve seen that banking isn’t what it used to be and the same goes for the energy patch.
And remember, the pandemic was more the final nail rather than the sole factor in the demise of oil companies. Supply had been high for a while as OPEC nations looked to keep prices low to make life hard on U.S.-based production firms.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Then ESG (environmental, social, governance) investing gained traction the shift to renewables began in earnest. More than 80% of the market’s activity is institutional trading, so when they move, the market goes with them.
Finally, the pandemic continues to slow economic recovery in the U.S., Europe and emerging markets. That means less oil and gas demand.

Here are 7 energy stocks to sell before they fall any further:
BP (NYSE:BP)
Chevron (NYSE:CVX)
Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.B)
Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO)
EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG)
HollyFrontier (NYSE:HFC)
Valero (NYSE:VLO)
These energy stocks aren’t likely to disappear, but there’s certainly more risk than reward at this point.

Good old British Petroleum has been around since 1909, one of the first companies to secure oil rights in what is today Saudi Arabia. It was very influential in the region as a technologically advanced company that could produce and deliver oil to the West and cut host countries in on a profit.
Now its empire spans the world. And while it makes a lot of noise about its renewables efforts the fact is, black gold still makes up a majority of its profits.
And the world is a much different place today and keeps changing. Being a big, integrated oil companies means you can spread your risk across all aspects of the business. But in times like these, that’s not necessarily an advantage, as all energy sectors are hurting.
The stock is off almost 40% in the past year, so its nearly 8% dividend doesn’t provide much temptation.

Chevron (CVX)

When you think of U.S. oil companies, you probably think of Ohio for Standard Oil or in more recent times, Texas. But Chevron actually began, and remains headquartered, in California.
When Standard Oil was broken up in 1911, its Southern California segment eventually turned into Chevron. Today, CVX is a major global integrated oil and gas company.
In 2000, Chevron merged with Texaco to form the second largest U.S. oil company and the fourth largest publicly traded oil company. Today, it has pivoted to natural gas in the U.S. as well as other parts of the world, with a massive natural gas operation in Australia.

But none of this is able to keep CVX at the high prices to which it had become accustomed. And while it’s still a big player, this isn’t a must-have stock for anyone any longer. CVX is off 23% in the past year and its 5.7% dividend doesn’t make that any easier to swallow.

Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.B)

This Anglo-Dutch integrated oil firm is another one that goes all the way back to 1907. And its challenges and troubles are much the same as our previous two companies.
Shell was a giant in an industry that ruled the world for nearly 200 hundred years. And now its farflung empire is becoming a costly remnant of its past. If you want to know how this goes, look at nation states that rule the world for a while, like the U.K., the Netherlands and Portugal.
Managing a global enterprise fundamentally based on a single commodity is quite challenging when that commodity is no longer in demand the way it once was. It’s not that the company will disappear but it will be a shell of the Shell it once was.
The stock is off 32% in the past year and cut its dividend in April for the first time since WW 2.

Concho Resources (CXO)

Launched in 2006, this exploration and production (E&P) company has an $11 billion market cap, so it’s not a small player in the upstream oil business. But with a 1.3% dividend, it’s fundamentally a growth-focused company.
But this isn’t a growth-friendly market right now. On the bright side, the compnany is focused on natural gas from two major shale deposits. But the conversion to natural gas from oil or coal has been usurped by solar and wind.
Granted, there are still huge margins on U.S. natural gas if you can get it to Europe or Asia, but export facilities aren’t plentiful. Domestic gas demand will keep it going, but growth isn’t on the horizon.

CXO stock is off 30% in the past year. It may not have much downside, but it has little upside in the short or intermediate term.

EOG Resources (EOG)

This is another big E&P that sits in the top half of the Fortune 500. But it’s under pressure from Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC as well as Russia, which is now working closely with OPEC to access markets and hamstring U.S. producers.
Combine that with a low-demand environment that will likely get worse due to rising pandemic numbers, and it’s a challenging environment even before you throw in ESG investing rotating money out of the industry in general and into alternatives such as electric and hydrogen vehicles.
Certainly the world isn’t going to give up oil anytime soon, but it also won’t be commodity that drives the global economy as it once did.
The stock is off 38% in the past year and that’s up 46% in the past three months. Its 2.7% dividend is nice, but not very useful.

HollyFrontier (HFC)
Source: Shutterstock

	
In the energy patch there are upstream players, which are E&P firms. Midstream players are the pipeline companies. Downstream players are refiners, distributors and retailers. Integrated oils do it all.
HFC is a downstream refiner. It not only sells various fuels and lubricants made of crude but it also sells other offshoots of crude refining.
When the economy is good, there’s demand for these products. When it’s not, demand drops and refiners have less demand to fulfill.
Given the current trends, HFC may see a bump in action as the economy recovers but there are also alternative energy options that are competing with an oil-driven economy, so there may be less business for it grab.


					10 of 2020's Most Fascinating SPAC Stocks				

The stock is off 46% in the past year, so its 5.5% dividend doesn’t really mean much unless the stock can maintain its current levels, which may be difficult.

Valero (VLO)
Source: JustPixs / Shutterstock.com

	
As a refiner and retailer, VLO has broadened its product line to include ethanol and renewable diesel. This certainly helps keep it relevant as the transportation industry transitions, since big trucks still rely on diesel and ethanol is blended with gasoline to cut down on air pollution.
However, if rising investment dollars are going into electric vehicles and more companies are moving into this market, it means increased competition from outside sources for VLO. And a weaker economy means less trucking.
Its 6.7% yield is certainly tempting but the stock is off 37% in the past year and if it continues to fall, that dividend may be in jeopardy.

Russian Gas Gets New Rival in Europe as Caspian Field Starts	(Bloomberg) -- Azerbaijan started commercial natural gas exports to Europe via the U.S.-backed Southern Gas Corridor, helping the region to diversify supplies away from Russia.Gas pumped from the BP Plc-led Shah Deniz deposit in the Caspian Sea began flowing into Italy, Greece and Bulgaria on Thursday, BP and Azerbaijan’s state energy company Socar said in a joint statement. The European Union has worked for years to ease its dependence on Russia, which accounts for about a third of the region’s gas supplies.The Southern Gas Corridor, which took $33 billion and seven years to build, includes the Shah Deniz field and more than 2,000 miles of pipelines connecting the Caspian Sea with Europe via Georgia and Turkey. Azerbaijan will ship 10 billion cubic meters of gas to Europe every year over the next quarter-century, with 8 billion of that going to Italy and 1 billion each to Greece and Bulgaria.“Some people were skeptical about the project” at the outset, Socar President Rovnaq Abdullayev said. “Now the mission is accomplished.

Shift Into Hydrogen Could Lift These 3 Stocks Higher	"In a report on the alternative fuel market, analyst Rupert Merer, of National Bank of Canada, looks at the possibilities and potentialities of the hydrogen as both an energy resource and a commodity. At the heart of the matter, he writes, “Stakeholders across energy markets have reached the consensus that climate change is a problem and decarbonization of our energy supply mix will require a multifaceted approach which includes H2. It is estimated that H2 could supply 15% to 25% of global energy needs…” Merer adds, of hydrogen’s potential benefits, “H2 has the ability to reduce emissions in sectors where decarbonization is otherwise challenging, such as freight logistics, collective transport and industrial heating.”So what is hydrogen, and why is it important? Hydrogen is the most plentiful element in the observable universe, and is a common building block in complex organic molecules. It’s found in both wood and petroleum derivatives – there is a reason those are commonly called hydrocarbons – and along with oxygen, it is part of the ordinary water molecule. Without hydrogen, life as we know it would not be possible.With this in mind, using TipRanks database, we locked in on three stocks that some of Wall Street’s top analysts have tapped for gains in the growing hydrogen environment. Ballard Power Systems (BLDP)The first stock on the list is Ballard Power Systems, a hydrogen fuel cell manufacturer based in British Columbia, Canada. The company focuses on proton exchange membrane technology, one of several competing technologies in the hydrogen fuel cell market. Ballard’s PEM fuel cells are distributed worldwide, and to date, the company has produced and shipped over 400MW worth of fuel cell products. Ballard’s fuel cells are used in transportation technology, to enable fully electric busses, commercial trucks, trains, and forklift vehicles.Like many manufacturers dependent on the transportation sector, this has been a hard year for Ballard. The disruptions caused by the coronavirus have hit the company form two directions: first, the usual foul-ups in the supply and distribution chains – but also, Ballard markets its products to commercial users, who have themselves been locked down due to corona. In short, Ballard saw revenues fall in the first part of 2020, and they have yet to recover. Q3 revenues came in at $25.6 million, in line with the first and second quarters of the year.Ballard’s share price, however, has been going up and up and up all year, despite some short-term periods of volatility. Overall, the shares have grown 170% year-to-date. The gains show the cachet of hydrogen in a market that is actively seeking renewable, less polluting, and non-emission energy sources. Hydrogen checks all three boxes.Covering Ballard for Roth Capital, 5-star analyst Craig Irwin sees the company in a sound position for rapid future growth.“BLDP exited 3Q20 with $361m in cash and no debt, and with only $100m-$120m in capital needed to generate positive earnings. Mgmt was clear that it intends to more actively evaluate M&A targets across the entire H2 and FC value chains [...] We remain optimistic on the LT uplift to revenue supported by the new China FC subsidy program, and would be buyers on any weakness,"" Irwin opined. To this end, Irwin rates BLDP a Buy, and his $25 price target implies room for 29% growth in 2021. (To watch Irwin’s track record, click here)Wall Street is broadly in agreement with this analysis. Over the last couple of months, BLDP has received 3 Buy ratings and 1 Hold from Street analysts. With an average price target of $24 per share, the potential upside stands at ~24%. (See BLDP stock analysis on TipRanks)Air Products and Chemicals (APD)Air Products and Chemicals is primarily known as a provider of industrial gasses – which makes it a natural for the hydrogen industry. In its pure form, hydrogen is gaseous at ‘normal’ conditions. APD earlier this year capitalized on that natural fit, and contracted to acquire 5 hydrogen production plants in an agreement worth $530 million. Along with the new plants, APD also sealed its position as a major hydrogen supplier for PBF Energy.APD's acquisitions show it is serious about becoming a long-term provider to the hydrogen industry. APD is already an important supplier to hydrogen refiners, providing a pure gas that is usable as in transportation fuel technology. In the recently fiscal 4Q20, APD missed earnings targets but beat the forecasts on revenues. The FQ4 top line hit $2.32 billion, up 2% year-over-year and also 2% over the estimates. Argus analyst Bill Selesky likes APD’s overall position in the market, noting: “Despite weak results in fiscal 4Q20 due to the pandemic, we believe that performance will begin to improve. We also believe that APD is extremely well positioned to manage through this period due to its stable cash flows, lower-than-average debt, and investment-grade credit rating.”Selesky gives APD shares a $360 price target, suggesting 33% growth ahead, and maintains a Buy rating on the stock. (To watch Selesky’s track record, click here)Air Products has 11 recent reviews, breaking down 10 to 1 in Buys and Holds, and giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. The average price target is $311.10, indicating a potential 15% upside from current levels. (See APD stock analysis on TipRanks)BP PLC (BP)Last but not least is BP, the petroleum giant. This company has a reputation within the industry as a leader in moving toward non-petroleum, renewable energy sources, and has in the past conducted initiatives in wind, solar, and hydrogen energy. Last year, the company joined the Global Hydrogen Council. As a major player in the natural gas market, BP is well-positioned to also become a provider of ‘blue’ hydrogen, or H2 derived from natural gas sources.BP is also conducting a project at its Lingen refinery in northwestern Germany, converting the facility to produce hydrogen from water. The project is in collaboration with Orsted, and when it comes fully online in 2024 will be able to produce up to one metric ton of clean hydrogen per hour.Taking a lead in the renewable energy market is one way that BP is moving to shore up its future position. The hydrocarbon industry won’t last forever, and 2020 has been a particularly difficult year. Shares are down 36% year-to-date, and quarterly revenue has fallen from $74 billion in Q1 to $44 billion in Q3. Q3 did, however, see the company post a $100 million net profit, after heavy losses in Q2.Sam Margolin, 5-star analyst with Wolfe Research, wrote of BP after the quarterly report, “Our instinct is that the underlying O&G story is more influential to near term stock performance, although the Lingen announcement is positive for BP as it reflects the company’s ability to partner with industry leaders to advance its net-zero plan.”Margolin is bullish on BP, and his stance comes with an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating. His price target, of $31, implies an upside of 41% in the year ahead. (To watch Margolin’s track record, click here)All in all, BP has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 6 reviews that include 4 Buys and 2 Holds. The shares are selling for $21.94 and the average price target of $29.80 suggests room for 36% upside potential in the next 12 months.

2020-12-14	2020-12-14 02:45:02	BP	BP p.l.c.	Singapore’s Lim Family, BP Sued for $313 Million on Oil Deals	(Bloomberg) -- Bank of China Ltd. has sued BP Plc in Singapore over its alleged role in fabricating oil deals with collapsed trader Hin Leong, in the latest effort by a creditor to recover losses after one of the biggest trading scandals in decades.The Chinese bank requested that BP repay $125.7 million that it withdrew from the lender earlier this year based on sales of gasoil cargoes to Hin Leong, according to documents provided by the Supreme Court of Singapore. The deals were part of “fictitious purchase scheme conspiracy” to maintain Hin Leong’s liquidity since no real transactions took place, the bank said.The lender also demanded $187.2 million from Hin Leong Trading Pte’s founder, Lim Oon Kuin, and his two children, the documents showed. The total sum includes the deals linked to BP and some other overdue payments on short-term loans, or letters of credit.BP strongly refutes the allegations by Bank of China and will defend its position, the company said in a statement, without elaborating. Bank of China and the Lim family haven’t replied to emails seeking comments. Lim has earlier denied forging documents in a case brought by HSBC Holdings Plc, saying they were “mistakenly” issued.Singapore, a major-oil trading hub, was shook by defaults and alleged fraud this year, roiling lenders who finance the opaque world of commodities trading in the city state. While the main protagonists were medium-sized trading firms such as Hin Leong, some leading global firms have also been ensnared in the debacle.It’s not the only hit Bank of China has taken this year on oil. Earlier this year it agreed to repay some investors after one of its oil-linked trading products collapsed amid a plunge crude prices.Hin Leong’s creditors, which also include HSBC and Singapore’s DBS Group Holdings Ltd., are fighting to recover funds from the insolvent firm, which has $3.5 billion in outstanding debt. Bank of China’s case, filed in late November, came after HSBC and the trader’s court-appointed managers PricewaterhouseCoopers started taking legal action against the Lim family.Simultaneous SaleThe disputed gasoil deals took place in the first two months of this year. BP withdrew a total of $125.7 million on three letters of credit in early February from Bank of China, the court document showed. Hin Leong purchased a combined 1.5 million barrels of gasoil from BP in the deals and the oil major was able to present documents to prove the authenticity of the trades.The bank was later informed by Hin Leong’s judicial managers that these trades were fabrications backed by non-existent cargoes financed by at least 27 letters of credit, including the three from Bank of China. The suit alleges that Hin Leong was able to maintain a semblance of financial stability and liquidity by selling and repurchasing forged cargoes backed by letters of credit worth $624 million.“HLT fabricated documents on a massive scale,” Bank of China said in its suit. “The forged documents enabled HLT to mislead banks into extending financing to it and also acted as supporting documentation for fictitious gains or profits.”Bank of China cited the court-appointed manager as saying that the trading firm sold gasoil to BP, which the oil major then sold back to Hin Leong at a higher price. Given the gap between the sales price and purchase prices and the short time period between the deals, it appears that the transactions were intended solely to provide liquidity for Hin Leong, the bank said, citing the appointed managers.Bank of China claimed that it wasn’t aware of the “simultaneous sale” and buy-back transactions, alleging that documents were forged to “induce” the bank to make payments. It wouldn’t have made payments if it had known that the representations were false, it said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/singapore-lim-family-bp-sued-024502401.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-12-11	2020-12-11 17:13:29	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP Will Be Stuck Until the Price of Oil or Its Dividend Moves Up	"At the beginning of October, I wrote that BP (NYSE:BP) was worth about $21 or so, based on its historical yield and the company’s cash flow. Now, however, BP stock has touched $22 in the past two months. I believe the stock will stay close to these levels unless something changes.
Source: Shutterstock 
	
For example, either oil has to move up — increasing its cash flow — or the company has to raise its dividend. Unless one or both of these things happens, BP will likely stay within 7% to 15% of its present price.
What does that mean for your position in the stock? Well, here’s what could happen to this oil company’s dividend.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
BP Stock: Reverting to the Mean and More
When I wrote my previous article, BP stock had a very attractive dividend yield of 7.44%. This was significantly higher than the company’s previous historical yield of 5.50%, as seen in the chart of my prior article. Therefore, it was due to rise at least 20%. I had figured it would hit $20.72.
This was based on the theory that stocks tend to revert to their mean values. I have found over time that — for stocks with strong dividends and that can afford high yields — this model tends to work well.


					8 Battery Stocks That Electric Vehicle Companies Rely On				

But now BP stock has a 5.78% yield (i.e. its $1.26 annual dividend divided by today’s price of $21.79).
Now, keep in mind that the mean yield of 5.5% over the last 10 years is just that — an average of the high yields and low yields during that period. There will be periods of extended high yield and vice versa.
For example, when there was no pandemic in 2019, the dividend yield average was 5.4%, according to Seeking Alpha. So, if we were to use that as a yardstick, BP is still worth $23.33. That is found by dividing the annual dividend of $1.26 by 5.4%.
And don’t forget, the yield could overshoot on the low side. For example, even if investors in BP stock became more energized, the yield might reach 5%. I don’t believe it would go lower than that unless the price of oil rose or the company decided to raise the dividend.
Therefore, at a yield of 5%, BP stock would be worth as much as $25.20. That represents a potential gain of 15.6% from today’s price.

Financial Recovery in the Third Quarter
In Q3 of 2020, BP produced positive cash flow from operations of $5.3 billion, excluding its Gulf of Mexico oil spill payments. After organic capital expenditure (capex) of $2.5 billion and inorganic capex of $1.1 billion, its free cash flow was about $1.7 billion.
That is more than enough to pay the quarterly dividend, which costs about $1.06 billion each quarter (Page 16). Moreover, this performance was better than what occurred in Q2 at the height of the pandemic.
At the time when I wrote my article, I said that the company would easily be able to afford the dividend. Now with the Q3 results, it is clear that there is room to even increase it.
However, it seems that BP wants to reduce debt first. For example, the company was able to lower its net debt to about $40 billion in Q3. However, the energy firm has said it needs to get that down to $35 billion (Page 2).
I suspect that could occur by the end of Q4 — if the company has a similar cash flow experience to Q3. And so far, the price of oil seems to be higher. BP said in the earnings presentation that its breakeven cash flow point is $42 per barrel of oil. Right now, the price is a good deal higher than that.
What To Do With BP
Given its performance, I believe that BP will likely consider raising its dividend by the middle or end of Q1 2021. But until then, I think BP stock could stay within 15% of its present price.
However — assuming they hike the dividend up by half of what they cut earlier this year — the dividend would be $1.89 per ADR. Therefore, with a 5.5% dividend yield, the potential price target could be $34.36 per share.
That represents a potential upside of over 50% above today’s price. But don’t expect that to happen until the price of oil increases BP’s cash flow and allows it raise the dividend as well as pay down debt.

""We took advantage of a situation of sugar prices going up in New York at the same time as the local currency was falling strongly, that is pretty rare,"" Consul said, adding that average prices for 2021 are 10% above the previous year, while prices for 2022 are 8% higher than 2021."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-bunge-joint-venture-capitalizes-184050300.html?.tsrc=rss

Walloped by an oil price war, slammed by a precipitous drop in demand thanks to the novel coronavirus pandemic, then caught up in a stock market crash, BP stock fell off a cliff.
Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com
	
After a brief post-crash bounce, BP shares continued to slide through the spring, summer, and fall. By the end of October, they dropped lower than at the worst of the March market crash. However, in the past several weeks, BP stock has begun to move the other direction. 
Is it time to rethink this stock? It’s put together a 23% gain since closing at $14.90 on October 28 — its lowest level since 1995. A coronavirus vaccine is imminent, bringing the possibility of a return to normal. Is now the time to snap up BP shares in anticipation of a recovery?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Some investment analysts think so, but I’m not convinced. BP itself is wary of a future for fossil fuels and that doesn’t exactly fill me with optimism in the company as an investment opportunity.
Why Did BP Stock Begin to Climb at the End of October?
Multiple factors combined to kick off a rally in BP stock that began after it hit that record low on October 28. 


					7 Retail Stocks That Will Benefit From 2020’s Holiday Shopping Season				

Several days before, the company reported third quarter earnings and beat expectations with a small $100 million profit. That was far more palatable than the $6.7 billion loss for Q2. It brought hope that the worst is over.
In addition, the company announced a new green hydrogen project for the North Sea. The news of a coronavirus vaccine nearing production also stoked hopes of workers returning to commuting and travel resuming — with a corresponding rise in oil demand.
Lower Oil and Gas Demand Likely to be the New Normal
The coronavirus pandemic gutted world oil and gas demand, along with prices. With employees working from home, cars remained in driveways. Planes were grounded. As a result, in April fleets of oil tankers were anchored offshore with nowhere to unload tens of millions of barrels of unwanted oil.
Demand began to recover through the year, but 2020 has been a year of reckoning for oil and gas companies. Reduced demand — from a combination of idled vehicles and the growing popularity of electric cars — will be the new normal. BP itself says 2019 was likely the year of peak oil demand.

The company is projecting a decline in fossil fuel demand over the next 30 years. The recognition that its products face decades of declining demand is not exactly good news for BP stock investors.
BP Wants to Transform to a Net Zero-Carbon Company
To its credit, BP has read the tea leaves and sees fossil fuels as a dead end. In February, the company announced a plan to become carbon neutral by 2050. In addition, it promised to boost investment in alternative energy ventures. That includes ongoing spending on wind farm and solar power installations. Investment in alternate energy would be boosted from the current level of $500 million annually to $5 billion annually by the end of this decade. 
A lot is riding on BP’s strategy. What are the odds the oil company can actually pull this off? Bruce Usher is a business professor at Columbia University’s business school. He told the Washington Post:
The challenge as I see it is that it is almost impossible for incumbent companies to change their business models … I can’t think of a company like that in the energy business.
Bottom Line on BP Stock
Like many oil and gas stocks, BP gets an “F” rating in Portfolio Grader. There have simply been too many warning signs to ignore in 2020, from the company writing down $17.5 billion in assets, to being downgraded to the point where it’s near junk status, to slashing its dividend.
There are investment analysts who like what they see in this company. Those tracked by CNN Money have BP rated as a buy with a median $24.55 price target. 
I have to break ranks with the pack. If you already own BP shares, holding onto them certainly seems like the smart strategy. But buying BP stock now? That’s a different story. Despite its ambitious plan to transform into a net-zero-carbon company, I just don’t see BP returning to meaningful growth.

2020-11-02	2020-11-02 15:28:42	BP	BP p.l.c.	Unusual Options Activity Insight: BP	"BP (NYSE: BP) shares experienced unusual options activity on Monday. The stock price moved up to $15.68 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-04-16  * Strike Price: $16.00  * Volume: 632  * Open Interest: 3460Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Lows On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Lows On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-31	2020-10-31 00:20:58	BP	BP p.l.c.	With No Cuts Left to Make, Big Oil Sits and Waits for a Recovery	(Bloomberg) -- It was Andrew Swiger, the chief financial officer at Exxon Mobil Corp., who summarized the attitude of the whole industry after Big Oil ended reporting another dismal set of quarterly earnings: “Prices will have to rise.”After months of low oil and gas prices driven by weak demand, the world’s largest international oil companies have largely exhausted their financial defenses, leaving little room to maneuver if they’re dealt further blows. Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and BP Plc have already reduced 2021 spending probably to as much as they can.With the exception of perhaps Chevron and Total, which entered the downturn with the strongest balance sheets, leverage is approaching uncomfortable levels. Put together, Big Oil is now completely at the mercy of a worldwide rout in fuel demand that, absent a Covid-19 vaccine, shows no signs of abating, as well as OPEC+ leaders Saudi Arabia and Russia.“I will say that a lot of the performance of the company today, but also in the future, will depend on the macro environment that we will be enjoying or suffering as the case may be,” said Ben van Beurden, chief executive officer of Shell.Brent crude closed this week below $38 a barrel, bringing the year’s decline to 43%. At such levels, the industry is underinvesting in supply to such an extent that shortages are inevitable in the future, which means higher prices, Exxon’s Swiger argued. But a price recovery relies on two other things: higher demand and OPEC+ holding the line on production curbs, underpinned by the often uncomfortable alliance between Russia and Saudi Arabia.With U.S. Covid-19 cases hitting a record this week and new lockdowns looming across Europe, the virus and its impact on petroleum demand show no sign of abating. And for all the brainstorming of executives from Dallas to Paris, the oil supermajors account for less than 15% of pre-pandemic global oil demand. If supply discipline is to succeed, the heavyweight national oil producers will have to work together, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and President Vladimir Putin must continue to get along.One bright spot is U.S. shale production, which is in free all after a decade-long, debt-fueled surge that surprised the supermajors and loosened OPEC’s power over the oil market. Executives at some of the biggest U.S. independent oil producers believe America may never return to peak production seen earlier this year, and that further declines are likely in 2021.Big Oil CEOs can do little to foster geopolitical cooperation, but for the last six months they have been pulling all the levers they can to stop the bleeding of cash. Or in corporate jargon, they have focused on self-help: Curtailing unprofitable production, reducing spending and future investment, and firing tens of thousands of employees.Exxon is paradigmatic of the trouble the supermajors are in. A year ago, the Texas-based company was targeting 2021 capital expenditure of as much as $35 billion; now, it’s planning to spend half that. It announced this week it will reduce its staff and contractors by 15%, or 14,000 people, by 2022. Even then, Exxon is spending more than it’s earning, with capital and dividend outlays consuming all its cash from operations.Many in the market think the situation is unsustainable, and if prices don’t rise, Exxon will have to cave and cut the dividend for the first time in more than four decades. “The message is clear: Equity needs the protection of higher oil prices,” said Alastair Syme, a London-based analyst at Citigroup Inc.Shell and BP cut their dividends earlier this year but are still weighed down by high debt levels. Shell outlined an intention to increase the payout this week. Still, that would need higher oil prices, and take decades of small hikes to reach prior levels.Cost cutting appeared to bear fruit in the third quarter, with four of the five large Western majors posting profits on an adjusted basis. But they can only cut so far.Regaining RelevancyChevron, for example, plans to invest just $14 billion next year, even after recently buying Noble Energy Inc. That’s not far above the $10 billion level that the company has historically said is the minimum to sustain production. CFO Pierre Breber said the company would let oil volumes drop if it made financial sense. “We’re not trying to sustain short-term production,” he said.The question is not will Big Oil survive but whether it can still make investors care. BP and Shell are no longer the dividend linchpins of European stock markets. Exxon, the profit powerhouse that dominated the top spot on the S&P 500 Index for years, now ranks outside the top 50. Energy is now worth about 2% of the S&P 500 Index, making it a rounding error in many generalist fund managers’ portfolios.“Making energy relevant and investable again is the million dollar question,” said Jennifer Rowland, a St. Louis-based analyst at Edward Jones. “They’re still trying to figure that out.”For Rowland, having a compelling strategy in a low-carbon future is key. While that hands an advantage to the Europeans, who are pledging net zero emissions by mid-century, unlike Exxon and Chevron, BP and Shell still need a recovery in their traditional businesses to fund the move, Rowland said. With less cash, a green pivot becomes more difficult.Exxon’s Swiger is convinced that prices will recover. Things are so bad that prices across oil, refining and chemicals are “at or significantly below bottom of the cycle conditions,” he said. Whether Big Oil investors are willing to wait for that forecast to come true remains to be seen.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/no-cuts-left-big-oil-002058186.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-10-30	2020-10-30 16:47:15	BP	BP p.l.c.	Amid An Oil Industry Slide, BP Stands for Bad Play	"For investors, the presidential debates made it clear that stocks reliant on fossil fuels for financial health face at best an uncertain future. In the case of BP plc (NYSE:BP), you have to wonder whether there’s at least some short-term daylight. One would hope BP stock is an outlier, given how the energy sector is taking a drubbing of historic proportions.

Judged by the company BP keeps, things don’t look so hot. Recently, I’ve written about how Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) are wallowing in investment sludge thicker than sweet crude. (Maybe sour crude is more like it.)
Drilling down, if you will, BP stock must be viewed in the context of its sector and then as a company in its own right. Where does it stand as gushers or dry rigs go? Most investors would settle for a steady profit flow from the well. Here’s my assessment of the petroleum behemoth. Spoiler alert: It ain’t good.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
BP Stock and a Beat-Up Sector
Sector health for individual companies is a non-negotiable as energy stocks go, BP stock included. And the news most definitely has been miserable at the retail end. The average price of a gallon of gas in mid-September fell two consecutive weeks to $2.17, according to GasBuddy.
7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy for the Second Wave
Fast forward and the numbers moved backward. By Oct. 26, gas prices recorded their fourth straight week of decline, galumphing along at $2.14. Adjusted for inflation, that would’ve been $1.97 back in 2016, which was the last time many consumers paid $3 a gallon.
How has BP stock fared in the midst of this? Meh at best. For 2020, it’s off 61%. Recalibrated in light of the novel coronavirus funk that ripped through much of Wall Street, BP is off 7% since mid-March. Here again, sector woes have played a role. Energy stocks sagged the week of Oct. 26, this time amid fears that the current spike in Covid-19 cases will sap demand.
Pumping Pain, Even With Gain
Now let’s examine BP stock news in particular. Does it offer a glimmer of hope or the bummer of nope? Here, the story is mixed. Yes, BP outperformed analyst projections for the third quarter of 2020, making $86 million as opposed to losing $120 million. But as good news goes, it was a punchbowl full of tepid, curdled milk. Echoing concerns over the Covid-19 pandemic that have rocked the broader energy market, BP warned on Oct. 27 that it would slash 10,000 jobs globally.
Thus, the profits failed to boost share prices; in fact, BP stock lost 5% over Oct. 27 and 28, landing at a share price of $14.88. The market likely factored in that year over year, quarterly profits sank from $2.3 billion.
One bright spot could transform BP’s prospects over the long haul. The company plans to move into alternative energy sources such as offshore wind and hydrogen, CEO Bernard Looney said. But that in large part represents a reaction rather than a vision. Here’s why I think so.

BP Needs to Tap New Energy Sources
The reality facing BP stock is more than dire. As the Guardian reports, “BP’s energy economists have said demand for oil may never recover after the pandemic [my emphasis], which has taken a heavy toll on transport industries, and may be on the brink of an unprecedented decades-long decline.”
Assuming that the demand for oil hits said decline, what does that mean for a company that lives and breathes, fails or succeeds, based on petroleum prices? Don’t take my word for it: You just heard it straight from the mouths of BP’s economists. It more than makes the case when representatives of the energy company you’re writing about render a verdict with more authority than investment experts can.
As for whether you should expend your energy of chasing BP stock, well, I think you know by now how I feel. Don’t. Long term, oil isn’t the energy future of an imperiled planet. Short term, oil prices have hit the skids. Somewhere in between, those prices are likely to never recover.
Only when viewed through the lens of conquering alternative energy sources, and marketing them effectively, does BP stock or any investment in the sector stand a chance.

Even After Its Dividend Cut, BP Stock  Looks Like a Great Buy Here	"BP (NYSE:BP) has released a litany of bad news, including dividend cuts, massive operating losses, and a controversial change in its business strategy going forward. The oil and gas giant recently reached its lowest point in more than 25 years. Investors in BP stock have gotten drilled.

With all that in mind, understandably, many investors are giving up. Why not take the year-end tax loss and put the funds back into something that isn’t on such a massive losing streak?
Before you throw in the towel on BP stock, here are a few redeeming factors to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
First, BP just announced its Q3 results on Tuesday. These were a huge improvement from Q2.
You may remember that last quarter, BP lost a massive sum of money. For Q3, however, BP actually managed to eke out a small profit. That topped expectations of another quarterly loss. While the business remains weak overall, there were pockets of strength in some areas such as fuel marketing that helped the company get back on track.


					7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy for the Second Wave				

There’s a lot more here than just a modest upturn in near-term earnings however. What’s really going to drive BP stock is that management is making fundamental changes to the business.
Changing Business Model and BP Stock
Back in the day, BP used to be called British Petroleum. For awhile, this led to the tagline “Beyond Petroleum” as the company sought to seize the climate change high ground early. This new strategic direction fell flat, however, after the Deepwater Horizon disaster caused BP unbelievable harm as a brand and company.
Now, however, a decade later, it appears BP is finally ready to make Beyond Petroleum a reality. The company has announced an ambitious effort to become a zero net emissions firm by the year 2050.
This is pretty incredible when you stop and think about it; a long-time oil and gas company is planning to stop emitting carbon into the atmosphere. So is BP going extinct? Not so fast.
Instead, BP plans to invest heavily in sustainable energy as well. It is focusing on green energy production, such as via wind farms. It will also invest heavily in convenience stores, charging stations, and other pieces of the logistics that get fuel and electricity to consumers.
Conversely, BP will greatly throttle back investments in traditional oil and gas. With sufficient green energy creation, on balance, BP intends to get to a point of having no net negative effect on carbon emissions or climate change.
Will it work? We simply don’t know. An oil and gas major of BP’s size has never managed this sort of transition before. However, let’s be clear in saying that BP’s existing business plan certainly hasn’t been working in recent years. It may well be worth the shot of doing something daring like this ahead of its other energy company rivals.
The Dividend Cut
While BP has made plenty of news recently, its decision to slash the dividend has generated the most headlines. Investors have long owned the energy majors for safe reliable dividend streams. And, at least until 2015 or so, they delivered on that promise.
Since then, however, prolonged low oil prices have forced painful decisions across the industry.
BP joined in that trend in August. At that point, it cut the dividend in half, with a new payout of $1.26 per share per year. This was a crushing blow for retirees and income investors who rely on BP for dividends.
The good news, however, is that in the context of BP’s depressed share price, this is actually still a generous yield. For people investing in BP stock today, the newly-trimmed dividend still offers an 8% yield. That’s cold comfort for long-time shareholders, but it’s a juicy offer for people that have confidence in BP’s new business direction.
Furthermore, with the cash it saves, BP has a reasonable plan. It first intends to shore up its balance sheet and maintain a strong investment grade rating. Once that mission is complete, BP will begin a large share repurchase program. Given that BP stock was at $45 in prior years, gobbling up shares down here under $20 each could offer tremendous value on the company’s capital.
BP Stock Verdict
It’s going to be a long road to recovery for BP. Particularly with the company adapting to a new business model, this will not be an overnight comeback.
However, management has taken the right steps. It admitted that the old course wasn’t working and has made big moves such as the dividend cut and changes in investments going forward to chart a new direction. This won’t fix everything for BP immediately. But with the stock at its lowest level since the mid-1990s, you don’t need much to go right from here for shares to rally.

Coronavirus, consolidation taking toll on energy jobs	Oil and gas companies worldwide are taking an axe to their employment rolls, shedding workers to survive what is expected to be a prolonged stretch of weak demand.  Exxon Mobil Corp said it will cut its workforce by 15%, or about 14,000 people, along with oil majors Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.  All told, more than 400,000 oil and gas sector jobs have been cut this year, according to Rystad Energy, with about half of those in the United States, where several big exploration companies and most large oil service companies are headquartered.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-consolidation-taking-toll-energy-050000288.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Pulls Plug on Australia Refinery as Asian Competition Bites	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc will cease fuel production at its 65-year-old Kwinana refinery in Western Australia, citing low margins and tough competition from Asia, and will transition the facility into an import terminal.The U.K. company’s move will leave Australia with just three remaining refineries, with the future of those also in doubt after the demand destruction caused by Covid-19 hit an industry already struggling to stay profitable. The government in September announced a package of measures to support the refiners, including a potential production payment to recognize their strategic role in supporting the nation’s fuel security.“The continued growth of large-scale, export-oriented refineries throughout Asia and the Middle East has structurally changed the Australian market,” said BP’s Australia country head Frédéric Baudry in a media statement. “Regional oversupply and sustained low refining margins mean the Kwinana refinery is no longer economically viable.”Converting to an import terminal would help to ensure ongoing security of fuel supply for Western Australia, Baudry said, although the transition will come at a cost to the local workforce. Kwinana employs around 650 permanent staff and contractors, while the import facility is expected to support about 60 jobs.Refining activities will wind down over the next six months, while construction work on the import terminal is expected to go to 2022. BP is exploring further options for the site including a clean energy hub that could produce and store lower carbon fuels.Ampol Ltd.’s Lytton refinery in Queensland and Viva Energy Group Ltd.’s Geelong facility are on review for potential closure, while Viva is also exploring options to locate an import terminal at the Geelong site. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil Corp. said in September that market over-supply exacerbated by the pandemic has seen its Altona refinery operate at a loss, according to a report in the Australian newspaper.Energy Minister Angus Taylor said in a statement that he was “deeply disappointed” by BP’s decision, adding that its closure would not negatively impact Australia’s fuel supplies.“We will ensure Australia maintains a sovereign refining capability to support local industry,” Taylor said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-pulls-plug-australia-refinery-035754541.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Narrowly Avoids Third-Quarter Loss	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc used a surprise third-quarter profit to reassure investors that it was on the road to recovery, while also warning that it would be a long journey.BP has had a turbulent few months. The company cut its dividend for the first time in a decade and its share price plunged to a 25-year low after Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney announced a companywide overhaul toward greener energy. It also plans to cut 10,000 jobs.However, the company defied analyst expectations to eke out a small profit, as a rebound in earnings from fuel marketing offset “extremely weak” refining margins. While it’s positive news after a year of multibillion dollar write-offs and record low oil prices, it points to a slow recovery in a world where demand is still at the mercy of the coronavirus pandemic.“This is going to be a quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year slog and I’m sure we will prevail,” Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss said in an interview with Bloomberg.BP shares set yet another multi-decade low on Tuesday, closing down 2.1% at 195.74 pence, the lowest since 1994.While crude prices have recovered from historic lows seen in April, BP’s profit was down 96% from a year earlier as restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus in Europe and the U.S. kept fuel demand at bay. The company warned of a “volatile and challenging trading environment” where “the shape and pace of the recovery is uncertain.”Consumable BoostDespite volumes of fuel being sold in the company’s marketing business being down 15% compared to last year, the unit had its best quarter in seven quarters, Auchincloss said. “People are buying more consumables at our sites.”Another positive sign for BP was a drop in net debt to $40.4 billion at the end of the third quarter, down from $46.5 billion a year earlier. After cutting the dividend in August, reducing debt is necessary to give investors confidence that the payout is now sustainable.“Funding the dividend remains our first priority and we are confident in moving toward our $35 billion net-debt target,” Auchincloss said in a statement released earlier.Once net debt reaches that threshold, BP will be able to begin share buybacks, which Auchincloss said could happen between the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. However, the CFO added that buybacks redirecting capital expenditure into its low-carbon business remains higher up in the priority list.BP reported an adjusted net income of $86 million for the third quarter, down from $2.25 billion a year earlier. That’s an improvement from the second quarter, when the company posted a $6.68 billion loss.BP’s trading division, which last quarter brought in “exceptionally strong results,” wasn’t able to cushion the blow this time around. With a less volatile market and fewer opportunities for so-called contango plays -- a trade that profits from buying and storing oil during a glut -- the unit’s earnings were “significantly lower,” the company said. “It’s hard to replicate 2Q,” Auchincloss said in an interview with Bloomberg, adding that gas trading had performed better than average, while oil “slightly” below.Other oil majors, who report later this week, have already told investors they experienced the same headwinds as BP. “Refining margins are absolutely terrible,” Patrick Pouyanne, Total SE’s chief executive officer, said earlier this month. Royal Dutch Shell Plc warned that its trading performance will be “below average” in the third quarter.Despite BP’s better-than-expected third-quarter performance, some of those other companies still offer a better balance of risk and reward for investors, RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note. Shell in particular has a core business that generates more cash and a dividend that should grow over time, he said.Shares for BP slid to 199.28 pence at 12:40 p.m. in London, while the firms market capitalization tumbled to below $40.4 billion. But Auchincloss remains convinced that the stable results puts BP on the right trajectory for the future.(Updates with share price in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-narrowly-avoids-third-quarter-071539817.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Is Said to Mull Sale of Stake in Constellation Oilfield	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc is weighing a sale of its majority stake in the Constellation oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico, according to people familiar with the matter, as it pushes ahead with a divestment program.The oil exploration and production giant has reached out to potential buyers of the deepwater asset, which could achieve a value of around $200 million in any sale, the people said, asking not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.The field is expected to attract interest from closely held peers and larger corporations, according to the people. A representative for BP declined to comment.A sale would form a small part of BP Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney’s plan to divest $25 billion in assets by 2025 to cut debt and transform the company into a clean-energy giant. BP is also in discussions about a sale of a roughly 10% stake in a key gas field in Oman, Bloomberg News reported in June. Investors have so far remained skeptical of the plans, with BP’s stock down 58% this year through Wednesday, giving it a market value of 40 billion pounds ($52 billion).The Gulf of Mexico has emerged as a source of stability and a steady source of cash-flow during this year’s oil-price rout, in contrast to the previous six years when the offshore region was overlooked by many companies in favor of shale.BP owns 66.7% of the Constellation field, which produces about 10,000 barrels a day, according to its website. The remainder is held by operator Occidental Petroleum Corp., which inherited it through its $37 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. last year. Occidental has so far held onto the former Anadarko Gulf assets, even as it’s been aggressively trying to sell elsewhere to raise money and pay down debt.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-said-mull-sale-stake-142421056.html?.tsrc=rss

However, U.S.-based equity income investors have experienced a high degree of volatility in recent years. In our view, investing in international income stocks is one way to increase portfolio diversification while reducing sensitivity to volatile U.S interest rates. Investing in overseas stocks carries its own set of risks, including the impact of currency exchange and geopolitical turmoil. But there are also a number of positives in this segment for U.S. investors. One is a more robust selection of high-quality names. Yields also tend to be higher in overseas markets in general.

2020-10-07	2020-10-07 07:55:16	BP	BP p.l.c.	Fossil Fuel Firms Not Doing Enough on Emissions, Funds Say	(Bloomberg) -- None of Europe’s largest oil, gas and coal companies are on track to limit global warming to within 2 degrees Celsius, according to a report by money managers overseeing more than $22 trillion.Energy and mining companies have been under increasing pressure, from both environmental groups and their own investors, to demonstrate how their business models align with the Paris climate agreement and to show they’re taking action to curb their emissions.Only seven out of 59 companies studied -- Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Repsol SA, Total SE, Eni SpA, Glencore Plc, Anglo American Plc and Equinor ASA -- have set emissions reduction targets in line with pledges made in the Paris Agreement, according to a report by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The TPI is a global program based at the London School of Economics, which assesses climate risks and companies’ preparedness for a low-carbon economy.However, even these so-called Paris Pledges will still leave the world heading for 3.2 degrees Celsius of warming, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.Just three oil and gas companies studied -- Shell, Total and Eni -- are approaching a 2 degree Celsius pathway “but still need further measures to be assessed to align with this benchmark,” the TPI said in a statement.“We’re seeing a direction of travel that is going toward decarbonization that is really positive,” Bill Hartnett, stewardship director at Aberdeen Standard Investments said in an interview. “However, there is a lot of devil in the detail.” The asset manager, which is a funding partner for TPI, sees the report as providing a framework to allow it to engage with fossil fuel companies so that net zero ambitions can be formalized into commitments or targets over time, Hartnett said.“We need to look at the detail of this report, but we are pleased that the TPI recognizes both the leading nature of our ambition and that we are aligned with the emissions reduction pledges of the Paris Agreement,” a Shell spokeswoman said. “We continue to engage with TPI over their methodology so that hopefully their models will in future be able to show how Shell’s ambition to be a net zero emissions energy business by 2050 is aligned with society’s move toward the 1.5 degrees goal of Paris.”London-based BP Plc’s emissions are seen steadily declining over the next three decades. However, they’re still expected to remain above what’s needed to comply with the Paris Agreement, despite the company unveiling further details of its climate goals last month. BP said it hadn’t seen the full report and didn’t know if TPI’s analysis reflected its new strategy announced in August and September. The oil major said it believed its net-zero ambitions set it on a path consistent with the Paris goals.BP aims to eliminate all net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. However the company isn’t aligned with any of the Paris benchmarks because its climate target does not cover traded products, according to Valentin Jahn, research associate for TPI, part of the specialist team at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. These comprised more than half of its externally sold energy in 2019, Valentin said.Glencore declined to comment on the report. The company said in February it would cut so-called scope 3 emissions -- those generated by their consumers -- by 30% over the next 15 years. Anglo American said it was committed to responding to climate change and that it aimed to be carbon neutral across its operations by 2040.Equinor announced this year it would eliminate emissions from its global operations by 2030 and would reduce the carbon intensity of its products by at least half by 2050. “We believe the measures demonstrate that our company is acting in line with the Paris ambitions and our plans are more ambitious than in most jurisdictions,” an Equinor spokesman said.Repsol said it was firmly committed to becoming a “net-zero emissions company” and that it would “continue to engage with TPI to demonstrate our progress in this respect.”“We are pleased to see that TPI, in its most recent report, has given Eni a top evaluation,” an Eni spokesperson said. “In the pathway to keep the temperature increase to 2 degrees or below, we consider that the best way for companies to align with such goal is to set absolute emissions targets.”Total said it supports the goals of the Paris accord and that its ambition is to be carbon-neutral by 2050. The French energy company says it has already reduced its average carbon-intensity of the energy products it sells by 6% since 2015.Transatlantic DivideThe research also highlights the growing divide between European and North American companies’ approaches toward mitigating climate change. Neither of the two U.S. oil giants, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., have overarching emissions goals.On the contrary, Exxon Mobil has been planning to increase annual carbon-dioxide emissions by as much as the output of the entire nation of Greece, an analysis of internal documents reviewed by Bloomberg shows.“There has been some movement, with seven European companies now aligned with the Paris pledges, and Shell, Total and Eni getting close to meeting the 2°C benchmark,” TPI co-chair Adam Matthews said. “But U.S. fossil fuel giants have yet to take meaningful action to reduce their emissions and the gap with their European peers is stark.”Utilities ProgressUtilities are making better progress on curbing emissions than oil, gas and coal producers. According to the TPI, 39 of 66 firms analyzed are already aligned with the Paris pledges, while a third are on track to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by 2050, the study showed.“The electricity sector is heavily regulated with regards to its emissions in some regions such as the EU,” said Professor Simon Dietz, one of the authors of the report. “More broadly, the technologies needed for decarbonizing electricity production are already there and often competitive on cost with fossil fuels, so the core business model is not under threat.”(Adds BP, Total comments from eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fossil-fuel-firms-not-doing-075516699.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-25	2020-09-25 07:47:07	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP Hits 25-Year Low a Week After Unveiling Climate Strategy	(Bloomberg) -- Just a week after revealing its plan to turn itself into a clean-energy giant, BP Plc watched its share price drop to a 25-year low.Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney and his new management team gave more than 10 hours of presentations over three days last week, in a bid to show the world that the oil and gas giant could adapt to a low-carbon future without sacrificing returns.The company’s shares closed in London on Thursday at 232.4 pence, the lowest level since October 1995. While falling crude prices and fears of the second wave of the coronavirus haven’t help BP, the slide suggests shareholders weren’t convinced by Looney’s pitch.“Investors remain skeptical,” said Mirza Baig, Global Head of Governance at Aviva Investors. “Particularly as this move is being forced on the company by climate change.”Looney took over as CEO in February, but the so-called “BP Week” this month was his big moment, designed to put flesh on the bones of a bold plan to become a “net-zero” energy company by 2050. It was also an opportunity to persuade shareholders to stick with BP after the company slashed its dividend by half in August.“What investors are looking for with companies, when they announce big strategic changes of direction of any sort, is compelling answers to three questions: The what, the why and the how?” said Nick Stansbury, a fund manager at Legal & General Group Plc.BP’s European peers are also trying to answer the same questions, with varying degrees of success. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which also made a deep cut to its dividend this year, is barely trading above the post-pandemic share price low reached in March. Total SA has so far done a better job of maintaining investor confidence in its energy-transition plan.At the heart of BP’s reinvention is a reduction in oil and gas production and simultaneous growth in its renewables business. Looney promised investors he could do this while delivering returns of 8% to 10%. That’s not as high as the double-digit returns oil developments can sometimes bring in, but greater than many clean-energy projects.Looney said BP will take advantage of its experience, integration, low borrowing costs and trading prowess, but the market is likely to remain skeptical until such returns can be demonstrated in practice, analysts at Redburn wrote in a research note.“BP’s challenge lies in the building up of its skill set in renewable energy solutions and a competitive advantage in its chosen areas that allows investors to believe they can deliver attractive financial returns from the capital allocated,” said Aviva’s Baig, who strongly supported the company’s net-zero ambition.Doubts about Big Oil’s ability to maintain returns as the world shifts away from fossil fuels are reflected in companies’ dividend yields. The measures have been climbing steadily for both BP and Shell, suggesting shareholders aren’t confident the payouts can be maintained even after they were cut sharply earlier this year.Investors don’t appear to be any more confident that sticking to oil and gas is a safe bet. Exxon Mobil Corp., the U.S. giant that shows little intention of transitioning to renewable energy and is still pumping huge amounts of money into hydrocarbon projects, has the highest dividend yield of all.Getting BP into a position where it can deliver profits from large-scale renewable energy projects will require lots of upfront spending. The company made a $1.1 billion splash in offshore wind earlier this month, buying a stake in developments owned by fellow oil giant Equinor ASA. The near-term milestones laid out last week suggests that more deals will follow.“For BP to meet its low-carbon target of 50 gigawatts of renewable generation capacity by 2030, considerable growth is required over the coming years,” said Stuart Lamont, an investment manager at Brewin Dolphin Holdings Plc. “This will require discipline from the company, ensuring a delicate balance between working toward decarbonization targets while achieving attractive returns for shareholders.”(Updates with comparison to peers in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-drops-25-low-week-172458895.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-23	2020-09-23 18:27:27	BP	BP p.l.c.	Nikola Held Talks with BP on Hydrogen Fuel Network	(Bloomberg) -- Nikola Corp. was in advanced talks with BP Plc over a partnership to build hydrogen fuel stations shortly before a short-seller report raised allegations about the startup’s credibility and capabilities, according to people familiar with the matter.The companies had an agreement in principle to collaborate on the project for a hydrogen fuel network, which would undergird a plan by Nikola to lease fuel cell-powered trucks, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information.Nikola hoped to announce the deal with the oil major just days after publicizing a separate partnership with General Motors Co. to make a battery-powered pickup truck, one of the people said. Representatives for BP and Nikola declined to comment.Shares of Nikola fell by as much as 20% on Wednesday. They were down 19% to $22.96 as of 2:21 p.m. in New York -- well below its price after going public in June through a reverse merger.Investors have been confused at times by Nikola’s business model and evolving list of projects -- from electric and fuel-cell semi trucks to a pickup to being a maker and distributor of hydrogen. But hydrogen infrastructure is a large part of the company’s value proposition, according to executives’ statements and a presentation to investors in April.Nikola plans to bundle the cost of hydrogen fuel and maintenance with its fuel-cell semi trucks as part of a seven-year or 700,000-mile lease. To achieve this, Nikola aims to build a network of 700 fueling stations across North America in the next eight to 10 years, according to a filing in March.A deal could still happen as the startup, whose stock has collapsed after reports of regulatory probes and claims of deception, had a stated ambition of announcing a hydrogen partner by the end of this year. Nikola has denied misleading investors.Nikola’s talks with BP were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Nikola executives have said the company’s assumed cost of producing hydrogen, which it claims will be $2.47 per kilogram, is based on its ability to buy renewable electricity -- solar, wind, hydroelectric -- at wholesale rates from utilities or energy partners.The Phoenix-based company has an agreement with Nel ASA to provide the electrolysis and fueling equipment, and it reconfirmed recently it’s seeking partners for construction and operation of the stations themselves. Executives said during Nikola’s Aug. 4 earnings call they will announce a partner this year. Production of the fuel-cell semi trucks is slated to start in 2023 at Nikola’s Coolidge, Arizona, plant, which is under construction.(Updates stock price in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nikola-held-talks-bp-hydrogen-161634245.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Lifts Veil of Secrecy on Big Oil Trading Profits	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc offered a glimpse of the profitability of its huge and secretive trading arm, suggesting it makes annual returns of as much as $2.5 billion.The revelation, which came during presentations this week about the company’s clean-energy plans, follows the emergence of trading in the first half of the year as one of the few bright spots for BP and its peers. The operations brought a torrent of cash that partly offset the impact of the coronavirus crisis on oil prices and energy demand.BP’s in-house trading business has a “long track record” of boosting the company’s return on average capital employed by “close to” 2 percentage points, according to Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney.Unlike the closely guarded trading profit, the company does disclose the average capital it employs each year. From 2015 to 2019, that figure was $124.2 billion a year, according to last year’s annual report. That suggests a 2% uplift to the RoACE equates to about $2.5 billion. That’s more than Vitol Group made in 2019, which was a record year for the company.BP doesn’t disclose the profits of its trading unit and declined to comment on questions from Bloomberg News about this calculation.The major published the figure this week as part of its bid to convince investors that its trading unit can help boost returns for less-profitable renewables. Trading, access to low-cost funding and integration are some ways that the company thinks it can achieve 8% to 10% returns across its renewables portfolio. “We actually believe we can do better, and these returns could turn out to be conservative,” Looney said.Major TraderAlthough better known for its oil fields, refineries and fuel stations, BP is one of the world’s largest commodity traders. Alongside rivals Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SE, it bets its own money on the ups and downs of the global oil and natural gas markets.The company said it traded just under 11 million barrels a day of crude oil last year, more than the best-known names of the commodity trading industry such as Vitol, Trafigura Group and Glencore Plc.Historically, the three major oil companies have disclosed as little as possible about how their traders make money. When investors earlier this year asked Total about the profitability of its trading business, CEO Patrick Pouyanne responded: “Oil trading is a secret.”The companies’ trading operations exploited wild price moves this year created by the pandemic. BP, for example, highlighted “exceptionally strong results” in its trading arm during the second quarter, while Shell’s equivalent division enjoyed record profits.(Adds CEO quotes, and Vitol returns details from 3rd paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-lifts-veil-secrecy-big-040000301.html?.tsrc=rss

Microsoft, BP Join Forces To Drive Digital Energy And Net Zero Carbon Goals	Microsoft and British oil giant BP have entered into a strategic partnership to digitize energy systems and accelerate net zero carbon goals set by both companies.As part of the collaboration, Microsoft (MSFT) will deploy its Azure cloud-based solution for BP infrastructure and in turn BP will supply renewable energy to help the tech giant meet its 2025 renewable energy goals.“BP shares our vision for a net zero carbon future, and we are committed to working together to drive reductions in carbon emissions and fulfil demand with new renewable energy sources,” said Microsoft’s Judson Althoff. “A strategic partnership such as this enables each organization to bring its unique expertise for industry-leading change and the potential to positively impact billions of lives around the world.”Earlier this year, BP (BP) announced its goal to become a net zero emissions company by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world reach net zero levels. By the end of the decade, the company seeks to develop around 50 gigawatts of net renewable generating capacity – a 20-fold increase on what it has previously developed, increase annual low carbon investment 10-fold to around $5 billion and cut oil and gas production by 40%.Meanwhile Microsoft in January set out a target to be carbon negative by 2030 and remove more carbon from the environment than it has emitted since its founding by 2050.As part of the partnership, Microsoft and BP have signed a framework agreement for renewable energy projects that aims to provide renewable energy to help power Microsoft’s datacentres. As such, BP will supply renewable energy to Microsoft across multiple countries and regions including the US, Europe and Latin America. The agreement is targeted to help Microsoft’s reach its 100% renewable energy goal by 2025.Shares in Microsoft have gained about 30% so far this year as the tech giant continues to benefit from increased demand for remote services and cloud solutions during the coronavirus pandemic. (See Microsoft stock analysis on TipRanks)In a bullish outlook, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss last week raised his price target to $245 (19% upside potential) from $230 and reiterated a Buy rating, saying that he sees room for a 10+% quarterly dividend increase in the coming weeks to 56 cents per share from 51 cents.&quot;Combined with mid-teens EPS growth, the supports [Microsoft's] premium total return profile, a durable and attractive level in uncertain times,&quot; Weiss wrote in a note to investors adding that Microsoft historically announces dividend hikes in mid-September.Overall, Wall Street analysts have a bullish outlook on the stock.

2020-09-15	2020-09-15 04:01:54	BP	BP p.l.c.	Big Oil Goes Looking for a Career Change	(Bloomberg) -- For most of the past century, Big Oil executives found it pretty easy to explain to investors how their businesses worked. Just locate more of the commodities that everyone needed, extract and process them as cheaply as possible, and watch the profits flow.That’s all over now. The change has been so profound that the chief executive officer of BP Plc recently found himself hyping the profit potential of another commodity. “People may not know—BP sells coffee. We sold 150 million cups of coffee last year,” Bernard Looney said in an interview in August, referring to beverage kiosks attached to the company’s fuel stations. “This is a very strong business. It’s a growth business.”Perhaps it was tongue-in-cheek, or a way for the leader of the world’s fifth-largest international oil company to emphasize a relationship with consumers. But it’s clear Looney and other oil bosses are struggling to sell their plans for a future in which the world wants more green energy. Last year, for the first time in history, solar and wind made up most of the world’s new power sources, according to BloombergNEF. If the margins on cappuccinos look good right now, that’s an indication of how hard it will be for Big Oil to rapidly ditch its winning formula of drilling, pumping, and refining while spending its way into renewables.“This is a time of energy transition,” says Daniel Yergin, the oil historian and vice chairman at consultant IHS Markit Ltd. “The supermajors were born of the trauma of the late 1990s,” he notes, and now “this global trauma of the pandemic will also be a decisive period.”Legacy energy companies are for the first time sketching out new strategies that in the near future—as soon as 2030, in some cases—would eliminate hydrocarbons. The industry would like everyone to believe it’s turning its back on fossil fuels for the good of the planet. After decades of denying its role in global warming, however, the reality is that Big Oil has been forced to change by green campaigners, local politicians, and pension funds.The green transition is more evident in Europe, but the same forces are hammering the industry in the U.S. In another unmistakable sign of the times, last month Exxon Mobil Corp. was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the first time since 1928. In the S&P 500, the energy sector is now the smallest component. (The mostly state-owned oil giants of the Middle East, India, and China are, for now at least, largely carrying on as before.)What is the future of Big Oil without oil? At the extreme of this approach are the pathways sketched out by BP and Italian oil group Eni SpA. These companies claim that in the next decade they will come to resemble a cross between a slimmer version of a traditional oil company and what’s today more like a utility (with, yes, a coffee-selling convenience store chain for drivers of electric vehicles). As the legacy business fades, the theory goes, investments in renewable electricity, biofuels, and EV charging points will pay off.If in the past the biggest names of the industry were known as “international oil companies,” the new jargon describes this approach as creating “integrated energy companies.” Michele Della Vigna, the top oil industry analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., expects to see oil giants attempt the same all-in strategy as before. “We believe the coming decade will see them integrating vertically in gas, already evident, and in power,” he says.Industry executives insist their legacy business is resilient even as they shift away from oil and natural gas, but their actions suggest otherwise. BP and Royal Dutch Shell Plc have already slashed their dividends—for Shell it was the first time in nearly 80 years. Returning profits to shareholders has long been a pillar of oil’s strength on financial markets. And those like Exxon who are keeping their shareholder payments untouched are taking on far more debt to do so.The fossil fuel industry as a whole has taken billions of dollars in writedowns, in part linked to the rise of U.S. shale production and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. If demand peaks earlier than expected, as some in the industry now fear, the most expensive and polluting oil fields such as tar sands in Canada may never be developed. The term of art for these uneconomic oil resources is stranded assets. The consultants at Rystad Energy AS estimate that 10% of the world’s recoverable oil resources—some 125 billion barrels—could become obsolete.Add it all up, and the Not-So-Big Oil of tomorrow looks greener, smaller, and nimbler—and also less profitable, more indebted, and paying lower dividends. That spells the end of a business model that hasn’t changed much since it was pioneered by John Rockefeller: Integrate oil production with refining, and market it under a single umbrella.This formula built an industry that made possible 20th century automobile culture, reshaped cities, produced political dynasties, and defined modern life. With hydrocarbons occupying a central role in the global economy, the model became a cash machine and a darling of long-only shareholders who adored its fat and predictable dividends. Oil interests became a powerful political force. The model was durable enough to survive the oil crisis of the 1970s, the rise of OPEC, wars in the Middle East, and the emergence of the ecological movement in the ’80s.When crude prices plunged in 1998 and the oil giants appeared on the brink, the industry responded in true fashion: doubling down on oil in a series of mergers that created the modern petroleum industry. The five companies that have dominated since then—Exxon, Chevron, Shell, Total, and BP—have been doing roughly the same things their predecessors did decades earlier.This time is different. The existential crisis of the ’90s taught Big Oil how to do the same but better and cheaper. In the 2020s these companies are trying to figure out how to do something completely different—renewable energy—while quickly reducing or offsetting emissions from the oil and gas they sell.“All the companies are swimming in the same water of energy transition,” says Yergin, “but they are adopting different strokes to get to the other side.”The answer from BP is far more radical than from Chevron. But even the smaller steps by American supermajors are remarkable by the standards of a conservative and slow-moving industry. Chevron’s last update to its shareholders in July highlighted an oil project, a deal to buy fuel stations, and investment in solar power. It looks like the end of an era.Which also means “past profitability is no longer a guide to the future,” says Martijn Rats, who covers the energy industry at Morgan Stanley. The writedowns and diminished dividends demonstrate “that the oil majors have entered a new phase.”Many are skeptical of the green drive in this new phase. BP promised to move “Beyond Petroleum” in the ’90s, only to return to business as usual once prices rocketed above $100 a barrel in 2008. If crude and natural gas prices rise again, these skeptics say, Big Oil will go back to basics—perhaps even under pressure from shareholders.The difference this time around is that most top oil executives are adamant there’s no going back. “Our transformation is irreversible,” says Claudio Descalzi, CEO of Eni, the sort of comment that’s widely echoed by his peers. Most senior executives simply don’t believe hydrocarbon prices will ever come back to the above-$100-a-barrel days for any sustained period. And the social, and investor, pressure to tackle climate change is unlikely to abate.And then there’s oil consumption. In BP’s long-term energy outlook, released on Sept. 14, the company acknowledged that the appetite for refined petroleum has all but peaked. “Demand for oil falls over the next 30 years,” BP wrote in its report. “The scale and pace of this decline is driven by the increasing efficiency and electrification of road transportation.”That’s why most of the industry—even Chevron—is spending billions of dollars on renewable electricity generation, particularly investments in solar and wind power. BP has pledged to generate 50 gigawatts of renewable electricity by 2030, up from 2.5GW now. Reaching that goal would mark a tremendous shift; it’s more than the renewable output of some large utilities today. But it’s still a drop in BP’s hydrocarbon bucket, even as that bucket shrinks. In 2019, BP’s oil-and-gas production was the equivalent of 2.6 million barrels per day. By 2030, the company has told investors, daily oil and gas output will drop to 1.5 million barrels. Renewables won’t fill the hole left by the missing million barrels.The question is whether Big Oil can deliver on any of its pledges and make money doing so.Paul Sankey, a veteran oil analyst, has doubts about the supermajors’ ability to rebuild outside their traditional business. “If they can’t make returns in their core competency, what chance do they stand in a new competition?” he says. The new areas that are supposed to become the heart of Big Oil’s future are, at least today, less profitable than the fossil fuels business. Renewable energy usually delivers a return on capital, a typical measure of profitability, of about 8% to 10%. A conventional oil project yields a return of around 15%. One way to generate higher returns is by taking on more debt, something the companies appear to be open to. The supermajors also face strong competition from incumbents that have already mastered the renewables business, including the likes of Italian utility Enel SpA or its Spanish rival Iberdrola SA.The strategy shift poses a question to investors: Why pour money into legacy players trying to prove a new concept rather than back a utility that’s already making money in the sector? Take an example: Enel today pays a 4.6% dividend yield—virtually the same as Shell’s 4.3%.The supermajors have some advantages as they move into greener sources. One is the size of their balance sheet, which allows them to invest more and faster than many of the renewables players. Another is they can learn from the mistakes that others made before them. In theory, the oil giants are also well suited to manage big projects.And green projects can help legacy giants because renewables are, surprisingly, the steadier sector. “Volatility is lower compared to the oil-and-gas sector, and thus more stable,” says Atul Arya, a consultant who used to work at BP in business strategy.In the end, that less-profitable stability from solar and wind resources will matter. Because even the oil giants most committed to turning green won’t complete their long goodbye to oil and gas anytime soon. The supermajors will depend on fossil fuels for the next 10 to 20 years, at the very least, to generate enough cash to keep shareholders happy and have some money left to invest in clean-energy projects. And perhaps, as Looney of BP says, in more coffee, too. For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-goes-looking-career-040154761.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Calls Out Oil Demand Peak, OPEC Cuts 2021 Outlook	BP plc (NYSE: BP) became the first major oil company to call out an oil demand peak in its energy outlook report on Monday.The company said oil demand may not return to pre-coronavirus levels. This is a contrarian view, as most energy giants and OPEC ministers think oil consumption will see decades of growth, according to Bloomberg.BP's 3 Oil Scenarios: BP's outlook considers three main scenarios: a rapid transition scenario, the net zero scenario and the business-as-usual scenario.In the first two scenarios, oil demand falls due to COVID-19 and doesn't return to pre-coronavirus levels due to new policy measures that lead to a significant rise in carbon prices and shifts in societal behavior.In the business-as-usual scenario, government policies, technology and social preferences continue to evolve as they have in the past. Under this scenario, the demand recovers but flatlines near 100 million bpd for the next 20 years.Last year, BP's outlook considered a &quot;more energy&quot; scenario that projected oil demand growing steadily to 130 million bpd in the next 30 years. This scenario has been excluded in the current outlook.&quot;Demand for oil falls over the next 30 years. The scale and pace of this decline is driven by the increasing efficiency and electrification of road transportation,&quot; the report said. This also explains why CEO Bernard Looney said in August that he'd shrink oil and gas output by 40% over the next decade and spend about $5 billion a year to build one of the world's largest  renewable power businesses. Aligning with BP's call, OPEC has cut its 2021 oil demand estimate by 1.1 million bpd and downgraded its outlook for the global oil market a few days before the next OPEC meeting, according to Bloomberg.

OPEC Sees Weaker Outlook as Demand Falters, Shale Recovers	(Bloomberg) -- OPEC downgraded its outlook for the global oil market a few days before ministers meet, amid faltering demand and signs of a recovery in supply from U.S. shale drillers.The figures raise questions about the group’s decision to ease production cuts last month. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries added 760,000 barrels a day to global markets in August, just as its analysts were revising down demand for its crude by more than 1 million barrels a day.OPEC and its allies will hold an online monitoring meeting on Thursday to assess whether the vast production curbs they’ve been making are still sufficient to stave off an oil glut as the resurgence of coronavirus batters the world economy.Oil prices slipped further below $40 a barrel in London on Monday, close to their lowest in more than two months, as companies from BP Plc to Trafigura Group made ominous predictions about consumption.OPEC+, the 23-nation alliance spanning cartel nations like Saudi Arabia and non-members such as Russia, had agreed to taper some of the supply cutbacks made during the depths of the pandemic amid expectations that economic activity was recovering.This month’s report from the organization’s secretariat in Vienna suggests the move might have been premature.Demand CollapseOPEC reduced forecasts for global oil demand for each quarter to the end of next year by an average of 768,000 barrels a day. As a result, consumption is on track to collapse by an unprecedented 9.46 million barrels a day in 2020, averaging 90.23 million a day.The group simultaneously raised projections for production outside OPEC over the next five quarters by an average of 394,000 barrels a day, mostly because of a stronger outlook for the U.S.The combination of the softer consumption forecasts and more robust non-OPEC supply numbers depresses the requirement for crude from the cartel. The organization revised down estimated demand for its crude next year by 1.1 million barrels a day to 28.2 million a day.While OPEC is producing far below this level because of its agreement to curb supply, the revisions indicate that the world’s bloated oil inventories will subside more slowly than previously thought.The group’s 13 members pumped an average of just over 24 million barrels a day in August, the report showed. To satisfy demand in the coming months, they would need to produce more than 28 million barrels a day, and the same for much of 2021, suggesting that inventories should still decline substantially.The organization, which has shaped global oil markets from the Arab nations’ embargo of 1973 to the record supply cuts of this year’s pandemic, turned 60 on Monday.The decades ahead could bring a further test.U.K. energy giant BP said the relentless growth of oil demand is over, becoming the first supermajor to call the end of an era many thought would last another decade or more. Oil consumption may never return to levels seen before the coronavirus crisis took hold, the company said in a report on Monday.(Updates with BP views on demand in final paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opec-sees-weaker-outlook-demand-120638100.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-09-14	2020-09-14 07:46:57	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP Says the Era of Oil-Demand Growth Is Over	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc said the relentless growth of oil demand is over, becoming the first supermajor to call the end of an era many thought would last another decade or more.Oil consumption may never return to levels seen before the coronavirus crisis took hold, BP said in a report on Monday. Even its most bullish scenario sees demand no better than “broadly flat” for the next two decades as the energy transition shifts the world away from fossil fuels.BP is making a profound break from orthodoxy. From the bosses of corporate energy giants to ministers from OPEC states, senior figures from the industry have insisted that oil consumption will see decades of growth. Time and again, they have described it as the only commodity that can satisfy the demands of an increasing global population and expanding middle class.The U.K. giant is describing a different future, where oil’s supremacy is challenged, and ultimately fades. That explains why BP has taken the boldest steps so far among peers to align its business with the goals of the Paris climate accord. Just six months after taking the top job, Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney said in August he’d shrink oil and gas output by 40% over the next decade and spend as much as $5 billion a year building one of the world’s largest renewable-power businesses.That’s because he suspects oil use may already have peaked as a result of the pandemic, stricter government policies and changes in consumer behavior. BP’s energy outlook shows consumption slumping 50% by 2050 in one scenario, and by almost 80% in another. In a “business-as-usual” situation, demand would recover but then flatline near 100 million barrels a day for the next 20 years.Read: BP Walks Away From the Oil Supermajor Model It Helped CreateBP isn’t the only big oil company adapting its business to the energy transition. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SE and others in Europe have announced similar pivots toward cleaner operations as customers, governments and investors increasingly call for change.Three Possible FuturesBP’s report comes ahead of three days of online briefings starting Monday on its clean-energy and climate strategy. The study considers three scenarios, which aren’t predictions but nevertheless cover a wide range of possible outcomes over the next 30 years and form the basis of the new strategy Looney announced in August.The “Rapid” approach sees new policy measures leading to a significant increase in carbon prices. The “Net Zero” course reinforces Rapid with big shifts in societal behavior, while the “Business-as-usual” projection assumes that government policies, technology and social preferences continue to evolve as they have in the recent past.See also: New EU Climate Plan Brings End of the Combustion Engine CloserIn the first two scenarios, oil demand falls as a result of the coronavirus, the report shows. “It subsequently recovers but never back to pre-Covid levels,” according to Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist. “It brings forward the point at which oil demand peaks to 2019.”That contrasts with what many others are forecasting. Russell Hardy, chief executive officer of trading giant Vitol Group, said on Monday that oil demand is poised for 10 years of growth before a steady decline. He predicts consumption will return to pre-virus levels by the end of next year.BP’s outlook last year contained a scenario called “More energy,” which had oil demand growing steadily to about 130 million barrels a day in 2040. There’s no such scenario this time.“Demand for oil falls over the next 30 years,” BP said in the report. “The scale and pace of this decline is driven by the increasing efficiency and electrification of road transportation.”Covid ImpactThe pandemic shattered oil consumption this year as countries locked down to prevent infections from spreading. While demand has since improved, and crude prices with it, the public health crisis is still raging in many parts of the world and the outlook remains uncertain in the absence of a vaccine.The impact, including lasting behavioral changes like increased working from home, will affect economic activity and prosperity in the developing world, and ultimately demand for liquid fuels, according to BP. That means it won’t be able to offset already falling consumption in developed countries.Demand for liquid fuels is seen falling to less than 55 million barrels a day by 2050 in BP’s Rapid scenario, and to around 30 million a day in Net Zero. The drop is mostly in developed economies and in China. In India, other parts of Asia and Africa, demand remains broadly flat in the first scenario but slips below 2018 levels from the mid-2030s in the second.Other points in the energy outlook:The Rapid scenario has carbon emissions from energy use falling by around 70% by 2050, while they drop by more than 95% in Net Zero. Business-as-usual sees them peaking in the mid-2020s.Demand for all primary energy -- the raw materials from which energy is derived -- increases by about 10% in Rapid and Net Zero in the period, and by around 25% in the third scenario.In Rapid, non-fossil fuels account for the majority of global energy from the early 2040s.Growth in China’s energy demand slows sharply relative to past trends, reaching a peak in the early 2030s in all three scenarios.Renewable energy -- excluding hydro -- increases more than 10-fold in both Rapid and Net Zero, with its share in primary energy rising from 5% in 2018 to more than 40% by 2050 in Rapid and almost 60% in Net Zero.Natural gas consumption is seen broadly unchanged to 2050 in Rapid and around 35% higher in business-as-usual. Demand falls by about 40% by 2050 in Net Zero.(Updates with BP briefings in the seventh paragraph, Vitol CEO comments in the 10th.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-says-era-oil-demand-230100653.html?.tsrc=rss

BP, Shell Urge Texas Regulator to End Routine Gas Flaring	(Bloomberg) -- Two of Europe’s biggest oil companies urged Texas regulators to end the routine flaring of natural gas, joining with large investors who want greater oversight of the harmful environmental practice.BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are calling for tougher rules than those proposed by the Railroad Commission of Texas, which regulates oil and gas in the state. The commission is considering requiring operators to disclose more data when they apply for flaring permits and issuing them for shorter periods.“We believe there is a real opportunity for the state to set the bar for others to follow,” BP and Shell said in a joint letter to the regulator dated Sept. 4 and published late Wednesday. “We encourage the Railroad Commission of Texas to support an ambition of zero routine flaring in Texas.”Last week, investors managing more than $2 trillion asked the commission to end routine gas flaring by 2025. AllianceBernstein, California State Teachers’ Retirement System and Legal & General Investment Management said the actions of leading operators “demonstrate the financial and technical viability” of their proposal.READ: Investment Giants Urge Texas to End Most Natural Gas Flaring (1)The boom in shale production over the past decade has led to a massive excess of natural gas, which is often a by-product of oil in some basins such as the Permian. Prices for gas are often so low that it’s cheaper for operators to burn it, releasing carbon dioxide and sometimes methane, rather than pay for pipelines to take it to market.Routine flaring refers to the burning of gas during normal operations. Most operators and regulators also reserve the right to flare during emergency situations.The business-friendly commission has historically taken a hands-off approach to flaring, granting permits and waivers when needed, but that may soon change with increasing pushback from environmentalists, investors and some oil companies.In their letter, BP and Shell didn’t set a date for ending routine flaring but called for improvements from operators, improved flaring data, more oversight and collaboration with pipeline operators.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-shell-urge-texas-regulator-040001820.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Joins Up With Equinor For $1.1B Offshore Wind Partnership	BP PLC and Equinor today announced a strategic partnership to develop offshore wind projects in the US. As part of the deal, the UK oil and gas giant will buy a 50% interest in two of Equinor’s US wind assets - the Empire Wind and Beacon - for $1.1 billion.BP (BP) said that the collaboration includes the development of existing offshore wind leases on the US East coast as well as the joint pursuance of further opportunities for offshore wind projects in the US. The deal is expected to close in early 2021, subject to customary regulatory and other approvals.“This is an important early step in the delivery of our new strategy and our pivot to truly becoming an integrated energy company. Offshore wind is growing at around 20% a year globally and is recognized as being a core part of meeting the world’s need to limit emissions,” said BP CEO Bernard Looney. “Equinor is a recognized sector leader and this partnership builds on a long history between our two companies. It will play a vital role in allowing us to deliver our aim of rapidly scaling up our renewable energy capacity, and in doing so help deliver the energy the world wants and needs.”The partnership comes just a month after BP announced its target to increase annual low carbon investment 10-fold to around $5 billion a year and grow its developed renewable generating capacity from 2.5 gigawatts (GW) in 2019 to around 50GW by 2030.First power generation from Empire Wind’s phase 1 is expected in the mid-2020s and phase 2 is preparing for upcoming solicitations, BP said. Beacon Wind will also be developed for future solicitation opportunities and will begin a review process to secure all necessary permits for the project, the company added.Shares in BP have lost 46% of their value this year as the coronavirus pandemic pushed oil prices to multi-year lows leading to declines in oil and gas output. (See BP stock analysis on TipRanks)Meanwhile, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd last month upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold with a price target of $31, up from $28, citing cost reductions that are bringing down breakevens across the group. Furthermore, Todd views valuations at the European majors as more attractive relative to their US counterparts.The analyst noted that multiples, breakevens, and free cash flow yields are at &quot;historically large discounts,&quot; while improving visibility on the medium- and long-term strategy should at least partially alleviate concerns on near-term risks.The rest of the Street shares Todd’s bullish outlook with a Strong Buy analyst consensus.

BP’s $1.1 Billion Deal Marks First Step Into Offshore Wind	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc, the oil giant that announced a seismic strategy shift last month, made its first venture into offshore wind power with a $1.1 billion purchase of U.S. assets from Norway’s Equinor ASA.The deal marks the start of an offshore-wind investment partnership in the region for the two companies, which have been at the forefront of the rapid changes in the oil industry as companies seek to adapt to the realities of climate change.BP has taken the boldest steps so far in abandoning the oil-supermajor business model. Just six months after taking the helm, Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney said in August he’d shrink oil and gas output by 40% over the next decade and spend as much as $5 billion a year building one of the world’s largest renewable-power businesses.Read: BP Walks Away From the Oil Supermajor Model It Helped CreateBP will receive a 50% stake in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind developments off New York and Massachusetts, respectively, the companies said in two separate statements on Thursday. Equinor will retain 50% in both, and continue to be the operator.Empire Wind, whose first phase could start in 2024-25, has a potential installed capacity of more than 2 gigawatts, and Beacon Wind more than 2.4 gigawatts. Together they’ll be able to power more than 2 million homes. Equinor earlier estimated total investments in Empire Wind’s first phase at about $3 billion.Future CooperationThe companies plan to participate in more offshore wind projects in the U.S., bringing together their significant balance sheets and experience of handling large projects.“Our ambition would be to replicate this across the U.S.,” Dev Sanyal, executive vice president for gas and low-carbon energy at BP, said in an interview. “States are going through their own process of looking at the offshore wind sector, and as offshore leases come available both of us would like to be a part of that.”Norway’s state-controlled Equinor has so far been the most aggressive oil major in offshore wind, seeking to capitalize on its experience in operating big industrial projects at sea. It’s now reaping the rewards of its early-mover status, expecting to book a $1 billion gain from the BP transaction.The company’s shares rose 0.6% in Oslo trading as of 1:37 p.m. local time, while BP declined 0.3% in London. Also read: Equinor’s $1 Billion Gain on BP Deal Shows Edge in Offshore Wind Equinor last year sold half its stake in a wind farm off Germany, recouping its initial investment. Bloomberg has also reported that the company is in talks to reduce its stake in what will be the world’s biggest offshore wind farm in the U.K.Equinor beefed up its climate strategy earlier this year, and incoming CEO Anders Opedal has vowed to increase the pace of the transition when he starts in November.BP’s boss Looney has set a target to boost renewable-power capacity to around 50 gigawatts by 2030 from 2.5 gigawatts last year. It won’t explore for oil in any new countries -- a major step away from the traditional business that made the company an energy supermajor for decades.BP and Equinor are looking to leverage each other’s strengths in the clean-energy sector in this and any future partnership. While the British company is already a big player in solar and onshore wind, its Norwegian counterpart has major offshore wind projects. Both have energy trading units that can squeeze out profits from the market.“We are complementary in many ways,” Equinor’s Executive Vice President for New Energy Solutions Pal Eitrheim said in an interview. “I see this as the hand and the glove coming together in an attractive growth market.”(Updates with the companies future plans, and executives’ comments from the sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-1-1-billion-deal-073054910.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-09	2020-09-09 13:40:24	BP	BP p.l.c.	Analyzing BP's Unusual Options Activity	Shares of BP (NYSE: BP) saw some unusual options activity on Wednesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $20.16.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-16  * Strike Price: $32.00  * Volume: 0  * Open Interest: 995Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally high. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.&quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. &quot;Out of the money&quot; occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For August 17, 2020  * ROCE Insights For BP  * Recap: BP Q2 Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Piper Sandler Turns Bullish On BP, Lifts PT	Piper Sandler upgraded energy giant BP Plc to Buy from Hold, while also lifting the stock's price target to $31 (34.8% upside potential) from $28, citing cost-savings measures.Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd is encouraged by BP’s (BP) cost reductions measures and believes &quot;valuation at the European Majors is more attractive relative to the US Majors&quot;. Todd noted that multiples, breakevens, and free cash flow yields are at &quot;historically large discounts&quot;. The analyst expects improving visibility in the medium- and long-term should partially lessen the near-term concerns.Earlier this month, BP reported a 2Q loss after it downgraded the value of some of its assets on expectations of lower commodity prices. Its underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, came in at a loss of $6.7 billion.BP is planning to become a net-zero-carbon company by 2050 or sooner. Within 10 years, it plans to raise its annual low carbon investment 10-fold to around $5 billion a year. The company also committed to reduce its oil and gas production by 40% from current levels by the end of the decade.Currently, the Street has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus is based on 5 Buys and 1 Hold. The average price target of $29.78 implies an upside potential of about 29.5%.

Oil Companies Wonder If It’s Worth Looking for Oil Anymore	(Bloomberg) -- A few dots near the bottom corner of the world map in the southern Atlantic, the Falkland Islands were once at the forefront of a new era for the oil industry as companies scoured the planet for resources.Yet a decade after the discovery of as much as 1.7 billion barrels of crude in surrounding waters, the British overseas territory known for sheep rearing and tension with Argentina looks as remote as ever. Rather than the next frontier, the project to extract energy risks being added to a list of what companies call “stranded assets” that could cost them huge sums to mothball.As the coronavirus ravages economies and cripples demand, European oil majors have made some uncomfortable admissions in recent months: oil and gas worth billions of dollars might never be pumped out of the ground.With the crisis also hastening a global shift to cleaner energy, fossil fuels will likely be cheaper than expected in the coming decades, while emitting the carbon they contain will get more expensive. These two simple assumptions mean that tapping some fields no longer makes economic sense. BP Plc said on Aug. 4 that it would no longer do any exploration in new countries.The oil industry was already grappling with the energy transition, copious supply and signs of peak demand as Covid-19 began to spread. The pandemic will likely bring forward that peak and discourage exploration, according to Rystad Energy AS. The consultant expects about 10% of the world’s recoverable oil resources—some 125 billion barrels—to become obsolete.“There will be stranded assets,” said Muqsit Ashraf, senior managing director responsible for the global energy industry at Accenture Plc. “Companies are going to have to accept the fact.”The Sea Lion project in the Falklands promised to be a world-class resource when Rockhopper Exploration Plc found the field in 2010. Hundreds of millions of dollars later and after enduring a flare up between Argentina and Britain over the legality of the project, the first phase still hasn’t brought any oil to market.Premier Oil Plc, Rockhopper’s partner, suspended work on Sea Lion earlier this year, and on July 15 wrote off $200 million of investment because later phases looked unlikely to happen. Larger companies have also begun voicing that realization for other projects. BP said in June it would evaluate its portfolio of discoveries and leave some undeveloped. Chief of Staff Dominic Emery already hinted last year at what kind of resources might never “ see the light of day.” Complicated projects could be shelved in favor of fields that are quicker to develop, such as U.S. shale, he said.The pressure to curb emissions may also prompt companies to leave the most carbon-intensive reserves in the ground, as France’s Total SE acknowledged last month when it took an $8 billion writedown on carbon-heavy assets.Quicktake‘Stranded Assets’ Risk Rising With Climate Action and $40 OilThe list of projects most at risk includes deepwater discoveries off Brazil, Angola and in the Gulf of Mexico, said Parul Chopra, vice president for upstream research at Rystad. Canadian oil-sands projects such as the expansion of the Sunrise development in Alberta are also in doubt, he said.The Sunrise deposit, a joint venture between BP and Husky Energy Inc., has an abundant supply of bitumen—potentially as much as 3.7 billion barrels. Extraction, though, is complicated. Most oil-sands projects resemble mining operations. The bitumen is dug out of the ground and processed into heavy crude, which must then be diluted with lighter hydrocarbons before it can be refined into fuel.Sunrise is more complex and more costly. The deposit is too deep to be dug up, so instead it’s injected with steam to get the bitumen flowing into a well, from where it can be pumped to the surface.Sunrise was meant to be built in three phases, ultimately producing more than 200,000 barrels of bitumen a day over 40 years. The first 60,000-barrel-a-day stage started in 2015, just as crude prices were slumping amid the first U.S. shale boom. Since March this year, output has shrunk to around 10,000 a day, net to Husky, amid plunging prices and restrictions on pipeline capacity.Neither Husky, which runs the project, nor BP have disclosed a timeframe for the next stages of development. They’ll require crude prices well above current levels, suggesting an expansion isn’t imminent, said Mike Coffin, an analyst at research group Carbon Tracker Initiative.  (The think tank has received support from the charitable foundation of Michael Bloomberg, the majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News.)Beyond their economic viability, carbon-intensive oil sands also sit uncomfortably with BP’s ambition to become a “net-zero” company by 2050. No new oil-sands projects fit in a world compliant with the Paris climate accord, according to Carbon Tracker.Husky has said its long-term plans include the potential to expand Sunrise, but declined to estimate timing or the oil price required. A BP spokesman said the company is reviewing oil-sands projects.In the Falklands, there’s still hope the outlook will improve. Rockhopper has said the challenges aren’t insurmountable, despite the remoteness of the islands and the hostility of Argentina, which fought a war with Britain in the 1980s and still claims sovereignty over the territory.It pointed to the involvement of other companies—Premier joined the project in 2012 and Navitas Petroleum LP is in talks to take a stake—to suggest there’s little risk Sea Lion will become a stranded asset.But a final decision on whether to proceed won’t come until next year at the earliest, according to Premier Chief Executive Officer Tony Durrant. Previous deadlines for final investment decisions have come and gone. The company declined to comment on whether Sea Lion was at risk of turning into a “stranded asset.”Sea Lion only needs oil prices in the low- to mid-$40s to break even, but probably requires at least $50 a barrel to secure debt, Rockhopper said. Benchmark Brent crude is currently trading around $45, having slumped by a third this year.Ultimately, with oil in abundance, doubts about the strength of long-term demand and pressure to eliminate the most carbon-intensive production, it’s a calculation that may become increasingly stacked against projects like Sunrise and Sea Lion.“Many assets are already stranded from an oil-price cycle perspective,” said Christyan Malek, head of EMEA oil and gas research at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “But when you then add the carbon curve, that takes a bigger chunk out.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-companies-wonder-worth-looking-060002627.html?.tsrc=rss

Now, many are wondering if the coronavirus is the last drop that will kill the oil industry and help save the planet. Analysts say that the oil and gas industry will never be the same. Without any exaggeration, oil is facing the gravest challenge in its 100-year history. Oil giants have been pushed to 'survival mode' and an environment of pure carnage due to plunging demand and a destructive price war.Unprecedented Times With some labeling, the situation as &quot;apocalyptical&quot;, the least lurid description is &quot;unprecedented&quot;. Oil prices have been the lowest in almost two decades, with even worse potentially on the way. This latest cyclical oil shock is hitting an industry whose days are counted. But the world's economy and infrastructure is still heavily invested in fossil fuels to a truly staggering level. This means oil has enormous inertia. Moreover, the aspects that made us rely on oil during the last hundred-plus years are still around because it is still a powerful way to produce and transport energy.The Answer Of Oil Giants Dividend Aristocrats are still betting their future on oilChevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) is continuing to drill for oil. Chevron and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) are certain they can still bring in a few profitable years while their European rivals are betting their future on renewables. Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth believes the energy business is simply undergoing another of its natural transitions. Chevron is not focused on replacing oil, but rather at making oil and gas more efficient and more environmentally benign. This isn't surprising as it is coming from someone who profits from the status quo.It's a multibillion-dollar gamble that would have been less surprising before the pandemic turned the whole world upside down. The risk is that the industry's mightiest could end up being left behind by producing a lot of climate-endangering oil and gas that no one wants or needs. Wirth insists he's comfortable with that risk because he finds that this energy transition is simply &quot;misunderstood.&quot; Exxon has also reiterated its commitment to being oil's last man standing decades from now.Chastened BP committed to dramatically reduce oil and gas productionIn sharp contrast, BP p.l.c. (NYSE: BP) announced dramatic steps to address climate change on August 4. This strategy includes an unexpected vow to reduce oil and gas production 40% over the next decade. Its CEO admitted its strategy was greatly influenced by the COVID-19 crisis.Contrasting Public Approaches So far, Chevron and Exxon's approach to climate change is in contrast to those of BP, Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS-B) (NYSE: RDS-A), and France's Total S.A. (NYSE: TOT). All three have committed to speed up their shift to cleaner fuel sources. The aim is to align with the Paris climate agreement and become &quot;carbon zero&quot; by 2050.On the other hand, Chevron and Exxon have pledged to sustain their dividends unlike BP and Royal Dutch Shell Plc that were forced to cut their highly prized dividends due to the low oil prices.Chevron and Exxon claim to support the goals of the Paris Agreement by reducing emissions, but they haven't committed to a zero-carbon footprint. They plan to reduce emissions from their own operations but not those of their products. Their position is also politically easier in the U.S., where fossil fuels count on significant support from Congress. Chevron and Exxon are simply avoiding the switch to a field where they have little expertise and where they perceive returns to be lower.The Business Of Oil May Never Return To &quot;Normal&quot;Shell CEO Ben van Beurden recently suggested that the oil business might never recover. BP's Bernard Looney didn't rule out the possibility that post-pandemic demand has already peaked. Those are horrifying news for companies that used to thrive as providers of a scarce resource that underpins the global economy. First of all, the resource is no longer scarce because of shale. BP even lowered its forecast it made two months ago by predicting that over the upcoming decades, crude prices could trend as much as 20% lower than initially thought.Natural Gas Could Be The Answer Natural gas is cheap these days. Its supplies also seem larger than oil reserves. Many experts are betting on natural gas to be our largest electricity provider. It is a perfect complement to solar and wind power. This is why it also makes sense to run cars on it. EVs are cleaner but their production also has an environmental footprint so they cannot solve all our problems. Another possibility is to use coal-to-liquid processes, just like what Germany did during WWII. But, it is a dirty and expensive way to increase supply. Rest assured, oil giants will explore any opportunity to keep the business afloat.The Solution Could Be Gradual A key question is whether the taken action is capable to alter the course of the climate crisis. Many experts are optimistic believing that the switch to renewables will provide the atmosphere the opportunity to gradually heal. The most enthusiastic ones believe 2019 will go down in history as the peak year for carbon emissions. But there are also pessimistic opinions that the fossil fuel industry will come back from the dead and that low oil prices will slow the much-needed transition to renewables.Outlook Is Uncertain Experts, including Jeff Currie at Goldman Sachs, are certain the climate change debate will take an entirely new direction. But exactly how will that look like remains to be seen. The first question is how long is the COVID-19 crisis going to last? And no one really knows the answer. But it is certain that these challenges combined are permanently altering the oil industry.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

2020-08-05	2020-08-05 14:48:56	BP	BP p.l.c.	Are Oil Giants Fighting For Profits Or Survival?	Without any sugar-coating, Big Oil is fighting for its existence. The coronavirus pandemic has turned the world upside down. Leaders around the globe were not up to the challenge of a pandemic. Despite a mild and slow recovery in sight, unemployment is still high, and the U.S. has seen its slowest economic growth rate ever. The combination of worst-ever oil prices, OPEC production cuts, collapsing margins, and oversupply resulting in millions of unsold barrels has harmed even giants in the industry, like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX).Losing Streak Exxon continued its streak of losses as it recently reported a second-quarter loss of $1.1 billion due to global oversupply and COVID-related demand destruction. Its shares are down 40% this year. Moreover, it was topped on the list of the world's largest energy companies by an Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd. The list is led by Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures. Investors turned to the conglomerate lured by its digital and retail expeditions.Layoffs And Slashed Earnings Expectations The reality is that the industry has found itself in an immense demand crater and its profits have disappeared overnight. Moreover, it's not just Exxon. BP p.l.c. (NYSE: BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS-B) (NYSE: RDS-A) are in the same basket with layoffs and slashed earnings expectations. Shell is not optimistic as its management openly stated it is aware that its business might never come back.BP just slashed its dividend for the first time since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill as it reported a record loss of $16.8 billion for the second quarter. Even that bleak scenario is still better than the fate of the 23 companies that filed for bankruptcy since this unprecedented year began. The collective debt of oil and gas companies that filed for bankruptcy protection in the first half of 2020 exceeds $30 billion.Exxon is using layoffs to pay out its dividends whereas BP will do the same in an effort to move beyond petroleum as this is the &quot;right thing to do&quot;. It is clear that Big Oil does not intend to take care of its workforce. And these are the people who kept the industry going since oil was seen as a strategic energy source and a tremendous geopolitical prize during World War I.You Can't Stop What's Coming The oil era has to come to an end at some point, simply because it is not a renewable source. The only question is when will this imminent event take place. Current events are happening at a great speed and at an unprecedented scale due to the pandemic that is threatening humanity as a whole- hand in hand with climate change. News from the US, Europe, and even Asia is triggering concerns that the second wave of the pandemic is about to strike.One thing is certain though - Big Oil is not acknowledging defeat and finds its workers disposable in the face of market downturns or more specifically, its bottom line.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

2020-08-05	2020-08-05 08:02:20	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP Walks Away From the Oil Supermajor Model It Helped Create	(Bloomberg) -- In the late 1990s, BP Plc boss John Browne used an oil-price slump to usher in the age of the supermajor, buying U.S. rivals Amoco and Arco to create a transatlantic giant. He kicked off a round of mergers that saw his company and four others dominate the industry -- Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. in the U.S., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SE in Europe.That era ended on Tuesday when Bernard Looney, the third chief executive officer since Browne’s swashbuckling reign ended in 2007, declared BP would be a supermajor no more and proposed a very different blueprint for the oil company of the future.Just six months after taking the helm, Looney has put meat on the bones of his plans to make BP compliant with the Paris accord on climate change, saying he’ll cut dividends in half, shrink oil and gas output by 40% over the next decade and spend as much as $5 billion a year building one of the world’s largest renewable-power businesses.Where Browne created a global model, Looney’s strategy shows the oil industry is splitting in two.On one side of the Atlantic, BP, Shell and Total are trying to make themselves going concerns for a low-carbon age, diluting their fossil-fuel businesses with plans to build significant revenues from renewable energy. Exxon and Chevron -- insulated from the pressure applied by European investors and politicians -- are charting a different course: keep pumping as profitably as possible and hand the cash back to investors. Like Big Tobacco, they’re increasingly courting shareholders willing to put returns above the harm their product causes.Pay Out or Diversify“BP had two choices,” said Brian Scott-Quinn, emeritus professor at Henley Business School in southern England, who’s written on financial markets and climate change. “First, simply paying out the maximum dividend it can in the future by not investing in the future at all. Alternatively, it can diversify on a much larger scale.”Looney described his seismic shift as making an integrated oil company into an integrated energy company.“You have to knit together lots of different energy sources,” Looney said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Wednesday. “We are natural gas, we’re in solar, we’re in wind, we have one of the world’s largest trading organizations.”It’s a complete change of direction for a company that raised the dividend earlier this year and has been hammered by the post-pandemic crash in oil prices. And there are plenty of risks ahead.BP concedes that power projects still make lower returns than oil and gas investments -- one reason why the board agreed to a lower dividend. And management has acknowledged that hydrocarbon production will probably remain BP’s main source of earnings for “the next several years,” funding its shift toward cleaner energy.It’s also unclear what competitive advantage an oil company brings to building wind farms and solar parks; traditional power utilities have had a long head-start.But there are dangers for Exxon and Chevron too. As alarm over global warming increases, their universe of potential investors may keep shrinking, especially if Joe Biden takes the White House in November and resets U.S. energy policy. As this quarter’s record losses show, if the post-Covid slump in crude prices is sustained, generating meaningful returns from oil and gas won’t be easy. A decade ago, Exxon was the most valuable U.S. corporation. Today it ranks 41st.See also: Tesla Overtakes Exxon’s Market Value in Symbolic Energy Shift“There’s definitely a division between the Europeans, who are much more committed to meeting the climate agenda,” and the Americans, said Panmure Gordon & Co. analyst Colin Smith. Their success will depend on how attractive the pivot in investments is perceived to be, relative to continued spending on oil and gas, he said.Unlike their European peers, Exxon and Chevron have managed to bat away investor pressure thus far. Both companies, backed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have resisted requests for shareholders to vote on their emission strategies.But they’ve been struggling with meager returns after investing heavily in megaprojects around the world for a decade, leaving them wholly unprepared for the era of cheap oil that began in 2014. Slow to realize the transformational effect of the shale revolution that happened on their doorstep, Exxon and Chevron are only now understanding that they must become more nimble to respond to market conditions, rather than dictate them.Sticking With OilUnder their current CEOs, neither U.S. major has the will to follow the Europeans down the green path. Both plan to stick with oil and gas long-term, tempered only by small clean-energy technology bets. For them, rushing to renewables -- where they have no competitive advantage and see smaller returns in a more regulated industry -- is not the answer.Yet in Europe, BP’s newly fleshed out plans will no doubt add pressure on Shell, which also announced ambitions earlier this year to slash its carbon emissions by 2050 and increasingly turn to renewables. The Anglo-Dutch major has promised more detail on that shift, which will ultimately result in it only doing business with emission-free companies.For the European majors, the success of their strategy depends in part on governments maintaining the scale of policy support needed to make the energy transition happen. With countries around the world pledging greener economies as they emerge from the devastation of the coronavirus, BP may have chosen its moment wisely.“If ever there was a moment to reset, this was it,” said Luke Parker, vice president of corporate analysis at consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Several factors have converged to make it possible: coronavirus and everything that comes with it; a strategic pivot to net-zero on the horizon” and a “new leadership with credit in the bank.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-walks-away-oil-supermajor-080220211.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-04	2020-08-04 14:15:50	BP	BP p.l.c.	ROCE Insights For BP	In Q2, BP (NYSE: BP) posted sales of $31.68 billion. Earnings were up 247.54%, but BP still reported an overall loss of $3.75 billion. BP collected $59.65 billion in revenue during Q1, but reported earnings showed a $1.08 billion loss.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q2, BP posted an ROCE of -0.04%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on BPReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For BP, the return on capital employed ratio shows the current amount of assets may not actually be helping the company achieve higher returns, a note many investors will take into account when making long-term financial decisions.Q2 Earnings Insight BP reported Q2 earnings per share at $-1.98/share, which beat analyst predictions of $-1.1/share.See more from Benzinga  * Recap: BP Q2 Earnings  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: BP  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 16, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-04	2020-08-04 09:47:25	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP Slashes Dividend As Covid-19 Propels Q2 Loss; Shares Rise 8%	BP PLC cut its dividend in half for the first time since 2010 after posting a $16.8 billion loss in the second quarter, as the energy giant expects weaker energy demand for a sustained period due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Shares are rising 8% to $23.86 in Tuesday’s pre-market trading. BP (BP) will slash its dividend to 5.25 cents per share from 10.5 cents per share for the previous quarter. The dividend decision is aligned with BP’s new distribution policy, which seeks to “reset a resilient dividend” of 5.25 cents per share per quarter and return at least 60% of surplus cash as share buybacks.Furthermore, the oil giant announced plans to ramp up its annual low-carbon investment by 2030 to $5 billion and increase its renewable power generation capacity to 50 gigawatts. Over the same period, BP’s oil and gas production is expected to be reduced by at least one million barrels of oil equivalent a day, or 40%, compared with 2019 levels.BP posted a $16.8 billion loss in the second quarter compared with a profit of $1.8 billion for the same period a year ago, including a net post-tax charge of $10.9 billion for non-operating items. In the reported quarter, underlying replacement losses amounted to $6.68 billion, compared with a profit of $2.81 billion in the year-ago period. BP said that the results mainly reflect the impact of writing down certain exploration intangible carrying values, and lower liquids and gas realizations.“These headline results have been driven by another very challenging quarter, but also by the deliberate steps we have taken as we continue to reimagine energy and reinvent bp. In particular, our reset of long-term price assumptions and the related impairment and exploration write-off charges had a major impact,” said BP CEO Bernard Looney. “Beneath these, however, our performance remained resilient, with good cashflow and – most importantly – safe and reliable operations.”In forward-looking statements, BP said that the outlook for commodity prices and product demand continues to be challenging and uncertain. In addition, the risk of the pandemic having an enduring impact on the global economy, boosts the potential for weaker energy demand for a sustained period.As of the end of June, BP’s net debt amounted to $40.9 billion, compared with $46.5 billion a year ago. The company had around $47 billion of liquidity, including cash and undrawn revolving credit facilities, at quarter end.Shares in BP have lost 41% of their value this year as the coronavirus pandemic pushed oil prices to multi-year lows leading to declines in oil and gas output.Ahead of the earnings, Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel raised the stock to Buy from Hold, saying that there was a &quot;good chance&quot; that BP will cut its dividend payout.The analyst noted that this is &quot;the first time our team has ever upgraded a stock to Buy when the risk of an imminent dividend cut was possible, but we believe a cut of 65% is already priced into the stock&quot;.Overall, Wall Street analysts share Gammel’s bullish outlook. The stock scores an unanimous 5 Buy ratings which add up to a Strong Buy consensus. The $29.48 average price target implies 33% upside potential in the shares over the coming 12 months.

2020-08-03	2020-08-03 09:20:04	BP	BP p.l.c.	Oil Crisis Presents BP’s New CEO With a Chance to Change	(Bloomberg) -- As Bernard Looney took to the stage in London in February to announce his plan to transform BP Plc for a low-carbon future, the U.K. capital confirmed its first case of Covid-19.The oil giant’s chief executive officer couldn’t have known how the virus would shake the foundations of his industry: since the start of the pandemic, BP has said it will write off as much as $17.5 billion of fossil-fuel assets, slash 10,000 jobs and exit the petrochemicals business. And on Tuesday, it may announce the first dividend cut since the Macondo oil-spill disaster a decade ago.But despite the pain for shareholders and employees, the crisis is giving Looney the opportunity to accelerate the big changes needed to fulfill his vision.The global spread of coronavirus “only reaffirms the need to reinvent our company,” Looney now says. The pandemic has created a world that pumps less oil, gets more of its energy from renewable sources and emits less carbon dioxide -- exactly what he says BP should do.“This backdrop of battered demand presents a lot of challenges, but it also presents opportunity,” said Luke Parker, vice president of corporate research for Wood Mackenzie Ltd.The measures BP has taken so far aren’t unique, either in the current slump or in the periodic downturns that have afflicted the industry over the decades. But there’s a symbolism that wasn’t there before.Quitting a core business like chemicals is a good way to show that the future looks different. Taking an ax to billions of dollars of oil and gas asset values demonstrates that “you’re a company that believes this transition is going to happen and that the world will be on a 2-degree path,” Parker said.Also see: BP’s New CEO Needs to Steer Company Through World Wary of OilMost importantly, the company is widely expected to follow Royal Dutch Shell Plc this week by cutting its dividend, potentially freeing up cash to invest in clean energy.Difficult decisions like this have been made easier by the coronavirus crisis, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s head of EMEA oil and gas, Christyan Malek.“What you’re seeing BP do is getting its house in order” before announcing a detailed transformation plan in September, Malek said. “BP have been putting the building blocks in place -- the impairments, the divestments. And we believe the dividend cut is the next building block.”Reducing BP’s $8 billion annual shareholder payout would address the biggest unanswered question about Looney’s transition plan: Where is the money going to come from?Even before the coronavirus lockdowns crashed energy prices, BP was saddled with more debt than any of its peers. Its gearing -- the ratio of debt to equity -- is poised to rise as high as 48%, according to RBC Capital Markets. That would be by far the highest in the industry, and could lead to questions about its credit rating.While the measures Looney has taken so far may help him achieve BP’s long-term goals, in the short-term shareholders appear unimpressed. The company’s stock is down 42% this year, a steeper drop than the 37% decline in the Stoxx Europe 600 Oil & Gas index.Low-Carbon SpendingWithout a detailed plan of how BP is going to become a clean-energy giant, the cost of the transformation remains largely theoretical. What’s clear, is that at the very least the oil major will have to boost spending on low-carbon fuels significantly from the current $500 million a year to billions.The other route would be acquisitions, following on from its 130 million-pound ($170 million) purchase of U.K. car-charging company Chargemaster in 2018. Such assets typically have positive cash flow and can be integrated easily into oil majors’ portfolios, said Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship, EOS at Federated Hermes.As Looney, 49, reshapes BP, doubts linger about the strategy. Sitting in the audience of the great unveiling in February was former CEO John Browne, who tried to steer the company into renewables in the early 2000s with the ill-fated “Beyond Petroleum” campaign.“We moved too soon,” Looney said in a recent Instagram post. “We lost money on much of what we had built up.”Bob Dudley, Looney’s immediate predecessor, has repeatedly cautioned against moving too fast into low-carbon fuels, saying the potential failure of new technologies could lead to financial ruin.The key to success will be keeping investors on board. There’s strong support for BP’s overall change in direction, with shareholders voting overwhelmingly in favor of climate resolutions in 2019, according to Hermes’ Duguid. But it could be a painful journey, and there’s a risk shareholders have a change of heart if Looney does cut the dividend.“You can use the macroeconomic backdrop as a way to justify the means, but you still need the end result to work,” said JPMorgan’s Malek.(Updates with share price information in 13th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-crisis-presents-bp-ceo-230100443.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-31	2020-07-31 15:47:33	BP	BP p.l.c.	Unusual Options Activity Insight: BP	On Friday, shares of BP (NYSE: BP) saw unusual options activity. After the option activity alert, the stock price moved down to $22.03.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-15  * Strike Price: $33.00  * Volume: 1844  * Open Interest: 119143 Signs of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume is one way option activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.&quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. &quot;Out of the money&quot; occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish and Bearish Sentiments   * Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price  * Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask priceThese observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish option activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Strategies to Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 16, 2020  * 13 Energy Stocks Moving In Tuesday's Pre-Market Session(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Chinese Oil Giant CNPC Eyes BP’s $1.5 Billion Stake in Oman Gas Field	(Bloomberg) -- China National Petroleum Corp. is in talks to acquire part of BP Plc’s stake in a key gas field in Oman, according to people familiar with the matter.China’s state-owned oil giant is having advanced discussions with BP for a 10% stake in the Khazzan natural gas field, the people said. The minority stake could fetch about $1.5 billion, said the people, asking not to be identified as the matter is private.No final decisions have been made and others have also expressed interest in the asset, the people said. Representatives for BP and CNPC declined to comment.BP was in early talks to sell about a 10% stake in the Khazzan natural gas field, Bloomberg News reported in June. The oil major owns a 60% stake in the project, while its partner Oman Oil Co. still has a 30% stake after it sold a 10% holding to Malaysia’s state oil company in 2018.China has been stepping up its presence in the Middle East as Beijing wants to increase its global influence and revive ancient trading routes under the Belt and Road initiative. Last year, State Grid Corp. of China agreed to acquire a 49% stake in Oman’s state-owned power transmission company in the first major privatization by the Middle East’s largest non-OPEC oil producer.CNPC has operations in five Middle Eastern countries, including Oman, according to its website. It started in Oman with an acquisition of a 50% interest in oil field Block 5 in 2002. The Chinese oil giant paid about $1.2 billion in 2018 for stakes in two oil and natural gas concessions in Abu Dhabi.BP shares declined 3.6% Thursday, as Brent crude futures fell the most in more than a month following dramatic U.S. economic data. The recovery in global oil demand is faltering amid the resurgence in coronavirus, even as the OPEC cartel and partners, including Oman, next week plan to resume some of the crude output halted during the depths of the pandemic.(Updates with BP share performance in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-oil-giant-cnpc-eyes-103210472.html?.tsrc=rss

Big Oil’s Worst-Ever Loss Puts Historic BP Dividend Cut in Play	(Bloomberg) -- For the first time since the West’s five energy supermajors were created in the early 2000s, all of them are expected to post a quarterly loss.Once a money-making machine, Big Oil is now relying on ever-increasing amounts of debt, raising the pressure on highly prized dividends. BP Plc may cut its payout for the first time since the Deepwater Horizon disaster a decade ago.The sheer scale of global oil demand destruction — some 30 million barrels a day, or a third of regular usage, in April — sent energy markets into a second-quarter tailspin, from which they’ve only recently started to recover. Worst-in-a-generation oil prices combined with OPEC production cuts, collapsing refining margins and millions of barrels of unsold crude mean no facet of Big Oil’s business has emerged unscathed.The companies’ unpredictable marketing divisions always have the potential to deliver surprise profits, as was the case for Norwegian producer Equinor ASA. But for some of the supermajors, billions of dollars of anticipated losses will be difficult for even the most skilled trader to offset. “There really hasn’t been anywhere to hide, even in the integrated model,” said Noah Barrett, a Denver-based energy analyst at Janus Henderson,which manages $294 billion. “Terrible quarter, but it’s behind us now. The focus will be on how the recovery takes shape.”DividendsFor BP, analysts from banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. are expecting a cut in the payout of anywhere between 30% and 65%, a historic move for a company that has been a cornerstone dividend payer in the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index for decades. It would reduce the amount of debt needed and free up cash for Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney’s high-profile strategy to eliminate almost all of the carbon emissions from the company’s operations and the fuel it sells to customers.The move would follow Equinor ASA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which cut its dividend for the first time since World War II earlier this year.Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Total SA aren’t expected to follow suit, though analysts at Goldman reckon a cut at Exxon “could enable a financially healthier company.”DebtBig Oil borrowed some $80 billion during the quarter, giving it a whopping cash balance of $194 billion to see it through an intense period of losses as well as scheduled debt repayments this year and in 2021, according to Jefferies Financial Group Inc. But this will increase net-debt-to-capital ratios, a key measure of indebtedness.European majors will remain more indebted than their U.S. rivals, but dividend cuts may bring some relief. Despite having low debt coming into the crisis, Exxon’s borrowing is rising rapidly and over time will become a cause for concern, according to Morgan Stanley and Goldman. Exxon’s net debt climbed by $8.8 billion in the the quarter and will surge to $78 billion by the end of 2022, Goldman said. Chevron's agreement to acquire Noble Energy Inc. this week includes the assumption of about $8 billion of additional borrowings. That still leaves the company well-placed to pay its dividend, CEO Mike Wirth said.RefiningRefining is seen as the “hedge” part of the Big Oil integrated model. When crude prices are down, refining is often unaffected because of lower feedstock costs, but that’s an “oversimplification,” according to Paul Cheng, a New York-based analyst at Scotiabank. When no one’s buying petroleum because of lockdowns to fight the global pandemic, all parts of the oil business suffer.A simple measure of refining profit, known as a 3-2-1 crack spread — it assumes three barrels of crude makes two of gasoline and one of diesel-like fuels - slumped to its lowest level for the time of the year since 2010. Refineries have also been running at reduced levels and changing their product mix due to a worse market for jet fuel compared with gasoline.Exxon, which has massive refining operations, will be affected the most by this trend. Chevron may also suffer from challenges to its operations on the West Coast, Cheng said.EarningsResults will reflect a tumultuous quarter in which Brent crude averaged about $33 a barrel, less than half the level a year earlier, but with a massive spread between the high and low points of some $20. That throws further uncertainty into the mix for trading and derivatives.“Our team has forecasted earnings for 72 quarters and 2Q20 seems the most difficult of them,” Jason Gammel, a London-based analyst at Jefferies Financial Group Inc., said in a note to clients.ImpairmentsShell and BP got the bad news out of the way in June by disclosing they would write down as much as $22 billion and $17.5 billion respectively in the second quarter as the pandemic hammered the long-term valuations of everything from oil to liquefied natural gas. Chevron took an $11 billion hit in December related to its U.S. natural gas assets. Exxon is yet to take such an impairment.The two U.S. majors may come under pressure from analysts to reveal more information on how they value their assets because they don’t provide the same disclosures as their European peers. Climate-conscious investors want Exxon and Chevron to disclose their long-term forecasts for crude prices as the Covid-19 pandemic heightens uncertainty about the demand outlook for fossil fuels. The New York State Common Retirement Fund, California State Teachers’ Retirement System and Ceres, a Boston-based coalition of investors with $30 trillion of assets, this month called on them to provide such estimates, in part to avoid ending up with uneconomic assets.Such write-downs aren’t inevitable. Equinor, which reported earnings on July 24, stuck to its assumption for an oil price of $77 a barrel in 2025, arguing that the current slump will permanently eliminate enough crude production and make markets tighter in the years to come. Shell and Total report on July 30,  Exxon and Chevron on July 31, and BP on Aug. 4.(Updates with details of Equinor’s trading gains in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-worst-ever-loss-040107230.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Singapore Oil Traders Placed on Leave Amid Disputed Deals	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc has placed some personnel from its Singapore-based crude oil team on leave after they were mentioned in court documents filed in disputes between banks and other trading houses, said people with knowledge of the company’s move.Three members of the trading staff and one manager were placed on leave late last week as internal investigations are being conducted, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. The trading staff hold portfolios focused on BP’s oil sales to Chinese customers, while the manager overlooks crude trading in Asia, the people said.A BP spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter.BP isn’t accused of wrongdoing. The oil major was named in court filings made by local units of CIMB Bank Bhd. and Natixis SA against Hontop Energy (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. and Sugih Energy International Pte. Ltd. -- now renamed as Aeturnum Energy International Pte Ltd. The banks claimed they found themselves in a $192 million hole from funding crude oil deals involving these companies.Between late 2019 and early this year, lenders said in filings in the High Court of Singapore that they issued letters of credit and paid out millions of dollars on behalf of Hontop, with Sugih as the beneficiary. The banks claimed they agreed to the letters of credit after Hontop showed them documentation including supposedly binding contracts to on-sell the oil to BP. When the banks went to collect from BP, however, the oil major said it had never agreed to some of the purchases, according to the claims.In one such transaction, at least six BP staff were identified in emailed deal recaps between Hontop and the oil major, filings show.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-singapore-oil-traders-placed-054706984.html?.tsrc=rss

That’s the predicament two banks claim they’ve found themselves in after funding crude oil deals in the midst of Singapore’s commodities trading meltdown.The troubled transactions, outlined in court documents, offer the clearest look yet at some of the deals at the heart of a web of scandals in the Asian energy-trading hub that have already caused more than $9 billion in potential losses for global lenders.The Singapore units of CIMB Bank Bhd. and Natixis SA claim to be victims in separate cases filed in the High Court of Singapore. Their accusations span four separate oil deals, but involve the same players:Hontop Energy (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., the oil trading unit of conglomerate China Wanda Group that’s now in receivership. CIMB is suing to put the trader under judicial management and is seeking $105 million from it and its parent, saying there is evidence of serious fraud and misconduct by its management.Singapore’s Sugih Energy International Pte. Ltd., which has since renamed itself as Aeturnum Energy International Pte Ltd. Natixis is suing the trader in two separate cases seeking a combined $86 million and/or the surrender of relevant documents, accusing it of false and fraudulently made representations.Oil major BP Plc, who isn’t being accused of wrongdoing by either bank.The banks said they issued letters of credit and paid Sugih for oil on behalf of Hontop, based on Hontop showing them supposedly binding contracts to on-sell the oil to BP, according to the filings. However, when they went to collect from BP, the oil major said it had never agreed to some of the purchases.CIMB and Natixis said they paid Sugih a total of about $192 million on behalf of Hontop for oil that Hontop promised it would sell on to BP, according to the filings.When the banks went to BP’s Singapore unit to be paid back, the oil major told them the transaction for one of the shipments was contingent of another payment that never materialized, and two never existed at all, adding that the lenders had been victims of their client’s fraudulent conduct, according to the filings.As for the oil at the center of the deals, the banks say it’s unclear if the cargoes were there to begin with and whether they were discharged as planned, according to the filings.An attorney for Sugih, now Aeturnum, said the firm is an innocent party in the series of sales. It sold the cargoes to Hontop, and Hontop never disputed that they were delivered, he said. Hontop is the one who failed to pay the bank for the cargoes, and that’s who the banks should be looking to for payment, the attorney said.BP declined to comment, as did attorneys for Hontop, CIMB and Natixis.The accusations shine a spotlight on the special relationship between banks and commodity traders, which require ample low-cost financing for the high-capital low-margin business. The magnitude of the losses in Singapore are now prompting lenders to take a long and hard look at whether the rewards of financing the sector are sufficient to offset the risks amid the most dramatic oil-price crash in a generation.The following is a summary of the trades in question, based on an affidavit CIMB filed in a case against Hontop in the Singapore court on July 1, and claims filed by Natixis against Sugih on June 19 and 29. The Green Attitude shipment counts as two deals as both lenders were involved.Green AttitudeHontop approached CIMB in early November 2019 to finance a purchase of Russian ESPO crude from Sugih for resale to BP.As proof of the deal, Hontop gave the bank a purchase contract between itself and Sugih and a sales contract between itself and BP, emails between the firms recapping the deals, and copies of bills of lading for about 518,000 barrels of ESPO crude on board the tanker Green Attitude.Based on that, CIMB agreed to issue a letter of credit to Sugih and eventually paid the firm about $36 million on Hontop’s behalf.When the bank went to BP expecting to collect the money from Hontop’s subsequent sale, however, the oil major told them the contract was subject to a framework agreement under which its payment obligations were conditional upon another payment from Hontop to BP, according to the filings.Since Hontop hadn’t paid, BP said it wasn’t obliged to pay Hontop or CIMB. BP went on to allege that the bank was “apparently a victim of Hontop’s fraudulent conduct,” according to a letter from BP included in the filing.In a separate claim filed by Natixis, the bank said it financed a purchase of 270,000 barrels of ESPO crude on board the Green Attitude after Hontop applied for a letter of credit in November, at the same time Hontop approached CIMB.Hontop provided documents to show it agreed to buy the oil from Sugih with an on-sale agreement to BP, according to the filing. Hontop has failed to reimburse the $18 million Natixis paid to Sugih, which refused to provide the documentation the bank requested.Gem No. 5Hontop approached CIMB in December last year to finance another purchase of Russian oil from Sugih, this time for resale to Mitsui & Co.’s trading unit in Singapore.CIMB declined to finance the deal because Mitsui wasn’t on its approved buyer list, and within eight hours Hontop came back and said BP would buy the cargo instead. Upon receiving purchase and sale contracts, email deal recaps and bills of lading from Hontop, CIMB agreed to finance the transaction and issued letters of credit totaling $70 million.CIMB later asked Sugih for more documentation, and the trader gave it contracts, invoices and other documents showing it bought 1.3 million barrels of crude from another firm, a Singapore unit of Chinese manufacturing conglomerate WanXiang Group. CIMB then paid Sugih the $70 million after receiving the documents.That’s when things started to go awry. First, BP’s lawyers said they searched their records and could find no contract to purchase the cargo from Hontop and suggested it had been fabricated. The oil giant refused to pay the bank’s invoice.Then CIMB reached out to Wanxiang. The trader said Hontop and Sugih had asked it to come into the deal, buying the cargo from Hontop and immediately selling it to Sugih, according to the filing. In addition, Wanxiang claimed that Sugih had altered the sales documents it forwarded to CIMB, the filing shows.Wanxiang isn’t being accused of any wrongdoing. An attorney for the firm said it isn’t a party to the legal proceedings and therefore isn’t aware of all the details of the case.New HonorHontop approached Natixis in late November last year to finance a purchase of Brazilian Lula crude from Sugih for resale to BP. Hontop provided supporting documents such as purchase and sale contracts with Sugih and BP and bills of lading on the tanker New Honor for about 982,000 barrels of Lula.Natixis issued a letter of credit with Sugih as beneficiary and eventually transferred $67.5 million to the firm’s bank.Once again, though, when Natixis sought payment from BP, the oil major said it had not entered into nor was it aware of a contract to purchase oil from Hontop, and it refused to pay.Natixis claims Sugih refused to give it more documentation. In addition, the bank alleged that only 425,000 barrels of Lula crude were discharged in China -- less than half the agreed-upon volume -- and that the cargo was delivered to another company called Shandong Dongying Yatong Petrochemical Ltd., rather than Hontop.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/burnt-banks-claim-fraud-fabrications-011038201.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-16	2020-07-16 22:40:17	BP	BP p.l.c.	Aramco, Exxon Make Move to Join BP, Shell in Carbon Curbs	(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco has joined with European and U.S. supermajors representing a third of the world’s oil industry to begin curbing emissions at their own operations as the clamor builds for the biggest polluters to act on climate impact.Members of the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative, a group of big oil companies working on ways to respond to climate change, pledged to reduce the carbon intensity of their operations to between 20 and 21 kilograms of carbon dioxide per barrel of crude equivalent by 2025. That represents a reduction of as much as 13% from 2017 levels.The target only refers to “intensity,” meaning it allows producers to increase their overall emissions, but they’ll have to be cleaner on a per-barrel basis. It also doesn’t include customer emissions, referred to by carbon accountants as “Scope 3,” which typically add up to more than 90% of an oil company’s total footprint.The target is higher than the 18 kilograms of carbon dioxide per barrel averaged by members of the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers, which represents about 40% of the industry. An OGCI representative said that its goal is not directly comparable because it includes methane emissions and carbon emissions of energy sourced from third parties. Bob Dudley, the former BP Plc CEO and chairman of OGCI, said the new target is significant because it brings together privately owned and state oil producers around a common goal.“It’s a start,” Dudley said in a phone interview. “I don’t think it’s a small achievement to bring all these companies together -- national oil companies, who have their own pressures, European and U.S. companies have different government and shareholder pressures on them -- actually work together, particularly during the pandemic.”Aggressive TargetsAchieving the target by 2025 will remove as much as 52 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, equivalent to the total emissions from about 6 million U.S. homes, according to the OGCI. “Anyone that tells you these are not big numbers, that’s just not right,” Dudley said.“Aramco has been actively investing in sustainability for decades,” a spokesperson for the company said in a statement on Thursday. “Since the 1970s, the company has been investing in flare-minimization and the installation of a gas-recovery system.”European oil companies such as BP, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA, have announced some of the most aggressive emission reductions targets, but have been criticized for a lack of detail and for giving themselves until the middle of the century to achieve carbon neutrality. U.S. majors such as ExxonMobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. have set no firm targets across all their emissions. By contrast, the OGCI target is “near-term, which means it’s practical and can be measured,” Dudley said.“It’s a step in the right direction for national oil companies to set emissions targets, even if it’s only a small step,” said Andrew Grant, head of oil, gas and mining at Carbon Tracker, an energy transition research group. “Incremental developments are welcome, but they need to be followed up with broader goals. Upstream emissions are only a very small part of the issue.”The OGCI announcement comes the same week presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden unveiled plans to spend $2 trillion creating a clean-energy economy with the goal of rapidly reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050, a big reason why European oil companies are embracing a similar goal.Dudley said it’s “completely coincidental” the OGCI plan was announced the same week as Biden’s. Despite widespread public criticism for its contribution to climate change, the oil and gas industry has proved it can adapt quickly to economic and political pressures, Dudley said.Big Oil’s new investment criteria “has got to be cleaner, it’s got to be economic for sure, it’s got to be within policy and it’s seen to be moving the envelope because everybody has a sense of urgency about this,” he said.(Updates with OGCI comment in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aramco-joins-exxon-bp-shell-040100759.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Invests $1B In Fuels Joint Venture With Reliance In India	BP PLC (BP) has entered into a $1 billion joint venture with Reliance Industries Ltd. to set up operations in India’s fuels and mobility markets and meet the fast-growing demand for energy in the country.Under the terms of the venture, BP has paid Reliance $1 billion for a 49% stake in the joint venture and Reliance will hold the remainder 51%. Operating under the Jio-bp brand, the partnership will expand Reliance’s current 1,400 fuel retail sites to up to 5,500 over the next five years. Jio-bp will also boost its presence from 30 to 45 airports and increase the staff employed in fuel service stations from 20,000 to 80,000 over the next five years.India “is a country that will require more energy for its economic growth and, as it prospers, its needs for mobility and convenience will accelerate,” BP CEO Bernard Looney said. “This new venture is a unique opportunity to build a leading, fast-growing business that can help meet India’s demands and create exciting new digital and low-carbon options for the future.”The partnership seeks to provide Indian consumers with advanced fuels with lower emissions, electric vehicle charging and other low carbon solutions over time.India is expected to be the fastest-growing fuels market in the world over the next 20 years, with the number of passenger cars in the country estimated to grow almost six-fold over the period.Shares in BP have lost 42% of their value this year as the coronavirus pandemic pushed oil prices to multi-year lows leading to declines in oil and gas output. The stock depreciated 4.7% to $22.08 in early afternoon U.S. trading.Meanwhile, five-star analyst Sam Margolin at Wolfe Research last month raised BP’s rating to Buy from Hold with a price target of $31, up from $29, saying that the company has &quot;a credible pathway&quot; to deleveraging and dividend coverage in 2021.Overall, Wall Street analysts share Margolin's bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy consensus shows 3 Buy ratings versus 1 Hold rating. The $29.67 average price target implies a 34% gain in the shares over the coming 12 months.

As Big Oil Stumbles, Total Manages to Stay on Its Feet	(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s oil giants came into 2020 promising shareholders they can “do it all” -- maintain generous dividends, keep the crude flowing and make a historic shift toward clean energy. Only one of them may succeed.Since the coronavirus pandemic wiped out oil demand, Royal Dutch Shell Plc shocked investors with its first dividend cut since the Second World War, while BP Plc announced 10,000 jobs cuts and the sale of its chemical business as debt soared. But Total SA has so far weathered the storm, and investors are confident Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne can avoid his rivals’ stumbles.They see the French company as an early adopter of clean energy, with multi-billion investments in solar, wind and batteries, but also a rare haven in an industry shattered by the slump in energy prices.“Total has probably the best balance sheet among the majors,” having spent its money wisely in recent years, said Laurent van Tuyckom, who manages high-dividend funds at Degroof Petercam Asset Management in Brussels. “We’re much more cautious on other heavyweights of the industry.”Total has taken steps to mitigate the effect of the downturn. It has cut costs, suspended a plan to increase its dividend by 5% to 6% per year, halted share buybacks, and given investors the option of taking the final quarterly dividend for 2019 in shares instead of cash. It also announced a plan to eliminate 1,000 jobs in France at a petrochemicals unit, and potentially more abroad.Those measures will save $7.5 billion this year, meaning the company can fund its major oil and gas projects, invest as much as $2 billion in low-carbon assets and keep paying its dividend even if oil remains at about $40 a barrel, Pouyanne has said. The payout will rise again when the economic situation has normalized, maybe from 2022, he said.Asset managers are confident Total can maintain its payout until the markets starts to recover. Most investors seem to agree, as the French company has the lowest dividend yield among its European peers, even after Shell’s two-thirds cut.Its peers are not so well placed. Eni Spa’s dividend is “more challenged than most peers at lower commodity prices,” said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Europe Ltd. JPMorgan said a cut to BP’s dividend is “well flagged”, particularly after Shell’s cut in April.Total can defend its dividend “even in an adverse scenario which would see the barrel staying around $40” said Regis Longlade, deputy chief executive officer of AG2R La Mondiale Gestion d’Actifs, which owns shares in Total and Shell. “It’s one of the most robust investment case in the industry. Total has one of the lowest breakevens in the market.”Total now needs less than $25 a barrel to cover its annual expenditure excluding the dividend payment, a drop of more than 75% compared to what it needed back in 2014. It is benefiting from spending cuts initiated since the previous down turn five years ago and investments in low-cost barrels. Its upstream operating expenditure has almost halved since 2014 to $5.4 a barrel, the lowest among the five supermajors, according to Total. Its gearing -- a measure of indebtedness -- has also halved.Writedown WoesYet Total may not be immune to another feature of the current downturn -- multibillion dollar asset writedowns. Last month, BP announced as much as $17.5 billion of charges, its biggest in a decade, saying it expects the pandemic to accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy. Shell soon followed, warning that it expected a writedown of $15 billion to $22 billion.“BP has made a major step forwards with its writedowns and the issue of financial risks linked with fossil energies,” said Aurelie Baudhuin, head of socially responsible investing research at Meeschaert Asset Management. “That will inevitably spill over to the entire industry one way or another.”Total should follow that example, by giving more details on its roadmap to net zero emissions, and broaden its ambitions to incorporate a worldwide scope, said Baudhuin. Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship, EOS at Federated Hermes also wants Total to follow BP, which “recently changed their management and accounting assumptions to be consistent with a Paris-aligned outlook on demand.”More Work NeededPouyanne is keeping pace with his rivals in the transition to clean energy. While Shell has set the ambition of becoming the world’s biggest power producer in 2030, Total has spent billions on electricity assets and plans to have more than 25 gigawatts of gross renewable generation capacity by 2025. It is targeting carbon neutrality for all its production and energy products used by its customers in Europe by 2050 or earlier.Total bought French battery maker Saft Groupe SA in a 950 million-euro ($1 billion) deal in 2016. It further diversified into power in 2018 with the 2-billion euro acquisition of Direct Energie SA, France’s third-largest utility. It recently announced plans to build batteries for electric vehicles in France and China, expanded in the power sector in Spain, India and Qatar, and announced its first deal in offshore wind in the North Sea.All these factors make Total one of the most attractive investments in the industry, especially since it trades at a discount to its peers, said AG2R’s Longlade.“Its low breakeven, its gearing among the lowest in the industry, and the ability of its management to adjust quickly to the crisis would justify that Total trades at a premium,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-stumbles-total-manages-040000899.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-30	2020-06-30 13:59:33	BP	BP p.l.c.	Shell and BP's Debt Problems Are Getting Worse	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The pandemic has now forced both of the U.K.’s oil majors to slash the value of their assets by billions of dollars. This is more than just an accounting issue for BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. In the real world, it makes it even harder for them to meet targets for cutting leverage — targets they were already straining to hit.Shell said on Tuesday it would take a $15 billion to $22 billion post-tax impairment charge after cutting its long-term view on oil and gas prices. BP warned earlier in June of potentially $18 billion in impairments.Whereas most non-financial companies assess leverage by comparing some measure of cash flow to net debt, BP and Shell do not. They use “gearing,” or net debt as a percentage of both net debt and equity. That equity number is the wildcard. If it suddenly falls, as happens with impairments, then gearing goes up. Shell says the impact of its impairments will push up gearing by three percentage points.Both BP and Shell are now even further away from their gearing goals. Shell aspires to about 25%. The measure rose steadily throughout 2019, and was 29% in the first quarter of 2020. BP’s gearing was last at 36%, against a target range of 20%-30%.It has always been easy to explain away or divert attention from repeated misses on these targets, as though they don’t really matter. Forthcoming disposal proceeds would bring gearing down, the companies would say. Shell could point to juicy cash returns to shareholders in dividends and buybacks. It’s hard to pay off debt when you’re doing that. On analyst calls, gearing is played down as a “noisy” number and just one among many ways of measuring leverage.But today, debt reduction is becoming important. ​​​The oil price will probably be volatile for some time, so balance sheets need a cushion. Investors have historically afforded a loftier valuation to the less highly geared U.S. oil majors. If gearing targets haven’t worked in the past, are there better ways of holding BP and Shell to account for attacking their debt piles?Shell has reduced its dividend, and analysts expect BP to follow. That will help. But it’s worth considering scrapping the existing gearing targets and starting over. One option would be to fall in with the rest of the corporate pack and measure leverage using cash flow metrics. That would be more helpful in assessing the ability to service debt. It’s probably also more in tune with how these companies manage their finances day to day.If gearing really is the best measure of leverage, then BP and Shell are going to need to set out a credible plan for getting it back down over time. Otherwise pick another type of target — one that can be met.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

Shell Warns of Record Writedown as Virus Curbs Oil Demand	(Bloomberg) -- Royal Dutch Shell Plc said it will write down between $15 billion and $22 billion in the second quarter, as the company gave investors a wider glimpse of just how severely the coronavirus crisis has hit Big Oil.The impairment is the firm’s largest since Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. and Shell Transport & Trading Co. merged in 2005, and shows how the pandemic has left no part of the energy giant’s sprawling business unscathed. Shell lost money from pumping oil, fuel sales fell and shipments of everything from liquefied natural gas to petrochemicals suffered.The lockdown-induced slump has permeated through the entire industry, which is reassessing both the value of its assets and longer-term business models. Shell’s large LNG business, which is central to its vision of the future of energy, is seen taking the biggest hit.“We see material downside for second-quarter earnings,” Banco Santander SA analyst Jason Kenney said. Despite a possible weaker performance relative to its peers, the Spanish bank still sees potential upside in the stock, as the bad news was largely anticipated.The drop in demand comes as little surprise. Oil majors’ earnings took a beating in the first quarter, and the companies warned that things would only get worse as the full impact of the pandemic started to be felt in March. Despite a recent rebound in consumption in some of the worst-hit countries, resurgent waves of the virus show the recovery remains fragile.Oil-product sales volumes will be 3.5 million to 4.5 million barrels a day in the second quarter, down from 6.6 million a year earlier, driven by a “significant drop” in demand because of the pandemic, Shell said Tuesday in a statement ahead of quarterly results on July 30.Shell also flagged that its upstream unit, traditionally the company’s core business, will suffer a loss in the second quarter. The division, which is responsible for pumping oil across the world, will take an impairment charge of $4 billion to $6 billion, mostly from North American shale and Brazilian assets.Shell said it has revised its mid- and long-term pricing and refining margin outlook, and expects gearing -- a measure of debt -- to increase by as much as 3% due to the impairment charges.The company’s B shares fell as much as 2.6% and traded down 2.3% at 1,241.40 pence as of 1:26 p.m. in London.Drastic ChangesThe coronavirus has exposed the vulnerability of some of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies, but also given them an opportunity to make investors swallow some unpleasant remedies. Since the pandemic started, Shell and BP Plc have made drastic changes to their businesses, from multibillion-dollar writedowns to big cuts to dividends and jobs.They explained these moves as responses to the dual threats of the lockdown-induced oil slump and the growing pressure to cut carbon emissions. BP has said oil and gas prices will be lower than expected in the coming decades as the virus hurts long-term demand and accelerates the shift to cleaner energy.Second-quarter performance at Shell’s in-house trading unit, which can be a boon when other parts of the business are hurting, is expected to be “below average,” the company said. Still, trading and optimization will offset “significantly lower” refining margins.When Shell reports its results next month, the market will be focused on the company’s outlook and any green-shoot developments, said Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel. The market is getting closer to balancing, he said, and while this isn’t necessarily bullish, “it’s better…it’s bad but it’s better.”The company indicated there was more pain to come from LNG sales, which have a price lag of three to six months compared with oil. The impact of crude prices on LNG margins became “more prominent” from June.Longer term, Shell is optimistic about the LNG market, with Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden telling Bloomberg in an interview in May that he expects the market to recover to pre-virus levels.In April, Van Beurden cut the company’s dividend for the first time since the Second World War. Last month, the Anglo-Dutch major said it would be well-placed to boost shareholder payouts again once the oil market recovers.“This morning’s announcement will cement the view that dividends will take longer to get back to their pre-crisis level than originally thought,” said The Share Centre analyst Helal Miah.(Adds analyst comment in 13th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-gives-first-glimpse-pandemic-063416332.html?.tsrc=rss

U.K.’s Richest Man Jim Ratcliffe Revisits Roots of Fortune With BP Deal	(Bloomberg) -- More than 15 years after Jim Ratcliffe bought part of BP Plc’s petrochemical business to help establish Ineos Group Holdings SA, the now billionaire is buying the rest.Ineos agreed to pay $5 billion for about 15 plants on Monday, reuniting them with ex-BP assets Ratcliffe acquired for about $9 billion in 2005. The U.K. chemicals giant will now look to improve and expand the sites, according to Ineos executive Tom Crotty, having long considered them a natural fit for the company.“The question back then was why we weren’t buying these bits, but they weren’t for sale,” Crotty said. “It’s always been a piece of the chemistry set that was missing for us.”Ineos and BP chemical plants operate side by side in some locations, including Hull in England and the Belgian city of Geel. The acquisition, which includes aromatic petrochemicals and acetyls, will expand Ineos into polyester and increase exposure to Asian markets including China, South Korea and Indonesia.For BP, the deal marks a significant step toward strengthening its balance sheet and accelerating a move away from oil and gas, which have been hammered by the coronavirus pandemic. Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney has also pledged to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050.Richest PersonRatcliffe made his $19.4 billion fortune piecing together unloved assets from oil majors into a more cohesive group that now ranks among the world’s top chemical makers. The 67-year-old still owns a majority stake and remains the driving force behind Ineos. He is ranked as the U.K.’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.A chemical engineer turned financier, Ratcliffe started out in 1998 by leasing a former BP chemicals site in Antwerp, Belgium. Over the course of the next two decades, he used it as a base to make multiple acquisitions from rivals --- including that landmark 2005 deal with BP -- earning a reputation for being a tough negotiator along the way.Alongside chemicals, Ratcliffe has turned his mind toward other areas, including buying a Swiss football team and a motorcycle jacket company, while sponsoring cycling and sailing teams. A driving enthusiast, he’s also bankrolling the development of an off-road vehicle.Ratcliffe orchestrated the deal with BP without financial advisers and negotiations were largely conducted remotely given Covid-19 restrictions. The deal will be financed using debt linked to Ineos’ Styrolution and Innovene arms, Crotty said, and should be completed by the end of the year.

2020-06-29	2020-06-29 12:51:02	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP To Sell Petrochemicals Business To Ineos For $5 Billion	BP PLC (BP) announced that it has agreed to sell its global petrochemicals business to Ineos for $5 billion sending shares up 3.3% in Monday’s U.S. pre-market trading.Under the terms of the agreement, Ineos will make an upfront deposit payment of $400 million to BP and the remaining $3.6 billion will be paid upon completion of the transaction. An additional $1 billion will be deferred and paid in three separate installments of $100 million in March, April and May next year with the remaining $700 million payable by the end of June 2021. The deal is expected to completed by the end of this year, subject to regulatory and other approvals.BP said the agreed sale is part of its strategic reinvention plan and means the company has now reached its $15 billion asset sale target a year earlier than originally scheduled. In addition, the transaction will further strengthen its balance sheet, the company said. The proceeds from the sale will be used by for general corporate purposes.“I recognise this decision will come as a surprise and we will do our best to minimise uncertainty,” BP CEO Bernard Looney said. “Strategically, the overlap with the rest of BP is limited. As we work to build a more focused, more integrated BP, we have other opportunities that are more aligned with our future direction.”“Today’s agreement is another deliberate step in building a BP that can compete and succeed through the energy transition,” Looney added.Over the past two decades, Ineos has bought a number of businesses from BP, such as the $9 billion purchase of Innovene in 2005, which was BP’s subsidiary focused on chemicals assets and included two refineries.Shares in BP have lost 40% of their value this year as the coronavirus pandemic pushed oil prices to multi-year lows leading to declines in oil and gas output. The stock depreciated 3.2% to $22.76 at Friday’s close.Meanwhile earlier this month, five-star analyst Sam Margolin at Wolfe Research raised BP’s rating to Buy from Hold with a price target of $31, up from $29, saying that the company has &quot;a credible pathway&quot; to deleveraging and dividend coverage in 2021.Overall, Wall Street analysts have a cautiously optimistic outlook on BP. The stock’s Moderate Buy consensus splits into 3 Buy ratings versus 2 Hold ratings. The $29.25 average price target implies a potential 29% gain in the shares over the coming 12 months.

2020-06-29	2020-06-29 11:37:22	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP to Sell Chemicals Unit to Ineos for $5 Billion	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc agreed to sell its chemicals business to Ineos Group Holdings SA, taking a big step toward strengthening its finances while also furthering its transitioning away from being a traditional oil company.The transaction means BP hits its target of selling $15 billion of assets ahead of schedule, as the oil industry faces immense financial pressure from the coronavirus crisis. The company recently made its biggest write-off in a decade and said it would lay off 10,000 staff by the end of this year.The announcement comes just months after new Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney set the London-based energy giant on course to eliminate its carbon emissions by 2050, a radical step that has since been followed by its peers.The deal is “the next strategic step in reinventing BP,” according to a company statement issued on Monday. It will “further strengthen BP’s balance sheet and delivers its target for agreed divestments a year earlier than originally scheduled.”BP shares rose as much as 3.1% and were trading at 314.2 pence as of 12:27 p.m. in London.Defend the DividendDespite poor margins recently, petrochemicals is generally seen as a resilient long-term part of the oil business, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Will Hares said in an interview. Given poor conditions for the sale of exploration and production assets, “this deal could be a sign that BP is doing its best to defend the dividend.”Following Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s surprise dividend cut last quarter, analysts have increasingly warned that BP’s payout could suffer the same fate. The company’s gearing -- a measure of net debt to equity -- has soared, while its dividend yield remains stubbornly above 10%, suggesting investors expect a cut.The much-needed cash won’t hit the company’s coffers for some time. Ineos will pay BP a deposit of $400 million, and a further $3.6 billion on completion. An additional $1 billion will be deferred and paid in three separate installments of $100 million in March, April and May 2021 with the remaining $700 million payable by the end of June 2021.BP also restructured the sale of assets to Hilcorp Energy Co. and Premier Oil Plc earlier this year, which in both cases will result in phased payments.The deal stands out against its peers, such as Shell and Exxon Mobil Corp., which have poured money into petrochemicals, one of the few areas of future growth for oil demand. But BP was already a smaller player in the sector, having sold its petrochemicals and refining business Innovene to Ineos in 2005 for $9 billion.The deal “makes strategic sense” from the company, consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. said.“BP held onto these assets in 2005 when they were making strong profits,” Steve Jenkins, vice president of Wood Mackenzie’s petrochemicals team, said in a note. “Now these chemicals businesses are struggling with over-capacity and BP is urgently raising cash.”(Adds further details, analyst comment from 10th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-sell-chemicals-unit-ineos-094652786.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-26	2020-06-26 18:19:22	BP	BP p.l.c.	Covid to Keep More Oil Underground, Forcing Drillers to Change	(Bloomberg) -- Hundreds of billions of barrels of oil stranded by weak demand could accelerate companies’ pivot to cleaner energy, or threaten their long-term survival.BP Plc raised the possibility of stranded oil assets when it announced this month it would take the biggest writedown on the value of its business in a decade. But it wouldn’t be the only oil company to leave crude in the ground as the pandemic ravages energy consumption. About 282 billion barrels of undiscovered oil is at risk of being stranded as the virus hastens peak demand, according to Rystad Energy AS.“It does start to have significant implications for how some of these companies are making their investment decisions,” said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co. “Some companies are starting to make investment decisions today and starting to pivot either towards shorter-cycle projects like shale or pivot towards renewables.”BP has already acknowledged that production will decline in the long term, and said whatever is pumped in 2050 “will have to be de-carbonized.” And French oil major Total SA has already started its pivot to renewables. Will other companies follow suit? If they don’t, they may have trouble getting access to the financing they need to keep the drills running over the next few decades, as lower demand locks their resource in the ground, according to Rowland.“There is going to be skepticism about what really is the terminal value of a lot of those assets,” she said. “It makes their investment proposition that much more of a challenge.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/covid-keep-more-oil-underground-181922863.html?.tsrc=rss

BP's dividend now yields over 10%. That seems to be hugely attractive for a large, diversified oil company.Source: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com Indeed, that yield is the highest among the largest oil producers, even for investors willing to look overseas for oil stocks. The dividends of Italy's Eni S.p.A. (NYSE:E) and France's Total S.A. (NYSE:TOT) are close to that of BP, but neither European company's yield is over 10%.The market, however, is aware of BP's dividend and is pricing BP stock accordingly. This isn't a case where investors have a wonderful opportunity to get double-digit annual returns, excluding share-price appreciation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRather, the BP stock price implies a very real expectation of a dividend cut. News last week suggests that such a cut is likely to occur -- and could arrive in a hurry. A Massive WritedownIn a press release last week, BP detailed its rather muted outlook for global oil prices. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the industry is well-known: oil futures even briefly went negative in April.  * 10 Consumer Stocks to Buy to Ride the Post-Covid-19 Wave But BP expects the pandemic to have a long-term impact as well. As the company wrote:bp's management also has a growing expectation that the aftermath of the pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system, as countries seek to 'build back better' so that their economies will be more resilient in the future.And so BP lowered its long-term outlook for oil and gas prices. For Brent crude, the company now expects prices of $55 per barrel, versus its previous forecast of $70. And BP now predicts that Henry Hub natural gas prices will stay below $3 per mm Btu (million British Thermal Units).That more negative view of the future will lead to significant charges in the present. BP anticipates that its second-quarter results will include impairment charges totaling $13 billion to $17.5 billion.That's obviously a huge sum. And it suggests that there will be significant near-term pressures on BP's dividend. A Dividend at RiskThe writedown will significantly reduce BP's equity. That, in turn, will increase its &quot;gearing,&quot; or its ratio of equity to debt.As one analyst told Bloomberg, BP's gearing could near 50% after the writedown. That may become the highest such figure among the large oil firms.More importantly from a near-term perspective, the figure is well above BP's long-term target of just 20% to 30%. And so it seems likely that debt reduction will become a priority for the company.The problem is that, in this environment, it's exceedingly difficult for BP to cut debt. Its 2020 cash flows are taking a hit from depressed oil prices. Asset sales will be difficult for the company at a time when nearly every other oil producer is looking to protect its own balance sheet. And the writeoff itself suggests that BP has significant acreage where drilling won't make economic sense in this &quot;new normal.&quot;That leaves a dividend cut  and cutting explorations budgets as the only near-term debt- reduction strategies. BP's dividend distributions cost over $8 billion annually. That means the company can at least start to tackle its debt load, which was $51.4 billion net of cash at the end of Q1, by cutting its dividend.The reason BP stock has a dividend yield of over 10% is not because the market isn't paying attention. It's because investors believe, for good reason, that a dividend cut is on the way. The Case for BP StockAll that said, I'm not completely bearish on BP stock. I've recommended the name in the past. And it's possible that the selloff went too far.One blunt way to make that argument is to compare the writedown to the decline of BP stock so far this year. The $17.5 billion figure at the high end of the projected writedown range sounds enormous. But BP stock has lost about $45 billion of market value so far this year.For several reasons, it's too simplistic to argue that the size of the writedown should match the decline of the company's market capitalization. But an investor can argue that lower oil prices are priced into the shares,  at least to some extent. Meanwhile, oil bulls might see BP's higher debt load as a relatively positive: it could cause the shares to climb further if BP's updated projections prove too conservative.Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) still seems to have significant strategic questions and a lengthening history of substandard returns. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is a solid operator, but its stock probably is the most expensive among the large oil producers  across a variety of metrics.So there's a case for BP stock as a nice combination of execution (which had been solid since the Deepwater Horizon tragedy) and value at these levels.But that case can't include the dividend. Not at this point. BP's dividend is at significant risk, and investors should prepare accordingly.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

BP Faces $17.5B Q2 Hit, Expects Lower Oil Prices	BP plc (NYSE: BP) is writing down $17.5 billion in assets in the second quarter and forecasting lower oil prices.The oil company said Monday that it has revised its long-term price predictions and is lowering them and extending the period covered to 2050.&quot;These actions will lead to non-cash impairment charges and write-offs in the second quarter, estimated to be in an aggregate range of $13 billion to $17.5 billion post-tax,&quot; BP said in a press release. What Happened: The company has revised long-term price estimates. For Brent oil, the company estimates an average of around $55 per barrel and $2.90 per mmBtu for Henry Hub gas ($2020 real), from 2021-2050. BP has also revised its carbon prices for the period to 2050 at $100/teCO2 in 2030 ($2020 real).The coronavirus pandemic drove the price of oil to less than $20 a barrel; it has since recovered and was trading around $38 a barrel at the time of publication. Why It's Important: BP CEO Bernard Looney said in February that the company set out to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner.&quot;As part of that process, we have been reviewing our price assumptions over a longer horizon. That work has been informed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which increasingly looks as if it will have an enduring economic impact,&quot; the CEO said in a statement. On June 8, Looney announced 10,000 job cuts following a global slump in demand for oil due to the coronavirus crisis.BP Price Action: BP shares were trading down 4.65% at $23.60 premarket Monday. The stock has a 52-week high of $42.70 and a 52-week low of $15.51.Related Links:BP Cuts 10K Jobs As Coronavirus Hits Oil DemandUSO Tanks After Oil ETF's Temporary Trading HaltSee more from Benzinga  * BP Cuts 10K Jobs As Coronavirus Hits Oil Demand  * Russia Declares State Of Emergency Over Arctic Oil Spill  * Why BPs' Stock Is Trading Higher Today(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Because of climate change, BP believes a portion of its assets are “stranded assets” — hydrocarbons that can never be burnt.  Bernard Looney, the new boss at BP, is more upfront than some peers in stating that meeting climate change targets is triggering financial charges.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5fd3432c-3c44-3030-824a-72cb2821528a/bp%2Fstranded-assets%3A-the-green.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Writes Off Billions as Covid Redraws Rules of Oil Demand	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc will make the biggest writedown on the value of its business since the Deepwater Horizon disaster a decade ago, as the coronavirus pandemic hurts long-term oil demand and accelerates the shift to cleaner energy.In a dramatic revision that prompted questions about the affordability of its dividend, the British giant cut its estimates for oil and gas prices in the coming decades between 20% and 30%. It also expects the cost of carbon emissions to be more than twice as high as before. Under its new Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney, BP has been quicker than many of its peers to plan for a low-carbon world. Yet moves toward a more sustainable future are bringing financial pain today, and investors are asking fundamental questions about the value of oil majors.BP is reviewing its projects against those new price assumptions, which could result in some oil discoveries being left in the ground. The risk of so-called stranded assets is just one of many challenges the industry faces as trends in energy consumption shift and policymakers pursue green targets.The company will take non-cash impairment charges and write-offs in the second quarter, estimated to be in a range of $13 billion to $17.5 billion post-tax. That could increase gearing -- the ratio of net debt to equity -- toward 50%, by far the highest in the industry, said RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria.“BP’s balance sheet was stretched even without this impairment, and is likely to look even more stretched following it,” Borkhataria said in a note.Enduring ImpactShares of BP fell 3.8% to 310.7 pence as of 11:51 a.m. in London.“BP now sees the prospect of the pandemic having an enduring impact on the global economy, with the potential for weaker demand for energy for a sustained period,” the company said in a statement on Monday. “The aftermath of the pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy.”In February, BP outlined its ambitions to become a “net-zero” company by 2050. The company acknowledged that production will decline in the long term, and said whatever is pumped in 2050 “will have to be de-carbonized.” Peers including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and Equinor ASA have also set out agendas for what’s becoming an existential challenge for the oil industry.Two of those companies -- Shell and Equinor -- cut their dividends last quarter. A growing number of analysts expect BP to follow.Dividend Cut?”It does now look increasingly likely that BP will reduce the dividend alongside the second quarter results,” Barclays said in a note. “With the shares trading on a 10% dividend yield, this already seems to be factored into the share price.”BP’s revised investment appraisal long-term price assumptions from 2021 to 2050 now average $55 a barrel for Brent crude, down from $70 previously, and $2.90 per million British thermal units for Henry Hub gas, compared with $4 before.It expects the cost of emitting a ton of carbon dioxide to be $100 in 2030, up from a previous assumption of $40. These new prices are “broadly in line” with the Paris climate goals, BP said.“This huge dent in BP’s balance sheet suggests it has finally dawned on BP that the climate emergency is going to make oil worth less,” Charlie Kronick, senior climate adviser for Greenpeace U.K., said in a statement. “BP must protect its workforce, and offer training to help people move into sustainable jobs in decommissioning and offshore wind.”The company is scheduled to publish its second-quarter results on Aug. 4. Looney will give a more detailed road map for BP’s transition to clean energy and net-zero emissions in September.(Updates with historical context in first paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-write-off-billions-covid-063147574.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-06-15	2020-06-15 11:45:31	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP Submits to Brutal Reality on the Future of Oil	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- BP Plc’s potential $18 billion writedown underscores just how significant a turning point 2020 is becoming for the oil industry. It baldly acknowledges that the major hydrocarbon producers are sitting on oil fields that will never be developed — because the pandemic has curbed energy demand and increased the desire for renewables within the supply mix.The British oil giant has a new chief executive officer and a new finance director and it was already trying to break with the past before the impact of the Covid-19 crisis became fully apparent. The outbreak has prompted a more radical reassessment of BP’s future role and what its assets are worth.BP’s assumption is that the long-term price of Brent crude will be about $55 per barrel, up to 30% lower than it thought previously. Among its oil major peers, the company’s management is shifting from the bullish to the bearish group. On that basis, some fields won’t earn adequate returns, and some of the world’s fossil fuels that would have been extracted and burnt now won’t be.It’s a moment to be compared not only with peers’ comments of late, but with the seismic revaluations the industry has inflicted on investors over the past two decades — think ConocoPhillips’s $34 billion of asset impairments in the financial crisis.The shift partly reflects the near-term reduction in economic activity. Energy demand is driven by gross domestic product and that’s expected to be sharply lower this year and next. BP also sees the pandemic accelerating the move to cleaner forms of energy as policymakers look to restart economies using less conventional energy, pushing up the cost of emitting carbon.Equities may have recovered from their lows on the expectation that many countries are returning to work. But oil stocks have not, and manufacturers such as Tesla Inc., squarely focused on the transition to cleaner forms of power, have sharply outperformed.Altogether, this hopefully begins to address the economic conundrum that has hampered the energy transition: the relative competitiveness of dirty and clean energy. The higher returns from putting another dollar into the development of conventional energy assets have simply been too tempting for oil majors to allocate serious funds to renewables. It may be some time before the returns BP makes from clean energy can compare with those from oil. Perhaps it can make a virtue of diversification, offering large business clients energy from multiple sources in a way that combines security of supply with an increased proportion of renewable provision.For now, the immediate impact on BP of the writedowns will be to weaken its balance sheet by inflating gearing, which measures net debt as a percentage of total capital. This was 36% at the end of the first quarter (against a long-term target of 20% to 30%). How significant this is will depend on the view of the credit-rating firms. But the pressure to lower leverage will be intense. That, in turn, forces a rethink of BP’s generous dividend.A few weeks ago, CEO Bernard Looney was unapologetic about maintaining the payout amid the pandemic, suggesting the board would wait and see how the crisis developed. The contrast between that message and the hard conclusions aired on Monday couldn’t be more stark.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

BP Expects to Incur Up To $17.5 Billion In Charges in Q2; Shares Drop In Pre-Market	"BP PLC (BP) said it expects to incur up to $17.5 billion in non-cash impairment charges and write-offs in the second quarter, as the enduring impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy is poised to lead to weaker energy demand for a sustained period.Shares fell 5.6% to $23.36 in Monday’s pre-market trading.The charge, which is estimated to be in an aggregate range of $13 billion to $17.5 billion post-tax, comes after BP lowered its investment appraisal long-term price assumptions by an average of about 30% and extended the period covered to 2050.The revised long-term price assumptions are now for an average of around $55/bbl for Brent and $2.90 per mmBtu for Henry Hub gas ($2020 real), from 2021-2050.In addition, the oil magnate expects that the pandemic’s aftermath will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system, as countries seek to “build back better” so that their economies will be more resilient in the future. As part of its long-term strategic planning, BP is also considering, the development of some of its exploration intangible assets.“In February we set out to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner,” said BP CEO Bernard Looney. “Since then we have been in action, developing our strategy to become a more diversified, resilient and lower carbon company.”“All that will result in a significant charge in our upcoming results, but I am confident that these difficult decisions – rooted in our net zero ambition and reaffirmed by the pandemic – will better enable us to compete through the energy transition,” he added.Second-quarter results are expected to be released on August 4th.Shares in BP have lost 34% of their value this year as the coronavirus pandemic pushed oil prices to multi-year lows leading to declines in oil and gas output. The stock advanced 2.8% to $24.75 at Friday’s close.Meanwhile, five-star analyst Sam Margolin at Wolfe Research earlier this month raised BP’s rating to Buy from Hold with a price target of $31, up from $29, saying that the company has ""a credible pathway"" to deleveraging and dividend coverage in 2021.Overall, Wall Street analysts have a cautiously optimistic outlook on BP. The stock’s Moderate Buy consensus splits into 3 Buy ratings versus 2 Hold ratings. The $29.25 average price target implies a potential 18% gain in the shares over the coming 12 months.

2020-06-08	2020-06-08 16:18:15	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP to Cut 10,000 Jobs as Virus Accelerates Reorganization	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc plans to cut 10,000 jobs as the slump in oil prices accelerates its move to slim down for the transition to cleaner energy.The coronavirus pandemic has hit companies' earnings and forced many to change the way they operate. European competitor Royal Dutch Shell Plc is said to be offering voluntary redundancies in a bid to become leaner, and U.S. rivals Chevron Corp. and Marathon Oil Corp. are among others laying off employees.BP will let go of 14% of its workforce, Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney said in an internal note. The move will mostly affect staff in office-based jobs and those holding senior roles, with the top 400 positions expected to be cut by one-third.Looney, 49, told staff that the job cuts were in line with plans set out in February to prepare BP for deep reductions in carbon emissions. At the time, the Irishman said BP would dismantle its upstream and downstream businesses and replace them with 11 new teams. “I think it would be insincere not to suggest that there will be some staff layoffs as part of this program,” Looney said in an interview with Bloomberg in February. The pandemic and crude’s subsequent collapse have however accelerated the process, leading the company to “go deeper at this stage than we originally intended,” he said in the note to staff.“Because of the changes in the reporting structure, BP was always more likely to make changes to headcount,” than its European peer Shell, which is largely continuing operations as before, Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said. “I’m surprised it’s such a big cut.Days after taking BP’s helm, Looney announced that the company would eliminate all emissions from its own operations and production by 2050, as well as slashing those produced by its consumers. Since then, oil prices have plunged as the coronavirus pandemic has cratered demand, forcing producers to reign in spending and put projects on hold. Looney is adamant that the crisis only reinforces the need to “reinvent BP” and press ahead with its new climate ambition.Last month, BP began the second phase of its reorganization, reducing senior manager positions to around 120 people from 250. The new appointments will begin their roles from July 1 and continue the reorganization, which is expected to be finalized by the end of the year.People Costs“We are spending much, much more than we make -- I am talking millions of dollars, every day,” Looney wrote. “It currently costs around $22 billion a year to run the company -- of which around $8 billion is people costs.” BP’s net debt rose by $6 billion in the first quarter of this year.BP also spends about $8 billion a year in dividend payments to shareholders. The company has come under scrutiny for maintaining the payout even as its debt increased. While Looney has dodged repeated questions on whether a cut to its dividend is on the cards for the second quarter of the year, he has soften his language saying its a decision made by the board on a quarterly basis. That compares to previous comments in which he said it was BP’s job to maintain the dividend.The move stands in contrast to European rival Shell, which slashed its dividend by two-thirds last quarter. The Dutch major is undertaking its own reorganization, but so far is offering voluntary redundancies, scaling back on external recruitment and reviewing expatriate staff contracts, according to people with knowledge of the matter. In a memo to staff, CEO Ben van Beurden said that over the coming months, Shell would “go through a comprehensive review of the company.”BP had committed to a three-month freeze on job cuts during the peak of the pandemic, starting in early March. Promotions were also frozen but will resume in July “in a measured way,” the CEO said. Cash bonuses for the year will be “very unlikely,” he said, without clarifying whether that extends to BP’s trading division. Staff will be able to apply for voluntary redundancy starting June 15.Senior management will also not receive pay increases this year, while junior and mid-ranking staff will only get them from October. Employees at filling stations won’t be included in the reorganization as they’re considered front-line workers. Their wages rose in April and will climb again in August.The real impact of the job cuts and reorganization for the British supermajor is likely to become apparent in September, Gammel said. BP is set to hold a capital markets day then where it will outline details of its ambition to slash carbon emissions.“They’ll certainly want to be ready to go in September,” Gammel said.(Adds Jefferies comments in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-cut-10-000-jobs-161815585.html?.tsrc=rss

At this writing, the S&P 500 index stands at 3,201, just 5.5% below its all-time high. That high, reached back in February, came the day before the bottom fell out of the stock market, as the coronavirus crisis triggered the steepest, deepest – and fastest – stock market drop on record. And now we are in the midst of a prolonged bull-rally, as the markets have been trending upwards since bottoming out on March 23.What’s an investor to do? The natural inclination during a bear market is to defend the portfolio and make conservative plays toward defensive dividend stocks, while the inclination during a rally is to go with the winners and stake positions in the stocks that are climbing most rapidly. The two strategies don’t often overlap, and the future remains clouded even though sentiment is high for now.At Wells Fargo, strategist Christopher Harvey believes that defensive moves are obsolete for now, and that investors should “start adding risk.”“We’re starting to price in a less bad scenario. Things are getting slightly better at the margin… A few weeks ago, for the first time in a long time, we went overweight on value. Now, what we are telling [investors] is we want them to start putting risk into the portfolio,” Harvey said.The strategist is advising investors to look for stocks that are positioned for a strong comeback. These are not necessarily the stocks that have been doing the best in the current rally; rather, they are stocks that will benefit most as the economy reopens. That reopening is happening now, in fits and starts, as some states continue their lockdown policies and others try to get back to business. With this in mind, we’ve opened the TipRanks database and pulled up three relevant stock calls from three of Wells Fargo's top analysts. These are stocks with at least 7% dividend yield, and in the eyes of the Wells Fargo analysts, at least 10% upside potential. Let's take a closer look. EQT Midstream Partners (EQM)We’ll start in the energy industry, with a $4.8 billion mid-cap player in the important midstream segment. EQM provides natural gas pipeline and storage services for the Pennsylvania/West Virginia/Ohio sections of the Appalachian basin. This region, in the rugged, low mountains of the East, is one of North America’s richest natural gas production areas, and a center of the fracking industry. EQM is also involved in that latter, providing water supply and waste-water disposal services for gas fracking companies.EQM holds a sound position in an essential industry, and has been able to maintain revenues and earnings despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Q1 earnings numbers beat the forecast by a wide margin. The $1.08 EPS was well ahead of the 95-cent estimate, while revenues grew 16.25% year-over-year to reach $453 million, 14% ahead of expectations.In addition, for income-minded investors, the company has made moves to maintain the dividend even in difficult times. Management lowered the payment – never a good look, really – but the new payout of 38.75 cents per share quarterly gives a yield of 7.43% and an annualized payment of $1.55 per share. These are solid numbers that significantly outperform the services industry average yield of 1.4%.Much of EQM’s potential is tied up in the Mountain Valley Pipeline. This project, in which the company is heavily invested, is delayed by regulatory and permitting hurdles, but is widely expected to come online in 2021.Covering this stock for Wells Fargo is analyst Michael Blum. Noting the pipeline delays, he writes at the bottom line, “EQM is well positioned to benefit from improving natural gas fundamentals heading into 2021 due to the expected decline in associated gas production. We see … the pending completion of MVP as positive…”Blum sets a $27 price target here, in support of his Buy rating. His target implies a healthy upside potential of 17%. (To watch Blum’s track record, click here)Overall, EQT Midstream gets a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 3 Buy and 2 Hold ratings set in recent weeks. Shares are selling for $23.18, and the $23.20 average price target is less bullish than Blum’s. (See EQM stock analysis at TipRanks)BP PLC (BP)Next up, we move from mid-cap to industry-leading giant. BP, with a market cap of $93 billion, is one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies, and reported $278 billion in revenue for 2019. While that was down from the year before, the $10 billion in net profits beat the expected $9.7 billion.And then came Q1 2020. We all know the story. Back in April, oil prices dropped dramatically, as demand was quenched by the ongoing economic shutdowns. Oil producers don’t have the luxury of simply shutting off the pumps when demand falls; the equipment must be maintained, and it is not easy to restart a well that has been capped. The bounce back in prices since the April low has been helpful, but only partially. Even so, BP saw net profit fall 67% yoy in Q1, from Q1 2019’s $2.4 billion to the current figure of $800 million. Even though Q1 earnings dropped so drastically they remained positive, but looking ahead Q2 is expected to show a loss of 37 cents per share.Through everything, however, BP has kept up its dividend payment. The company remains committed to the payments, and has even increased its debt load to do so. The current dividend is 63 cents per share quarterly, annualized to $2.52, gives a yield of 9.65%. Compared to the 3% yield among utility peer companies, the attraction is clear.Roger Read, another of Wells Fargo’s analysts, is cautious here but also sees a path forward for BP. He writes, “…BP's expected free cashflow generation through 2022 should support reductions in leverage and capacity to raise its dividend in 2020 and beyond.”Read gives the stock a Buy rating, and backs it with a $31 price target implying room for 15% upside growth in the next 12 months. (To watch Read’s track record, click here)The Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating on BP is derived from 7 reviews, including 4 Buys and 3 Holds. The average price target of $32.20 suggests a 16% premium from the $27.81 current trading price. (See BP stock analysis on TipRanks)CenturyLink, Inc. (CTL)The last stock on our list here is a communications services firm, in the cloud-based tech niche. CenturyLink’s products offer customers solutions for networking and online security, a vital industry in today’s connected work environment – and even more vital during the current corona crisis, with so many office workers moving to telecommuting. The urgency of online security is clearer now than ever.That clear from CTL’s Q1 earnings, which not only grew 12% sequentially, but also beat the forecast by a penny. The 37 cents reported was even 8% higher than the year-ago quarter.CTL’s steady earnings underlie the company’s dividend. The payment has been stable for 5 quarters – and management recently announced that the next payout, set for June 12, will remain at 25 cents per share, or $1 annually. At this level, the dividend yields 9.43%, a solid return by any standard.Wells Fargo’s Jennifer Fritzsche, rated 5-stars in the TipRanks database, acknowledges that leading-edge tech company inhabit a capricious landscape, but is optimistic about CTL’s prospects. She writes, “In our view – the co. made its difficult capital allocations decisions last year and we see that dividend as secure near term.  If one lesson will be (crystal) clear coming out of this crisis, it is that fiber is critical and necessary ‘railroad tracks’ (to quote WSJ) in our new normal.  CTL has more of that asset than any public co.”Supporting her Buy rating on the stock, Fritzsche gives CTL a $12 price target, indicating room for 10% upside growth. (To watch Fritzsche’s track record, click here)While Fritzsche is optimistic here, her Wall Street peers remain cautious. CTL shares have a Hold from the analyst consensus, based on 2 Buys, 4 Holds, and 4 Sells. Shares are selling for $10.24, but the average price target is $9.91. Time will tell if Fritzsche’s bullish stance is the correct course for CTL.

BP Discusses Sale of More Than $1 Billion Stake in Giant Oman Gas Project	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc is in early-stage discussions to sell about a 10% stake in a key gas field in Oman as part of the energy giant’s plans to cut debt, according to people familiar with the matter.London-based BP is talking with interested parties about cutting part of its 60% holding in the Khazzan natural gas field, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. The 10% stake is likely to fetch more than $1 billion and is drawing interest from other large energy companies, they said.A stake sale would help BP deliver on its goal to achieve $15 billion in divestments by mid-2021 -- crucial for easing its debt burden. The company has bolstered its financial reserves as the double impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a crash in oil prices hit profits in the first quarter. In April, BP confirmed its commitment to completing the sale of its Alaska business to Hilcorp Energy Co. on revised terms.No final decisions have been made, and there’s no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, the people said. A representative for BP declined to comment.Khazzan is unique because it’s one of the few fields outside the U.S. which uses the technology that kicked off the shale boom. While the rocks BP drills into aren’t shale, the company has applied hydraulic fracturing to boost output at the site. BP’s partner in the Khazzan field, Oman Oil Co., sold a 10% stake in the project to Malaysia’s state oil company in 2018.In the same year, BP and Oman Oil signed off on the second phase of the onshore Khazzan project, called Ghazeer. The new field is expected to start production in 2021 and boost overall output by 50% to 1.5 billion cubic feet (42.5 million cubic meters) a day, BP said at the time. Ghazeer was tied in to Khazzan in April, almost a year before it was scheduled to start producing.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-discusses-sale-more-1-115449675.html?.tsrc=rss

Will BP (NYSE:BP) stock see an additional boost? The oil giant's shares have moved higher from their March sell-off lows. Rising from $15.51 per share to $23.62 per share, BP stock got a more than 50% gain in two months.Source: TK Kurikawa / Shutterstock.com Yet, other integrated names have performed even better during this timeframe. Take Chevron (NYSE:CVX), for instance. CVX shares are up about 80% from their 52-week lows. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)? Their shares have doubled since their March lows.So, what's the issue here? More like two issues. With investors anticipating a dividend cut and the company shouldering a massive debt load, there are plenty of reasons for concern.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite these overhangs, today's prices may be a solid entry point for BP stock. Sure, risks remain. However, energy prices continue to bounce back. With the novel coronavirus soon in the rearview mirror, ""return to normal"" will finally happen. With these factors in mind, there's plenty of potential for shares to move higher. Why the Rebound Has Only Just Started For BP StockOil may no longer be trading at negative prices, but it's still substantially lower than where it was just a few months prior. At the start of 2020, crude oil was trading above $60 a barrel. Today? Around $34 a barrel.  * 7 Excellent Penny Stocks Ready to Roar Besides beaten-down prices, things are moving in the right direction. The coronavirus took its toll. With much of the world's economic activity brought to a halt, it's no surprise demand for petroleum collapsed.Yet, with the pandemic slowly ending, expect energy prices to continue bouncing back. Granted, experts like the EIA (Energy Information Administration) don't see prices heading above $50 per barrel until the end of 2021.However, BP is taking active steps to improve its cash flow situation while oil lingers at lower-than-normal prices. By slashing costs, the company expects its breakeven oil price to fall from $56 a barrel in 2019 to just $35 a barrel in 2021.Granted, this implies continued profitability challenges this year. But with Wall Street taking a forward-looking approach, shares could continue to climb in tandem with oil prices, as investors anticipate a rebound in net income and cash flow.In short, shares look appealing as a bottom-fisher's buy. There are some risks to keep in mind before you put in a buy order. Is the Dividend Safe?A dividend cut seems to be the other shoe that's yet to drop. As InvestorPlace's Tom Taulli wrote May 18, the company's current cash flows can't cover the dividend. In short, shares now have a seemingly high yield of 10.7%, but that's only because investors expect a cut sometime soon.Is their validity to these fears? Peers like Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.B, NYSE:RDS.A) have already slashed their dividends. And analysts like Morgan Stanley's Martijn Rats think BP is the next one to announce a cut. He sees the company reducing its dividend by half in order to avoid taking on additional debt.Speaking of debt, that's the other issue at hand with this company. Taulli touched on this in his write-up, stating that the company's outstanding debt continues to climb. Coupled with reduced cash flow, this could mean a serious liquidity situation.Or does it? Based on a market update from back in April, the company detailed their liquidity situation, and their game plan to ride out today's storms. As of March 31, BP had $32 billion in cash and available credit lines.To combat sharp declines in cash flow, the company announced a 25% cut to capital expenditures. They also plan billions in cost-cutting across their upstream (exploration) and downstream (refining/marketing) business units. Pending asset sales could also free up additional capital.The situation at BP is far from perfect, yet these aforementioned risks are likely accounted for in today's valuation. When the other shoes does drop, don't expect shares to fall much further from here. Risks Remain, But BP Could Move HigherThings turn on a dime in the oil patch. Whether it be Middle East conflict, trade wars, or pandemics, it's tough to ""predict the unpredictable"" with energy prices. With today's crisis slowly dissipating, it's fair to assume a bounce back in demand is just around the corner. In short, plenty of reason for oil prices to continue trending higher.Although the company has a lot on its plate regarding debt and an unsustainable dividend, investors have largely priced these risks into the current share price. If and when the dividend gets a haircut, don't expect shares to sell off further.In short, with the potential for shares to rally in tandem with rising oil prices, consider BP stock a buy.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single-stock analysis since 2016.

They would have to be cheap stocks with low price-earnings ratios and high dividend yields. The idea is that by diversifying a portion of your portfolio in non-U.S. stocks, you will enhance your overall returns.Often, foreign equities provide a return that is not correlated with U.S. stocks. At least, that is the theory. There are some significant drawbacks. I have managed non-U.S. equity portfolios on the institutional side for a good number of years and am well familiar with these issues.For one, non-U.S. stocks are subject to currency fluctuations. When the dollar rises, the U.S. dollar return on non-U.S. equities tends to lag. However, I have learned that this effect tends to recycle over a number of years and sort of washes out.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA second issue is that often, non-U.S. stocks pay dividends just twice a year. This is because the vast majority of foreign companies only report their earnings semi-annually. However, the larger U.S. listed American Depository Receipts (ADR) or American Depository Shares (ADS) tend to report quarterly and pay their dividends that way. This occurs either because U.S. holders are a big percentage of the share base, or the company perceives that its stock price is ""made"" in the U.S.Moreover, another issue is that many non-U.S. companies will pay their dividends out as a percentage of their semi-annual earnings. In other words, the dividends paid each year can fluctuate, based on profits. U.S. companies tend to pay out a steady dividend that increases over time. I have learned again that the larger non-U.S. stocks have started following the steady dividend approach.The following five cheap stocks are worthwhile investments. They all have higher-than-normal dividend yields that tend to be paid quarterly. They also have low price-earnings ratios.Here are five cheap stocks -- that pay nice dividends -- to buy now:  * BP Midstream Partners (NYSE:BPMP)  * Publicis Groupe (OTCMKTS:PUBGY)  * Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO)  * Vodafone Group (NASDAQ:VOD)  * Total (NYSE:TOT)Let's dive in and look at these foreign, cheap stocks more closely. Foreign Cheap Stocks: BP Midstream Partners (BPMP)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 12.5%BP (NYSE:BP) is a profitable foreign stock with a nice 10.9% dividend yield. But I thought I would focus on one of its spinoff companies, BP Midstream Partners. BPMP has a higher dividend yield than BP.BPMP is a U.S.-listed master limited partnership (MLP) that is focused solely on the midstream portion of the oil and gas life cycle. That involves running oil and gas onshore and offshore pipelines and terminals.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Now that more companies are looking to store oil and gas, its assets are close to fully occupied.BPMP declared a quarterly dividend on April 15 for 34.75 cents per share. That works out to an annualized dividend of $1.39. At today's price of $11, the stock yields 12.5%.  This is higher than BP's distribution yield of just under 11%.The company reported excellent results for Q1 on May 8. It says that the quarterly distribution is covered 1.17 times by its earnings. Moreover, BPMP says it is targeting a 5% increase in its distributions to shareholders in 2020 over 2019.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Have Nothing But Upside In Their Future At 7.3 times earnings, with a 16.8% free cash flow yield and a 12.5% dividend yield, BPMP is very profitable and cheap. Investors should take a close look at the company. Publicis Groupe (PUBGY)Source: shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 4.9%Next on my list of cheap stocks is Publicis Groupe. This is a French advertising, communications and digital marketing company. Publicis has its tentacles in a lot of related areas like media, technology, healthcare communications and consulting services. It owns famed companies Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett.Publicis Groupe trades on the over-the-counter market. Its dividend yield has been about 9%, and the forward price-earnings ratio is about 7. So it is a profitable company, but a cheap stock.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA On April 13, Publicis reported its revenue, which was up 17%, although it included the effects of the acquisition of Epsilon. Its organic growth was down by 2.9% over last year. The company did not report its earnings, which apparently are done on a semi-annual basis.In addition, Publicis Groupe decided to cut its dividend by 50% to 1.15 euros. This works out to about 31.12 cents per ADR.There are four PUBGY ADRs per French ordinary share. As a result, PUBGY has a dividend yield of 4.9%. The company said it will pay the dividend in September.So Publicis Groupe is a cheap and profitable foreign stock with an above-average dividend yield. Rio Tinto Group (RIO)Source: BalkansCat / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 8.4%Rio Tinto is a $74 billion mining company based in London. It produces iron ore, bauxite, copper, gold, silver, aluminum and a host of other commodities.Last year, Rio Tinto started paying dividends four times a year. It is still not clear that it will continue with this practice. I suspect it will, as there does not seem to be an announcement to the contrary. Based on last year's dividend of $3.82 per share, RIO stock yields 8.4%.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Moreover, the company has a website section showing consensus financial information, including production, revenue and earnings estimates by all its sell-side analysts. This is not allowed by U.S. regulators for U.S. stocks, for no good reason. But it is fairly common for foreign stocks under looser financial information regulations.Based on this I estimate that earnings will be $5.04 per ADR this year. The company just needs global lockdowns to relax, or at least ease up.This will increase the demand for global committees, especially iron and copper. As demand rises, the price of these commodities will increase and the company will make more money.This puts the stock at a very cheap multiple of just 9 times earnings. So, combined with the 8.4% dividend, RIO stock offers very good value for investors. Vodafone Group (VOD)Source: Photos by D / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 6.6%Vodafone is a telecom and cable TV company based in the United Kingdom. The company has a $43.8 billion market value and its ADR is listed on the Nasdaq Exchange.VOD stock has a very high dividend yield at 6.6% and is quite attractive to investors at this level. It pays the dividend twice a year. Vodafone kept its final dividend level with last year in its earnings announcement on May 12.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA This requires a little explanation. First of all, Vodafone is like most other UK stocks that report their earnings and dividends twice a year. But for some reason, even though VOD's earnings are in pounds, it pays out the dividend in eurocents.So for this fiscal year ending March 31, the Vodafone annual dividend was kept stable at 9 eurocents per share. Now since there are 10 ordinary shares for every one VOD ADR, and since the exchange rate is $1.0823 per euro, the U.S. dividend per VOD ADR is about 97 cents. That makes the annualized yield about 6.6%.To make things more complicated, the upcoming final dividend (half of the total dividend, since an interim dividend was already paid) is set at 4.5 eurocents per ordinary share. This will be paid on Aug. 7, 2020. This effectively makes the upcoming payment a dividend yield of about 3.3%. This depends on the exchange rate when the ADR payment is set.Vodafone's earnings for the year ending March were reasonably good. The bottom line is that the company expects its FY 2021 free cash flow to decline slightly from 5.7 billion pounds to 5.4 billion pounds. As a result, I expect the dividend will be kept level.This makes VOD stock very attractive as a stable, well-covered and high-dividend play for income investors. Total (TOT)Source: MDOGAN / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 8.8%Total is a French oil and gas company. Last year the company paid four dividends to its shareholders, although it calls three of them ""interim"" dividends and the last one a ""final"" dividend.This past year, the company increased its dividend 5% to 2.68 euros per share. This works out to $2.92 per ADR.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA As a result, the stock has a very attractive dividend yield of 8.8% for investors.I estimate that the stock is also cheap at just 7.4 times earnings. In its most recent Q1 earnings presentation, Total said its break-even level is at $25 per barrel of oil.So I expect the company will be able to stay profitable this quarter. As economic activity picks up, the company will be able to make more money once the price of oil rises.This is an attractively priced stock at below 8 times this year's earnings, based on the company's recent earnings results.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-05-06	2020-05-06 15:17:33	BP	BP p.l.c.	How the Mighty Have Fallen In Oil	The oil and shale industries are drowning like never before. Washington is willing to find ways to bail out the industry but many analysts find that negative oil prices we recently witnessed were a warning, not an anomaly. In fact, if oil producers don't cut the acute state of oversupply, these negative figures will be back and perhaps already in a month's time to force them to do it.BankruptcyThis turbulence has led yet another energy company into bankruptcy as Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc (NYSE: DO) is the fifth publicly traded oil company to file for bankruptcy in just the last month, according to BankruptcyData.com.Turmoil always cleans out weak players and this is a company that was posting losses even before these dark times. With 2,500 workers, it conducted offshore drilling with 15 rigs working for giants such as Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) and BP p.l.c. (NYSE: BP). Diamond lost $357 million last year which is nearly twice the loss it posted in 2018 as its revenue dropped 12% to just under $1 billion. With losses in four of the last five years, with only a narrow profit of $18 million in 2017, its losses amounted to $1.2 billion over the last five years. Yet its long-term debt on Dec.31 amounted to almost $2 billion with only $156 million in cash.Many More Oil And Shale Bankruptcies Are Expected To Follow Once a rising star of shale, Whiting Petroleum (NYSE: WLL) is the largest to file for bankruptcy so far. With $1.6 billion in sales last year, the company had no other choice but to give up on the first day of April. Just like Diamond Offshore, it also had a net loss in four of the last five years.How The Mighty Have FallenLooking at the top U.S.-listed oil-producing companies' stock prices, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) have fallen by 35% and 22% respectively, this year as of this writing. Smaller energy companies are having an even worse outlook as their odds of survival are significantly less, which will make a wave of bankruptcy in the energy industry quite likely. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) has dropped by more than 62% this year. Its market capitalization recently fell below $10 billion. Last year, Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (NYSE: BRKB) chairman, Warren Buffett, invested $10 billion in Occidental Petroleum to finance its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, but this crash is putting the investment at risk.BP Was better Than Analysts Expected-But Still BadBP has reported a loss for the first months of the year due to these exceptionally challenging conditions. The loss of $628 million for the first quarter looks quite bad if you look at the first months of 2019 when there was a profit of $2 billion. The bottom line was better than analysts had expected due to both the coronavirus lockdown restrictions and crashing oil prices. The average oil price in the first quarter of 2020 was $50 a barrel, compared with $63 in the first quarter of 2019.But BP remains determined, as it will maintain its dividend for the quarter. The company is taking decisive actions to strengthen its finances by reinforcing liquidity, rapidly reducing spending and costs, and driving the cash balance point lower.The whole industry is left fighting for survival, and is getting help from the Trump administration. But hits are coming from both the supply-and-demand side and on a scale that have never been seen before. Only time will tell which companies can make it to the other side of this crisis, but whenever we get there the oil and gas landscape will look significantly different.

2020-05-01	2020-05-01 14:31:51	BP	BP p.l.c.	Big Oil Sees Evidence of Fledgling Rebound in Chinese Demand	(Bloomberg) -- Some of the world’s largest oil producers are starting to see evidence of a rebound in demand from China, even as other economies around the world remain hobbled by the coronavirus.While it’s still early days into the Chinese recovery, limited initial sales data was encouraging, Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corp. said in its first-quarter earnings presentation. In a major milestone on April 8, the Asian nation lifted the lockdown on Wuhan -- where the pathogen first emerged -- and is tentatively firing up its economic engine.Prior to that, strict nationwide restrictions meant the world’s second-largest economy recorded its deepest contraction in decades over the first quarter. As the country reopened, BP Plc’s soon-to-be chief financial officer, Murray Auchincloss, said on an earnings call earlier this week that demand has started to recover in China in its lubricants division in recent weeks.BP Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney told CNBC that the company was seeing its road transportation business in China back to 90-95% of pre-coronavirus levels, while aviation had recovered to about 50%. Exxon gave projections of a quick recovery across finished lubricants, polyethylene and retail fuels in Fujian province.Weakness Persists ElsewhereBP’s Auchincloss cautioned, however, that sales remain down in Europe, the U.S. and India, regions that are still under various stages of lockdown aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.Royal Dutch Shell Plc also highlighted a potential recovery, saying that there were a few “greenshoots” in its business in places like China where demand volume at some retail stations is above pre-Covid-19 levels.“That gives a signal that the potential for a rapid recovery in some parts of our businesses and in certain circumstances can be good,” Shell CFO Jessica Uhl said on its earnings call.The companies were careful to caveat that while the initial signs were positive, there is a lot of uncertainty ahead.Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said there could still be a second wave of infections in China. The data from the Asian nation is a bit of a guide to the path in demand recovery, BP’s Looney said, “but the reality is we really don’t know.”China’s faster-than-anticipated resumption prompted Bloomberg Economics to increase its GDP growth forecasts for the country to an expansion this year of 2%, up from 1.4% in its previous forecast, yet far below the actual growth rate of 6.1% in 2019.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-sees-evidence-fledgling-143151240.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Is Out of Fashion With Murky Prospects	To put it delicately, the oil mayhem is dominating the oil market this year, taking equities such as BP (NYSE:BP) along for the ride. BP stock is lower by 37% year-to-date as the United States Brent Oil Fund (NYSEARCA:BNO) - much of the company's output is priced in Brent - is off a staggering 70%.Source: Shutterstock What ails BP stock and shares of its brethren isn't just low oil prices. It's a muddied outlook as to when to demand will return to reasonable levels that make drilling worth it. Yes, BP has onshore exposure - plenty of it. And yes, it's cheaper to drill in shale patches than it is offshore, but at this point, where BP's oil is produced - or where anyone's oil is produced for that matter - is of little consequence. There simply isn't demand to absorb supply.  * 7 U.S. Stocks to Buy on Coronavirus WeaknessIn what feels like an eternity ago, BP CEO Bernard Looney said in February the company's 2021 free cash flow targets point to a breakeven rate of $40 per barrel while CFO Brian Gilvary said BP's breakeven rate for this year was probably in the mid-$50s.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat &quot;breakeven&quot; means here is the price at which a producer needs oil to reside for it to not lose money on that output. Yikes. Brent crude closed around $21 per barrel on April 27. Change Isn't Just Coming. It's Already HereI'll stop short of comparing change in energy production and consumption with something like cell phones replacing landlines or Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows replacing whatever the old, clunky IBM (NYSE:IBM) operating system was. But the reality is change is afoot in the energy field, it's seismic and it's not good for traditional fossil fuel producers.As just one example, the International Energy Agency recently released a report indicating that in 2019, more power was produced from renewable sources (solar, wind, etc.) than from coal. For those that need a bit more convincing, consider the following:&quot;The advent of electric vehicles and the growing pressures to decarbonise the transportation sector means that oil is facing significant competition for the first time within its core source of demand. This has led to considerable focus within the industry and amongst commentators on the prospects for peak oil demand - the recognition that the combined forces of improving efficiency and building pressure to reduce carbon emissions and improve urban air quality is likely to cause oil demand to stop increasing after over 150 years of almost uninterrupted growth.&quot;Spoiler alert: that quote comes directly from BP's website. I'm not piling on BP here. These trends affect the likes of Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and many more.Sure, there will always be some demand for oil. It's needed for asphalt, golf balls, tires and more. And hey, airlines are terribly unimaginative in their business practices, meaning there are no signs of an alternative to petroleum-powered jets. However, the bad news is that industry, like oil, is being blasted by the novel coronavirus pandemic with little indication as to when &quot;normal&quot; is returning or if it ever will. The Bottom Line on BP StockWith a dividend yield of 9.8%, it's easy to see why investors may find BP stock tempting here. The payout is probably defensible for this year, but there are some moving parts here.First, the company already pledged to slash spending by $15 billion, meaning there's not much more wiggle room for conserving capital, if need be, to sustain the dividend. Second, rosy assumptions by European oil majors seem to be revolving around a $40 per barrel average for the rest of 2020.Ask yourself this before being seduced by the BP yield: against a weak demand backdrop, what are the chances Brent prices almost double this year? The odds are long.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Iraq faces problems cutting 1 mln bpd of crude output -sources	BASRA, Iraq/BAGHDAD, April 30 (Reuters) - Iraq will struggle to cut crude output a record 1 million barrels per day (bpd) or 23 % from May under OPEC's deal with Russia and other producers, and Baghdad has yet to agree with oil majors about where the cuts will come from, industry sources said.  Majors such as BP, Exxon Mobil, Lukoil and Eni produce the lion’s share of Iraq’s output and have so far resisted calls for cuts, prompting Iraqi officials to review options such as asking the companies to bring forward field maintenance.  Less than full compliance by Iraq could hurt the OPEC+ group's efforts to curtail supply by as much as 9.7 million bpd to support oil prices that have crashed along with fuel demand during the coronavirus outbreak.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iraq-faces-problems-cutting-1-201403364.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-30	2020-04-30 17:22:32	BP	BP p.l.c.	Shell’s Dividend Cut Shows This Time is Different for Big Oil	(Bloomberg) -- When the boss of Royal Dutch Shell Plc slashed his dividend on Thursday, he didn’t just shock investors. He tore up the industry’s financial playbook.For decades Big Oil has used the strength of a large balance sheet to borrow money when the going gets tough and keep investors sweet until the next upward cycle.As the coronavirus pandemic potentially causes lasting damage to energy demand, Europe’s largest oil company asked whether this strategy is sustainable.“I would say no,” said Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden. “It’s also not wise and prudent, nor even responsible, to pay out a dividend if you know for sure you have to borrow for it.”Oil majors had no problem borrowing to pay shareholders during previous downturns. Over the years, Shell has weathered recessions, wars, nationalizations, and deep price slumps.So why is this time different?Lasting DamageThe coronavirus pandemic has delivered an unprecedented hit to demand through global lockdowns and it’s hard to say if it will ever return to 2019 levels. Shell doesn’t expect a recovery in consumption or oil prices in the medium term, the 62-year-old Dutchman said in a Bloomberg TV interview.“I think a crisis like this has the potential to catalyze society into a different way of thinking,” van Beurden said.It is a view that was shared by his BP Plc counterpart, Bernard Looney, earlier this week. As business travel is replaced by video conferences and employees work remotely, some shifts in behavior may stick for longer, Looney said.The long-term trends in energy consumption that determine company’s financial decisions -- such as air travel -- may change permanently and put many other oil majors’ dividends in doubt.“Shell’s cut will also put pressure on other majors to revisit distributions,” Redburn said in a note. BP’s decision earlier this week to ride out the downturn with the usual spending cuts and debt increases “now risks being cast in an imprudent light.”Debt BurdenShell can’t put all the blame on the virus. While van Beurden said the dividend cut was an unavoidable decision due to an unforeseen pandemic, his critics have long warned that the company had been over leveraged since its 2016 acquisition of BG Group, a big natural gas producer. The board approved a $25 billion share buy back in July 2018 that further strained the company’s balance sheet.“The problems have been building for a while,” said Alastair Syme, oil analyst at Citigroup. “All roads lead back to the high price paid for BG and the burden that this acquisition put on the company’s financial structure.”BP’s ratio of net debt to equity is even higher than Shell’s. Looney said this week that the company’s board would review the payout on a quarterly basis, potentially opening the door for a cut later this year. Exxon Mobil Corp. has just frozen its dividend for the first time in 13 years as its financial underpinnings feel the strain of the downturn.Energy TransitionShell’s CEO said again and again on Thursday what a tough decision it was to cut the dividend, but it could make sense in the longer term.European oil majors have promised to slash their carbon emissions over the next 30 years, requiring big increases in spending on renewables. Even before the pandemic, many analysts and shareholders were questioning whether Shell and BP could maintain their generous payouts, while also investing enough in both their core oil and gas businesses and clean energy.The dividend cut gives Shell “the ability to allocate incremental capital to high-value barrels as demand recovers and accelerate its energy transition agenda to net zero carbon by 2050,” said Christyan Malek, head of oil and gas research at JP Morgan.Shell made no promises about how it will spend the $10 billion a year removed from the dividend. Van Beurden said he would update the market on plans in the second half of the year.“We will have to see what the response of our investors is going to be” to those plans, Van Beurden said.Their verdict on Thursday, as shares dropped 11% in London, was clear: Sell.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-dividend-cut-shows-time-172232868.html?.tsrc=rss

BP's Love of Dividends Is Bordering on the Absurd	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s no secret that the U.K. oil majors BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc will do everything to avoid cutting their dividends, but the lengths to which BP is going to leave its payout untouched by the Covid-19 crisis border on the absurd. When Brent crude is at $20 per barrel and BP’s dividend stays firm, the company’s management gives the impression of living in fear of investors.BP’s revenue fell sharply during the first quarter as the pandemic curbed industrial demand for oil and chemicals, lockdowns cut transport and a Saudi Arabia-led price war exacerbated the impact on oil prices. Operating cash flow was $1 billion, compared with $7.6 billion in the final three months of 2019.In response to the crisis, the company is saying the right things about strengthening its finances. It is amassing cash from anyone who will lend it, raising $7 billion in the bond markets and obtaining a $10 billion credit facility. It’s cutting capital expenditure this year by 25% and it will reduce operating costs by about $2.5 billion by the end of 2021.There’s only so much BP can cut, however, so its net debt has shot up and the company is now saying its overall leverage, measured as net debt to total capital, will be above its 20%-30% target range into 2021.And yet, the quarterly dividend stayed at 10.5 cents per share, after being raised last quarter, implying a total payout for the three months of $2.1 billion. While dividends are meant to be discretionary, BP’s have taken on an unshakable status. Every operating measure and financial target appears to work around them, even as the oil giant talks about the need to strengthen its balance sheet.Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney’s defense is that the payout was reviewed by the whole board and is supported by the “underlying performance” of the business. Yet even when adjusting for working-capital movements, squeezing the dividend plus a quarterly capital-spending bill of about $3 billion out of operating cash flow is going to be tight this year.How does this support the big strategic challenge facing BP: the need to invest in the energy transition? Looney is promising more details on BP’s green plans later in the year. For now, it’s hard to be optimistic.The company’s renewed cost-cutting zeal means it can break even at low crude prices, though not as low as today. As the oil industry finds ways to produce more efficiently, that just makes it harder for cleaner energy sources to be competitive. Meanwhile, the financial resources needed to invest in the transition away from hydrocarbons are being rationed. They’re mainly being paid out to BP investors. The only silver lining will be if those same shareholders reinvest the cash on renewables companies in a better way than BP would spend it.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

The oil major's first-quarter profits tumbled by two-thirds as the crisis hammered demand and its debt rose sharply. London-based BP said it expected significantly lower refining margins in the second quarter when global restrictions on movement reached their peak. The firm reported an underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, of $800 million. That beat the $710 million forecast by analysts.  But it was down from the $2.4 billion profit a year earlier. BP, like its peers, responded to a 65% drop in oil prices in the first quarter by sharply reducing spending.  It slashed its 2020 budget by a quarter to around $12 billion and reduced output at its U.S. shale operations. Debt hit $51.4 billion in the first quarter and its debt-to-capital ratio rose to 36%, significantly higher than its target of 30% or less. Oil prices slumped again on Tuesday amid concern about dwindling capacity to store crude worldwide.  There is also a fear that fuel demand may be slow to pick up once countries ease restrictions.  U.S. benchmark crude was down 20% to around 10 dollars a barrel.  Meanwhile BP shares were down over 2% on an otherwise up morning for stocks.	https://news.yahoo.com/bps-profit-tumbles-debt-climbs-093241632.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Bolsters Financial Reserves as Pandemic Slashes Profit	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc bolstered its financial reserves as the initial stages of the coronavirus pandemic caused its profit to plunge and increased its debt.While earnings were hit hard in the first three months of the year, the worst of the virus-driven crisis is yet to come. The company expects the pandemic to reduce its production and have a material impact on refining in the second quarter.A measure of its indebtedness rose to the highest in more than eight years, underscoring the financial strain resulting from the oil-market collapse. To boost its financial reserves, BP has taken on a new $10 billion credit facility and also sold $7 billion of bonds.“Our industry has been hit by supply and demand shocks on a scale never seen before,” Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney, who took the company’s helm earlier this year, said in a statement on Tuesday. “We are focusing our efforts on protecting our people, supporting our communities and strengthening our finance.”The earnings figures offer a deeper look at how major energy producers are navigating the economic turmoil imposed by the pandemic. BP already announced that it would slash costs by 25% this year, while Italy’s Eni SpA reported a 94% slump in first-quarter profit last week.The London-based oil and gas giant’s adjusted net income was $791 million in the period, exceeding the average analyst estimate of $774 million. That compares with a profit of $2.36 billion a year earlier. Shares of the company fell 1.5% to 309.35 pence as of 8:06 a.m. in London.Gearing -- a measure of net debt to equity -- was 36.2%, remaining above its targeted range of 20% to 30% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Expanding on the weak outlook for the second quarter, BP said it expects to make an annual payment of around $1.2 billion relating to the Gulf of Mexico spill settlement. That would put even more pressure on the balance sheet.Including the credit line and the bond sales, BP had $32 billion in liquidity at the end of the first quarter.BP said on Monday that it will still deliver $15 billion of divestments, crucial for easing its debt burden, but the timing will be affected by the renegotiation of Hilcorp Energy Co.’s purchase of its Alaskan assets.The company maintained its dividend, having increased it to 10.5 cents in the previous quarter. Big Oil’s generous dividends are a big attraction for investors, but the sustainability of the payouts is under renewed scrutiny in the current downturn. Norway’s Equinor ASA cut its dividend earlier this month and “serious questions remain over its affordability” for BP, analysts at Redburn said in a note.Speaking in a Bloomberg television interview, Looney said the company could, if necessary, go back to paying a portion of its dividend in new shares, commonly known as a scrip.“A scrip dividend is one of the many tools in the toolbox,” Looney said. “But not one that we choose to use at the moment.”(Updates with share price in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-profit-plunges-debt-rises-063124410.html?.tsrc=rss

BP to Close Hilcorp Alaska Deal With Revised Payment Terms	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc confirmed its commitment to completing the sale of its Alaska business to Hilcorp Energy Co., but said financial terms had been adjusted to reflect market conditions.The renegotiation of the deal will come as a relief to the London-based oil major, which is leaning on asset sales to rein in its debt and sustain its dividend amid a historic oil crash that has battered company valuations globally.Under the revised agreement, the total consideration for the sale remains unchanged at $5.6 billion, but the structure and phasing of payments has been modified, BP said Monday.BP shares were trading up 1.3% at 312.6 pence as of 9:28 am in London, reaching as much as 319 pence after the announcement.The terms of the revised deal are light on detail and are likely to be scrutinized on Tuesday, when the major announces its first-quarter results under its new chief executive, Bernard Looney. The new deal includes lower completion payments in 2020 and new cash-flow sharing arrangements over the near-term, BP said in a statement. The companies continue to expect completion in mid-2020.The proceeds from the deal will be key in supporting BP’s dividend, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Will Hares. “Still, the new phased payment structure, likely through the second half of this year at least, means the deal won’t represent the deleveraging windfall for BP’s indebted balance sheet as it had originally.”In February, BP said it had announced $9.4 billion of divestments since the start of 2019. The Hilcorp sale represented the lion’s share of that figure, meaning a change to the price would affect BP’s divestment target of $15 billion by mid-2021. The disposal of unwanted assets is key in reducing BP’s debt burden. The company’s gearing - a measure of debt to equity - remained stubbornly above its self-imposed target of 30% at the end of last year.Earlier this month, consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. said that about $25 billion worth of oil and gas deals were awaiting completion. With the industry going through unprecedented turmoil, executing these deals will be of paramount importance for companies trying to strengthen their balance sheets.As BP announces its earnings, industry watchers will be looking out for insights into what the major expects the rest of the year has in store. With Big Oil feeling the heat from low oil prices and demand savaged by the coronavirus pandemic, shareholder payouts have come under increasing scrutiny. BP increased its dividend in the fourth quarter to 10.5 cents a share.(Updates with analyst comment in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-close-hilcorp-alaska-deal-065701843.html?.tsrc=rss

Oil Slump May No Longer Be a Curse for Renewable Energy	(Bloomberg) -- Low oil prices are usually a curse for green energy, but this time might be different.The collapse of the crude market has seen prices fall below zero for the first time in history. Yet Royal Dutch Shell Plc this month outlined a bold program to slash carbon emissions and invest in clean energy, while Eni SpA said Friday it’ll consider accelerating its ambitious climate plan.There’s always been tension between calls for Big Oil to tackle climate change and their investors’ doubts about the profitability of spending on renewables. Historically, a plunge in crude prices has tended to undercut costlier clean energy, prompting companies to divert dwindling financial resources into their core business of fossil fuels.What’s different this time is that the cost of renewables and natural gas has broken away from oil, weakening crude’s influence on the price of electricity. While the coronavirus has destroyed demand for oil and transport fuels, power use has dropped less sharply. And importantly, energy companies are now painfully aware of the mounting pressure from consumers -- and investors -- to clean up their output, rein in emissions and prepare for a future beyond oil.“The situation is totally different since the last time oil prices were this low,” said Nick Boyle, chief executive officer of solar company Lightsource BP. The cost of solar is a 10th of what it was during the recession of 2008 to 2009. Even as crude has slumped, “in the last few weeks we have announced new deals on nearly 400 megawatts of new capacity in the U.S. alone,” he said.Risky BetTransport is dominated by oil, especially in aviation where battery power or renewable fuels have virtually no presence. So any investment today in a hydrocarbon project is a bet that the impact of the coronavirus will be temporary. That could be a risky assumption.The lockdowns imposed around the world to slow the spread of the virus have hammered almost every part of the global economy. In France for example, tight restrictions on movement have reduced power demand by about a fifth but wiped out 70% to 90% of consumption of gasoline and diesel. Similar patterns have emerged in other European countries and the U.S.See also: The Future of Oil Demand Is Being Reshaped by Virus LockdownsUnlike during previous price slumps, cheap fuel is no incentive for people to drive or fly because they can’t leave their homes. Even if travel restrictions are eased in the second half of this year, the International Energy Agency expects global oil demand to fall by a record 9.3 million barrels a day on average in 2020.A lot depends on how long lockdown habits, such as working from home and replacing business travel with video conferences, will continue to reduce demand from transport. That in turn will depend on things far beyond the control of the energy industry, such as the development of comprehensive virus testing, or possibly a vaccine.Any recovery in demand will be gradual, given the damage done to the global economy, according to London-based consultant Energy Aspects Ltd.Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, Energy Aspects was forecasting a demand increase of 5.6 million barrels a day from 2019 to 2025, according to Matt Parry, head of long-term analysis. Its models are now showing that number is more likely to be around 3 million barrels a day because of the huge drop in consumption this year.Behavioral changes resulting from the virus could affect long-term growth in oil demand, though existing trends, such as the surging middle class in emerging markets, will help drive consumption higher into the 2030s, Parry said.Renewables RiskWhile the impact of the coronavirus is concentrated on oil, the crisis in the industry is so large that investment in clean energy could suffer collateral damage.Even before the pandemic, major crude producers were still feeling the effects of the previous slump -- deep spending cuts, elevated debt and questions about the sustainability of their huge dividends. Now they’re reducing investment again, with cuts of about 20% from Shell, BP Plc and Total SA.Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden conceded to investors last week that the oil slump wasn’t helping the energy transition. “I don’t think I’d be honest if I said: ‘No, no, don’t worry’.” Yet he’s still willing to tie the pay of executives and 16,500 other employees to a target of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions as much as 3% by 2021.BP boss Bernard Looney, who has set out one of the industry’s boldest plans to curb carbon, sent his Dutch counterpart a message of support on LinkedIn. “Ben -- I agree. Despite all that is going on, we must keep our eye on the future and helping the planet.”Meanwhile, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said Friday that the Italian oil company’s long-term plans for the energy transition remain unchanged amid the market rout, and it will pursue them with “determination.”Having made green commitments, the risk to their reputations from scaling these pledges back would be too big, said Fiona Reynolds, CEO of the Principles for Responsible Investment, which has 3,000 signatories with more than $90 trillion in assets under management.Shell’s Van Beurden has promised that his company will spend $1 billion to $2 billion on new energies this year, increasing to as much as $3 billion in 2021. Yet neither Shell nor BP have provided a blueprint on how much they will invest in clean energy to fulfill their pledge to eliminate the bulk of their emissions by 2050.Both oil majors will report quarterly results next week, but the big test of their commitment will come later this year when both plan to give investors more detailed plans.“To us the real question -- and real proof -- is how much capital are they putting toward this transition?,” said Heike Cosse, engagement manager at Aegon Asset Management, which has shares in Shell and has voted in favor of climate resolutions.Renewables represent just a sliver of oil majors’ overall spending and portfolio today, but if fuel demand remains suppressed, the balance will continue to tilt.“People will be very reluctant to consume at the rate that they have been consuming before,” former BP CEO John Browne said this week on Bloomberg Television. “The behavior of people changed as a result of the virus. I would not be surprised if you look at oil prices being much lower for longer.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-slump-may-no-longer-230100711.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-24	2020-04-24 19:41:35	BP	BP p.l.c.	4 Dividend Energy Stocks at Risk	Wall Street looks vulnerable to another pullback here as the post-Covid-19 rebound capped out near a 50% retracement of the initial selloff and has been sliding sideways for weeks. To be sure, there are plenty of things to be worried about: Evidence of a prolonged economic shutdown, chaos in the energy markets, and concerns a quick fix for Covid-19 is not forthcoming. None of this has helped the energy stocks.As a result, a number of dividend stocks look vulnerable here as a prolonged economic disruption increases the likelihood of payout cuts and further selling pressure.Here are four I think investors should avoid at all costs:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A)  * Petrochina (NYSE:PTR)  * Total SA (NYSE:TOT)  * BP(NYSE:BP)Now let's delve into exactly what makes each of these energy stocks a bad pick right now. Dividend Energy Stocks at Risk: Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-A, RDS-B)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comShares of Royal Dutch Shell are languishing below their 50-day moving average, looking set for a retest of their mid-March lows as crude oil prices continue to suffer amid a global oversupply situation. Shares currently pay nearly an 11% dividend, but that doesn't look likely to persist as wells are capped and production volume falls as storage tanks top off.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week The company will next report results on April 30 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 56 cents per share on revenues of $55 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 30, earnings of 74 cents per share missed estimates of 80 cents on a 19% drop in revenue. Petrochina (PTR)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comShares of Petrochina as also drifting lower after suffering a 35% decline from their early January high and capping a drop of nearly 60% from the highs set in late 2018. Shares were recently downgraded to &quot;sell&quot; by analysts at Citigroup. JPMorgan also recently downgraded to &quot;neutral.&quot; Currently, the stock pays a 6.7% dividend yield.The company reported fiscal 2019 results in late March, with revenues rising 6% year-over-year. The company recently pulled its capital spending targets for the first time since 2015 amid a volatile and uncertain environment. Last year, the company spent nearly $42 billion, up 12.5% over the prior year. Total (TOT)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comTotal shares, which currently pay a dividend yield of 8.4%, are following a similar pattern to the others shown here, failing to retake its 50-day moving average. Cowen's Jason Gabelman recently warned that Total along with BP had the highest exposure to probable production cuts -- at roughly 8% vs. 4%. So, earnings could be very sensitive to top-line swings in output that could affect payout ratios.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip Separately, the company along with Apache announced a significant oil discovery at its Sapakara West-1 well offshore Suriname, a project that is jointly owned. The project drills to a depth of 20,700 feet. Shares were recently downgraded to &quot;neutral&quot; by analysts at Morgan Stanley. BP (BP)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comBP shares, which pay a 10.8% dividend, are also currently below their 50-day moving average and look vulnerable to a return to the mid-March low which would be worth a loss of 30% from here. Not only is the company heavily exposed to production cuts, but the Wall Street Journal recently reported that the $5.6 billion sale of some of its assets to Hilcorp Energy is threatened by a drop in liquidity and fears over the health of the energy industry.The company will next report results on April 28 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 25 cents per share on revenues of $79.6 billion. When the company last reported on Feb. 4, earnings of 13 cents per share beat estimates by three cents on a 6% drop in revenues from the prior year.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

It is down 45% from the 52-week peak. In the past month, though, the stock has actually risen 34% from its low on March 18.  Right now BP stock has a very attractive dividend yield of more than 10%. But will this last?That's in question because the company's debt situation seems to be getting worse. That could prevent the stock from rising further if BP cannot raise cash. The company wants to reduce its gearing ratio to below 30%. Gearing measures the company's financial leverage compared to its equity.Source: TK Kurikawa / Shutterstock.com  Asset Sales Delay Will Hurt GearingBanks are balking at financing the buyer for some of BP's asset sales, The Wall Street Journal reported last week. BP announced the deal in August 2019 to sell all of its Alaska assets for $5.6 billion. This includes its Prudhoe Bay oil field and its interests in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline system. Hilcorp Energy, the largest privately held energy company in the U.S. was to finance the acquisition with banks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut now these lenders are wondering how the deal will be worthwhile since the oil prices have dropped 60% since August.But the problem is BP needs to reduce its leverage. So if this sale does not go through, BP stock could suffer.For example, the company's gearing ratio right now is over 35%. Gearing is the ratio of net debt divided by net debt plus equity.Here are the numbers, according to the company's recent 20-F annual report (note 27, page 201): Net debt, including leases, is $55 billion. But BP's equity, as of December, is $100.7 billion. So the gearing ratio, $55 billion divided by $155.7 billion tops 35%.  * 7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for the Market Rebound So, we can estimate how much debt it needs to reduce in order to get down to 30% gearing. For example, if net debt plus leases drop to $43 billion, then the ratio falls to 30% (i.e., $43 billion divided by $143.7 equals 30%).So that means net debt must decline by $12 billion, or 21.7%, from $55 billion. So you can see that this $5.6 billion asset sale needs to go through. That is less than half of the $12 billion in asset sales that BP needs to complete. Is the Fat Dividend at Risk?One thing to take into consideration, is whether BP can still afford the dividend without any sales. For example, right now BP stock has a 10.31% dividend yield. In fact, the company just raised the quarterly payout in February.The chart below shows that, with asset sales, BP has had enough free cash flow to cover the dividend over the past 12 months. The dollar amount of asset sales in the last year was just $500 million. So BP was able to finance the dividend with its adjusted free cash flow.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFAHowever, in the months ahead, free cash flow will be significantly lower given the reduced oil prices. Some of its production is hedged, so the drop in free cash flow will slowly feed in.For example, assuming that FCF is 30% lower over the next 12 months, it will be just $7.6 billion. But that includes $500 million in asset sales. So the net number with no asset sales is $7.1 billion.  * 7 Bank Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Heats Up With a dividend of $2.52 per share and 3.373 billion ADR equivalent shares outstanding, management needs $8.5 billion to keep paying investors. However, current FCF falls short by $1.4 billion. If BP has a downdraft of more than 30% in FCF, this gap will be wider. What to do With BP Stock?So you can see that the company needs to sell assets to cover this deficit. Otherwise, it may have to borrow more.On the other hand, BP has already announced cuts in its forward capex spending. The bottom line is that the company expects to shave $2.1 billion from spending by the end of 2021.So, it looks like even without asset sales, BP stock can hold up that recently expanded dividend, even at its present 10.31% yield.I believe that knowing this, BP management will likely wait. They will see if the banks warm up to financing the $5.6 billion Hilcorp purchase of its Alaskan asset sales.After all, this is the largest deal in the oil and gas sector right now -- in fact, it's looking like the only deals are going to be bankruptcies, such as Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) and its ilk.Can the banks really afford to pass this up? I suspect all they want is a lower price tag. BP is likely to accommodate this in order to get the deal done.The bottom line on BP stock is that  this looks like a good time to pick up a great oil and gas name with an affordable, but high dividend yield.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

However, if you're looking for income, BP stock is not the answer. Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere's why. On Feb. 4, BP announced its fourth-quarter results, which included a 6.1% decline in revenues ($72.2 billion), and an adjusted net profit of $2.6 billion, 26.2% lower than a year earlier. The good news is that the company's profit was much better than analyst expectations. Further, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 2.4% to 63 cents. CFO Brian Gilvary had previously said that it would be &quot;premature&quot; to increase the dividend.   &quot;BP is performing well, with safe and reliable operations,&quot; Outgoing CEO Bob Dudley said in a statement. &quot;This all supports our commitment to growing distributions to shareholders over the long term.&quot;So, as a result of the increase, BP's dividend yield is flirting with double digits. However, it's unlikely to remain that high given what's happened to oil prices in the first quarter.  BP's Results Were Better Than ExpectedIn Q4 2019, the average price of a barrel was $63.08 for Brent crude and $56.88 for West Texas Intermediate. As I write this, Brent Crude is trading at $33.52 a barrel and a barrel of WTI is at $25.85. Therefore, you can expect profits and revenues to be lower in the first quarter compared to both Q4 2019 and a year earlier. On April 1, BP announced that it would take a $1 billion impairment charge in the first quarter and cut its capital spending by 25% to $12 billion, to reflect the current oil and gas environment. On a positive note, it plans to find $2.5 billion in annual cash cost savings between 2019 and 2021. The company said that it finished the first quarter with approximately $32 billion in cash and undrawn facilities. However, on the downside, its net debt in 2019 increased to $45.4 billion, up 4.5% from a year earlier. At the same time, BP finished 2019 with free cash flow of $10.4 billion. From that, it spent $8.3 billion on dividends, leaving just $1.9 billion for other capital allocation levers. That would be fine in an up-market. But even with an OPEC+ cut, the demand for oil is going to fall through the floor in April, May and June. Petroleum geologist Art Berman recently suggested that demand in the second quarter could drop by 18 million barrels of oil per day, pushing oil prices to levels lower than where they were in late March when a barrel of WTI crude was selling for $20. It is not going to be pretty. The Bottom Line on BP StockAt a time when oil prices are, at best, going to trade only marginally higher for a short duration, it seems crazy that BP would maintain a 63-cent dividend. In 2020, that dividend is going to cost the company approximately $2.1 billion in cash per quarter. The company managed to generate positive free cash flow in 2019. Even with a 25% cut in capital spending, I don't see how it can deliver anywhere near $10.4 billion in 2020. It could also turn negative if prices stay low for the majority of the year. However, Berman believes that oil prices won't return to 2018 levels for many years, which has me wondering about the long-term viability of a 63-cent dividend.If you're looking for income, BP stock is not a good bet. As for buying its shares for appreciation, I would stay far away. Things are going to get worse before they get better.

Historic Oil Slump Puts Multibillion-Dollar Deals in Balance	(Bloomberg) -- About $25 billion of oil and gas deals are hanging in the balance following crude’s historic collapse, potentially doing further harm to the finances of companies already battered by the slump.Companies including Occidental Petroleum Corp., BP Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp. are relying on asset sales started last year to bolster their finances. But many deals look less attractive now with oil near $30 a barrel and a bleak outlook for the global economy, according to consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd.As oil companies around the world scramble to protect their finances by boosting credit lines, slashing spending and suspending buybacks, those leaning too heavily on asset sales may need to find other measures.“I think they’re going to be extremely difficult to execute in the near term,” said Greig Aitken, director of M&A research at WoodMac. “It’s borderline impossible for the next few months.”Valuations have been hit hard by the slump. Infections and deaths from the coronavirus pandemic are still climbing, and large parts of the world are likely heading toward a recession. While OPEC and other major producers are planning talks this week to help steady the market, immense output cuts would be required to compensate for a demand destruction that some traders estimate has risen to as high as 35 million barrels a day.Failed asset sales would only make matters worse for the companies, Aitken said. Oil majors have an additional $27 billion of planned disposals beyond what has been announced.Occidental may have the most to lose from a freeze in the market. The U.S. shale producer has a pile of debt due over the next two years and is depending on asset sales to pay it.A key pillar of its purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. last year was selling off its African assets to Total SA for $8.8 billion. But the disposal of operations in Ghana and Algeria, valued at almost $5 billion, is yet to be signed off.Total can walk away from both transactions should Algeria not give approval by Sept. 30, according to Morgan Stanley. The government there has suggested it may seek to preempt the purchase of the asset, adding further uncertainty to an already stressed market. Ghana meanwhile is claiming $500 million in taxes, complicating the deal.Total declined to comment on the status of the agreements. The French major is pushing ahead with its own $5 billion divestment plan, and on Tuesday closed the sale of more than $400 million of assets in Brunei and West Africa.Occidental referred Bloomberg to remarks from Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub in February that there’s “increased risk” associated with the Algeria and Ghana sales. But she pledged to reach her target of raising $15 billion from selling assets, with or without the Africa deals.Wyoming SaleOccidental also wanted to sell land in Wyoming, which state authorities had expressed interest in buying. However, the outbreak of the virus may complicate the state’s efforts to get that deal done, according to Devin McDermott, a New York-based analyst at Morgan Stanley.“There are a lot more pressing issues that every state including Wyoming has to focus on right now,” he said.Even so, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon said he will “continue to find ways to take steps to explore this opportunity” despite the coronavirus and legislative hurdles in a letter dated March 26. Hollub said the bidding was a “competitive process,” indicating the interest of other bidders.BP to ExxonOthers oil companies including BP, Exxon and smaller players in the North Sea have also been looking to sell.In early February, BP said it would boost its divestment program from $10 billion to $15 billion by the middle of next year. It said last week it’s still on track to hit that target. The company had agreed more than $9 billion of deals by the end of last year, about $5.6 billion of which will come from the pending sale of its Alaskan business to Hilcorp Energy Co.Some deal completions may be revised, “particularly while volatile market conditions persist,” BP said last week, adding that it expects the Hilcorp transaction to go through. Hilcorp didn’t respond to a request for comment.Exxon, already paying its dividend with borrowed money, has been relying on asset sales to bolster its financial position as it attempts to build a series of mega-projects in one of the worst oil markets in decades. Announcing a pullback in its ambitions on Tuesday, the company said it would reduce spending this year by 30% to $23 billion. Exxon is targeting about $10 billion of disposals by the end of next year with assets in the Gulf of Mexico, Azerbaijan and Malaysia on offer. But Senior Vice President Neil Chapman sought to temper expectations for successful sales at Exxon’s analyst day in March.“We don’t expect success on every asset that we put in the market,” he said. “If the value is not there, we’re not going to transact.”Bleak OutlookThe grim macroeconomic outlook is making it “doubly important” that any announced deals close, WoodMac’s Aitken said. But that’s difficult to do since potential buyers are focusing on existing portfolios and looking to conserve cash rather than seeking new opportunities.“Asset sales are extremely challenging right now,” said Morgan Stanley’s McDermott. “In the low oil-price environment we’re in right now, the universe of buyers just dries up.”(Updates with Total’s asset sales in Brunei in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/historic-oil-slump-puts-multibillion-230100484.html?.tsrc=rss

We remain committed to growing sustainable free cash flow and distributions to our shareholders.”Oil prices dropped to about $25 a barrel on Wednesday, nearing its lowest level in 18 years. BP forecasts spending this year to amount to about $12 billion, which is about 25% below its full-year guidance. For the first quarter of the year, BP expects to take an $1 billion impairment charge, while oil and gas output is poised to decline form the previous quarter.For the first quarter, BP sees “no significant operational impact” from the coronavirus outbreak on its global operations, but this could change through the second quarter, the company said.Wall Street analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on the stock split into 2 Buys and 3 Holds.

Holders of BP (NYSE:BP) stock have suffered staggering losses amid the energy-sector rout. Some audacious traders might wonder if this is the time to grab some cheap shares and hope for the best.Source: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com That's an ill-advised strategy.Russia and Saudi Arabia are embroiled in a vicious oil-price war. The coronavirus from China is pummeling demand. There's little hope for a swift recovery in BP stock, and the prospect of a dividend cut only makes the future look bleaker. Yet, even while BP should be cutting costs, the company's new chief executive is proposing a major vision shift that could cost the company billions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Big Plans, Few DetailsBernard Looney, who has only been BP's chief executive since February, has already made the headlines with an ambitious plan. It's probably the boldest clean-energy plan of any oil company. Evidently, Looney wants all of BP's fuel &quot;to be de-carbonized&quot; by 2050.This is not the appropriate forum to debate the merits of clean energy. Rather, the focus is on whether this proposal is what is best for the company and its shareholders. In any case, Looney is unambiguous in his advocacy of carbon-free energy solutions. He declared, &quot;The world's carbon budget is finite and running out fast; we need a rapid transition to net zero … We have got to change -- and change profoundly.&quot;  * 7 Buyout Targets to Watch for in 2020 It has been said that the devil is in the details. Regrettably, Looney has few details to offer in this instance. &quot;I appreciate you want more than a vision -- you want to see milestones, near-term targets, some ways to measure progress … We do not have those for you right now,&quot; he stated.This is a time when energy companies need to cut costs just to remain solvent. BP and other oil stocks are in a terrible, sustained bear market. The oil-price suppression tug-of-war between Russia and Saudi Arabia could go on for a while. The coronavirus could continue to depress gasoline demand for many more months.This is a time for fiscal discipline, not plans that could potentially cost billions of dollars. Worse yet, we don't have a picture of how many billions it would cost since Looney hasn't provided the essential details of the plan. Dividend Cuts a PossibilityWith oil companies in survival mode, it's hard to imagine things getting any worse. Yet, the situation for BP could worsen if the company cuts its dividend. The company's generous forward dividend yield of 10% is one of the few consolation prizes for battered shareholders.Slashing that yield would likely scare off some stockholders. And that would push the price down even further into the abyss. That's a grim prospect. However, as explained by Nick Stansbury, head of commodity research at Legal & General Investment Management, given the supply and demand pressures placed on the company, it's hard to imagine BP staving off the inevitable for much longer:&quot;The situation as it stands looks pretty challenged for most of the oil majors, if you were to assume that prices will persist at these levels … If it sticks for six, nine months, then there will be serious questions raised about the sustainability of dividends.&quot;BP's chief executive may try to avoid dividend cuts for a while. After all, Looney is new to the position and, as AJ Bell Plc. asset manager Russ Mould observes, a dividend cut is &quot;a decision no CEO wants to be associated with … It can cost you your job.&quot; How long Looney can delay dividend cuts, and how long he gets to keep his job, remains to be seen. The Final Word on BP StockIt's questionable whether BP can embark on a likely very costly carbon-elimination plan, while avoiding cutting dividends, amid a horrendous supply and demand shock.

Even with recent robust sessions, Chevron stock has lost 36% of its value so far in 2020.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com To some investors, the plunge no doubt looks like an opportunity. Chevron remains one of the world's great energy companies. It's a dividend aristocrat: an 8.4% increase in its dividend in January marked 33 consecutive years in which the company had raised its payout. That dividend now yields an attractive 6.8%.But investors buying Chevron stock on the dip need to keep one thing in mind: the world has changed. Indeed, Chevron itself shows just how much the energy industry has changed.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith an understanding of those changes, the opportunity in CVX stock isn't quite what it appears. The stock should be attractive for energy bulls betting on a rebound. But investors simply looking for a &quot;cheap&quot; quality name likely have better opportunities elsewhere in the market. Security Analyst MeetingOn Mar. 3, Chevron held its Security Analyst Meeting. At the time, energy stocks already were struggling. Soft fourth-quarter earnings from both Chevron and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) dented optimism toward the sector. Chevron stock traded at a four-year low. XOM stock, incredibly, had touched its lowest level in 15 years.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem But Chevron sounded optimistic regardless. The company outlined a plan to return $75 to $80 billion to shareholders over the next five years through dividends and share repurchases. That figure was nearly half Chevron's market capitalization of roughly $175 billion.Adjusted free cash flow was expected to double by 2024, with return on capital employed clearing 10%. To any energy investor looking to buy the dip, the outlook made Chevron stock look exceedingly cheap.Five days later, Saudi Arabia started an &quot;all-out price war&quot; in crude oil. Oil prices plunged. Unsurprisingly, so did Chevron stock, which declined over 15% on the news.By Monday's close, it had declined another 44% from where it closed the day before its analyst meeting. Shares touched a 14-year low. Chevron RespondsWith Brent crude below $30, Chevron's outlook is quite different. Just three weeks after guiding for annual shareholder returns averaging over $15 billion, the company suspended share repurchases altogether. Chevron will keep its dividend -- chief executive officer Michael Wirth told CNBC that the payout &quot;is our number one priority&quot; -- which suggests 2020 returns under $10 billion.Guidance for 2020 capital and exploratory spending is being cut 20%. Production in the Permian basin is coming down by the same amount. Operating costs are being cut as well.Chevron is retrenching. It's going to cut costs, lower production, and look to wait out this cycle.But the impact is severe. It's worth going back to the fourth quarter report on Jan. 31, itself not all that long ago. In its earnings presentation, Chevron noted that a $1 move in the per-barrel price of Brent crude would hit cash flow by roughly $450 million.Brent crude has fallen about $24 per barrel since then. That's a hit to cash flow of over $10 billion. Lower production will only add to the pressure.In 2019, Chevron generated operating cash flow of $27.3 billion. Capital expenditures were $14.1 billion, and still are guided to about $16 billion in 2020.Cut $10 billion off that operating cash flow and free cash flow is almost totally erased. The Decline in Chevron StockLooked at from that perspective, the broader decline in Chevron stock is not an overreaction.To be sure, Chevron still will be profitable in this oil price environment. It's not going to go bankrupt.But Chevron also has a market cap back over $100 billion. The dividend is going to see pressure going forward if oil prices don't recover. Indeed, payouts from Exxon and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are at risk. As Tezcan Gecgil wrote for InvestorPlace this week, the same is true for BP (NYSE:BP). We've already seen a big dividend cut from explorer Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), though its disastrous acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum is to blame.With run-rate free cash flow likely to be relatively thin going forward, Chevron stock actually is pricing in a rebound in oil prices. And, to be fair, it's possible that rebound will come. There is growing skepticism that Saudi Arabia can hold the line in the price war. Russia may give as well.But that doesn't mean Chevron stock is undervalued here. Rather, it's another piece of evidence to suggest that the market's response has been somewhat rational. In a &quot;lower for longer&quot; environment, Chevron's earnings will plunge. So will its free cash flow.That's why Chevron is scrambling to cut costs and lower production just three weeks after it was giving an optimistic five-year outlook. The oil business has changed dramatically. It only makes sense that the Chevron share price would do the same.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-03-18	2020-03-18 10:22:45	BP	BP p.l.c.	Big Oil’s Big Crisis: Saving Sacred Dividends From Collapse	(Bloomberg) -- To understand the crisis engulfing the world’s largest oil companies, just look at their dividend yields.Exxon Mobil Corp., for decades considered one of the bluest of blue-chip stocks, is paying investors 10%. For Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the Anglo-Dutch giant that hasn’t cut payments to shareholders since the Second World War, its 12-month dividend is equivalent to 14% of its current share price. BP Plc offers a yield of 12.4%, and France’s Total SA 11%.Yields at those levels typically suggest one thing: a significant risk that shareholders may not get the money they’ve been promised.No Big Oil executive would ever accept that’s true -- at least for now. Even as management teams confront both the catastrophic demand destruction wrought by the spread of coronavirus and an oil-price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, they’re determined to keep paying.“Nobody wants to be the CEO who cuts the dividend,” said Noah Barrett, a Denver-based energy analyst at Janus Henderson Group Plc, which manages about $375 billion. “They understand that any company that cuts, its shareholders will flow into competitors and be very, very hesitant to ever come back.”To buy time, they’re taking the ax to capital expenditure. Exxon partially reversed course on an ambitious spending program on Monday, saying it’s weighing significant cuts after being downgraded by S&P Global Ratings. Shell’s outlook was revised to negative on Tuesday by the agency, and risks a rating downgrade unless it lowers its leverage and increases funds from operations.Shell, Chevron Corp., and Total may also choose to save money for dividends by reducing their share-buyback programs, which are typically seen by investors as more discretionary than the quarterly cash payouts.Chevron said last week that it’s reviewing options for cutting capital spending and curbing short-term production. BP Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said the British major could curb spending by as much as 20% this year.While market expectations for Big Oil dividends have reduced over the past two weeks, pricing in a 37% cut from 2019 dividends for European majors in 2021, Goldman Sachs analysts including Michele Della Vigna said that they do not expect a cut because of the current environment. “In past oil downturns, Big Oil on aggregate did not respond to challenging macro conditions through material dividend cuts,” they said in a research note Tuesday.Serious QuestionsEven before the crash in prices, Big Oil was in a difficult place. The industry was the worst performing part of the stock market as investors fretted about its ability to navigate the energy transition, invest enough in keeping their businesses going and meet their obligations to shareholders.“The situation as it stands looks pretty challenged for most of the oil majors, if you were to assume that prices will persist at these levels,” said Nick Stansbury, head of commodity research at Legal & General Investment Management, one of the largest shareholders of major oil companies. “If it sticks for six, nine months, then there will be serious questions raised about the sustainability of dividends.”These companies’ sheer size gives them the financial flexibility to allow business to continue even in times of significant hardship. Beyond lower spending, Europe’s oil companies could opt to pay dividends to investors in scrip, where cash is substituted with new shares. BP’s Gilvary said this is one tool in his armory, but the company isn’t considering it right now.Letting debt rise is another option, but Exxon’s downgrade shows the limit of that strategy.“They’re going to have to lean on the balance sheet,” Barrett said. “At some point though, borrowing to pay the dividend is not sustainable.”Enduring PainShell declined to comment on its dividend. Exxon spokesman Casey Norton referred back to CEO Darren Woods’s comments at the March 5 investor day when he said the company is “committed to a reliable and growing dividend.” The company has increased the payout each year for the past 37 years.Maintaining and growing Chevron’s dividend is “top priority,” said spokesman Braden Reddall said by email, reiterating comments earlier this month from CEO Mike Wirth, who said Chevron is on track to raise its annual per-share payout for the 33rd time in 2020.The flood of Saudi crude onto the market, coupled with slumping demand as the world’s largest economies stop people from traveling and spending, threaten to create an unprecedented oil surplus that could weigh on prices for a long time.In an enduring slump, Shell’s first remedy would be to revise its share-buyback program. Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden already said in January the company would probably miss its target of buying back $25 billion of shares by the end of this year if the macroeconomic environment didn’t improve. Since then, oil prices have fallen by almost half.Investments in clean energy could also suffer if there’s a lasting downturn. The big European oil companies have been outlining increasingly ambitious strategies to tackle their carbon emissions that will, eventually, require significant capital expenditure.BP is the boldest so far, saying it will eliminate all its emissions from its own production and operations by 2050. Shell and Total have also made pledges to reduce emissions.While it’s unlikely that European oil companies will backtrack on their green commitments, low crude prices are typically not good for alternative energy, said Stansbury.Historic ShiftSome oil companies, notably Occidental Petroleum Corp., have already responded to the current slump by cutting dividends. The debt-laden explorer will reduce its 2020 payment by about $2.2 billion, or 86%, setting up CEO Vicki Hollub for a showdown with investors to determine her future.If Occidental’s decision sent a tremor through the market, then a dividend cut from BP or Shell would cause an earthquake. Those two companies paid out $22 billion in 2019, 20% of the FTSE 100 dividends. U.S. counterparts Exxon and Chevron hold the second and ninth spot as dividend payers on the S&P 500.Persistent periods of low prices can dramatically reshape the industry. Between 1997 and 1999, Saudi Arabia competed against Venezuela for market share, sending Brent oil prices to as low as $10 a barrel. A wave of mergers followed, creating the era of the supermajors -- Exxon coupled with Mobil, BP bought Amoco, Total combined with Elf, and Chevron merged with Texaco.Throughout this turbulent history, these companies have managed to translate a very volatile commodity into dependable cash flows. If European oil companies can no longer fulfill that role it would be a serious concession, said Legal & General’s Stansbury.“Cutting the dividend is “a decision no CEO wants to be associated with,” says Russ Mould, investment director at U.K. asset manager AJ Bell Plc. “It can cost you your job.”(Updates with S&P downgrade details in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-big-crisis-save-204611096.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Exec: Oil Prices Have No Path To Upside For Now	Oil prices were lower by nearly 10% Monday morning and likely have more downside potential as we will &quot;likely see negative demand&quot; for the commodity this year, BP (NYSE: BP) CFO Brian Gilvary said on CNBC.What Happened BP was modeling as early as February demand for oil to weaken by 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day but still remain in positive territory. But instead of expecting a slower pace of growth, the oil giant is expecting demand for oil will contract -- a very rare event.Oil prices are under pressure after Russia and Saudi Arabia entered into a de-facto trade war and rising coronavirus related concerns are keeping many people at home across the world.Why It's Important The global oil market is dealing with a &quot;demand-side shock&quot; along with a significant amount of new oil scheduled to enter the market within the coming weeks, the CFO said.The company itself is operating from a &quot;much stronger financial position&quot; today compared to when Brent oil prices were at around $28 which is approximately $2 below the current price, he said.What's next for the oil market depends in part on what the &quot;new normal&quot; will be for the world, he said. The company is currently modeling Brent to rebound to around $40 a barrel in 2021, a figure which was actually modeled four years ago.Related Links:Coronavirus, Oil Crash Are 'One-Two Punch' To Stock Market, Says Warren BuffettBofA Downgrades 14 Oil And Gas Stocks In Face Of Oil Price WarSee more from Benzinga  * How COVID-19 Is Impacting Restaurants  * Carl Icahn Says Some Stocks Are Being 'Given Away'  * Slack CEO Sees Increased Demand From Businesses Of All Sizes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

That's the trouble XOM stock is in now.It's exposed at every level and its global exposure makes it worse, not better. There is no place to turn.XOM stock is off 47% year-to-date. And crude and natural gas prices continue to plummet. The upside is, it has a sizable 8.3% dividend that's pretty safe. But there could be more than that in downside left. BP (BP)Source: TK Kurikawa / Shutterstock.com BP (NYSE:BP) is off 42% in the past month. Remember this is one of the oil giants and has a $90 billion market capitalization. This is not a small company where its stock price rises and falls like the sun.BP, like most of the other integrated oil majors, is in trouble because there's nowhere to turn in this kind of market. And now the global economy is looking shaky.And the fact is, if everyone is avoiding travel, shopping and public school, that directly and indirectly kills its business.Granted the stock is providing a 11.6% dividend now. But this is far too soon to jump in to get that. There's more downside left and that bottom hasn't been found yet. Meanwhile, other stocks have much better prospects due to revolutionary technology. ConocoPhillips (COP)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a major global exploration and production (E&P) company with other integrated operations. It has a good share of natural gas in its portfolio as well.But this is a very demand-based end of the business, and one of the most volatile. When energy prices were steady, it was ideal for COP since it could produce at a stable margin and create efficiencies to maximize those margins.Also, the U.S. economy was expanding, so it could sell into the market and deliver good numbers every quarter.Now, all that has changed. With decreasing demand, its access to and ability to supply energy products is not helping move the needle.The stock is off 56% in the past year, and 52% in the past month. The downside momentum is still very strong. Don't be tempted by its 6% dividend. Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is another global E&P player. It also has some midstream and downstream operations, but its business is pulling energy out of the ground.And that's not a great business right now. As a matter of fact, it's a terrible business right now.The stock is off 82% in the past year and 70% in the past month. And you can be sure, it won't be long until its massive 26.8% dividend gets cut. I'm all for bargain hunting if a company is actually a good buy, but don't bottom fish this thing right now; it's still a falling knife.Carl Icahn announced this week that he is looking to pick up a 10% share of the company here. That may sound encouraging, but unless you have a very long time frame and as much capital to be wrong as Icahn does, your best bet is to avoid this one for a while. PetroChina (PTR)Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com PetroChina (NYSE:PTR) is one of Asia's largest energy companies, but it hardly comes close to its global peers.It's one of two companies that supplies most of China with its energy needs and has created a fast-growing company that is building its global reputation by creating partnerships with larger majors.Yet while its long-term future is bright, given the support of the Chinese government, its short-term fate is a little less certain. First the U.S.-China trade war, and now Covid-19. That's a big one-two punch.The stock is off 50% in the past year and it has just announced that it's going to suspend shipments of liquified natural gas (LNG) imports for at least the next quarter. That was a deal it had with XOM and others. That's not a good sign of the demand in China. Devon Energy (DVN)Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is a decent-sized North American E&P company, with a $2.9 billion market cap.While most energy companies are struggling here, this is a good example of how the upstream sector is being impacted. It's usually the sector that's most leveraged to supply and demand issues with oil and natural gas production. (The select few energy stocks that make my Growth Investor list right now are midstream and downstream companies).DVN stock is off 67% in the past month and 74% in the past 12 months. This is a difficult trend and it's not a place where you should walk in thinking the worst is over.It's possible there may be an overreaction to the potential for a global recession, but it's not worth betting on right now.This is a risky sector that shouldn't be a risky investment, given all the oil and natural gas in the North American shale deposits where DVN works. Steer clear for now. Cimarex Energy (XEC)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Cimarex Energy (NYSE:XEC) is another E&P that's half the size (by market cap) of DVN. Yet its problems are just as big.XEC operates in the Southwest shale regions, including the big daddy of them all, the Permian Basin. But it doesn't matter how much oil and natural gas you can produce if there isn't a market that wants it.Shutting down wells or running them at half capacity is not what E&P companies want to do. But that is what has to be done. Some analysts are betting that this situation is overblown and are stepping in, but they're in the very small minority.The stock is off 62% in the past month and 78% in the past 12 months. This is another one to avoid in one of the hardest-hit sectors in the energy patch.The bottom line, though, is that energy companies are in a terrible position right now. Besides $30 per barrel oil, you have to consider that in the United States the stocks are basically not sold in 33 blue states; they're divesting due to environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investing philosophies.Instead, the companies I'm particularly keen on now are facilitating the spread of ultra-fast internet worldwide -- anywhere there's a cell tower. The 5G Buildout Is an Incredible Opportunity for Investors Right NowWithin two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. With 5G, we'll have cable modem speeds on any device; no need to plug in. That's a big deal for rural areas … the very same areas that are also key to President Donald Trump's reelection. So, by pushing 5G over the goal line, Trump will deliver a big win for his base -- and strike a blow against Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies.But, in the big picture, 5G is about much more than trade wars and faster downloads. Because 5G is 100 times faster than 4G, it'll allow your internet devices to work in real time. That advancement is a game changer for tech companies.With the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity with 5G stocks now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics … but they can't compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it's got ultra-fast 5G. That's how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I'm targeting is enjoying an influx of big money on Wall Street, and it has strong fundamentals, too -- making it an &quot;A&quot;-rated &quot;Strong Buy&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system.Click here to watch my new, free briefing on this extraordinary technology and the opportunity with 5G stocks.When you do, you'll see how to claim a free copy of my new stock report, The Netflix of 5G, which has full details on this company -- and what makes it such a great investment.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

The Oil Crisis Is Even Worse News for Shell and BP	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The collapse in crude prices has brought into relief the correlation between oil majors’ financial leverage and the valuation of their shares. It’s a relationship that looks like particularly bad news for the bigger European firms.Investors’ knee-jerk reaction to the downward lurch in the oil price was, naturally, more severe toward the companies that were more indebted. So shares in BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Equinor ASA and Eni SpA suffered more than Total SA and the two big U.S. majors, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., when European markets closed on Monday.Investors’ worries about leverage are longstanding. The top five European oil majors have a ratio of net debt to total capital — a leverage measure known as gearing — averaging 28% based on their 2019 annual results. Meanwhile, Exxon and Chevron were at 20% and 15%, respectively, at the full year, according to Bloomberg data. Valuations based on forward earnings have historically been lower in Europe than in the U.S., and analysts have suggested that leverage may help explain why investors rate the European sector less favorably. As research from UBS Group AG noted ahead of Monday’s sell-off, balance-sheet strength would define which oil majors got “less badly hurt” in a market where there would be no winners.Despite these dynamics, the most levered of the European groups have been making relatively slow progress at debt reduction, and the latest crisis is only going to hamper this further. BP and Shell’s gearing is already above their own near-term targets of 20%- 30% and 25% respectively. These targets assumed a different environment, and preventing gearing going back up would require some painful compromises around uses of cash.Shell’s free cash flow in 2019 was only just enough to cover its dividends and debt interest, adjusting for working capital and excluding what it made selling assets. That was with oil prices in the $55-$70 per barrel range, against around $37 now. Capex was also already below the company’s stated floor, and the group has just gone through a colossal efficiency program following the 2016 acquisition of BG Group. As for debt reduction, this is a terrible market in which to be selling assets. True, Shell could scrap its share buyback program, but that would halt progress on reducing the share count and in turn the absolute cost of the dividend. BP, on the other hand, provocatively raised its dividend last month, anticipating cash from recently agreed-on disposals and from the sale of a putative $5 billion worth of assets yet to find buyers. But the number put on that fresh divestment program must now be in doubt.The oil crisis should force a fresh appraisal of gearing targets and dividend levels. But investors crave the income, and the pressure to maintain payouts will be immense. The firms with lower leverage may feel they have earned the right to let borrowings tick up as a way of maintaining investment and cash to shareholders. For others, Shell in particular, the room for maneuver is more limited. Defending the dividend is likely to mean finding more costs and capital expenditure to cut, just when investing in the energy transition is the top strategic priority.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nicole Torres at ntorres51@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

2020-02-25	2020-02-25 10:40:31	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP’s Bold Climate Plan Doesn’t Add Up to Net Zero	(Bloomberg) -- After months of planning, BP’s new CEO Bernard Looney made his big green pitch: Europe’s second-largest oil company will cut its emissions to net zero by 2050, he said earlier this month. Many thought that made BP the world’s first supermajor to take responsibility for all its emissions.It did not do that.Every company has three types of emissions. BP’s so-called Scope 1 emissions are those directly produced by the company, such as natural gas used to heat BP buildings. “Scope 2” emissions are created by another entity, for example a coal power plant powering BP refineries. Finally, “Scope 3” emissions are all those that can be directly tied to the company, including emissions customers generate when using BP fuels.BP is only going to cut some, not all, of its Scope 3 emissions. Sensing some confusion at that concept at his presentation on Feb. 12, Looney took to a drawing board to explain. “I’ve probably drawn this 50 times,” he said.BP’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions are about 55 million metric tons each year, he explained, drawing a small horizontal bar. Then he drew two much bigger bars—and called both Scope 3. One was about 360 million metric tons and another “around” 1 billion metric tons.You won’t find the larger number in BP’s annual reports, which for 2018 put the company’s Scope 3 emissions at 437 million metric tons. But it is a number that the CEO is confident enough to mention at his big climate announcement.The 360 million metric tons was the amount of Scope 3 emissions BP would reduce to net zero; those were emissions from the oil and gas the company extracts itself, Looney said. The higher figure, 1 billion metric tons, includes refinery outputs for crude that BP buys from other producers and additional energy products that BP markets, such as power or gas supply agreements, a spokesman later explained. The company plans to cut its carbon intensity by 50%.BP does not officially report that higher figure, because, the spokesman said, calculations get “more complex” as you move downstream. That’s why Looney added “around”, he said. Still confused? You’re not alone. The energy industry has no standard definition of Scope 3 emissions. That means every company is free to choose how they define it, and comparisons of those figures can be like comparing apples to oranges. Crucially, because most emissions reporting is voluntary, many of the largest oil companies, including ExxonMobil and Saudi Aramco, choose not to report Scope 3 emissions at all.Industry groups have made some attempts at standardization but none have succeeded. A spokesman for the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, which counts 13 large oil companies as its members, said it has created an “internal benchmark” but there is “no established joint methodology.” Without strict regulation on standards and requirement to report Scope 3 emissions, we are likely to remain confused.Looney’s reasoning for choosing to cut only 360 million out of 1 billion metric tons is that, if the companies BP buys its crude from also take responsibility to cut their respective Scope 3 emissions for the oil they extract, then all involved could avoid double-counting. In effect, we’d all be heading toward a net-zero world.“In 2050, the world ain’t going to be arguing about Scope 3 or not,” Looney said. “We are going to be arguing about whether we’ve reduced our emissions or not.”But “oil companies cannot avoid the Scope 3 debate,” said Rory Sullivan of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. First, what you can’t (or won’t) count, you won’t cut. Second, as the oil and gas industry looks to renew its social license to operate, it needs to be seen to be taking responsibility for its actions. However you count them, Scope 3 forms the majority of an oil company’s total emissions.It’s easy for Looney to swat away definitional arguments. He won’t be BP’s CEO in 2050. What we can be sure about is that the climate debate will rage more strongly in the decades ahead, and someone will have to take responsibility for all Scope 3 emissions. The question is whether it will be the oil industry that pays the price for it—or all of us.Akshat Rathi writes the Net Zero newsletter on the intersection of climate science and emission-free tech.

Big Oil Explores Adding More Cheap Ethanol to Gasoline in Iowa	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are exploring adding more ethanol in gasoline in top corn state Iowa to take advantage of how cheap the biofuel has become.The oil majors are gauging driver interest at a small number of stations in 15% ethanol blends, up from the current state standard of 10%, after the Trump administration in May allowed an increase nationwide.Adding more ethanol to gasoline may help Midwest farmers who have been struggling to find markets for corn after biofuels demand plateaued last year. Ethanol futures slumped to the lowest in more than a decade in 2019, making it unprofitable to make the biofuel that accounts for about a third of demand for the U.S. corn crop. But cheap ethanol won’t save drivers much money: At current prices, filling up a Ford-F150 would only cost about a quarter less.The BP-branded Elliott Oil Co. has for about two weeks been selling some E15 in the small town of Osceola, CEO Andrew Woodard said. BP spokesman Michael Abendhoff said the company does not comment on marketing strategy.John Reese, downstream policy and advocacy manager in the Americas for Shell, said at the National Ethanol Conference in Houston that Shell offers higher ethanol blends, without offering specifics.Shell spokesman Ray Fisher said the company is working to add E15 in Iowa, Indiana and Illinois. “Prior to implementing E15, there is due diligence to ensure we can deliver a quality product and meet state regulations.”Benchmark Chicago cash ethanol traded at a one-year low in January, with the price decline generating interest in adding more to the mix. But that’s less than a penny per gallon below pump prices.Efforts to boost ethanol have an edge because the U.S. is sending only trace amounts of it to China, and Mexico is trending toward using less corn-based fuel, Corey Lavinsky, ethanol analyst at S&P Global Platts, said by email.There is also some political support. Iowa’s governor included an E15 tax credit extension and expansion in the state’s budget proposal.Iowa drivers like E15, and retailers have noticed, said Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association in West Des Moines, by telephone.“It’s happening because enough independents in Iowa, they know there’s no stigma, that Iowans will buy this stuff,” Shaw said.To contact the reporters on this story: Jeffrey Bair in Houston at jbair4@bloomberg.net;Michael Hirtzer in Chicago at mhirtzer@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Jessica SummersFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-explores-adding-more-203311585.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-13	2020-02-13 15:31:14	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP Beefs Up Carbon Capture Team in Bid to Meet Climate Goals	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc is expanding its team working on carbon capture and storage projects as part of its ambition to zero out net greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.The oil major has added staff over the past 12 months and is reorganizing teams that have been dispersed within different units of the company, a spokesperson confirmed. The moves build on Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney’s announcement Wednesday that BP will target pollution not only from its own energy use but from the fuel its customers use, known as Scope 3 carbon emissions.The moves add the weight of Europe’s second-biggest oil company to efforts to make the technology a commercial reality. Carbon capture is a broad set of technologies that can be deployed to cut emissions from industrial plants. The goal is to bury pollutants underground instead of allowing them to escape into the atmosphere and contribute to climate change.The hiring spree “is a rejuvenation of the size and speed and seriousness of (carbon capture) activity within BP,” said Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh. The company declined to provide more details on how many new people they are taking on or how many people work in the field now. The move is an indication of BP’s ambition to tackle Scope 3 emissions, which is about 90% of the carbon footprint of most oil companies. While the industry burns some fossil fuel to run refineries and deliver gasoline to service stations, its largest impact on the environment is in the oil products its customers burn. Looney said carbon-capture projects will have to be part of the solution to reaching the net-zero target. “Trillions of dollars will need to be invested in re-plumbing and rewiring the world’s energy system,” Looney said Wednesday in a statement outlining his plan. “It will require nothing short of re-imagining energy as we know it.”Read More: How Much Carbon Dioxide Is in the Atmosphere?BP flirted with carbon-capture technologies in the early 2000s, when the U.K. government put out a series of bids and competitions to attract private companies to build technology capabilities and large infrastructure projects. The U.K. government’s flip-flop on supporting the technology cost BP as much as $50 million, which it had spent studying the feasibility of the world’s first natural-gas power plant fitted with the equipment.Under new leadership, BP is aiming to align its emissions targets to match the ambition that governments set under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. That deal brokered by the United Nations aims to keep global temperature increases since the industrial revolution “well below 2° Celsius,” a level that would still mark the quickest shift in the climate since the last ice age ended. Every climate model setting out how that goal can be reached suggests carbon capture will be essential.The technology plays only a marginal role in cutting emissions today, partly because each plant can cost $1 billion or more, and governments so far have been reluctant to subsidize it or put an appropriate price on carbon. Some 20 large scale projects that can capture about 40 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, about 1% of global emissions, are working now.As part of its commitment, last month BP joined the Global CCS Institute, an industry body promoting the use of carbon capture technology. Read more: Why Company Carbon Cuts Should Include “Scope” CheckThe company is currently leading a group looking to build a zero-carbon cluster at the U.K.’s Teesside industrial complex, which includes oil refineries and chemical factories. It’s part of a project run by the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, which includes Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA. The plan would be to inject carbon emissions into rock formations deep under the North Sea. Haszeldine said that the project “could serve as a carbon dioxide store for many, many decades.”If it’s built, the Teesside project aims to capture as much as 6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, or about 2% of the U.K.’s annual emissions. The OGCI estimates the single project could create up to 4,000 jobs. That’s only one of the industrial sites ripe for the technology. Others include plants near the Humber river, Merseyside, Runcorn and in Grangemouth. Those places employ more than 90,000 people in chemicals and oil refining.The U.K. government, which has set its own legally mandated goal of hitting net-zero emissions by 2050, is also looking to invest in carbon-capture technologies. Prime Minister Boris Johnson committed to spend 800 million pounds ($1 billion) toward scaling up the technology in his party’s manifesto before the December election. Haszeldine says that the government is looking to stump as much as 30% of a project cost, if private companies pony up the rest.To contact the author of this story: Akshat Rathi in London at arathi39@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net, Lars PaulssonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-beefs-carbon-capture-team-153114864.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-13	2020-02-13 14:01:31	BP	BP p.l.c.	Piper Sandler: These 3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Have Plenty of Growth Ahead	Markets started 2020 with a 5% gain on the S&P 500. It's a fine cap to start the year, but will it last? Not so sure; Wall Street is predicting a far more modest run in 2020, with the end-year targets averaging just a 2% gain.The outlook reflects relative risk assessment, rather than depression. With the coronavirus outbreak, and a US Presidential election just nine months away, 2020 is starting out with plenty of uncertainty on the horizon.That uncertainty has investors worried, and when investors get worried they look for a safety net in their investment strategy. It’s a draw that naturally pulls them to dividend stocks. Dividend stocks don’t offer the same high share appreciation as growth stocks, but they do offer a steady income stream. And when markets are volatile, a steady income stream is a hot commodity.With this in mind, analysts from Minnesota-based investment firm Piper Sandler have tagged three energy stocks as particularly noteworthy, offering investors a valuable combination of high dividends, and even higher upsides. Using the Stock Comparison tool from TipRanks, we can look at these three tickers, side by side, comparing their attributes. All are Buy-rated with dividend payouts exceeding 5%, and show an upside between 20% and 45%.Black Stone Minerals (BSM)We’ll start with Black Stone, a Houston-based oil and gas exploration and development company. Black Stone controls over 20 million acres across 40 states, but the bulk of its operations are in the South (Alabama-Mississippi, Louisiana-Arkansas, Texas-Oklahoma) and the Northern Plains (Montana-North Dakota). The company also has a presence in the Appalachian gas fields of Pennsylvania and West Virginia.Black Stone’s ability to continue making money in the current environment was clear in the last quarterly report. The company beat the earnings forecast by 10%, reporting 32 cents per share on revenues of $137.4 million. The free cash flow reached $89.2 million, marking the fifth quarter in a row of FCF gains. BSM reports Q4 2019 on February 24 and is expected to show 26 cents EPS.Investors should note the rising FCF. Black Stone has used that money, at least in part, to fund a high dividend. The company pays out 30 cents per share quarterly, or $1.20 annually, which may not sound like much – but the yield is impressive at 11.4%. That’s almost 6 times the average yield among S&P companies. The payout ratio is 93%, indicating that BSM pays back most of its profits to shareholders – and that the payment is sustainable in current conditions.Piper Sandler analyst Pearce Hammond looks at BSM in the context of the gas industry generally, and draws a bullish conclusion. He writes, “While natural gas headwinds might intensify further in coming months, we believe this negativity is largely reflected in the unit price and there is a favorable risk/reward tradeoff... Most important, nothing cures low prices like low prices, and we expect declining natural gas drilling combined with further demand growth to result in improving natural gas s/d fundamentals over the next twelve months.”In short, Hammond sees BSM in position to grow this year, and puts an $18 price target behind his Buy rating. That target indicates a 75% upside potential. (To watch Hammond’s track record, click here)Black Stone’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is derived from 2 recent Buy reviews – and 3 Holds. Opinions are mixed on this stock, but note that even the low-ball price target estimate is higher than the current share price. The average target, $14.90, suggests room for 45% upside growth. (See Black Stone stock analysis on TipRanks)BP PLC (BP)Our next stock is a $123 billion staple of the oil industry, BP. This is the sixth largest oil and gas company globally, and brought in over $300 billion in calendar 2018 revenues. The low prices plaguing the industry through 2019 pushed hard on the bottom line, however, and BP’s 2019 profits were down 21%.At the same time, despite the slip, the $10 billion profit reported beat the forecast of $9.7 billion. Looking ahead, there are indications that production cuts by OPEC – in the range of 500,000 barrels per day – could help improve the supply-demand situation in 2020. Should OPEC be successful in its moves to push prices back toward $60 per barrel, companies like BP would see immediate gains. That would be a welcome change from the 13% price drop in Brent crude over the past 12 months.Despite the low prices and decline in profits, BP has maintained its dividend. The company announced a 63-cent quarterly payment this month, making the annual payout $2.52 and the yield a strong 6.6%. BP has been raising the dividend payment modestly over the past 4 years.Writing on the stock after the earnings report, Piper Sandler's Ryan Todd reiterated his $47 price target and Buy rating. He was particularly impressed by the dividend, writing, “…while 2020 guidance was largely in line, capex again at the low end of the guided range combined with success to date on disposals should set the stage for a coming ramp in shareholder distributions… the [dividend] raise was modest, [and] represents the second sequential (annual) bump to the dividend and management’s commitment to growing shareholder distributions going forward.”Todd’s price target suggests a 26% upside to BP shares. (To watch Todd’s track record, click here)BP is another Moderate Buy, according to the analyst consensus view. The stock has received 2 Buy ratings and 1 Hold in recent weeks. Shares are priced at $36.54, and the average target of $45 implies an upside of 23%. (See BP stock analysis on TipRanks)Total SA (TOT)Our final stock on the list, like BP, is a ‘Supermajor,’ one of the few giant companies that collectively are called “Big Oil.” Total has a $128 billion market cap, brings in some $200 billion in annual revenue, and sees more than $11 billion in net profit.Where BP has been facing lower quarterly earnings, TOT’s quarterlies are rising. In Q4, the company saw $1.19 EPS, for a 1% year-over-gain and a 5% sequential gain. The rising earnings came even as total revenues slipped. The top-line number was down 6% year-over-year, to $49.3 billion – another indication of the impact low prices have on the sector.Total’s oil production in the fourth quarter was 3.113 billion barrels per day, up 8% from the year before, while gas production showed a 4% gain to 7.264 billion cubic feet. The company saw an 8% decrease in realized oil prices, and a 25% drop in gas prices, over the course of 2019. Total ended Q4 2019 with $27.4 billion cash on hand, essentially flat year-over-year.The company has been using its cash to boost shares, with a $1.75 billion share buyback in 2019. Going forward, management expects to buy back $2 billion worth of shares in 2020. These buybacks are part of a planned program, in place for the 2018 to 2020 time horizon, totaling $5 billion.Along with share buybacks, TOT pays out a reliable quarterly dividend. The annualized payment, at $2.93, makes the yield 5.99%. For investors, the best feature of the dividend is the payout ratio. At 51%, it’s high enough to show a company commitment to paying back shareholders, while not so high to spark worries about sustainability.Analyst Ryan Todd, quoted above on BP, also reviewed TOT. He believes that this company is the best option for investors looking for an oil play, writing, “While not immune to macro headwinds, the combination of above average production growth and high-margin project starts managed to hold earnings flat YoY in a peer group showing material declines – outperformance that we expect to continue in 2020. We continue to view Total as best positioned to support both top-line growth and upside to growing shareholder returns.”Todd reiterated his Buy rating on the stock, and set a $68 price target. His target suggests a robust 36% upside for Total over the coming 12 months.TOT is the only stock in this list with a Strong Buy analyst consensus. This rating is based on 4 Buys and 1 Hold set recently. The stock is trading at $49.81, and the average price target of $67.31 indicates room for 30% upside growth potential.

2020-02-13	2020-02-13 05:00:01	BP	BP p.l.c.	All Eyes on Exxon, Chevron After BP Pledges to Be Carbon Neutral	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc’s pledge to zero out all its carbon emissions by 2050 deepens the divide between major European and American oil producers on climate change, increasing the pressure for Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. to do more.The U.S. supermajors have only committed to reducing greenhouse gases from their own operations, which typically account for just 10% of fossil fuel pollution. BP on Wednesday followed Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Equinor ASA in pledging to offset emissions from the fuels they sell to customers, representing about 90% of the total.“If we do see capital flowing into BP, that may force the U.S. majors to rethink the speed at which they move on carbon reduction targets,” said Noah Barrett, a Denver-based energy analyst at Janus Henderson, which manages $356 billion. Still, he doesn’t see “Chevron or Exxon adopting a BP-like strategy in the near future” as they “have historically been less aggressive in their shift away from traditional oil and gas.”Concerns about global warming are increasingly reshaping investment policies, with BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. becoming the latest high-profile investors to demand companies improve environmental, social and governance metrics, or ESG.Exxon and Chevron, the West’s number one and three oil producers, say it’s not up to them to offset emissions from cars, factories and other polluters known in the industry as Scope 3. For Exxon, such emissions are the “result of choices consumers make.” Chevron says “well-designed policies and carbon pricing mechanisms” are needed.But BP’s announcement “could be a real tipping point where the norm becomes taking responsibility” for customer emissions, said Kathy Mulvey, a campaign director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “For a company to continue to stick their heads in the sand and refuse to take responsibility for those harmful impacts is not a sustainable business model.”Exxon and Chevron do agree with the goals of the Paris Agreement, support a carbon tax and are committed to cleaning up emissions from their vast network of wells, refineries and pipelines. They joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative later than their European rivals but are still fully paid up members. They even lobbied against U.S President Donald Trump’s plan to roll back Obama-era emission standards.The fundamental difference with European peers, however, is that neither is reducing commitment to their oil and gas business by chasing the crowd into lower-margin renewables such as wind and solar.When asked about potentially following Shell into the power sector, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth was clear in an interview with Bloomberg News last year.“We don’t see distinctive differentiating capabilities that would say, ‘wow we can do this better,’” he said. “And it’s inherently lower return than the other things we could invest money in.”Chevron is investing in early-stage technologies that could help aid carbon capture and energy storage, but that’s a small fraction of its budget. The company helps customers clean up their energy usage by supplying gas for power generation that’s cleaner than coal, developing biofuels and adding renewable energy sources like wind and geothermal, it said in a statement.Exxon CEO Darren Woods says the real answer to climate change will come through technologies that haven’t yet been invented. The company said in a statement it has invested more than $10 billion over the past 20 years in researching and developing low emissions technologies.The oil giant is working on proprietary technologies that would reduce emissions in areas like aviation, heavy duty vehicles and industrial processes. “We can bring more value in the space where we don’t know what the solution is but we need one,” Woods said in an April interview. Exxon has pedigree in this field. It invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s.This approach will likely come under attack at this year’s round of shareholder meetings in May. Both companies are being asked by Dutch activist investor group Follow This to align their strategies with the Paris Agreement. Exxon is asking the Securities and Exchange Commission to exclude that proposal from a shareholder vote, arguing it “seeks to micromanage” the company.To contact the reporter on this story: Kevin Crowley in Houston at kcrowley1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net, Carlos Caminada, Dan ReichlFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eyes-exxon-chevron-bp-pledges-192925250.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-13	2020-02-13 00:01:00	BP	BP p.l.c.	Less Oil, No Carbon, Few Answers: BP CEO’s Hazy Vision of Future	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc’s new boss set out the oil industry’s boldest plan to tackle climate change. All that’s missing is the map for how to get there.Bernard Looney, who has been chief executive officer for just a week, committed BP to eliminating all emissions from its own operations and production by 2050. That’s a radical shift for one of the world’s largest and oldest oil companies, and he gave a blunt admission that he didn’t know how to achieve it.“Every journey has to begin with a destination,” Looney said as he presented his new strategy in London on Wednesday. “I appreciate you want more than a vision -- you want to see milestones, near-term targets, some ways to measure progress. We do not have those for you right now.”One thing was clear from Looney’s plan -- and it’s a big deal for a company that tapped the first fields in Iran in the early 20th century and drilled wildcat wells on the Alaskan frontier more than 60 years ago.In an industry obsessed with finding the next barrel, BP has accepted that its oil and gas production will decline. The company will reconsider its exploration strategy, sell its most carbon-intensive assets and divert spending from fossil fuels to other things.“I get it. The world does have a carbon budget. It is finite and it’s running out fast,” Looney said, adopting the language of climate activists in his pitch. “We have got to change, and change profoundly.”BP’s own operations emit the equivalent of about 55 million tons a year of carbon dioxide, while the oil and gas it pumps from the ground adds another 360 million tons. Looney said both categories of greenhouse gases will be eliminated on a net basis by 2050 or earlier.That goes further than pledges from Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA, and is far ahead of U.S. peers Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. Only Spain’s Repsol SA has gone further by pledging to fully eliminate “Scope 3” emissions, including fuel it buys from other producers and sells to consumers.BP will reduce by half the carbon intensity of the fuel it sells but doesn’t produce itself, Looney said.Deep reductions in Scope 3 emissions are a big step for an industry that produces the bulk of the world’s planet-warming gases. To fulfill that pledge, Looney or his successors may one day face a hard reckoning -- either shift energy production completely to renewables, invent a commercially viable technology to store the carbon emitted from burning oil and gas, or shut down the business.Looney was clear that he had no intention of choosing the third option.“BP is going to be in the oil and gas business for a very long time,” he said in a question and answer session after the presentation.Whatever hydrocarbons BP is still pumping in 2050 will have to be subject to carbon capture and storage, a technology that’s been touted for decades but hasn’t yet been implemented on a broad commercial scale.“I’m not going to get drawn into how much oil we’re producing in 30 years time,” Looney said. “I do believe the technology exists” for carbon capture, he said.On clean energy investments, the CEO was intentionally vague. “We don’t plan to commit to an arbitrary or pre-set number,” he said. “The goal is not just to spend more money, it is to invest wisely.”In one of his last interviews before leaving office, Looney’s predecessor Bob Dudley warned against Big Oil moving too fast on new technologies to counter climate change, because their failure could lead to financial ruin.Still, 49-year-old Looney is clearly embracing a different style and agenda to Dudley. He’s often seen in jeans and open-necked shirts with his sleeves rolled up. He recently joined Instagram, where he talks about climate change.Unanswered QuestionsBP’s ultimate goal to be a thriving and sustainable energy company, Looney said.“BP will have a very high quality oil and gas business” that over time is likely to get smaller and be de-carbonized, he said in an interview with Bloomberg television. “At the same time, I see us building and growing new low- or zero-carbon businesses.”Looney said he will offer greater detail in September “and in the months and years to come.”BP’s bold plan drew wide support, with industry insiders, major investors and even environmental pressure groups voicing their praise.“Looney made an outstanding decision,” said Mark van Baal of Follow This, an activist investor that’s been pressing oil companies to set carbon targets. “We, the shareholders, have to support him through thick and thin now.”Yet the lack of detail left BP open to criticism, suggesting it will remain in the cross-hairs of some environmental groups.BP’s ambitions “leave the urgent questions unanswered,” Charlie Kronick, oil adviser from Greenpeace U.K., said in a statement. “What is the scale and schedule for the renewables investment they barely mention? And what are they going to do this decade, when the battle to protect our climate will be won or lost?”&#92;--With assistance from Alix Steel.To contact the reporter on this story: Laura Hurst in London at lhurst3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/less-oil-no-carbon-few-182336716.html?.tsrc=rss

Ubben’s ValueAct Capital Buys Into BP On Carbon-Cutting Pledge	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc’s ambitious plan to go green is winning accolades from at least one high-profile investor.ValueAct Capital Management started building a position in BP after an “inspired” presentation Wednesday from the energy giant’s new boss about his plans to eliminate almost all its carbon emissions, according to ValueAct Chairman Jeff Ubben.The bet is on BP Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney’s vision for the oil and gas company, which goes far beyond any of its peers, Ubben said in an interview. While Ubben had been studying the company for a while, he was inspired to buy shares during Looney’s pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions from operations and production to net zero within 30 years.“I just started buying while I was watching,” Ubben said. “Someone needs to stand up and reward these guys.”The investment was made through the $1 billion ValueAct Spring Fund, which is focused on social and environmental investing, Ubben said. BP’s strategy is exactly the sort of investment the fund is looking for, he said. He didn’t disclose the size of his stake.While peers including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and Equinor ASA have responded to investor pressure by adopting targets for emissions curbs, none has promised to zero them out like BP.It highlights the perils of investing in companies with so-called environmental, social and governance agendas, Ubben said.“ESG is total crap,” Ubben said, noting that the five most owned stocks in ESG funds are Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Visa Inc., Apple Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc.. “It is worse than greenwashing, since these investors ignore the externalities of Google mining your privacy; Visa earning monopoly rents on the back of small business; and Apple’s extractive business model of selling you a new phone full of mined materials as often as possible.”He said to actually have an impact, investors have to get involved with the companies where their core business deals directly with the biggest problems of the day, which he said is climate change. To that end, he said the ValueAct Spring Fund has joined the board of power producer AES Corp. to help facilitate its move away from fossil fuels and the private board of Nikola Corp.Representatives for Apple, Visa, and Alphabet weren’t immediately available for comment.ValueAct on Wednesday also was granted a seat on the board of Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc. Eva Zlotnicka, managing director of the Spring Fund, will join the board and also sit on its compensation committee.ValueAct, which owns a 1.5% stake in the utility, had urged Hawaiian Electric to look externally for a successor to CEO Constance Lau in a November letter to stakeholders, arguing it needed a shift in corporate culture. ValueAct also raised concerns that the company wouldn’t reach its renewable targets.“As an island economy, sustainability is must,” Ubben said. “It is an inspired place, with legislative and regulatory leadership that wants to reward innovation. Hawaiian Electric management and board have taken on the challenge to move faster off of base-load oil.”The San Francisco-based hedge fund disclosed its original stake in Hawaiian Electric in October 2018 through the Spring Fund. Total shareholder returns since ValueAct disclosed its position have been about 38%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Last month, Ubben, the founder of ValueAct, was replaced as CEO of the activist firm by Mason Morfit. Ubben remains chairman and will continue to help run the Spring Fund.&#92;--With assistance from Laura Hurst.To contact the reporter on this story: Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Matthew Monks, Michael HythaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ubben-valueact-capital-buys-bp-221355472.html?.tsrc=rss

Sign up here.BP Plc’s new boss set out the boldest climate plan of any major oil company, pledging to eliminate almost all of the carbon emissions from its operations and the fuel it sells to customers.Bernard Looney, the company’s chief executive officer for just a week, set an ambitious agenda for what’s becoming an existential challenge for the oil industry. While peers including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and Equinor ASA have responded to investor pressure by adopting targets for emissions curbs, none has promised to zero-out all emissions from the fossil fuels they pump from the ground.“The world’s carbon budget is finite and running out fast; we need a rapid transition to net zero,” Looney said in a statement on Wednesday. “We have got to change -- and change profoundly.”Only Spain’s Repsol SA, a smaller refiner and energy producer, has gone further by pledging to fully eliminate “Scope 3” emissions, which include fuel it buys from third parties and sells to consumers.While Looney struck a confident tone, he faces an enormous task. The new CEO didn’t have detailed answers to questions about how to eliminate carbon from one of the world’s largest oil companies, which tapped the first fields in Iran in the early 20th century and drilled wildcat wells on the Alaskan frontier more than 60 years ago.“I appreciate you want more than a vision -- you want to see milestones, near-term targets, some ways to measure progress,” Looney said in a question and answer session posted on BP’s website. “We do not have those for you right now,” but will announce more measures in September, he said.Radical ChangeFor BP to survive the energy transition in a world that’s gradually falling out of love with oil, it will need to make big investments in new sources of clean energy, ensure cash keeps flowing from its fossil fuel assets, while also funneling generous returns to investors. It’s a tricky balancing act that its closest peer Shell is already struggling to master.BP’s commitment to do all this while still boosting free cash flow and shareholder returns is “really the key challenge,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria.As he presented his strategy in London, Looney said BP will remain an oil and gas business “for a very long time,” while also acknowledging that production will decline in the long term. Whatever is pumped in 2050 “will have to be de-carbonized” and the CEO said he’s big believer in the viability of the technology to capture and store CO2 emissions.BP also announced structural changes alongside its emissions target. Looney will dismantle its upstream and downstream businesses and reorganize them into a an entity made up of 11 new teams that will be more integrated and focused.“For us the statement represents a step change in terms of vision for the company and one that moves the group toward the biggest reorganization and modernization in at least two decades, if not a century,” analysts at Barclays Bank Plc said in a note. “The magnitude and radical nature of this shift should not be underestimated.”Targeting Scope 3 emissions is a big step for an industry that produces the bulk of the world’s planet-warming emissions. To fulfill the pledge, Looney or one of his successors may one day face a hard reckoning -- either shift energy production to renewables, invent commercially viable technology to store the carbon emitted from burning oil and gas, or stick with fossil fuels and accept that production will have to drop.BP’s own operations emit the equivalent of about 55 million tons a year of carbon dioxide, while the oil and gas it pumps from the ground adds another 360 million tons, the company said. Looney plans to eliminate both those sets of emissions on a net basis by 2050 or earlier.“This is what we mean by making BP net zero,” Looney said. “It directly addresses all the carbon we get out of the ground as well as all the greenhouse gases we emit from our operations. These will be absolute reductions, which is what the world needs.”Trans-Atlantic DivideBP also aims to reduce by half the carbon intensity of the products it markets -- crude and fuels it purchases from other companies and sells to its customers -- by offering people more choice of low- and no-carbon products. BP’s own upstream operations produced 1.14 million barrels a day of liquids in 2018, but it actually refined 1.7 million a day and its total sales to consumers were 2.74 million barrels a day, according to its annual report.The move increases the divide between oil companies on either side of the Atlantic. The European majors are heeding societal and investor pressures to drastically reduce their carbon footprint. Pledges from their American counterparts ExxonMobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. are more modest, focusing on reducing methane emissions and more generally aligning themselves with the Paris Climate Agreement.In the early 2000s, the company re-branded itself as “Beyond Petroleum” under another visionary CEO, John Browne. But big investments in solar power largely failed. In one of his last interviews before leaving office, Looney’s predecessor Bob Dudley warned against Big Oil moving too fast on new technologies to counter climate change, because their failure could lead to financial ruin.However, circumstances are changing. Becoming greener is no longer a choice for the world’s largest polluters.The damaging effects of rising global temperatures are increasingly evident and established investors are starting to worry about the vulnerability of their portfolios to a climate crisis. It was among the most debated subjects in this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos. Last month, BlackRock Inc. added its significant weight to a $41 trillion investor group that’s pressing the biggest emitters to change their ways.The Church of England Commissioners, one of the activist investors that has been pressuring Big Oil, praised BP’s move. “This is the ambition that the world needs,” Edward Mason, head of responsible investment, said in a tweet.(Updates with CEO comments in ninth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Julian Lee and Akshat Rathi.To contact the reporter on this story: Laura Hurst in London at lhurst3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Christopher SellFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-ceo-sets-plan-eliminate-111709901.html?.tsrc=rss

While investor groups welcomed the 2050 targets set out by Looney, which put BP ahead of rivals Royal Dutch Shell <RDSa.L>, Total <TOTF.PA>, Equinor <EQNR.OL> and all of the U.S. oil majors, environmental campaigners criticized a lack of detail.  ""We have got to change and change profoundly because the world is changing fast and so are society's expectations of us,"" Looney said in his first major speech as CEO, after earlier highlighting a need to ""reinvent BP""."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-boss-looney-reinvents-oil-112734635.html?.tsrc=rss

With Big Oil’s Future in Doubt, New BP Boss Sets His Vision	(Bloomberg) -- As BP Plc’s new chief delivers his vision to transform the company on Wednesday, investors and activists want to know just how much appetite he has to take on the existential crisis facing the oil industry.Bernard Looney’s big challenge will be to navigate BP through an energy transition with the world falling out of love with oil, and louder demands from investors to pivot toward clean energy. When climate protesters forced the company to shut its London headquarters last week, the 49-year-old Irishman promised them he would address their concerns.BP is already taking some modest steps to address climate change, including investment in renewables and selling some of its most carbon-intensive assets. But it remains an oil major through and through, still very much the company that tapped the first fields in Iran early in the last century and drilled wildcat wells on the Alaskan frontier more than 60 years ago.Undertaking a truly radical move -- such as Repsol SA’s pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 -- would be a historic, and controversial shift for the oil industry. It might satisfy the company’s activist investors, but could displease the many shareholders that still demand hefty dividends.“The challenge will be how to solve decarbonizing its portfolio while at the same time sustaining growth if this means divesting high-carbon assets that also generate material cash flow,” said Christyan Malek, head of European oil research at JPMorgan Chase & Co.BP has been here before. In the early 2000s, the company rebranded itself as “Beyond Petroleum,” but big investments in solar power largely failed. In one of his last interviews before leaving office, Looney’s predecessor Bob Dudley warned against Big Oil moving too fast on new technologies to counter climate change, because their failure could lead to financial ruin.Open-Neck ShirtsLooney is embracing a different style to Dudley. He’s often seen in jeans and open-necked shirts with his sleeves rolled up. He recently joined Instagram, where he talks about climate change.“All of the anxiety and frustration of the world at the pace of change is a big deal. I want you to know we are listening,” Looney said in a Instagram post this week. He will on Wednesday set out “the role we aspire to play in the world,” BP said on its Twitter account.Read More: BP’s New CEO Needs to Steer Company Through World Wary of OilThat’s allowed expectations to build, and investors and analysts see Looney announcing a sharp turn toward cleaner operations and fuels when he starts speaking at 2:30 p.m. in London.Activist shareholders will be scrutinizing his every word. Top of their agenda will be how Looney plans to deal with so-called Scope 3 emissions, which tackles greenhouse gases from the fuels BP sells. Dudley opposed the idea of setting a target for customers’ pollution. But with Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and Repsol taking responsibility for Scope 3, BP is under pressure to follow suit.“BP has been on the wrong side of this issue and we would encourage bold leadership from the new CEO to embrace not only Scope 3 emission targets but a net-zero goal,” said Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board.Big ShiftTargeting Scope 3 emissions would be a big shift for an industry that produces the bulk of the world’s planet-warming emissions. BP and other companies will one day face a hard reckoning -- either shift all their energy production to renewables, invent commercially viable technology to store the carbon they emit, or stick with fossil fuels and accept that one day the company will fade away.Increasing pressure from investors and society may not leave them with much choice. Climate change was among the most debated subjects in this year’s Davos, and last month, BlackRock Inc. added its significant weight to a $41 trillion investor-group that’s pressing the biggest emitters to change their ways. BP’s shares, which have fallen about 13% over the past year, added 0.6% on Wednesday.Click here to read a QuickTake defining the issues around carbon scopesSeveral oil companies have already set targets for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gases, which come directly from pumping and refining hydrocarbons. Yet these account for less than 10% of total emissions from the life cycle of oil and gas.Boldest MoveRepsol has made the boldest move yet, promising net-zero emissions in 2050 by diverting investment into wind and solar power. Shell plans to halve its “net carbon footprint” by that year, and will tie the target to executive pay. Norway’s Equinor ASA set a goal for customer emissions for the first time last week.Tackling emissions is a balancing act, Equinor’s Chief Financial Officer Lars Christian Bacher said in an interview on Tuesday. “You can never be responsible as a producer for the way people drive their cars,” he said. “But we have a role to play to decarbonize the world.”Looney is taking over the storied oil company at a critical time for BP, and the oil industry. Dudley’s greatest challenge in his 10-year tenure was the survival of the company itself following the Gulf of Mexico accident that caused the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. Looney’s would be to ensure the company thrives in a rapidly changing world.“Being part of the energy transition is going to be the great adventure” for Looney, Dudley said in a Bloomberg television interview last month.(Updates with time of presentation in ninth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Laura Hurst in London at lhurst3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Rakteem KatakeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-future-doubt-bp-000100173.html?.tsrc=rss

Sign up here.BP Plc surprised investors with a slight increase in its dividend, bucking the trend in what has otherwise been a bleak earnings season for Big Oil.In the final set of results for retiring Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley, the London-based company offered some respite for investors who received nothing but bad news from BP’s peers. Big payouts, whether as dividends or buybacks, are the only thing attracting many investors to the industry in a world increasingly aware of the impact of fossil fuels on climate change and falling energy prices.Last week Royal Dutch Shell Plc slowed the pace of its share buybacks due to weak macroeconomic conditions, while Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. failed to impress.“We remain confident in delivering the 2021 free cash flow targets and divestment proceeds, and expect to continue to reduce net debt and gearing,” Dudley said on an analyst call on Tuesday. This underpins the company’s “ongoing commitment to sustainably growing distributions to shareholders over the long term,” he added.BP shares rose 4.4% to 472.75 pence as of 11:38 a.m. in London, the biggest increase since September.“BP’s results have come in slightly better than expected, but they are still a reflection of the challenging environment for oil and gas companies,” said Stuart Lamont, an investment manager at Brewin Dolphin Ltd.Fourth-quarter adjusted net income was $2.57 billion, exceeding even the highest analyst estimate. That compares with profit of $3.48 billion a year earlier. The company’s dividend for the period will rise 2.4% to 10.5 cents a share.Sustainable DividendBig Oil offers generous returns, but analysts are beginning to question the affordability of these payouts due to high levels of debt, volatile markets and investor pressures to invest in clean energy. BP’s gearing -- a measure of debt to equity -- remained above its target of 30% at the end of 2019.BP is reducing its debt burden in part by selling unwanted assets. It has announced $9.4 billion of deals since the start of 2019, putting it well on course to complete the targeted $10 billion of sales in the two years to 2020, Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said. It announced a further $5 billion by mid-2021.In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Gilvary promised a “major de-leveraging of the balance sheet” this year. BP has so far only received about a quarter of the proceeds from its 2019 divestments, so receipt of the remaining funds will accelerate the repayment of debt this year, he said. “We are very confident that today’s dividend is sustainable.”BP completed its share repurchasing program, buying $1.5 billion of stocks in the fourth quarter. The program has offset the dilution from paying dividends in shares, know as a scrip, since the third quarter of 2017 and is on a much smaller scale than Shell’s buybacks.Trading BumpBP also enjoyed its best year trading oil and natural gas since 2009, helping it weather the impact of lower energy prices and weak refining and chemical margins. Like its peers, the company doesn’t disclose the how much money it makes from its trading business, but insiders put the profitability in a good year in the order of a couple of billion dollars.Oil and gas production increased in the quarter as maintenance season came to an end, with output 2.7% higher than a year earlier at 3.781 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, including the contribution of barrels from strategic partner Rosneft PJSC.Bernard Looney takes over as the company’s CEO on Wednesday. Dudley is credited with saving BP from the brink of collapse following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and caused the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history. His departure is part of a wider changing of the guard, with Gilvary handing over the role to Murray Auchincloss before he retires on June 30.Looney’s task will be to convince investors and the wider public that BP is doing enough to tackle climate change. Last week, the Church of England Pension Board launched a passive index, which includes oil and gas companies, aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Shell and Madrid-based Repsol made the index. BP and its American peers did not. Looney is set to outline his ambitions for the company on Feb. 12.(Updates throughout.)&#92;--With assistance from Christopher Sell and Javier Blas.To contact the reporter on this story: Laura Hurst in London at lhurst3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Christopher Sell, Helen RobertsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-bucks-oil-industry-gloom-071601928.html?.tsrc=rss

In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.BP Plc said the coronavirus outbreak threatens to wipe out a third of global oil-demand growth this year, a troubling prediction for prices already languishing at their lowest in a year.“We see demand down on average for the year by 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day,” BP Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said Tuesday in an interview in London. That takes a large chunk out of the 1.2 million-barrel-a-day growth expected before the deadly virus hit, sapping fuel consumption.Brent crude slid below $55 a barrel on Monday to its lowest close since December 2018. The rout is piling pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners, with leading producer Saudi Arabia pushing other members to take emergency action.

BP boosts dividend despite slide in profits	BP raised its dividend as confidence about its ability to generate more cash grew following the completion of a share buyback programme, new asset disposal targets and falling debt levels.  The higher payout was announced despite the UK energy major reporting a 26 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings as increased production failed to offset lower oil and gas prices.  BP said that prices would remain volatile this year with the deadly Coronavirus outbreak expected to cut global oil demand by 300,000-500,000 barrels a day on average this year — as much as 40 per cent of the 1.2m b/d growth predicted by energy agencies.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/32945cb8-9a26-3da6-86c2-3962e2808a96/bp-boosts-dividend-despite.html?.tsrc=rss

The plans were published on Tuesday by the Sustainable Aviation coalition of companies in the British sector, including engine-maker Rolls Royce, airline easyJet, BP's aviation fuel arm AirBP and planemaker Airbus. Meeting the emissions target is likely to require several major changes in the industry, such as more efficient aircraft and a significant increase in the use of sustainable aviation biofuels, which are currently not widespread.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/british-aviation-industry-outlines-plans-000100094.html?.tsrc=rss

The U.S. stock market has benefited in large part from the emergence of the FAANG stocks and other fast-growing tech and internet companies. These, along with a robust economic recovery, have powered the S&P 500 to a 264% total return over the past decade. International holdings, including foreign dividend stocks, haven't fared so well. The world stock market, excluding U.S. stocks, is up a more modest 70% over the same span, as measured by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (NYSEARCA:VEU).However, that underperformance leads to an opportunity. Markets usually revert to the mean; after a hot period, expect stocks to cool off. After a decade of American outperformance, international shares could be set to shine.Additionally, foreign stocks add favorable qualities to your overall portfolio. We spoke with Steven Dennis, who is the Firestone Chair of Corporate Finance at Kent State University. He told us that:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;Many investors exhibit what is referred to as 'Home Bias,' which is the tendency to invest in companies near where the investor lives (i.e., U.S. investors' preferences for U.S. stocks).  There are advantages to investing in foreign stocks in the form of diversification.  Other countries' economies do not perfectly correlate to the U.S. economy, so adding a dividend-paying stock in a foreign country to the portfolio can provide yield and perhaps also reduce risk. While it is true that correlations between stock markets around the world tend to increase in troubled times, which reduces diversification benefits, foreign investing can provide risk-reducing benefits over long periods of time.&quot;  * 7 Stocks to Buy for February Contrarians With the historic discount in international companies as opposed to American ones, this is a great time to start gaining the advantages of investing in some foreign dividend stocks. Here are seven underappreciated names that have strong dividend track records. Foreign Dividend Stocks to Buy: Honda Motor Company (HMC)Dividend Yield: 3.9%Despite being one of the world's most well-known vehicle brands, Honda Motor (NYSE:HMC) is not a particularly hot stock with American investors. Generally, if investors go looking for dividends out of the auto sector, they buy Ford (NYSE:F). And Ford certainly offers a high dividend yield, but one that comes at a lot of risk given the stalled out auto market and debt-filled balance sheet.Honda stock, after its recent 10% pullback, is now offering a 3.9% dividend yield. In addition to the auto business, it's also a leader in motorcycles, particularly in emerging markets. Although the coronavirus may slow things down a bit, Honda should enjoy a pick-up in key markets such as Southeast Asia once the trade deal is in place and global growth picks up again. Grupo Aval (AVAL)Dividend Yield: 4.2%Grupo Aval (NYSE:AVAL) is certainly an underappreciated international dividend stock -- it has very little following in the U.S., despite being a $10 billion market capitalization Colombian bank holding company. That lack of exposure is likely due to the company's history. It elected to launch its U.S. initial public offering in mid-2014, just as the oil market started to crater.Given that crude oil makes up half of Colombia's exports in a good year, this was disastrous timing for Colombia's largest financial firm. AVAL stock immediately tanked from $14 to $6 per share. However, it has spent the last few years starting to recover. Shares recently tagged $9, making for a 50% rebound off the lows. Colombia has adjusted to lower oil prices with fiscal reforms, and economic growth has picked back up.Meanwhile, Aval has remained faithful to its shareholders. It has paid a continuous monthly dividend dating back to 2001 (for its shares listed on the domestic Bogota stock exchange) and a fairly generous one at that. Shares currently pay three cents a month (36 cents a year) making for a 4.2% annual dividend yield.  * 10 of the Top Franchise Stocks to Buy Now And at 9x forward earnings, the stock is rather cheap as well, while offering substantial upside in the event that oil prices pick back up and lead to a robust move in emerging markets generally and in Colombia in particular. There are relatively few monthly-paying dividend stocks outside of specialized sectors such as real estate investment trusts (REITs), so if you want to diversify your monthly-paying dividend holdings, give Aval a look. BP (BP)Dividend Yield: 6.6%Speaking of oil, the major international energy firms are a good way to diversify your portfolio while buying reasonably priced stocks. Instead of picking Exxon (NYSE:XOM) or Chevron (NYSE:CVX), for example, you can grab BP (NYSE:BP) and diversify the geographies and markets within your portfolio. Let's say U.S. stocks start to underperform after a decade of crushing all competition; meanwhile, British stocks recover as Brexit fears finally fade. In that sort of scenario, BP should add some alpha to your portfolio.And if nothing else, it will certainly add some meaty dividends. BP stock is paying out a 6.6% dividend yield. That $2.46 per year payout is well-covered by earnings, as analysts project BP to earn 3.24 per share next year. BP is among the higher-yielding stocks out there where the dividend is easily secured from its current business operations. And if oil prices finally find some upside going forward, shares could explode higher. Diageo (DEO)Dividend Yield: 2.5%On the subject of the United Kingdom, they have more good dividend stocks as well. Take Diageo (NYSE:DEO) for example. The company is a global leader in spirits. It produces Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Baileys and Ketel One among many others. It also has some other reputable alcoholic beverages, including Guinness beer.The company has been subject to on-and-off concern about the potential impact of Brexit on its supply chain since 2016. It has also faced a sharp slow-down in sales in some of its key emerging markets in recent years. However, management has overcome both of these concerns, and both earnings and the share price have soared in recent years.So is Diageo still worth buying today? For long-term investors, absolutely. The company has raised its dividend every year (as measured in its home currency of British Pounds) every year dating back to the turn of the century. Shares yield 2.5%, which isn't huge, but does beat the overall market and grows quickly thanks to the annual dividend hikes. The rebound in the British Pound, if it continues, should lead to higher dividend payouts for American Depository Receipt &quot;ADR&quot; holders as well.  * 7 Industries Using AI to Benefit Shareholders Around the World And this is exactly the sort of business you want to buy near the end of an economic cycle. Liquor sales hold up well regardless of the economy's status, and Diageo is a conservatively managed cash flow machine. It will keep generating more profits, cash flow and higher dividend payouts in coming years, even if the overall stock market and economy hit a rough patch. Finally, of note for dividend-focused shareholders, the U.K., has an agreement with the U.S. that makes it so there is no withholding tax on British dividends whatsoever for American citizens. Coca-Cola Femsa (KOF)Dividend Yield: 3.1%Sticking with consumer staples, it's fair to call Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) one of the world's most well-known and respected dividend investments. It's as blue a blue chip as they come, and it has the all-important Warren Buffett endorsement.However, Coca-Cola stock is now trading at all-time highs and is quite unattractive on a valuation basis given the disconnect between its rising share price and the lack of any underlying business momentum or growth. Luckily, Coca-Cola has various listed partners around the world, and some of them are much more promising at the moment. For example, we have Coca-Cola Femsa (NYSE:KOF), which is Mexico's largest Coca-Cola bottler/distributor. It also has major operations in various South American countries.Coca-Cola Femsa comes at the business from a position of strength, as it is half-owned by Femsa (NYSE:FMX), which is one of Mexico's largest business conglomerates. Femsa operates more than 15,000 convenience stores in Mexico and South America, giving it a most favorable position for distributing Coke products.KOF stock has gotten walloped in recent years thanks to lackluster economic activity in Latin America and a grueling bear market for Mexican stocks. And, in particular, Coca-Cola Femsa is the bottler for Venezuela, and has seen that 30 million person market go from a major profit center to essentially zero in recent years. But it could return to prosperity with any change in the Venezuelan government. More broadly, KOF stock is down from a peak of $150 to $60 now, despite stable business performance. As a result, shares yield 3.1%, while trading at just 17x through earnings. Get any sort of upswing in sentiment for Mexico or Venezuela and shares could rocket up from here -- in the meantime, it pays a solid yield off a low-risk beverages business. Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico (PAC)Dividend Yield: 4.7%Since we're talking about Mexico, long-time readers might be able to guess my next pick. I've championed the Mexican airport operators as surprisingly strong growth and income investments. And nothing has changed on that front. Over the past five years, the Mexican stock market has been no fiesta; the benchmark iShares Mexico ETF (NYSEARCA:EWW) is actually down almost 15% despite a raging bull market north of the border.The Mexican airport operators have shrugged off the general malaise, however. All three public Mexican airport stocks are up big recently, and two of them are trading at all-time highs. And the fun is just getting started.Why buy airports? They are incredibly high margin businesses; you get a cut of the airfare on every passenger that travels through, plus you get royalties off retail, restaurants, car parking, hotels and other services at your airports. Traditionally, air travel has grown far faster than global economic growth. And in Mexico in particular, discount airlines are booming as they supplant long-distance bus trips.And why buy Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico (NYSE:PAC) in particular? The company is a diversified growth and income powerhouse. It operates the Guadalajara airport, which serves Mexico's second-largest city. It also runs Puerto Vallarta and Cabos, which are two of Mexico's leading tourist destinations. That mix of airports ensures plenty of both business and tourist traffic.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for Your Income-Generating Portfolio Over the years, Pacifico has grown revenues, earnings and EBITDA at a double-digit rate compounded. And it pays out nearly 100% of its operating cash flow in dividends, which ensures a strong income stream. It often yields more than 5%, and is at 3.7% even now with the stock at all-time highs. With the business growing double-digits every year, the dividend gets similar increases. Do note that Pacifico pays a semi-annual regular dividend and then one additional special dividend of variable size every year depending on its profitability. Many financial websites ignore the special dividend and thus understate Pacifico's true dividend yield. Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior (BLX)Dividend Yield: 7.2%Hop on a southbound flight out of Mexico, and you may well end up in Panama. That's where you'll find my last pick, Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior (NYSE:BLX). This bank, which in English is the Foreign Trade Bank of Latin America, has a cool business model. Its primary backers are the Central Banks of various Central and South American countries. They put together this bank with the aim of boosting commercial activity throughout the region.The bank, thus, downplays the traditional consumer deposits and lending business, and instead focuses on trade-driven business opportunities. It has a widely diversified loan portfolio across country and sector, as you'd expect with LatAm's Central Bankers effectively running the shop.BLX's owners, which include 23 different Central Banks, are happy to get their cash profits paid back to them every year. As a result, BLX pays nearly all its profits out as dividends; shares yield 7.2% at the moment. The bank has historically been well-run and has not suffered an unusual number of lending losses. With its powerful and connected backers, investors that join the club by buying BLX stock can enjoy an unusually high dividend yield. And with time, the share price should move higher as well once Latin American economies pick up more steam.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned AVAL, BP, XOM, DEO, PAC, KOF, FMX and BLX shares.

2020-01-27	2020-01-27 09:24:15	BP	BP p.l.c.	Oil Traders Made Billions in 2019 as Conflict Shook the Market	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s largest energy traders enjoyed one of their best ever years in 2019 as pipeline outages, dramatic changes in ship fuel regulations and Middle East conflicts shook up the global oil market.The bonanza extended beyond the independent traders like Vitol Group and Trafigura Group Ltd. to the in-house units of oil giants Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and BP Plc, which made billions of dollars in profits.“By all accounts, 2019 was among the best years ever for the energy trading industry,” said Marco Dunand, the chief executive of Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., one of the five largest independent oil traders.For the independents, the bumper year all but guarantees a fat bonus season for a group of companies that’s largely owned by their executives and senior staff. For the European oil companies, the trading boom will help Shell, BP and Total to weather a tough year in other parts of their business.In interviews with senior traders and top executives, the consensus is that the industry benefited from a lucky mix of factors in the oil market. Recent investments in trading natural gas, power and liquefied natural gas also started to bear fruit.First, a series of supply outages boosted the premiums that oil refiners pay over the benchmark price for some crudes. Early in 2019, Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuela, disrupting flows. Then, Russian shipments into Europe via the key Druzhba pipeline were halted after oil was tainted with a corrosive pollutant. And in September, Saudi exports were hindered after a terrorist attack against the country’s most important petroleum facility.Some traders also profited from the so-called IMO2020 rules that force the world’s merchant shipping fleet to use fuel with a lower sulfur content. The rules have upended the oil-refining and maritime industries, causing gyrations in the price of fuel-oil and marine diesel.The results provide some breathing room for a sector that’s under assault from falling margins. Brent crude, the world’s most important benchmark, traded in a relatively narrow range of $52.51 to $75.60 a barrel through the year.Vitol, Glencore, Shell, BP and Total all declined to comment on their results.The trend was already clear in the results of Trafigura, which reports earlier than others due to a fiscal year ending in September. Trafigura said its oil unit delivered a record gross profit of $1.7 billion last year.$1 Billion YearElsewhere executives also expect a stellar year, even as they caution that they haven’t yet audited their financial statements or decided on the final writedowns against 2019 results. The oil-trading unit of Glencore Plc., for example, enjoyed its best ever result, according to people familiar with the matter. One person said Glencore expects to report earnings before interest and taxes of more than $1 billion in oil trading.At Gunvor, chief executive Torbjorn Tornqvist said 2019 was “up there among the best years ever” for the trading house, in part thanks to its expansion into LNG, super-cooled natural gas that can be transported by vessel. “We have a good year across the board.”Vitol, the world’s largest independent oil trader, expects to report earnings near $2 billion, one of its best results, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mercuria also enjoyed a “very good year,” its chief executive said.Inside Big Oil, it was also a trading bonanza. Although better known for their oil fields, refineries and pump stations, Shell, BP and Total also run in-house trading businesses that are larger than the better-known independent dealers. Shell alone trades the equivalent of 13 million barrels a day of oil, dwarfing the nearly 7.5 million barrels a day at Vitol.For BP and Shell, 2019 was one of the best years ever in trading, making several billions dollars, according to two people familiar with the matter. Shell alone made at least $1 billion in fuel-oil trading linked to the IMO2020 changes.The results came despite mounting legal and regulatory pressures on some of the biggest trading houses. Glencore is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. Meanwhile, Vitol and Trafigura had their Geneva offices raided by Swiss prosecutors as part of a bribery investigation in Brazil. And Gunvor had to pay $95 million in Switzerland to settle a case that saw a former employee pay bribes to secure oil deals in the Republic of Congo and Ivory Coast.&#92;--With assistance from Andy Hoffman, Jack Farchy, Ronan Martin and Francois de Beaupuy.To contact the reporter on this story: Javier Blas in Davos at jblas3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Will Kennedy at wkennedy3@bloomberg.net, Emma Ross-Thomas, Helen RobertsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-traders-made-billions-2019-092415373.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-22	2020-01-22 18:49:04	BP	BP p.l.c.	Oil CEOs at Davos Debate Tougher CO2 Cuts as Pressure Mounts	(Bloomberg) -- Sign up here to receive the Davos Diary, a special daily newsletter that will run from Jan. 20-24.The bosses of some of the world’s biggest oil companies discussed adopting much more ambitious carbon targets at a closed-door meeting in Davos, a sign of how much pressure they’re under from activists and investors to address climate change.The meeting, part of a World Economic Forum dominated by climate issues, included a debate on widening the industry’s target to include reductions in emissions from the fuels they sell, not just the greenhouse gases produced by their own operations, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The talks between the chief executive officers of companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Chevron Corp., Total SA, Saudi Aramco, Equinor ASA and BP Plc showed general agreement on the need to move toward this broader definition, known as Scope 3, the people said, asking not to be named because the session was closed to the press. The executives didn’t take any final decisions.Shell and Aramco declined to comment. Media representatives for Chevron, Total and BP weren’t immediately able to respond to requests for comment. Equinor confirmed its CEO Eldar Saetre attended the meeting.Climate FocusTargeting Scope 3 emissions would be a big shift for an industry that produces the bulk of the world’s planet-warming emissions, once that could eventually require them to sell far less oil and gas. The simple fact that the industry’s top executives were considering it underscored how climate concerns suddenly came into focus in Davos this year.For the first time, environmental risks occupied the WEF’s top five long-term concerns. Business leaders from BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink to Allianz SE boss Oliver Baete used their platform at the event to focus on sustainable investment. The two highest-profile attendees at the forum -- President Donald Trump and climate activist Greta Thunberg -- made headlines as they staked out opposing positions on the issue.The oil and gas executives debated a document produced by the WEF on “neutralizing emissions at the pump,” a reference to the gasoline and diesel sold to customers. There’s an urgent need to shift the industry’s target from production to emissions from end users, said one person.Several companies have already set targets for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gases, which come directly from pumping and refining hydrocarbons. Yet these account for less than 10% of total emissions from the life cycle of oil and gas. Some of their pledges have also focused on curbing emissions intensity -- the amount of carbon dioxide released per unit of energy -- which wouldn’t necessarily lead to a reduction in the volume of greenhouse gases produced if a company’s output is growing.Among major energy groups, only Shell, Total and Madrid-based Repsol SA have publicly announced that they are either targeting or monitoring Scope 3 emissions.The Spanish company made the boldest move, promising net-zero emissions in 2050 by diverting investment into wind and solar power. Shell has taken more modest steps, pledging to offset the greenhouse gases produced by fuel sold to drivers on their loyalty-card programs in the U.K. and Netherlands.Eni SpA Chairman Emma Marcegaglia said in a Bloomberg TV interview that the company is committed to becoming carbon neutral on a Scope 1 and 2 basis by 2030. The Italian oil and gas giant is in discussions about Scope 3 emissions, but needs more guidance from the government on how to do so, she said.Other companies, notably U.S. majors Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron have so far resisted specific pledges to cut total emissions, with the latter focusing instead on the carbon intensity of the energy it produces. BP CEO Bob Dudley, who retires later this year, has agreed aims for Scope 1 and 2 gases but in the past opposed a Scope 3 target.“We need to reduce our carbon intensity, everyone in the industry agrees on that,” Dudley said in an interview in Davos. However, he cautioned that shareholders and companies were using multiple definitions of Scope 3 emissions. “We need to get a common definition” so the industry “can work together in a powerful way.”(Updates with Aramco comment in fourth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Laura Hurst, Francois de Beaupuy, Matthew Martin, Francine Lacqua and Mikael Holter.To contact the reporter on this story: Javier Blas in Davos at jblas3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Rakteem KatakeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-chiefs-davos-debate-tougher-112515264.html?.tsrc=rss

Sign up here.BP Plc handed more power to a new generation of executives, announcing that Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary will join his boss Bob Dudley in retiring this year.Murray Auchincloss, currently the finance chief of BP’s oil and gas production division, will succeed Gilvary. The energy giant already announced last year that Bernard Looney, who runs that unit, will become chief executive officer at the end of March.In a world that’s increasingly wary of fossil fuels, BP’s new top executives will have to prove the company can keep up with the times. The London-based company has a highly profitable oil and gas business that pioneered exports from the Middle East, opened up giant fields in Alaska and the U.K. North Sea, and has paid billions of dollars to shareholders.Looney and Auchincloss will be expected to keep that business performing well, while also addressing increasing investor pressure to curb greenhouse gas emissions and lay the groundwork for the long transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy.With Auchincloss’s “international financial and commercial experience and a deep understanding of the whole group, he will play an important role as BP continues to develop in a fast-changing energy market,” Chairman Helge Lund said.Gilvary, 57, will step down at the end of June following a 34-year career with BP, Europe’s third-biggest oil company said Tuesday. Auchincloss, will become group CFO and join the board on July 1.Auchincloss has served as CFO for BP’s Upstream unit since 2015. He was head of the group CEO’s office from 2010 to 2013, working directly with Dudley. From 2005 to 2007 he was CFO for BP’s North Sea business.“It seems a natural transition,” RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria said. “It bucks the recent trend of new management coming from the downstream businesses, however neither appointments are a surprise,” he said, referring to BP’s new CEO and CFO.Gilvary became finance chief and joined the board in January 2012. Since then, he has managed issues including the resolution of litigation after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill that nearly bankrupted the company. He was also in the thick of reshaping BP following crude’s price crash that began in 2014.Gilvary and Auchincloss will work together between now and the end of June to ensure an “orderly transition,” BP said in the statement.(Updates with analyst’s comments in the eighth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Amanda Jordan in London at ajordan11@bloomberg.net;Laura Hurst in London at lhurst3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Rakteem KatakeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-names-cfo-gilvary-plans-072009937.html?.tsrc=rss

Launchpad, an entity that sits alongside BP’s venture capital unit, is focusing on building large-scale businesses that can run parallel to existing hydrocarbon divisions and specialise in digital and low-carbon technologies and the circular economy.  BP Ventures invests small sums and takes minority stakes in new energy businesses, for preferential access to disruptive technologies, maintaining an arm’s length relationship with these companies.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6f6a04e1-0b9e-32cc-a8f9-ad93b680b532/bp-sets-target-to-create-five.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-31	2019-12-31 16:30:10	BP	BP p.l.c.	7 Excellent Value Stocks to Buy for 2020	After an exceptionally strong performance in the stock market in 2019, 2020 will have a higher than average chance of a correction. This argument can only hold true if either fundamentals worsen and volatility rises or if markets decide to lock in profits early. The S&P 500 rose by almost 30%, so even a slow 5%-10% pullback will still net a 20%-35% return in a one-year period.To stay investors but minimize the damage from the potential near-term downside, consider accumulating value stocks in 2020. Since it is impossible to time or predict any market correction, investors will need to have the discipline to shift from growth to value. Demand value and have a bias for stocks that pay a dividend. Phillip Braun, the Clinical Professor of Finance and Associate Chair of the Finance Department at Kellogg School of Management, said:Money will flow out of low volatility funds because of their declining performance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs market uncertainty continues to prevail, dividend funds will continue to be popular, momentum funds will see a net outflow and quality fund inflows will continue to rise.There will be a shift of money from growth funds into value funds as the performance of growth funds decline relative to value funds.  * 7 'A'-Rated Stocks to Buy Under $10 Besides adding to dividend fund holdings, what are seven value stocks that investors will want to buy in 2020? Value Stocks to Buy: BP (BP)Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com The energy sector vastly underperformed the markets in 2019 and is due for a strong rebound in 2020. Oil prices rose to around $60 a barrel recently despite Wall Street analysts predicting prices falling next year. But that logic does not make sense. If the OPEC exercises restraint in limiting supply, then oil stocks will perform well in the year ahead.In its third quarter, BP (NYSE:BP) reported a massive $2.6 billion asset write-down. The company uses underlying replacement cost profit to measure net income. In October, it reported that the metric fell 41% year-over-year to $2.3 billion.BP's lower interest realizations in the U.S., down around $6 quarter-over-quarter, is due mostly to the barrels coming from the Gulf of Mexico. But if energy prices improve in the year ahead, BP's profit margins will rise. Plus, the company completed maintenance costs and has no hurricane-related expenses in the next few quarters.The income investor will also have the confidence that BP will sustain its dividends through persistently strong future cash flows. On top of that, it will deploy its cash to buy back shares and lower its debt to continue de-levering its balance sheet. Asset disposals will also lift cash flows in the next year while BP's balance sheet improves.Investors should use the Dividend Discount Model: Stable Growth to estimate a fair value on BP stock. At a perpetuity growth rate of 3.5%, the stock is worth $41.60. Schlumberger (SLB)Source: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.com With a dividend that yields 5%, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), which rose 30% from its yearly lows, is a potentially rewarding value play in 2020. Investors have many reasons to hold this oil and gas equipment and services company despite its warnings on the drilling and fracking market. Schlumberger took a massive $12.7 billion write-down in the third quarter related to goodwill intangibles and fixed assets.On its conference call, the company said:Most of the goodwill and intangible comes from two major acquisitions. In 2010, we did the Smith acquisition, which was almost 100% paid by stock. We issued 138 million shares at that time, and then, Cameron in 2016, where we paid almost 78% in stock. The book value of those two acquisitions was booked for Smith at $56 per share, for Cameron at $72 per share.Schlumberger is forecasting a conservative year ahead despite the prospects of better energy prices. But since the company experienced modest product equipment sales in the last two or three years, 2020 budgets may be the same. So, Schlumberger is cautious for the upcoming year. A recession or any geopolitical or economic events will hurt its business. International growth will hold steady, helped by strong offshore activity in both shallow and deep-water environments.The company said that it is too early to forecast a rebound in the North American market. It will have a better idea on the second quarter's performance if it sees stronger activity starting in January. At that time, Schlumberger's customers will set their expectations for 2020. And when they do, it will be better positioned to set investor expectations, too.Similar to BP, Schlumberger has three asset divestitures underway. It closed the Sensia joint venture in October. Its divesting of assets from the Eurasian Drilling Company will come next.  CVS Health (CVS)Source: QualityHD / Shutterstock.com Moving on to the healthcare space, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is becoming a growth play after its Aetna acquisition. One year after acquiring Aetna, CVS said the combined company &quot;met or exceeded its first-year integration goals.&quot; With cost-cutting and operational integration largely completed, the $69 billion acquisition will start contributing to growth.CVS reported Q3 revenue growing 36.5%. It forecast 2019 revenue in the range between $11.8 billion and $11.95 billion. Adjusted operating income will come in as high as $15.4 billion. As CVS transforms its business into the country's leading consumer health company, its stock should continue its uptrend in 2020.On the back-end, CVS is using data and analytics to drive prescription volumes higher. On the retail front, consumers will bring more business as CVS offers local personalized care. For example, MinuteClinics and HealthHubs increase healthcare accessibility and affordability. This may result in the company raising its full-year 2020 revenue expectations.For 2020, CVS expects gross new business growing $1.1 billion. The net new business will add another $1 billion to results. And in 2021, CVS has its product line-up ready and an engaging sales staff who will serve its clients.  * 6 Transportation Stocks That Are Going Places Based on 13 analysts who cover CVS stock, the average price target is $85.31. UnitedHealth (UNH)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Though the stock traded close to its 52-week high recently, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 18 times. The company forecast 2019 revenue of around $242 billion. Earnings per share will be $14.15-$14.25. In 2020, revenue will expand to between $260 billion and $262 billion while EPS will increase to $15.45-$15.75.In 2020, the key drivers to UNH's 13%-16% growth rate exclude the positive impact of deploying strategic assets. It also excludes the use of additional strategic capital. So, if UNH introduces assets in the marketplace in 2020 to drive down costs for patients while improving quality, management may raise its guidance for the next year.UNH will continue to benefit from the performance of OptumCare. The strong momentum in the unit will sustain itself in 2020. OptumHealth is set to become the nation's value-based patient-centric medical system. So, as it manages costs on medicare and empowers OptumRx and OptumCare with digital solutions, profitability will grow.Investors should notice that OptumHealth margins fell 110 basis points from last year. This is due mostly to the DaVita Medical Group acquisition. As its integration of the unit progresses, expect the financial performance of the unit increasing.The average price target on CVS Health stock is $311.95. General Electric (GE)Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Though General Electric (NYSE:GE) is trading close to its 52-week high, the beaten-down conglomerate is a potential rebound play for value investors.Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 Max production halt is a negative headwind for GE's LEAP engines. But Boeing will eventually get the Federal Aviation Administration's certification for the plane. And when it does, GE will get back the $1.4 billion it lost from the grounding. Investors only need to wait patiently for that inevitability. Even if the delays persist longer than thought, GE will still have plenty of customers buying its engines.In 2020, GE will continue to improve its balance sheet by cutting its debt levels. GE Healthcare's PET Tracers enjoys a 4 million installed base. In fact, its backlog of $18 billion suggests steady cash flow growth in the future is sustainable. Last quarter, GE's industrial cash flow improved to a positive $650 million. It benefited from the continued stabilization from its Power unit. As cash flow growth continues, GE is in a good position to pay down its debt.GE ended the third quarter with net debt below $30 billion. So, it still has plenty of debt it must work down. Its Renewable Energy unit was one of GE's bright spots in the last quarter. Orders rose 30% to $5 billion, lifted by international orders rising 94% year-over-year. GE also said that favorable new order pricing helped increase the backlog to $27 billion, up 19% from last year.If GE sustains a perpetuity growth rate of just 2.5% in the next five years, then the stock is worth around $14. Comcast (CMCSA)Source: Todd A. Merport / Shutterstock.com Though shares of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) rose by around 30% in the year, the stock has a low P/E of 16.6. Investors may want to wait for a few positive catalysts ahead.After peaking in September at $47.27 and falling since then, Comcast already prices in the disappointing box office numbers. Its video streaming strategy, through the Peacock streaming service, is a potential growth story in 2020. Comcast will hold an Investor Day on Jan. 16. As it gives more details on what the product will actually be, investors will decide how the service fares compared to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Disney+.The upcoming streaming service will cost Comcast $2 billion in investments. Management expects costs peaking at 1% of Comcast's revenue, but that the service will achieve break-even by the fifth year.Comcast's Universal Parks and Resorts unit has a consistent track record for performing. And in 2020, Nintendo World will help boost performance. The company has two new parks under development, including one in Beijing, China. Although it opens in 2021, markets could start pricing in its upside in 2020.  * 7 Stocks to Buy to Get 2020 Started the Right Way Epic Universe is also under construction and will open in Orlando, Florida in 2023. Again, Comcast will book the investment costs in 2020 but markets will price in the success of these parks ahead of their openings. 3M (MMM)Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com 3M (NYSE:MMM) shares lost money for investors this year but in 2020, that might change for the better. On Dec. 12, the company announced it would sell all of its drug delivery business to Altaris Capital for $650 million. 3M's CEO said:This transaction will allow us to focus more resources on our core health care business as well as retain a share in the value of the drug delivery business as it grows over the coming years.3M needs to simplify its business and strengthen the performance of its core businesses. And although it had the opportunity to grow its profits through the drug delivery market, it now must find growth in other ways. That includes the global electronics market. So, if the factory automation markets rebound in China, 3M will benefit. Semiconductor manufacturers like Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) posted strong quarterly results. Both are positive on the outlook for 2020. If the consumer electronics market rebounds, 3M's product refresh in electronics will lead to the rebound in revenue.The automotive market is undergoing a major acceleration in innovation growth. As more materials and electronics are added to automobiles, demand for its goods used in this sector will grow.3M cited its $6.7 billion acquisition of Acelity as a positive catalyst to growth. With 3M's innovation model in mind, the combined company should report higher margins and return on invested capital. This may begin in 2020 but will certainly continue in the years ahead.As of this writing, Chris Lau owned shares of BP.

It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]Income investors are looking for sources of yield again, as interest rates are low once more and the safe sources of fixed-income yield are drying up.Against that backdrop, conservative dividend stocks look like better and better alternatives to bonds for income investors. We saw a similar trend play out in 2015-16, with rate sensitive stocks soaring. Then, those gave way as the economy picked up steam and investors rushed back into big growth names like the FAANG stocks -- Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks for 2020 Here are seven conservative dividend stocks to buy for income investors. Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5%If you're a short-term trader, energy stocks have been a terrible place to be this year. But for dividend investors, the longer this slump drags on, the better.Take Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) for example. XOM stock has gone essentially nowhere since 2005. The combination of plunging natural gas prices and the renewed weakness in crude oil scared everyone out of the sector. But with that mass departure comes opportunity.XOM stock is now yielding 5%. That's its highest level since the early 1990s. It's hard to overstate how pessimistic folks have gotten on oil and gas. But for the big dogs with great balance sheets, like Exxon, this is their time to shine. They can buy up assets from struggling and bankrupt rivals for cents on the dollar, and wait for the cycle to turn.Exxon's management is now planning for aggressive growth at the same time, so many other firms are having to pull back. In fact, Exxon is looking to double cash flow and earnings over the next five years. If it can do so, Exxon stock stock will soar. And you get a 5% dividend yield while you wait. BP (BP)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 6.45%Exxon isn't the only energy stock worth considering thanks to the latest sell-off in energy shares. Dividend investors should also take a look at BP (NYSE:BP) stock at these prices. BP got itself into hot water ages ago with the Deepwater Horizon tragedy, and the stock has underperformed ever since then.But the company's liabilities associated with that are almost gone now. Meanwhile, the company has greatly cut costs, making itself profitable even in current low-energy-pricing conditions.Skeptics had suggested that BP stock would have to cut its dividend to get through this difficult period for oil and gas companies. Instead, BP was able to maintain its juicy yield.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2020 It's worth remembering that the United Kingdom and U.S. have a tax arrangement that ensures investors pay no foreign dividend taxes on their British shareholdings. This makes BP a nice option for dividend investors seeking to diversify their income streams beyond American sources. Kraft Heinz (KHC)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5%It has been a great year for consumer staples stocks. In general, the sector has moved sharply higher, and many stalwarts like Hershey (NYSE:HSY) are up 40% or more and hitting new all-time highs. However, not all staples stocks have blasted off.For example, there is Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC). Kraft Heinz suffered an unbelievable decline from a peak of $90 to $27 in just a few years. Despite involvement from investing legends including Warren Buffett and 3G Capital, Kraft Heinz imploded thanks to failing growth prospects and excessive leverage.But don't count out the condiments and packaged foods maker just yet. The company has sold off non-core assets and adjusted its capital allocation to shore up the balance sheet. Management is changing its branding strategy as well. And at these depressed prices, KHC stock is undervalued even compared to other struggling sector laggards, to say nothing of industry leaders like Hershey and McCormick (NYSE:MKC).Even assuming Kraft Heinz only gets back to comparable enterprise value/EBITDA and price-to-earnings ratios with other lower-tier packaged foods stocks, it should still trade back up to $40 from the current $32 valuation.And at this price, KHC stock yields 5%. In a world that is increasingly starved for meaningful yield, Kraft Heinz will become irresistible to income investors. Hormel Foods (HRL)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.05%Another solid choice in the staples industry at this point is Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) stock.Forget about vegan meat for a second, there's way more dividend potential in the real stuff. Hormel is known for its legacy SPAM brand, but it makes a great assortment of lunchmeats, bacon and canned meals as well.It has acquired natural and organic meat brands to appeal to millennial consumers in recent years. It has also diversified in organic nut-butters, guacamole, Mexican salsas and other more youth-orientated products.Hormel stock enjoyed a tremendous run the last time interest rates plummeted a few years ago; HRL stock shot up 50% in six months. Since then, Hormel has traded sideways, however, as investors moved back out of dividend stocks. But its earnings are up 25% over the same period.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2020 With investors piling back into yield plays, however, Hormel Foods should soar to new all-time highs. The African swine fever has been a bump in the road. Higher pork prices have hurt margins. But as pricing reverts to normal in 2020, Hormel's earnings per share should soar above $2, supporting a $50 share price based on its historical median earnings ratio.Hormel is the lowest-yielding stock on this list, at 2%. But it is a dividend king with more than 50 years of consecutive dividend hikes.It has consistently grown its dividend (and its earnings) at more than 10% per year for decades now. This means that investors get a starting yield significantly higher than in bonds, with rapid increases to their income stream over time. With dividend aristocrats back in style, HRL stock is heading to new all-time highs. Molson Coors Brewing (TAP)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.2%Turning from food to beer, we have Molson Coors Brewing (NYSE:TAP) stock. The big macro-brewers have seen their stocks implode in recent years based on craft beer fears. And those were valid fears. But note the past tense.In 2018, U.S. craft beer grew just 3% overall, with many of the leading craft brewers showing an outright decline in production. Arguably, craft beer over-expanded, and has now lost its cutting-edge trendiness.Meanwhile, there's still plenty of people that like macro beers, along with cheaper brews in general. The major beer companies still control nearly 80% of the American market after all. And Molson Coors plays to both lanes; it owns leading craft brands such as Blue Moon to complement its mainstream holdings.Why buy TAP stock now though? For one thing, it's at multi-year lows and its decision to rebrand and revamp should add shareholder value. Wells Fargo (WFC)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield 3.8%Investors don't like bank stocks much right now. In fact, other than energy, there's little that is more disliked at the moment. And with that comes opportunity.Interest rates have plummeted so rapidly since last year, and the bond market is now pricing in the equivalent of six Fed rate cuts to the long end of the curve.As the rate curve heads back to more normal levels, banks will benefit. Right now, people are pricing in a massive drop in profits for the industry going forward, but this could reverse on a dime.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2020 Who wins? Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) stock is one obvious winner. Investors have shunned the bank since the account scandals a few years ago. But the bank has thrown out old management and moved on. Meanwhile, the stock price has gone nowhere for many years as capital piles up. This is allowing it to go on an aggressive shareholder return plan now.Wells Fargo is now paying a nearly a 4% dividend yield. On top of that, the company has authorization to repurchase more than 10% of its total outstanding float over the next year. Add it up, and the bank is offering a shareholder yield of nearly 15%. Throw in any improvement in the economic outlook, and we could see WFC stock rise 25% over the next year and pay a generous dividend along the way. PacWest Bancorp (PACW)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 6.15%The other banking dividend stock to consider today is PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW), which offers a dividend yield of over 6% at the moment.Headquartered in Los Angeles, PacWest is a major player in the California market and currently sports a  $4.6 billion market cap. That puts it in a sweet spot, size-wise, where it may still be a buyout candidate, but it is large enough to manage the rising costs of regulation and banking technology costs.Despite the horrid state of the California housing market in 2008, PacWest survived the crisis. In fact, its shares never came close to zero during the panic. The bank has come out stronger and is now generating record profits. Thanks to the corporate tax cuts in particular, PACW stock is now at a cheap P/E ratio of just 10.1 times its trailing earnings.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned BP, PACW, WFC, KHC, MKC, HSY, HRL, and XOM stock.

2019-12-13	2019-12-13 14:35:48	BP	BP p.l.c.	Billionaire George Soros Snaps Up These 3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks	Few investors have realized better sustained profits than George Soros. His hedge fund’s annualized returns exceeded 30% for over 30 years, and made him one of the world’s richest men. He gained fame in 1992 when he made a famous bet against the Pound Sterling and generated over $1 billion in profits in just 24 hours. While his political activities have generated controversy and criticism, no one can doubt his financial acumen.He bases that acumen on a simple aphorism: “If investing is entertaining, if you’re having fun, you’re probably not making any money. Good investing is boring.” He means, of course, that the most reliable stocks are the ones least likely to make waves in the markets or headlines in the news. So, don’t expect to find anything exciting in his firm’s $3.6 billion worth of 13F securities – but do expect to find solid returns and reliable dividends. After all, that’s where the profit is.To find out just how good that profit can get, we’ve taken three of Soros’ big dividend moves and looked them up in the TipRanks database. These are investments that the Stock Screener tool reveals as ‘Buy’ rated and, more importantly, all three offer robust dividend yields, between 4% and 11%. The average dividend yield of the S&P-listed stocks is just about 2%, so Soros’ choices start at double that – and work their way up.BP (BP)Up first is BP, the world’s sixth largest oil and gas company. The company’s revenues in calendar year 2018 totaled $303.7 billion, and gave a net profit of $9.6 billion. BP has had some trouble maintaining that sort of performance in 2019, however. In the Q3 earnings release, the company reported $2.3 billion in profits, a 17% decline sequentially and a 39% drop year-over-year.The drop in profits comes on the heels of declining oil prices. Brent crude, the global benchmark price on the oil markets, is down 12.7% from its peak in April of this year. There are subtleties in pricing, however. BP’s quarterly earnings reflect the generally low oil prices, but those same oil prices have been trending slightly upwards since October – and BP’s Q3 numbers did beat the analysts’ expectations. Among the headwinds the company faces is a CEO transition, as current head Bob Dudley will be stepping down this coming March. He will be followed by the company’s upstream chief. The promotion from within promises continuity despite the upper level churn.So, BP is a stock that is weathering a down time in commodity prices, with the resources to wait out a low-price regime. That’s a good position for a company to hold. Even better, for investors, the company has maintained its dividend. The quarterly payment has been set at 61 cents for the last six quarters, and the was 60 cents prior to that. The annualized dividend of $2.44 gives a yield of 6.67%, more than triple the S&P average. At 92%, the payout ratio, while high, is sustainable long-term.With a background like that, it’s no wonder that Soros moved heavily into BP in Q3. The stock offers a solid industry position, a reliable dividend, and a clear path for future profits. Soros’ purchase of BP marked a new position, of 270,000 shares for his fund. At today’s prices, those shares are worth nearly $10 million.Wall Street is upbeat about BP prospects. Setting that tone is BMO analyst Daniel Boyd, who writes, “We think BP is turning a corner after years flagging financial performance driven in part by oil-spill payments that are dropping off. We expect strong production and cashflow growth, enabled by high margin projects, to fuel dividend growth and improved returns.”Boyd’s Buy rating is backed up by a $53 price target, suggesting a strong upside of 43%. (To watch Boyd’s track record, click here)BP shares have received three recent Buy ratings, giving the stock a unanimous ‘Strong Buy’ from the analyst consensus. The average price target stands tall at $51.33 -- indicating a robust upside potential of 39%. (See BP stock analysis on TipRanks)Dominion Energy (D)BP wasn’t the only energy industry company that Soros was interested in. The master investor also made a large entry purchase in Dominion Energy, a power company based in Richmond, Virginia. Dominion is a major supplier of electricity in Virginia and the Carolinas, and also supplies natural gas to customers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia.Utilities are a profitable business. Dominion’s earnings in Q3 2019 came in at $1.18 per share, beating the estimates by 1.7%, and beating the year-ago number by 2.6%. Revenues were up more than 23% year-over-year, but missed the Q3 forecast by 3%.Dominion is due to pay out its next dividend on December 20. The payment, of 92 cents, annualizes to $3.67, giving a solid yield of 4.54%. The company has a 10-year history of committing to its dividend payment, and has been raising it annually for the last three years. Dominion has proven itself a reliable dividend stock.Long-term reliability of return likely drew in Soros, who purchased 150,000 D shares in Q3. His purchase is now worth over $12 million. Like BP, this was a new position for Soros, signaling an interest in the energy industry.Wolfe analyst Steve Fleishman takes a bullish stance on Dominion. Writing on the stock this week, he said, “Dominion has a balanced strategy, combining high-growth electric and gas utility operations with heavily contracted gas pipeline and LNG export assets. The company has done a good job de-risking the earnings mix and balance sheet, and we see it as attractive at current levels…”Fleishman gives D shares a ‘Buy’ rating with a $90 price target. His target indicates confidence, and about 12% upside potential for the stock. (To watch Fleishman’s track record, click here)Wall Street is evenly split right now on Dominion, with the analysts giving the stock 4 Buys and 4 Holds. The stock is trading for $80.69, and the $87.57 average price target implies a premium of 8.5% from the trading price. (See Dominion stock analysis on TipRanks)Annaly Capital Management (NLY)Turning away from the energy industry, we come to a stock in which Soros had already held a position. In the third quarter, the billionaire added over 1.15 million shares to his exiting holding in Annaly Capital Management, a substantial increase of 49%. The company is a real estate investment trust, and one of the largest in the US.Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are companies that own and manage combinations of residential or commercial properties, or invest in the loans and mortgages used to fund those properties. Annaly invests primarily in mortgage-backed securities, and holds some $133 billion worth of assets in its portfolio.For dividend investors, whether small-scale or billionaire hedge gurus, the stock is an obvious target. US tax code regulations require REITs to return as much as 90% of their income directly to shareholders, which is usually done in the form of dividends. For income investors, this is a boon. Stocks like NLY generally have dividend payout ratios that start at 85%; in Q3, NLY’s ratio was just over 100%, meaning all of the company’s income was sent back to investors. The current dividend, paid out quarterly at 25 cents per share, annualizes to a yield exceeding 10%.The high dividend makes up for slipping share value, helping to keep investors interested in NLY even though the stock has slipped 4.8% this year. As noted above, Soros’ interest in the company is substantial – and his total holding in the stock, of 3.517 million shares, is worth $32.88 million.4-star Barclays analyst Mark Devries lays out a clear thesis for investing in Annaly: “NLY's diversification into non-Agency and commercial real estate investments are initiatives that could generate attractive returns longer term. We like Agency focused Mortgage REITs at this point in the cycle given their defensive nature and ability to outperform in a bear market for equities.”Devries puts a $10 price target and a Buy rating on this stock. His target suggests a 7% upside to the stock – not spectacular, but still profitable. (To watch Devries’ track record, click here)Wall Street’s analyst give approval to NLY by a 3 to 1 advantage, putting a Strong Buy consensus rating on the stock. The average price target, $9.69, implies a modest upside of 4% from the $9.35 share price. From an investor’s perspective, the high yielding dividend here is more attractive than the shares’ appreciation potential.

BP faces ‘greenwashing’ complaint over advertising campaign	Environmental lawyers have made their boldest move to date against “greenwashing” in advertising campaigns by oil and gas companies.  ClientEarth, a non-profit legal group, submitted an official complaint under international guidelines on Tuesday arguing that BP is misleading consumers over its low-carbon credentials in recent advertisements — the company’s first global campaign in 10 years.  The adverts, which emphasise BP’s role in the transition to cleaner energy, create a “potentially misleading impression” that distracts the public from their core business of hydrocarbons, ClientEarth said.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/13c30737-bc87-3715-bcd4-b5ec14cf178b/bp-faces-%E2%80%98greenwashing%E2%80%99.html?.tsrc=rss

Asia’s Richest Man Breaks Into Club of Six Oil Elites	(Bloomberg) -- Reliance Industries Ltd., run by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, has eclipsed BP Plc to break into an elite club of energy supermajors.The Indian conglomerate is now valued at $138 billion, compared with the British energy giant’s $132 billion value at the close of trading on Tuesday. Reliance’s shares have increased at three times the pace of India’s benchmark index this year after its billionaire owner in August announced plans to cut the company’s net debt to zero in 18 months through measures including a stake sale in the oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco.The surge in shares gives Ambani a net worth of $56 billion, making him Asia’s richest person, above Alibaba Group’s Jack Ma, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Reliance’s market value briefly surpassed BP for the first time at the end of last month, and it has now regained the lead over the British company after its shares hit a fresh high in Mumbai on Wednesday.It also narrowing the gap with PetroChina Co., currently Asia’s biggest oil firm by value, and is within a whisker of becoming the first Indian company to hit the 10 trillion rupee market-cap milestone.Reliance has rallied 40% this year, compared with BP’s 1.2% gain as it works on cutting high debt levels. Oil companies have struggled because of swings in crude prices and as uncertainty persists over future energy demand.Reliance, meanwhile, has benefited in a number of ways. It operates the world’s biggest oil-refining complex in western India, which can process low-quality crude and turn it into higher-grade fuels, partly protecting it from volatility in prices.Telecom, RetailWhile Reliance gets two-third of its revenue from energy, Ambani has also made massive investments in telecom and digital services as he looks to benefit from growing demand in the world’s second-biggest market for mobile phone users. He has also expanded the company’s retail business to take on Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.The telecom unit, Reliance Jio, which claims to be world’s largest mobile data network, was also bolstered by a recent blow to India’s wireless carriers that left Ambani’s company largely unscathed. On Tuesday, Jio said it will take steps including an appropriate increase in tariffs in the next few weeks.Reliance is now the world’s sixth-largest oil company, with Exxon Mobil Corp. topping the list with a market value of about $290 billion. Aramco, formally known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., is planning an initial public offering with a valuation target of between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion, which would make it the world’s biggest.(Updates with superlative on market value in fifth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Ravil Shirodkar and P R Sanjai.To contact the reporter on this story: Debjit Chakraborty in New Delhi at dchakrabor10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Serene Cheong at scheong20@bloomberg.net, Rakteem Katakey, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asia-richest-man-breaks-club-210000776.html?.tsrc=rss

The problem is that has remained too steady.Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com The stock has seen little movement in the nine years Bob Dudley has served as CEO. Mr. Dudley took over in the midst of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that devastated both the stock and the company dividend.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 As leadership transitions to incoming CEO Bernard Looney in February, investors may credit Mr. Dudley with saving the company. However, stockholders have seen almost no profits in that time other than the dividend payments. Now, as new leadership takes over and as BP finally escapes the liabilities of the oil spill, many wonder if they can finally look forward to gains in BP PLC stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Oil Spill Turned BP Into a Dividend StockFor the last few years, BP stock has generated little excitement and considerable dividends. The company paid $3.36 per share in yearly dividends before the oil spill. At the current $2.46 per share in annual payouts, it still has not caught up to that level. However, it has risen steadily since management cut the payout.The company's dividend yield currently stands at an impressive 6.2%. Ian Bezek also makes a great point that shareholders do not pay foreign taxes on dividends from British companies. This is a bonus to holding shares in the company formerly known as British Petroleum.The problem involves a seemingly immovable stock price. BP traded at $38 per share when Bob Dudley took over as CEO in 2010. As Mr. Dudley prepares to step down, the equity trades at around $39.50 as of the time of this writing. For this reason, investors should probably continue to view BP stock primarily as an income play. Here's why. The Case For and Against BP StockNew leadership and the prospects for higher demand beg the question of whether investors need to buy BP stock for gains. In that area, I do not feel so optimistic.Admittedly, BP stock bulls have a reasonable argument. Although profits will fall this year, analysts forecast average annual earnings growth of 31.5% per year over the next five years. If this comes to pass, BP stock will again become a growth play. Moreover, countries such as China and India have an ever-increasing need for oil. The need should increase further once a U.S.-China trade deal becomes a reality.However, investors also have good reason to mistrust such a rosy forecast. Companies such as ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), like BP, have seen profits fall over the last year. So bad is the problem that Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) now questions its ability to stay in business.West Texas Intermediate crude currently trades at about $57 per share. While most would not consider this &quot;low,&quot; oil prices have struggled to gain traction in recent years as production levels in the Permian Basin have kept prices in check.The oil discovery in Iran will probably not help matters. The Iranian government claims it has discovered 53 billion additional barrels of oil. Despite sanctions, this likely helps to keep a lid on prices. When one figures-in the increasing importance of alternative energy, I see little reason to believe demand will rise enough to take the price of BP stock with it. The Bottom Line on BP PLC StockAmid a change in leadership, investors should continue to look at BP stock as an income play. BP should remain a good buy for dividend investors. The $3.05 per share in predicted profits will cover the $2.46 per share in dividends. The question is whether the equity can offer more.BP stock has seen little net price growth in nine years. Moreover, output continues to stay ahead of forecasted demand growth, indicating prices will fall. Despite this, analysts continue to hold to optimistic forecasts of long-term profit growth.Considering these conditions, I recommend BP stock only as a dividend play. I see the prospects for stock gains as mixed, but if they occur, see it as a bonus.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and Vitol Group are among partners in a new exchange to trade Abu Dhabi’s flagship oil grade in what could become a new price benchmark for a fifth of the world’s crude.Intercontinental Exchange Inc. Chairman Jeffrey Sprecher confirmed the partnerships, speaking on Monday to reporters in Abu Dhabi. Other partners in the exchange are Petrochina Co., Inpex Corp. and JXTG Holdings Inc. of Japan, PTT Pcl of Thailand, and South Korea-based GS Caltex Corp., he said.Although oil producers across the Persian Gulf pump about a fifth of the world’s oil, they have never had a region-wide, exchange-traded crude benchmark. Adnoc wants the Murban futures contract to become a benchmark for crude from the Middle East, the biggest oil-exporting area of the world.Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will join major international oil companies, traders and customers as founding partners in a platform operated by ICE for the trading of futures contracts in Abu Dhabi’s flagship Murban crude, Adnoc Chief Executive Officer Sultan Al Jaber said in a speech earlier Monday. Murban futures will allow buyers to hedge in the open market, he said.Trading StartThe contracts are likely to begin trading around June, and are set to be the benchmark for other Abu Dhabi grades, Al Jaber said in an interview after ICE’s announcement. ICE will be a majority shareholder in the Abu Dhabi futures exchange, he said.Having a large number of well-known international partners “gives you instant credibility that what we’re doing is the right step forward,” Al Jaber said.ICE plans also to introduce swaps contracts on the Abu Dhabi exchange -- for example, between Murban and North Sea Brent -- to improve liquidity by offering more hedging options. The swaps would start trading at about same time as the Murban futures, Stuart Williams, president of ICE Futures Europe, said in an interview in Abu Dhabi.Murban is Adnoc’s most plentiful grade, at about 1.7 million barrels a day, and accounts for more than half of the crude pumped in the United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi holds most of the oil in the U.A.E., the third-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.Crude BenchmarksAbu Dhabi won’t be the first regional producer to offer futures contracts for its crude. Oman and the neighboring U.A.E. emirate of Dubai joined with CME Group Inc. in 2007 to start the Dubai Mercantile Exchange to trade Omani crude futures. Oman, Dubai and Saudi Arabia are the only producers in the Gulf to price off the contract; most of the others base their monthly crude pricing on the Dubai and Oman crude price assessments by S&P Global Inc.’s Platts.There is room for more than one benchmark in the region, and the Oman and Murban markers could act as reference points for different crude grades and qualities, Al Jaber said. Murban is lighter and more sweet, while Oman is heavier and more sour, he said.Murban generally fetches higher prices on global markets and is similar in quality to Brent crude, the international benchmark. Brent futures are traded on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange.To contact the reporters on this story: Anthony DiPaola in Dubai at adipaola@bloomberg.net;Javier Blas in London at jblas3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nayla Razzouk at nrazzouk2@bloomberg.net, Bruce Stanley, Amanda JordanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-total-shell-vitol-stakes-091707962.html?.tsrc=rss

BP's new technology investments have so far focused on electric vehicle charging platforms such as FreeWire and PowerShare and reduction of emissions from oil and gas drilling.  Whim, which is developed by MaaS Global, offers customers a single platform to connect all available transport options in a city from taxis, buses, bikes and rental cars to ride-hailing services and shared e-scooters and e-bikes.	https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-invests-city-transportation-app-001107519.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-11-07	2019-11-07 00:00:00	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP Invests in App Maker Aimed at Killing Private Car Ownership	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc is investing 10 million euros ($11.1 million) in the makers of the app Whim, which allows users to pay a monthly fee to access both public and private transport in their city.The company that owns Whim, MaaS Global, started offering the service in Helsinki in 2017. A study early this year suggested the app’s users in Finland curbed their private car use, turning instead to the taxis, public transport, bicycles and rental vehicles they were able to access for a single flat rate using the service.BP’s investment will give it access to the technology underpinning the service. Like other oil companies heavily reliant on fuel sales, the British oil major is seeking a foothold in businesses that understand changing consumer preferences around mobility.“Whim is super convenient,” said Roy Williamson, vice president for advanced mobility at BP, in a statement. “It takes the hassle out of planning travel, taking on board users’ preferences and connecting and booking their ideal transport choices.”In Helsinki, Whim offers four different “plans” which users can sign up for. The cheapest is a pay-as-you go deal, where the app tells a user the best way to get from one destination to the next using a combination of public and private transit options. The user pays for and collects tickets within the app. In the most expensive option, users pay 499 euros a month for unlimited access to rental cars, taxis, public transport and city bikes.MaaS Global, which stands for “mobility as a service,” has published reports which say creating a single digital plan for all types of transport will be important to cut congested and polluted streets, and foster the shift to automated cars. In the future, private car ownership may fall while software helps people find instant, easy and cheap transit options, according to a report from MaaS in March.In one year, the company said it found its users relied on public transit, cycling and walking more than others in Helsinki. Though it doesn’t track private car rides, “new mobility” options could replace 38% of daily car trips, the report said. Whim is now also available in Birmingham, the U.K. and will soon be available in Vienna and Antwerp. BP’s investment will support expansion plans in Singapore and the U.S., the oil major said in the statement.BP executives have talked and written about the importance of understanding the changing dynamics of transport, which will affect the way customers access BP’s retail stations and demand for its fuel. The company is already the largest investor of electric car charging in the U.K., anticipating rising demand for vehicles without a combustion engine.To contact the reporter on this story: Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Helen Robertson, Christopher SellFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-invests-app-maker-aimed-000000298.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-02	2019-11-02 08:00:00	BP	BP p.l.c.	Big Oil Bruised in Communication Breakdown of Its Own Making	(Bloomberg) -- Big Oil emerged from the third-quarter earnings season battered and bruised, and in some cases it only had itself to blame.Exxon Mobil Corp. aside, the Western supermajors have made bold proclamations about showering investors with cash as they emerge leaner and meaner from the 2014-2016 oil-price crash. But as darkening economic headwinds and operational deficiencies mounted, investors fretted that their expectations may be too high. Here are five things we learned:1&#92;. Communication BreakdownRoyal Dutch Shell Plc Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden made an unplanned intervention midway through his company’s earnings conference call in an attempt to lessen the damage from its warning it may fall short of a share buyback target. The move only invited confusion and the shares slid.Meanwhile, BP Plc backpedaled on Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary’s comment that a dividend raise would be premature, clarifying that “no decision has yet been made.” Exxon failed to field a senior executive on its call, a reversal from last year when the oil giant vowed to “increase engagement” with investors.2&#92;. Reality BitesShell positioned itself as the sector’s cash king over the past two years after major projects came on stream and commodity prices rebounded from the crash. But with weaker economic growth threatening oil demand and crude supplies surging, Europe’s biggest oil company warned that it may not finish a $25 billion buyback program by the end of next year as planned.Chevron has made financial discipline the keystone of its investment case with CEO Mike Wirth repeatedly saying “costs always matter.” It had previously warned of rising spending at its giant Tengiz field in Kazakhstan but few expected the estimated development cost to blow out by 25% to $45.2 billion, especially after upstream boss Jay Johnson said the project was making “good progress” in August. “Clearly this is a disappointment,” he said on Friday.3&#92;. High BarExxon, Shell, BP and Total SA all beat earnings estimates but their shares either fell or failed to keep pace with oil prices on the day. That underscores the fact that energy has a high bar to retain and attract investors as short-term commodity price constraints meet long-term uncertainties over the fate of fossil fuels.In the U.S., energy companies make up just 4.3% of the S&P 500 Index, down from nearly 12% a decade ago.4&#92;. Permian PowerOne bright spot for Big Oil is the Permian Basin, which is now the fastest-growing major source of production for both Exxon and Chevron. BP is also gearing up to grow there after its $10.5 billion purchase of BHP Group Ltd.’s assets last year. Once an overlooked backwater, the Permian is now a safe space for America’s oil giants, providing quick, low-cost production.Exxon is looking “very closely” at M&A in the basin and elsewhere, Neil Hansen, head of investor relations, also said Friday. Shell, meanwhile, appears to be cooling on the idea of expanding in the Permian; its CFO said it sees no need to buy a shale company.5&#92;. European DebtPaying down debt is a much larger draw on cash reserves for European companies, especially BP, than for their American rivals. Reducing leverage is BP’s number one priority for extra cash at the moment while Chevron reiterated that dividends are its top consideration. That’s exactly what investors want to hear right now.To contact the reporters on this story: Kevin Crowley in Houston at kcrowley1@bloomberg.net;Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-bruised-communication-breakdown-080000369.html?.tsrc=rss

Sign up here.Royal Dutch Shell Plc said the worsening economy could slow the pace of returns to shareholders, overshadowing a strong third-quarter trading performance that yielded bumper profits.While the company comfortably beat even the highest analyst estimate for third-quarter profit, shares dropped the most in almost a month after Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden warned of uncertainty around the current pace of share buybacks and reduction in gearing -- Shell’s ratio of debt to equity.It’s a performance that echoes Shell’s closest rival BP Plc, which also posted better-than-expected earnings but disappointed shareholders hoping for a dividend increase. The third quarter was difficult for energy producers, with crude prices sinking over worries about the impact of the U.S.-China trade war while natural gas markets endured a long stretch of oversupply. “The prevailing weak macroeconomic conditions and challenging outlook inevitably create uncertainty about the pace of reducing gearing to 25% and completing the share buyback program within the 2020 timeframe,” van Beurden said in a statement on Thursday.Shell’s B shares fell as much as 3.2% in London, the biggest drop since Oct. 2, and traded 2.6% lower at 2,262.5 pence as of 8:18 a.m. local time.Shell said adjusted net income was $4.77 billion in the quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.92 billion. That compares with profit of $5.62 billion in the same period last year, and improves on a surprisingly weak second quarter. Cash flow from operations including working capital, perhaps the single most important measure for Shell as it aims to distribute $125 billion to shareholders between 2021 and 2025, was $12.25 billion, little changed from a year earlier.“Common sense suggests the balance sheet is much more important than an arbitrary target on the buyback, especially if the company plans to continue the buyback post 2020,” RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note. Trading GainsThe company’s downstream division, which includes refining, chemicals and fuel marketing, jumped 51% to $2.57 billion. The company emphasized the positive impact of trading gains, particularly in the market for fuel oil, which has been in flux ahead of the introduction of new rules limiting the sulfur content of shipping fuel.While Shell and its peers are better known for their oil fields, refineries and fuel stations, they also run vast trading operations far larger than independent trading houses like Vitol Group or Glencore Plc. Shell trades about 13 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, nearly double the volume handled by Vitol.Shell’s upstream output fell 2% in the quarter as a result of a hurricane and maintenance, as Shell produced 2.606 million barrels of oil equivalent a day. That doesn’t include production from the integrated gas unit, where output rose 4% to 957,000 barrels of oil equivalent and liquefied natural gas sales volumes increased 9% to 18.9 million tons.Advance WarningThe company had warned in its first ever pre-earnings “quarterly update” that upstream production would probably dip slightly from a year earlier, though the impact of the decline may be offset by a strong performance in its market-leading liquefied natural gas trading business.The company decided to disclose more information before publishing its results following complaints its earnings were too volatile to predict. In the first quarter of 2019, it beat analyst estimates by 14%, then missed them by 28% the following quarter.Shell’s peers also made one-time disclosures this quarter to flag bearish news. BP Plc beat estimates on Tuesday but only after analysts downgraded them by about 35% after the company flagged a $2.61 billion impairment charge. Exxon Mobil Corp., which reports earnings on Friday, said it will take a $400 million to $700 million hit from lower oil prices.&#92;--With assistance from Javier Blas and Christopher Sell.To contact the reporter on this story: Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Stuart WallaceFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-beats-estimates-strong-refining-071901358.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-28	2019-10-28 16:14:59	BP	BP p.l.c.	Big Oil Investors Bracing for Bad News as Headwinds Gather	(Bloomberg) -- Slumping energy prices, sluggish global demand and shrinking chemical margins are weighing on the oil industry as its biggest names prepare to announce quarterly results to investors demanding ever-higher payouts.The so-called supermajors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Chevron Corp., Total SA and BP Plc -- are expected to disclose a 42% plunge in third-quarter earnings, on average, when they post results this week. That drop-off is too steep to blame on the 18% decline in crude oil prices, which means executives will have some explaining to do.Exxon, Shell, and BP already have already taken steps to manage shareholder expectations by releasing limited data points on things like refinery repairs, asset sales and hurricane impacts on offshore oil production. Nonetheless, investors will be watching for additional color on what to expect for the remainder of 2019.To make sense of all the moving parts in Big Oil’s earnings reports that start Oct. 29 with BP, look for these five things:1&#92;. SurprisesMost of the bad news already should be priced in. Exxon fell 2.6% on Oct. 2 after disclosing a half-billion dollar hit from lower oil prices, a deficit that wasn’t plugged by improved refining profits.Meanwhile, Shell warned that oil and gas output inched lower, and its refineries and chemical plants operated at about 90% of full capacity. BP warned that its tax bill rose, production declined, and it incurred an impairment on some assets it sold, factors that dampened hopes of an imminent dividend increase.2&#92;. PetrochemicalsLong touted as Big Oil’s next high-growth opportunity, petrochemicals are languishing. The U.S.-China trade war has weakened demand for plastics amid concerns that $40 billion in planned U.S. Gulf Coast chemical plants will create a glut.“Current trends continue to suggest a prolonged downturn” in chemicals, RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in an Oct. 17 note. Exxon, with its giant chemical division, is the most heavily affected by this trend among peers.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysChemicals may not recover materially from recent margin contraction, and overhang from oversupply amid economic slowdown is concerning.&#92;--Fernando Valle, analystRead the research here.3&#92;. GrowthIn a world awash in crude and confronted with climate change, growth is a major conundrum for Big Oil. Should these companies be expanding or winding down? Investors don’t seem to have a clear answer right now. Exxon’s stock has been punished after the company spent too much on future projects while Chevron is regularly challenged on whether it has enough in the tank for growth after 2023.Meanwhile there’s uncertainty whether Shell can match historic returns with investments in renewables and power, though earlier this month Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne declared the company has already achieved double-digit returns by selling electricity.Don’t expect major pronouncements on such existential issues, but executives may offer clues to their thinking during earnings conference calls when they’re quizzed about 2020 spending and progress toward asset-disposal targets. BP’s call may get more scrutiny than most after it said earlier this month that longtime CEO Bob Dudley is handing the reins to upstream director Bernard Looney in February.4&#92;. ShaleExxon and Chevron each plan to more than triple production in the U.S. Permian Basin to 1 million barrels a day by the early 2020s. As for the European giants’ attitude toward shale, BP’s $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP Group Ltd.’s assets last year was a statement of intent.Analysts will be keeping a close eye on how those companies avoid the pitfalls of smaller rivals stung by overambitious drilling programs, and how their performance stacks up against lofty targets. Despite the production boom, investors have soured on shale because of poor performance by independent producers that burned through nearly $200 billion of cash in the past decade.5&#92;. DividendsThe supermajors have long been among the stock market’s most generous dividend payers but in the new world of plentiful crude and anti-fossil fuel campaigns, increasing payouts and share buybacks are seen as key to retaining investors. Just as critical is whether the companies can afford them: the supermajors’ dividend yields this year surged to more than double the return on 10-year Treasury notes.While none of the five companies’ dividend programs are in jeopardy, investors are keen to see how sustainable they are when balanced against costly drilling and construction projects, such as Exxon’s $30 billion-a-year spending program, and Shell’s investments in lower-profit renewable power.(Updates with chart under ‘Surprises’ heading.)&#92;--With assistance from Grant Smith.To contact the reporters on this story: Kevin Crowley in Houston at kcrowley1@bloomberg.net;Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net, Joe Carroll, Christine BuurmaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-investors-bracing-bad-040002396.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Has Been Palantir Shareholder Since 2014, Sunday Times Says	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc, one of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies, is a shareholder in secretive U.S. data-mining firm Palantir Technologies Inc., the Sunday Times reported.The London-based oil giant first bought a Palantir stake in 2014, according to the Sunday Times report, which didn’t cite sources. The two companies have reportedly worked together for several years. Closely-held Palantir, founded and chaired by Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, is known for its links to U.S. intelligence.Such an investment is rare for BP, the Sunday Times said, yet may reflect its embrace of digitization under Bernard Looney, the company veteran who becomes chief executive officer in early 2020. The incoming CEO expanded the relationship with Palantir while he was head of its upstream operations, the Financial Times reported earlier this month.Spokespeople at BP and Palo Alto, California-based Palantir didn’t immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.Palantir is in talks to raise significant funding from private investors, a move that could delay previous plans to hold an initial public offering, Bloomberg reported last month.To contact the reporter on this story: Donal Griffin in London at dgriffin10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ambereen Choudhury at achoudhury@bloomberg.net, Jon Menon, Sara MarleyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-palantir-shareholder-since-2014-115324207.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-21	2019-10-21 23:01:00	BP	BP p.l.c.	U.K. Politicians Push for Divestment of BP and Shell Shares	(Bloomberg) -- A group of 300 British politicians are pushing the trustees of the Parliamentary Pension Fund to sell shares of BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc to ward off the risks of climate change.The group, organized by environmental non-profit 350.org, adds to pressure on the fossil fuel industry. Over the last two weeks, climate change activists from the group Extinction Rebellion have disrupted London by blocking roads and climbing on commercial airplanes. Just weeks before that, an estimated 7.6 million people globally took to the streets to protest continually rising emissions.“Reducing our dependence on fossil fuels is probably the single most urgent challenge we face,” the Former Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Rowan Williams of Oystermouth, said in a statement. “Divestment will send a positive and hopeful message to the people of this country.”The U.K. politicians pushing for divestment said dumping shares in Shell and BP from its 700 million pound ($909 million) pension fund would reduce risk associated with the sector. A panel of bankers at the Oil & Money conference in London earlier this month drew comparisons between oil companies and the tobacco industry, which shrunk after it was socially ostracized and drawn into expensive legal battles.The pledge was signed by politicians from the U.K.’s largest political parties and backed by 30 former MPs including London Mayor Sadiq Khan. In a statement, supporters argued divestment aligns with other actions Britain has taken to address climate change. Parliament declared the world is in a “climate emergency” in May and some lawmakers said they will come up with a new investment policy that factors in the impact of global warming.The Parliamentary Pension Fund holds 11.6 million pounds of BP shares and 10.9 million pounds of Shell shares.“We agree that action is needed now on climate change, so we fully support the Paris agreement and the need for society to transition to a lower-carbon future.” a Shell spokesman said in an emailed statement. “We’re committed to playing our part, by addressing our own emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs. In the U.K., we support the government’s target of net-zero emissions by 2050.”BP didn’t respond to a request for comment.While it’s hard to link divestment directly to changes in fossil-fuel consumption, supporters of the practice believe it can urge companies to adopt cleaner practices. Shell said in its last annual report that the divestment movement could have “a material adverse effect” on its share price and could restrict its access to new capital needed to grow.To contact the reporter on this story: Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Helen RobertsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-k-politicians-push-divestment-230100206.html?.tsrc=rss

Regardless of whether you're looking at the past one year, five years, or ten years, XOM stock has been stuck in the mud. You'd have to go back to before the Great Financial Crisis since XOM stock made investors significant money.Source: Shutterstock As is often the case, however, the longer a stock trades sideways, the bigger its next move will be. XOM stock has now traded largely flat for a decade, swinging up and down but generally remaining near the $75/share mark. When it finally gets going again, expect a huge move.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Canopy Growth Stock Technically, Exxon stock is primed to explode upward once it starts accelerating. Here's why Exxon's next move will be upward, and probably dramatically so.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Exxon Mobil's Huge Growth PlansInvestors tend to think of the oil and gas companies being hunkered down for a long winter, and that's generally right. As the oil slump has entered year five, many smaller firms are drastically cutting down exploration and drilling expenses. In a world of $55/barrel oil, it doesn't make sense for small operators to try to increase production.This leaves a big opportunity for companies with more scale and cheaper access to capital like Exxon Mobil. The company can, and is, making efforts to greatly improve its production in coming years. Management realizes that the world is going to need more oil. Once the current shale boom loses steam in the U.S., we'll need another round of fresh supply to replace declining reserves elsewhere.Enter Exxon, with its multi-billion dollar projects to open new production fields in places like Guyana. In fact, Exxon is getting aggressive. They are aiming to double cash flow and earnings in coming years. With so many other players pulling back their spending, Exxon with its fortress balance sheet will profitably pick up the slack. Oil May Be Peaking, But It Isn't Going Away Anytime SoonMany folks seem to confuse Exxon's (very) long-term prospects with its ability to carry on in coming years. Some analysts project that if current trends hold, by around 2050, we may see renewable energy displace fossil fuels in making up a large portion of the electric grid. And the crossover point for electric vehicles could be relatively sooner -- say in the 2030s. Exxon is well aware of this, and management has invested heavily in research for next-generation energy solutions.The fact that renewables will be growing in future decades hardly matters to XOM stock tomorrow, or even ten years from now. By 2040, the 2019 Energy Outlook estimates (see slides 11 and 13) that wind, nuclear, solar, and other renewables will still be less than one-fifth of the world's global energy supply. Even dirty coal will remain a key though shrinking player, while oil demand will be about flat, and natural gas use will continue to rise. XOM Stock Dividend Is Rock-SolidXOM stock is currently offering a more than 5% dividend yield. This is the highest dividend that the company has provided in three decades. Even in the Great Financial Crisis, XOM stock paid far less. Also, in the late 1990s, when oil was just $15/barrel, XOM stock only paid a 2-2.5% dividend. Now it pays double that.The higher dividend yield is the result of investor apathy, along with many socially-responsible funds dumping their allocations to fossil fuels altogether. Oil and gas appear to be becoming like tobacco stocks in the 1990s, shunned by investors who felt the companies were &quot;obsolete&quot; and harmful morally. Regardless of those concerns, cigarette companies like Altria (NYSE:MO) went on to post world-beating returns while giving off fat dividend yields.Exxon stock could perform similarly going forward. The world will need plenty of oil for at least a few more decades, and Exxon has the balance sheet to keep its dividend secure. At an AA+ credit rating, Exxon is one of the highest-rated companies out there; it could pay off its debt with just a year or two of profits if needed.As for the dividend, based on an average of recent years, Exxon's cash flow covers its payout more than three times. This indicates that the company has more than enough ongoing operations, even at relatively low oil and gas prices, to pay the 5% dividend indefinitely. And with growth projects coming online, the company will be able to continue hiking the dividend even more in coming years. XOM Stock VerdictI've been buying Exxon stock gradually over the past year. And with the recent dip under $70/share, I've gotten more aggressive in picking up shares.Admittedly, there's no imminent catalyst for Exxon shares to take off. The oil market is currently in a slump, and natural gas is oversupplied as well. Exxon's refining business is steady, and is generating large profits. That said, until oil or natural gas -- preferably both -- see an uptick, XOM stock might stay down around $70. That's true of other high-quality oil and gas stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX), BP (NYSE:BP), and Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) as well.Once prices start to lift, however, XOM stock will skyrocket. Remember that the company is planning to double earnings and cash flow over the next five years from increasing production from low-cost new areas such as Guyana. This should lift earnings to $9/share.Throw in some help from higher oil and gas prices, and EPS will reach the double digits. At the current $70/share price, that'd be a 7x P/E ratio, or less. Even a $100 share price would be no more than 10x earnings. Add in that outsized dividend yield and things look even better. Buy now, and enjoy the 5% dividend with a strong chance of big share price appreciation over the next few years as well.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned XOM, BP, and CNQ stock.

The bidders who win exploration and production rights in the massive Nov. 6 auction will be obliged to pay the government a combined signing bonus of some 106.5 billion reais ($25.8 billion), making it the largest oil bidding round in history, according to Brazilian authorities.  The fields are unique as Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA, better known as Petrobras, has already done significant exploration work in the area.	https://sg.news.yahoo.com/explainer-translating-tor-brazils-26-120000630.html?.tsrc=rss

Big Oil Is Selling Dirty Assets, But They Aren’t Going Away	(Bloomberg) -- When BP Plc announced its historic exit from Alaska, Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley pointed to an extra perk from the $5.6 billion sale: a significantly lower carbon footprint.Cutting emissions is important for Dudley, partly because influential shareholders are forcing BP to align its spending with climate goals. But there’s a catch.Hilcorp Energy Co., the buyer of the Alaska assets, plans to pour more money to boost production there than BP would have, according to Dudley. That could end up making the carbon problem worse than it was.The BP boss and his counterparts at the world’s biggest oil companies are caught in a dilemma. Investors are demanding they adhere to the goals of the Paris climate accord, while continuing to generate the mounds of cash that make them among the biggest and most consistent dividend payers.To strike a balance, one of the strategies for the executives is to sell high-cost and high-carbon projects. But that may only offload the emissions problem on to another company.“If one asset just passes to another and still operates at its maximum capacity, OK that may have helped the profile of that individual company, but does that actually do anything on a net effect of reduced emissions?” said Adam Matthews, the director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England Pensions Board. “That’s a legitimate question.”Oil Sands, CoalBP is not the only one passing on the responsibility. Royal Dutch Shell Plc divested its carbon-intensive Canadian oil-sands business in 2017 that is now operating under a new owner. Total SA sold its interest in a similar project, which was dormant, to a buyer looking to revive it. Miner Rio Tinto Plc exited coal by selling some of its assets to Glencore Plc, which plans to keep running them for years.The companies’ actions will be discussed when hundreds of executives gather this week at the Oil & Money conference. The event, which saw noisy protests from pressure group Extinction Rebellion outside its London venue on Tuesday, will change its name to Energy Intelligence Forum next year in a nod to climate change and the energy transition.While the asset sales help reduce costs, Dudley, Shell’s CEO Ben van Beurden and Total’s Patrick Pouyanne will also need to show they’re committed to the environment and not just offloading their responsibility.Still, for some investors selling the high-carbon projects makes the companies more resilient to future climate legislation, and that’s a step in the right direction.If companies can use the funds from the sale of carbon intensive projects to develop lower-intensity production, that’s a “decision that we are generally supportive of,” said Nick Stansbury, head of commodity research at Legal & General Investment Management, one of the largest shareholders of major oil companies.Big ChallengeOil executives say their big challenge is to cut emissions while continuing to supply energy to a growing global economy. Shutting down production can create shortages that could boost prices, reduce affordability and even encourage the start up of new projects.Also read: Norway’s Huge New Oil Project Clashes With Growing Climate FocusTo tackle the “radical changes” required to keep global warming at a safe level, demand for low-carbon energy would have to rise dramatically, said Tal Lomnitzer, a senior investment manager at Janus Henderson Investors. It would have to be aided by government policy changes and involve social pressure, he said.“A much faster transition is technically possible but actors need guidance,” Lomnitzer said. “It’s likely to arrive from the populace and then be expressed via bans, taxes and incentives.”The oil companies support a tax on carbon as a way to discourage emissions, and are promoting natural gas as a cleaner fuel. France’s Total applies a carbon price internally in its assessment of projects, a spokeswoman said, as do others like BP. Qatar, the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas exporter, started a carbon capture and storage project as part of an effort to address concerns about climate change, Energy Minister Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi said Tuesday.Investor pressure is also forcing the oil majors to increase spending on green energy. They’re building wind and solar projects, boosting electric-vehicle infrastructure and reducing the amount of gas they release into the atmosphere. But these investments are still a fraction of overall expenditure.“The transition from Big Oil to Big Energy will certainly take time,” said Rob Barnett, an energy policy analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “But we do see things headed in that direction.”(Updates with protests in the eighth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Isis Almeida, Francois de Beaupuy and Kevin Crowley.To contact the reporter on this story: Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Rakteem Katakey, Amanda JordanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-selling-dirty-assets-230100475.html?.tsrc=rss

BP’s New CEO Needs to Steer Company Through World Wary of Oil	(Bloomberg) -- In a world that’s increasingly wary of fossil fuels, BP Plc’s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney will have to prove the company can keep up with the times.BP has a highly profitable oil and gas business that pioneered exports from the Middle East, opened up giant fields in Alaska and the U.K. North Sea, and has paid billions of dollars to shareholders.But 49-year-old Looney needs to decide how quickly he wants to pivot BP toward cleaner -- typically less profitable -- forms of energy. The company is already transitioning to cleaner fuels, and the timing will be essential as the new CEO tries to keep influential investors on his side, and also offer an attractive career to talented young engineers.Looney has taken an unusual approach by asking a BP geophysicist in his 20s to “mentor” him on new innovations. During an interview earlier this year, the younger employee, Connor Tann, said he was somewhat in disbelief when he was picked to visit the office of the powerful executive.The two meet regularly to discuss not just technology but the culture of the younger generation, which Looney hopes to lure to his company from the attractions of Big Tech. The tall and lanky Irish executive, who carries himself with the charm of a politician, often looks worried when he’s asked if he’s keeping up with society’s attitudes.Looney has been “modernizing the upstream for BP and driving the digital agenda with a vision that the industry and the company are seen as cool, clean and low-carbon,” Barclays Plc analysts wrote in a note. “It is likely that the appointment of Mr. Looney as CEO may accelerate the journey that BP is on regarding the energy transition.”Delivering ProjectsLooney already has some experience under his belt. As head of BP’s upstream business, he steered the company through a worst-in-a-generation price slump that led to project cancellations, staff reductions and the mandate to squeeze more out of every dollar spent.He is credited with delivering projects on time and on budget. BP’s production is set to rival that of much larger Exxon Mobil Corp., including its stake in Rosneft PJSC, by the middle of the next decade.He frequently holds town halls and runs an online discussion forum that looks a bit like a Facebook page. Looney sees these as key to keeping BP relevant in a world where students are marching on the streets demanding a move to a cleaner world and investors are questioning if it’s safe to keep their money in fossil fuels.Looney’s Path at BPSource: BPHe helped drive the company toward digitizing its upstream operations and encouraging oil workers to wear devices to monitor their health. He’s also helped push the company toward better detecting methane leaks, a key contributor to global warming.‘Humbled’“I am humbled by the responsibility that is being entrusted to me by the board,” Looney said in a statement that announced his appointment to the top job. “And am truly excited about both the role and BP’s future.”In the past, he worked in the CEO’s office -- a position his predecessor Bob Dudley also held -- under the tumultuous reigns of former bosses John Browne and Tony Hayward. Those stints exposed him to major upheavals at BP including the company’s early, and eventually ill-timed, foray into solar. He was also in the thick of the action as the Deepwater Horizon accident resulted in the biggest ever U.S. oil spill, killed 11 people and which cost the company $70 billion in penalties.Looney, who joined BP in 1991 as a drilling engineer, was running the company’s North Sea operations when the rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico.He flew out to Houston and worked for 60 days to try to stop crude gushing out of the well, he told an Irtish newspaper last year. At BP’s headquarters in London, employees were watching the company’s stock price plunge and U.S. President Barack Obama admonish their irresponsibility. People wondered if the company would survive the fallout. Looney called it the most challenging time of his career.Son of a FarmerLooney grew up on a dairy farm in Kerry, Ireland, with about eight arable acres, he told the Irish Independent newspaper last year. “We had 14 cows and it was pretty much subsistence farming,” he said. When the paper asked about his past-times he said he likes to follow tractor accounts on Instagram, as well as travel.He was the only one of his family to gain a university degree, with neither of his parents going to school beyond the age of 11, he said. Looney studied engineering at University College Dublin, and then got a degree from the Stanford Graduate School of Business in California.In February, he found himself on an all-male panel at a major London industry conference. He pointed out the practice, known as a manel, is not acceptable. Later at the company’s annual general meeting in May, a former engineer in his division took to the microphone to say people she speaks to in the upstream business are growing disillusioned because they don’t know what their purpose is amid the broader climate debate.Afterward, as dozens of shareholders jostled for Looney’s attention, he stood speaking to her to better understand her concerns.Looney will not be short of people wanting to have a say. A investor group overseeing $35 trillion called Climate Action 100+ said it wants BP, and 160 other companies, to be carbon neutral by 2050. That would drastically alter life at the oil major, which is aiming to keep its emissions from rising even as it increases production. The group has already bound BP to detail how each capital investment decision is aligned with the Paris climate accord, which Looney will be responsible for ushering through.“An incoming CEO who understands his organization, diversity, shareholders, free cash flow and how to make BP investible amid the growing energy transition concerns,” said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. “We see no radical change in strategy.”To contact the reporter on this story: Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Rakteem Katakey, Helen RobertsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/irish-farmer-son-set-steer-093237703.html?.tsrc=rss

His replacement Bernard Looney, appointed on Friday, should avoid the temptation to think his job is primarily to sustain that legacy.Like all the big international oil companies, BP under Dudley acknowledged the need to adapt to a world that craves more energy but fewer fossil fuels. The standard industry blueprint is to target more profitable conventional oil production, while investing in renewables and cutting emissions by, for example, using carbon sinks to store greenhouse gases underground and planting forests. But the precise balance of these goals matters.BP must steer between two extremes. On the one hand, it faces pressure to cease all investment in hydrocarbon energy and channel all of its free cash flow into clean energy — a wholesale transformation of the company.Alternatively, it could accept that when an industry is disrupted by an epochal change, like the shift to renewables, new entrants are best placed to exploit the opportunity. On that view, BP and its fellow oil majors should effectively start running themselves down, while paying out dividends to shareholders who can invest in companies better placed to lead the transition to new forms of energy.It would be better to see BP’s role as doing something between those two alternatives: pursuing some activities in clean energy, while also providing cash for others to deploy. Looney’s first task will be to look honestly at where BP has distinctive capabilities in renewables. There are some areas where it makes sense for the company to put its financial resources to work. It can turn its retail gas stations into charging stations for electric cars, as it’s doing. In turn, there’s logic in investing in related electrification infrastructure. But it would be foolish to believe that BP can transform itself completely into a wind, solar and battery company with a small legacy oil business.Unusually for the new CEO of a $124 billion company, Looney must face the reality that BP’s conventional business is going to decline and his role is largely about managing that.Dudley had to contend with the political hostility generated by Deepwater Horizon. Looney has an even more profound challenge. He will be dealing with an investor base of university endowments, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, which are all under pressure to exit oil investments completely. There could be worse uses for BP’s cash than buying back its shares and letting those shareholders decide where to re-invest.By reputation Looney is energetic, personable and sharp, as has been demonstrated by his rapid promotion through the ranks. He’ll need to bring vigor in carrying out a realistic appraisal of what BP can do and what’s best left to others.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

              </p><p>A change of leadership at BP.</p>
              <p>Bernard Looney is to replace Bob Dudley as CEO when he retires in February. </p>
              <p>The incoming CEO is no stranger to the oil giant. </p>
              <p>He took charge of BP's oil and gas production, or ""upstream operations"" in 2016, just as the sector grappled with the aftermath of the 2014 collapse in oil prices.</p>
              <p>The Irishman's energetic management style was quickly felt, as he spearheaded cost cutting and digitalization.</p>
              <p>Looney has helped lead BP through some of its fastest growth in oil and gas production - with output rising by around 20% since 2016. </p>
              <p>The same period saw the acquisition of BHP's portfolio of U.S. shale assets this year for $10.5 billion - BP's biggest deal in three decades.</p>

2019-10-04	2019-10-04 09:17:31	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP CEO Bob Dudley to Step Down, Succeeded by Oil-Drilling Chief	(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.BP Plc said Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley will retire early next year, a much-anticipated step after more than nine years at the helm of the oil and gas giant.He’s succeeded by Bernard Looney, the head of upstream who has led BP into new countries and championed the latest technology.Dudley’s most notable achievement was rescuing the company in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico that caused the biggest oil spill in U.S. history and killed 11 people. His tenure has been focused on restoring the company to the position it held before the 2010 accident as billions of dollars of penalties and compensation piled up.The 64-year-old will step down as CEO following the publication of BP’s full-year results on Feb. 4 and will retire on March 31, the London-based company said Friday.Speculation about Dudley’s resignation has been swirling for a while. Sky News reported last month that he was preparing to leave within a year and had held detailed discussions with Chairman Helge Lund about his retirement plans.While the speed of the announcement is a surprise -- Dudley said this week that the board hadn’t decided on the timing of his retirement -- Looney’s ascent to the top of the company follows a well-trodden path. Dudley’s two immediate predecessors also ran the upstream division before becoming CEO.Deputy CEO Lamar McKay has agreed to take a new role as chief transition officer, supporting the chairman and incoming CEO, BP said in a statement.BP shares in London have increased about 11% in the decade Dudley has been at the helm. They’ve largely recovered from the oil-price collapse that began in 2014, which hit the company just as it was starting to emerge from the impact of the oil spill, adding to Dudley’s challenges as he was forced to cut spending and defer projects.BP rose as much as 1.4% on Friday, and traded up 1.1% at 490.3 pence as of 10:11 a.m. London time.Looney, 49, has run BP’s upstream business since April 2016 and is responsible for all oil and gas exploration, development and production. He has steered the company into new countries including Mauritania and Senegal, and spearheaded the acquisition of U.S. assets from BHP Group Ltd. last year. The Irish executive has touted the benefits of technology in making BP’s operations safer and more efficient.The news “should not come as a surprise to the market given Mr. Looney’s role in modernizing the upstream for BP and driving the digital agenda,” analysts at Barclays Plc said in a note. “It is likely that the appointment of Mr. Looney as CEO may accelerate the journey that BP is on regarding the energy transition.”Profile: An Irish Farmer’s Son Set to Steer BP Through World Wary of OilBP, like all oil majors, is facing severe criticism over its contribution to climate change. While the fossil-fuels business continues to drive profits -- and underpin generous dividends -- climate concerns are increasingly affecting investment decisions. Dudley himself has pushed through plans to sell some oil projects and scale back others to align BP’s operations with the Paris accord.Amoco, TNK-BPIt’s a far cry from his days at U.S. oil giant Amoco Corp., where he started out and later ran its Russian operations before its 1998 acquisition by BP.That experience helped prepare him for a subsequent stint at TNK-BP, the Russian venture forged between BP and a group of billionaires which he led for five tumultuous years in the 2000s. During a bitter battle for control, Dudley survived raids by Vladimir Putin’s secret service, overcame bureaucratic hurdles that barred employees from working and outlasted a no-confidence vote, all before being forced to leave the country in 2008.Already a 30-year veteran of BP by the end of that decade, he was drafted into the top job after a series of missteps by then-CEO Tony Hayward, who faced public anger in the U.S. and criticism from lawmakers over his handling of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.BP’s resilience following the catastrophe was due in large part to Dudley’s deft dealmaking. The American citizen -- BP’s first non-British CEO -- negotiated massive energy deals in India and Russia in the year after the spill, while using BP’s enormous earning power to help make peace with Washington. Even before taking over from Hayward, he helped set up a multibillion-dollar trust fund to compensate individuals and businesses hurt by the accident.“He was instrumental in steadying the ship and rebuilding a top quartile portfolio,” analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said in a note.‘Right’ AppointmentAt the time of the spill, Looney was running BP’s North Sea operations. He flew out to Houston to work on efforts to halt the leak, a time he’s since described as the most challenging of his career. He was subsequently appointed executive vice president of developments and then chief operating officer of production.“Bernard’s appointment is the right one,” the Bernstein analysts said. “We see no radical change in strategy but an incoming CEO who understands his organization, diversity, shareholders, free cash flow and how to make BP investible amid the growing energy-transition concerns.”(Updates with analyst comments starting in 10th paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Kelly Gilblom and Rakteem Katakey.To contact the reporter on this story: Amanda Jordan in London at ajordan11@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-ceo-bob-dudley-step-061904587.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-03	2019-10-03 11:20:54	BP	BP p.l.c.	An Oil Giant Exits the Stage (Pursued by Kids)	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- BP Plc’s embarrassing sacking from its role sponsoring cheap Shakespeare tickets exposes the complicated economics of corporate donations. For a cultural organization, taking money from an oil company today comes with costs that may end up exceeding the sums raised.The Royal Shakespeare Company, based in Stratford-upon-Avon, said on Wednesday that it would “conclude” a partnership with the British oil giant that dates back to 2011 and the cultural celebrations around the London Olympics. BP has been subsidizing tickets at 5 pounds apiece for 16- to 25-year-olds, broadening access to theater beyond those who can afford the often painfully high prices.The RSC explains its decision almost entirely in terms of the views of young people. “Amidst the climate emergency, which we recognize, young people are now saying clearly to us that the BP sponsorship is putting a barrier between them and their wish to engage with the RSC. We cannot ignore that message.”The organization said there were “many fine balances and complex issues involved,” without saying whether it was right or wrong to take money from an oil company. But its decision on BP was driven by commercial, as well as moral, reasons. Schools and young people are a big part of the RSC audience. The company’s “Matilda the Musical” production is a major contributor to its success. It cannot afford adults, influenced by children, choosing to spend their cash elsewhere. Young people are its future full-price audience, and the campaigning against BP was getting noisy.The RSC’s revenue was 86 million pounds ($106 million) last year. Sponsorship — including BP’s — was just 2.6 million pounds of that. Box office receipts accounted for 62% of the total, government funding 17%, with the balance coming mostly from licensing and royalties of RSC intellectual property. The economic power over this organisation is with the audience. For BP and other listed companies, the episode raises questions about their pursuit of non-business goals. Companies have a duty to leave the communities where they operate better off. Two responsibilities matter above all: paying people well and not damaging the environment through what they do.BP supports communities in several ways. It does pay its staff very well. It also gives employees time off to pursue local voluntary work, as it should. Yet its hard to see the imperative for corporate sponsorship beyond that. For starters, donations may prove counterproductive if they put off the recipient’s other sources of funds. Above all, there are other more useful ways BP might spend its cash to help society.Its much bigger and more urgent responsibilities are to the global community. Energy demand is rising yet the world economy needs to shift as soon as it can to net zero greenhouse gas emissions, as the company acknowledges. That requires adapting BP’s business to giving consumers cleaner sources of energy.The savings made from ending the Shakespeare sponsorship will be tiny. But hastening the energy transition is the single most important thing facing this company. There’s no better claim on its budget.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

BP Is Striking Out in a Hotspot for Offshore Oil Exploration	(Bloomberg) -- It was supposed to be BP Plc’s big Brazilian breakthrough after years of setbacks in one of the world’s top destinations for offshore oil.The potential bonanza is still out of reach, two years after the London-based major teamed up with Brazil’s national oil company and a unit of China National Petroleum Corp. to outbid two rival groups for the Peroba deepwater block. Data published by the National Petroleum Agency, or ANP, show the explorers haven’t found the kind of hydrocarbons that bring in money.The first well, which typically costs $90 million to $150 million to drill, encountered only carbon dioxide and natural gas, according to the ANP data. Stand-alone natural gas fields aren’t profitable in Brazil’s deep waters because there aren’t enough pipes to get the molecules to consumers on land. That means Peroba probably won’t deliver riches unless further exploration leads to a large oil discovery.The ANP’s press office confirmed the data and said large accumulations of carbon dioxide are possible in what’s known as the pre-salt region of the deepwater field. BP declined to comment on Peroba, as did CNPC’s office in Rio de Janeiro. State-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the operator, said the results are still being analyzed by the consortium.While the minimum exploration plan was completed with the drilling of the first well, the companies continue to study the area, the Brazilian company said in an emailed response to questions. It declined to comment on the development of stand-alone natural gas fields in the pre-salt area.Focus on Oil“The pre-salt is good, but it’s not a sea of oil; there are still risks,” said Marcelo de Assis, the head of Latin American upstream research for Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Deepwater gas is something that doesn’t work. All the developments are focusing on oil.”Petrobras, which is calling the shots as the operator, has plenty of world class oil projects to keep it busy. A giant natural gas field the company discovered back in 2008 in the same deepwater region hasn’t been developed yet.The intense competition for recent pre-salt blocks means that fields need to be in the 2- to 3-billion-barrel range to be profitable, according to Assis. For smaller discoveries, operators will need to renegotiate the terms or hand them back to regulators, he said.Efforts in VainWhile BP has been investing in Brazil since Petrobras lost its exploration monopoly at the turn of the century, the effort hasn’t delivered production or proven reserves the way it has for European rivals Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Equinor ASA, who took advantage of low oil prices in recent years to buy into existing pre-salt discoveries.BP’s drilling campaign in the 2000s in deep waters off the coast of the Amazon River basin never panned out. In 2011, the company bought a group of assets from Devon Energy Corp. for $3.2 billion. It sold the only producing property for $135 million in 2013, and booked $2.2 billion in Brazil-related write downs from 2013 through 2016. None of its remaining Devon prospects have delivered any production yet.BP’s Top Ten Biggest Finds of the Past Decade(Source: Wood Mackenzie)Still, BP has plenty of chances left in Brazil. In July, the ANP approved an exploration plan for Pau Brasil, a pre-salt prospect that the company acquired in 2018 where it controls operations. It has stakes in 25 blocks in the nation and operates 6 of them, according to its website. And the country has three more deepwater auction rounds scheduled for this year and one of them offers access to proven reserves. BP is among the 14 explorers registered to participate in that auction, the government said Monday in the official gazette.Read more: Oil Rights Worth $26 Billion Up for Grabs in Brazil AuctionBP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley has struck a cautious tone about investing in new rounds, saying earlier this month in a call hosted by JPMorgan Chase & Co., “You have to be careful there” because it’s possible to overpay. “We’ll really have to sharpen our pencil on that one.”His comments track a wider strategic shift at the company. Rather than the old days of pouring endless dollars into the latest exploration hotspot, the company has pared spending. One of its biggest oil finds of the last decade was the result of BP running seismic data on a field it discovered in 1999 through a supercomputer, a vastly cheaper project than drilling a brand new well in an unfamiliar frontier.It’s also shifted focus to so-called advantaged oil projects, which are cheaper to develop, and lower-carbon natural gas. Executives have said since at least 2017 that demands to cut both carbon and costs means some of its oil resources will remain in the ground forever.(Updates with BP registering for Brazilian bid round in 11th paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Peter Millard in Rio de Janeiro at pmillard1@bloomberg.net;Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tina Davis at tinadavis@bloomberg.net, Pratish Narayanan, Simon CaseyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-striking-hotspot-offshore-oil-060000062.html?.tsrc=rss

The European oil & gas sector fell 0.4%, weighing the most on the pan-European STOXX 600 index, which dipped 0.1%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/european-shares-lower-bp-weighs-070336141.html?.tsrc=rss

Sign up here.BP Plc’s CEO plans to sell some oil projects and curb the development of others to align its business with the Paris accord, the latest sign climate concerns are starting to impact the investment decisions of the world’s largest fossil fuel producers.Senior BP executives met within the last few days to discuss how to cut carbon as it grapples with a shareholder resolution requiring the company to explain how its spending is aligned with Paris, Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said on a Wednesday conference call organized by JPMorgan Chase & Co.One proposal weighed up by BP’s management team was exiting the most carbon-intensive projects, though Dudley wouldn’t say which assets were targets because there are “governments and partners involved.”“We are certain we’ve got a path, it may not be linear, to being consistent with Paris goals,” Dudley said in conversation with JPMorgan’s head of European oil research Christyan Malek. “There are going to be projects that we don’t do, things that we might have done in the past. Certain kinds of oil, for example, that have a different carbon footprint.”His comments offer a response to increasingly severe criticism aimed at the entire oil industry over its contribution to man-made climate change. BP’s own shareholders sparred with company managers at its annual general meeting in May, before voting almost unanimously to require the company to issue a report about how each new investment is aligned with Paris. The report will be issued before its next AGM in May 2020.Still, the plan may prompt questions about how selling assets to another producer can help curb global emissions. For example, Dudley said on the call that the sale last month of BP’s oil and gas fields in Alaska helped it reduce its carbon footprint. But the buyer plans to invest more in the fields than BP would have, potentially increasing production and boosting emissions in the process.Dudley also pointed out the main driver of the Alaska sale was the fact those fields were struggling to compete for capital within BP because production there was unlikely to grow as much as at the company’s other projects. Dudley said he is driving down the entire company’s “break-even” point toward $50 a barrel, meaning projects will need to be cheap to stay within BP’s portfolio.Also read: BP Says Some of Its Oil ‘Won’t See the Light of Day’Dudley said he’s juggling with the challenge of investing in relatively low-return renewables businesses while maintaining the company’s large dividend. He took aim at those who didn’t acknowledge how beneficial it is when BP does invest in low-carbon technology, saying any assessment of its carbon footprint should probably include the emissions it avoids.“We’ll reduce the emissions from our operations, reduce the emissions from our products and come up with the new business models,” he said. “If you add all those figures up in reductions of greenhouse gas -- for example, we have a big solar business, a big biofuel, wind business -- you almost get no credit when you do those calculations.”While he has maintained the company’s business model already aligns with the Paris accord, he said having to issue a report to benchmark progress has caused BP to think further about its spending.Carbon TrackerA report by Carbon Tracker last week said BP’s most polluting investments are the Zinia 2 project in Angola and the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli development in Azerbaijan, and that neither are compatible with the Paris goals.“Our strategy is to produce advantaged barrels, which involves considering factors like whether they are economic to produce, low risk to bring to market and lower carbon from an emissions standpoint,” a BP spokeswoman said in response to the Carbon Tracker assessment. These “could help to push other more costly and high-carbon barrels out of the mix, just as gas can help to push coal out of the power mix.”BP is also seeking to divest assets because its debt is too high, Dudley said on the call, constraining his spending power. It has announced about $7 billion of a $10 billion disposal program linked to the purchase of shale fields from BHP Group Ltd. last year. An earlier plan to meet that target by selling older onshore gas fields was complicated by the price of natural gas falling, he said.BP became the operator of the BHP fields in March, which has now caused other complications to the British company’s climate ambitions. Dudley said the level of flaring, the deliberate burning of methane at the place it’s produced, is “not right,” and he is working to reduce it. Earlier this week, the company announced it was adding new equipment to its projects to quantify and identify methane leaks.(Updates with comments on break-even price in seventh paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Helen Robertson, Amanda JordanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-ceo-says-ll-sell-083226509.html?.tsrc=rss

Thanks in part to the generous dividend, I predicted in July that $70 would hold as a floor for Exxon stock.That didn't quite play out, as XOM went to $66, but the dip below $70 - and to a 5%+ yield - proved to be short-lived.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBack at $72, Exxon Mobil stock still looks attractive, but it's not perfect. There are reasons why XOM stock has been dropping for the past five years. And there are plays elsewhere in energy that might be more compelling. XOM still looks like the easiest play in energy. But easiest isn't always the best. The Case for Exxon StockThe case for Exxon stock has two pillars. First, earnings are set to grow sharply over the next few years. CEO Darren Woods said last year that Exxon Mobil would double its profits by 2025.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September The company said in May that the plan remained on track. It noted at its March Investor Day that it could reach those goals with flattish oil prices and even assuming demand was cut to meet climate change targets.The second, related, pillar is that the earnings growth can support continuing increases in the dividend, which can further support Exxon Mobil stock. To be sure, I'm not a fan of buying a stock for its dividend. That's a dangerous play, a lesson learned by shareholders of General Electric (NYSE:GE) and CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL), to name just two.But Exxon Mobil has some internal protections to its earnings thanks to its downstream and chemical operations. When oil prices fall, profits in upstream (exploration and production) drop. But they usually increase elsewhere in the business. Even as oil absolutely collapsed in the middle of the decade, XOM stock held up - and the dividend kept growing.In an environment where 10-year Treasuries yield less than 2%, it's difficult to believe that Exxon can yield 5% or more for very long. Last month's move to under $70, as noted, was short-lived.So Exxon Mobil stock is probably safer than some investors realize. Given its growth potential going forward, it's cheaper than some investors realize. That's a nice combination.And it suggests a path to $100 or more, given plans to move EPS above $8 and the dividend potentially to $4+. Give Exxon a mid-teen P/E multiple or a 4% yield and the stock gains 50% or so from current levels: including dividends, likely double-digit annual returns. The RisksThat said, even if risks are lower here than elsewhere in energy, risks aren't zero. Climate change worries could drive lower energy demand amid both government regulation and changing consumer behavior. It's not just Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) pushing electric vehicles, after all.Lower gasoline demand doesn't send Exxon Mobil profits to zero, as oil has other uses. But it does pressure Exxon Mobil earnings, and thus the XOM stock price.Another factor is the role of ESG (environmental, social and governance) investing. Those funds may avoid Exxon stock, lowering demand in the market and potentially keeping a modest ceiling on performance going forward.Finally, Exxon Mobil has to actually hit its targets - and get some help from oil prices in the process. Lower oil prices, too, don't send Exxon Mobil earnings to zero. But if EPS is $6 in 2025 instead of $8+, Exxon's next five years could look like the last five. Over that time, shareholders have lost about 10% of their investment, even including dividends. The Bottom Line on Exxon StockThe other question is whether there are other more attractive plays in the energy sector. It's worth remembering that the same internal hedge that protects earnings in a lower oil-price scenario also makes  XOM stock a notably poor play on oil prices.Investors bullish on oil should look elsewhere, particularly with prices cheaper across the space. Both Exxon and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have said that they expect shale M&A to continue, after Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) acquired Anadarko Petroleum earlier this year.Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) has been considered a logical acquisition target and is much cheaper after a post-earnings plunge. Other shale plays have fallen steadily since spiking after the Oxy-Anadarko bidding war.Even in integrated oil, there are some intriguing plays. Chevron has been a better stock in recent years. BP (NYSE:BP) has a higher dividend.Again, XOM the simplest play in the space. It's likely, given its dividend, to preserve capital even if oil prices move to a so-called &quot;lower for longer&quot; scenario. But there are intriguing options as well. Oil bulls should look elsewhere. Income investors should take a look at BP. Exxon stock is a good option, but it's likely it won't turn out to be the best one.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-09-03	2019-09-03 15:27:11	BP	BP p.l.c.	7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy	2019 has been a rotten, no-good year for energy stocks. While the stock market as a whole has prospered, energy stocks have missed the boat. The price of crude oil hasn't been particularly favorable and natural gas prices have sunk like a rock. On top of that, investors have been favoring growth while shying away from value stocks. This has left the energy sector orphaned; in fact, energy's share of the S&P 500 has fallen to its lowest level in many years.For investors willing to buy what others are selling, however, energy stocks offer many rewards here. For one, these are the stocks to buy now if you want strong dividend yields. Across the sector, leading energy firms are offering their highest dividend yields in decades. This, while rates on fixed income in general have plummeted.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now Additionally, expect a wave of M&A to help reignite interest in the energy stocks. For example, Blackstone (NYSE:BX) just announced a takeover for pipeline operator Tallgrass Energy (NYSE:TGE). That led to a 35% surge for TGE stock last Wednesday. And as we'll see, that's not the only dealmaking activity going on in the sector right now. With everyone abandoning energy stocks, this could be the time to take advantage of the general pessimism.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Energy Stocks to Buy: BP (BP)Source: AVM Images / Shutterstock.com Tallgrass wasn't the only company making headlines this week. BP (NYSE:BP) also caused a stir with its announcement that it is selling its Alaskan oil interests to Hilcorp, a privately-owned company. Hilcorp will pay BP $5.6 billion; $4 billion of that goes to BP immediately, and Hilcorp will deliver the rest gradually in coming years.It seems that BP drove a fair bargain. Its Alaskan properties produce roughly 74,000 barrels of oil a day, and have been declining in production in recent years. Figuring an average oil price in the low $50s per barrel, Alaska was generating around $1.4 billion annually for BP in revenues. Thus, it sold a mature oil field for around 4x annual revenues, even given the poor industry sentiment at the moment.Additionally, this sale helps with BP's promised transformation. BP said that it will divest $10 billion in assets as it transitions to more growth and green energy opportunities. With this deal, they have now reached more than half of their overall target.Management is delivering on its corporate strategy. The asset sales also help strengthen the balance sheet. This should give investors more confidence in BP's gigantic 6.71% dividend yield. In a market starved for yield, it's hard to think BP stock will stay unloved for too long. ExxonMobil (XOM)Source: Michael Gordon / Shutterstock.com Speaking of dividend yields, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is another income champion that the market is paying no respect right now. ExxonMobil has raised its dividend for 36 consecutive years, making it one of the few companies to manage that feat. Incredibly, it was able to keep raising its dividend even through the oil and gasoline price doldrums in the late 1990s. The great financial crisis didn't break its streak either.XOM stock is now offering a 5.1% dividend yield. That's amazing; it's the most that ExxonMobil has offered since 1990. Particularly with interest rates plunging ever lower, XOM stock is a fantastic alternative to bank CDs or government bonds yielding 2% or less.Is the dividend sustainable? Yes. In fact, ExxonMobil still has one of the highest-quality balance sheets in corporate America and is rated a sterling AA+. Even with the slump in oil and natural gas prices, ExxonMobil has still been able to cover its dividend payments out of free cash flow.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off And after years of lying low, XOM is pushing the accelerator. It has plans to double its earnings and cash flow over the next five years or so. While the competition has had to retrench due to the slump in energy, ExxonMobil is ready to pick up the slack. With a huge new oil field coming online soon in Guyana, ExxonMobil is prepared for the next decade and more. Throw in any recovery in oil prices, and XOM stock should soar. Suncor (SU)Source: Shutterstock A lot of investors, Americans in particular, have some faulty perceptions of the Canadian oil sands. Often disparagingly called &quot;tar sands,&quot; oil sands -- primarily located in the province of Alberta -- are an emerging power play in global crude oil production. Many years ago, this type of production was extremely expensive and damaging to the environment. Over the years, however, operators have gotten much better on both fronts.Oil sands are now one of the cheapest sources of crude in North America. There's still another issue, however. The oil sands have huge upfront development costs to launch production. That's in stark contrast to, say, fracking another well in the Permian in Texas. Some investors have been put off on oil sands projects because of these capital costs.Here's the thing they're missing: When you drill a new well in the Permian, for example, most of the production comes within the first couple years. By year ten or so of operation, that well will be kicking out only a few barrels of oil a day. Thus, for frackers, it's a constant and expensive treadmill to keep production rolling. With the oil sands, however, once it's built, you can produce for decades at a low cost. Your production doesn't fall off a cliff -- rather you get stable sweet returns for many years.Suncor (NYSE:SU) has become the leader in this space in Canada. It has several other attractive features as well. The most important right now is that it is integrated; it has a ton of gasoline refining capacity as well. This allows Suncor to earn far higher prices for its oil than other Western Canadian operators who are dealing with a glut of oil locally.It's possible that upcoming elections will deliver a more pro-energy government in Canada, making way for more pipelines. Until then, however, Suncor, with its refining and decades of cheap oil reserves, is a standout pick for its refining edge. SU stock currently yields 4.53%, making it one of the better options in the energy stocks space. Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)Source: Shutterstock Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) is another big player in oil sands, although it has oil operations around the world in addition to its Canadian holdings.The firm just made a huge power play, buying up $2.8 billion of oil sands assets from Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). This deal appears to have been an absolute steal. Bankers estimated that Devon could fetch up to $5 billion for these assets; Canadian Natural grabbed them for barely half of that.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week Canadian Natural doesn't have the same refining capacity as Suncor, however it has a huge asset base and nice diversity across its operations. At a $27 billion market cap, CNQ stock is also a huge player in Canada. When money comes flowing back into Canadian shares and the energy stocks in particular, CNQ stock should catch a solid bid. In the meantime, it also offers a generous 4.88% dividend yield. Enbridge (ENB)Source: Shutterstock Speaking of unloved Canadian stocks, let's turn our attention to pipeline giant Enbridge (NYSE:ENB). Enbridge is right up there with Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) among the big midstream energy players. Unlike Kinder Morgan, Enbridge is not as popular with American investors; the company doesn't have the same sort of promotional management style you get from Rich Kinder. Nor has Enbridge made a history of big dividend hikes followed by painful dividend cuts.By contrast, Enbridge has built a reputation for stability, and has become a Canadian blue chip stock. ENB stock offers a current dividend yield of more than 6.5%. And unlike so many energy stocks, Enbridge offers a rock-solid yield. Even despite the difficult operating environment, the company is still able to grow its cash flow by around 5% per year, paving the way for more dividend increases in the future.Additionally, with 93% of its customers having investment-grade credit ratings, Enbridge has a quality group of clients using its pipelines and thus is largely insulated from more bankruptcies in the E&P space. Schlumberger (SLB)Source: Shutterstock Benjamin Graham, who is widely considered to be the &quot;father of value investing&quot; recommended an interesting strategy for profits in beaten down sectors. He said investors should look at the industry and find the biggest firm that has a strong balance sheet. That way, you know that your investment will survive the down cycle and perhaps even benefit as smaller competition goes bust. Then, when the cycle turns upward, you'll be poised to capture huge gains.With oil services, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is that company today. Schlumberger has a long and storied history of shareholder value creation. Its stock soared from a split-adjusted $12 in 1995 to as high as $140 in 2014. Since then, with the plunge in oil prices, SLB stock has gotten hammered as well; it's down 75% to around $32 today.  * 7 'Strong Buy' Stocks to Beat Volatility However, much of Schlumberger's competition has already gone bankrupt or is on life support at this point. Meanwhile, Schlumberger remains the global leader in its field, continues to generate profits even during these hard times, and offers a 6.3% dividend yield. When oil booms again, Schlumberger could make it all the way back to its old high of $140 per share; even this past October, it traded at $62, making the current $32 price quite a discount. Cullen/Frost Bankers (CFR)Source: Shutterstock You might be asking what a banking stock like Cullen/Frost Bankers (NYSE:CFR) is doing on a list of energy stocks to buy. That's a fair question. Cullen/Frost, however, is no ordinary bank. It's focused on the Texas economy and has substantial direct exposure to energy loans.The San Antonio-based bank, in fact, has all 134 of its branches and more than 1,300 ATMs located within Texas. On every earnings call, management devotes substantial time talking about the health of the Texas economy. Given its reliance on energy companies in Houston and fracking in West Texas, the local economy is heavily levered to oil. As a result, investors absolutely pummeled CFR stock in 2015 and 2016 when oil dropped.CFR stock plummeted from $80 to $45 during that oil crash. Despite that, Cullen/Frost's loan losses barely went up, and the bank came through unscathed. In fact, it has gone through a ton of obstacles without harm; it was the only major Texas bank to survive that state's massive bust in the 1980s oil collapse. On top of that, Cullen/Frost kept raising the dividend even during the financial crisis which took out so many banks. In 2016, after investors gave up on CFR stock, it soared back from $45 to $120 as oil prices normalized.However, with energy in retreat again, CFR has plunged back to $80 a share. At just 12x forward earnings, it is trading well below its normal valuation. The stock is also yielding more than 3.5%. It could come flying back up in a hurry -- as it did in 2017 -- once the tide turns for oil, gas, and the Texas economy.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned shares of BP, CNQ, XOM, SLB, and ENB.

2019-09-02	2019-09-02 12:16:27	BP	BP p.l.c.	Can These 3 Oil Giants Survive the Latest Round of Tariffs?	The trade war with China is waging on, with the latest escalation coming on September 1 as the U.S. began imposing 15% tariffs on some Chinese goods. On the same day, China started targeting U.S. crude with a 5% tariff being placed on oil imports. Following the escalation, the Crude Oil WTI Futures fell 0.15% to $55.02 by 7:24 AM ET on September 2. &quot;Economic uncertainty will continue to dominate the oil market’s agenda as new U.S. and China trade measures come into effect,&quot; said head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA Harry Tchilinguirian. With this in mind, investors have expressed concerns as to whether 3 of the largest players in the space will be able to survive the latest round of tariffs in the ongoing trade war.Let’s take a closer look to see if analysts believe these 3 oil giants can emerge from this trade war escalation unscathed. Chevron Corporation (CVX)With shares down almost 3% in the month following its August 2 Q2 earnings release, investors are worried that the situation won’t improve thanks to the new tariffs. However, one analyst argues that Chevron’s commitment to improving key areas of its business will keep it on the path towards long-term growth. After hosting investor meetings with CFO Pierre Breber, Cowen & Co. analyst Jason Gabelman believes CVX has made substantial progress in its efforts to improve its return on capital employed (ROCE) with its plan to increase activity in the Permian basin. This is on top of the 5% to 8% year-over-year ROCE improvement it already saw in 2018. CVX has also taken steps to reduce execution and financial risk by limiting simultaneous major capital projects. Gabelman adds that Chevron’s approach to corporate responsibility makes it an attractive buy. “On environmental, social and governance (ESG), Mr. Breber highlighted a tension between managing fiduciary duty with societal responsibility. The company will not invest in a business where it does not have a competitive advantage, but understands it needs to be part of the energy future and is taking other steps such as reducing methane emissions,” the analyst explained. Based on all of the above factors, the analyst reiterated his Buy rating and $140 price target on August 30. Gabelman thinks share prices could surge 19% over the next twelve months. All in all, the Street agrees with Gabelman. CVX boasts a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and a $143 average price target, suggesting 21% upside potential.    Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM)Since its August 2 Q2 earnings release, Exxon has been faring even worse than Chevron with shares falling about 5% in the last month. In spite of this, a few analysts say this oil stock is worth the risk.Exxon is one of the largest energy companies in the world with a market cap of $290 billion. It also doesn’t hurt that it sports a strong balance sheet, with long-term debt at less than 10% of the capital structure and has a 5% yield which falls at high end of the company's historical range.The company has a diverse product pipeline that includes upstream (drilling), midstream (pipeline) and downstream (refining and chemicals). To expand this even more, XOM plans to spend $35 billion per year on various growth projects through 2025. Management claims these efforts are already paying off. “We continue to make significant progress toward delivering our long-term growth plans. Our new U.S. Gulf Coast steam cracker is exceeding design capacity by 10 percent, less than a year after startup,” CEO Darren Woods stated.Some members of the Street have cited the weakness in its downstream and chemicals segments as a cause for concern. In Q2, income generated by both fell well below consensus estimates. That being said, Merrill Lynch analyst Doug Leggate stated that Exxon still has a lot to brag about. “Exxon clearly faced headwinds throughout the first half of 2019, but we believe it is a top pick within the major oil group based on its attractive valuation versus the stock's fair value of $100 per share, a dividend yield of 4.5% affords investors to wait and a growth story that's now starting to play out,” he explained. As a result, Leggate reiterated his Buy rating and $100 price target on August 5. The analyst’s price target indicates share prices can soar 46% in the next twelve months.  In general, Wall Street is less bullish on this oil stock. XOM has a ‘Hold’ analyst consensus as well as an $81 average price target, implying 18% upside potential.  BP plc (BP)The last oil stock on our list is also down in the month following its Q2 earnings release on July 30. In the last month, shares have fallen almost 4%. However, analysts still believe that there’s plenty of upside to be had, with BP boasting more double that of CVX and XOM.According to management, BP is “right on target” at the midpoint of its five year growth plan. The company was able to post an underlying replacement cost profit, a proxy for net profit, of $2.8 billion, compared to the $2.5 billion consensus estimate. The beat was driven by solid upstream production of 2,625K Boep/d (not including Rosneft production of 1,127 K Boep/d), up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.Adding to the good news, BP is expanding its products to include more sustainable forms of energy. The company is making large investments into renewable energy and has even agreed to pay incentives for 36,000 employees to further reduce its operational emissions.As part of its efforts to explore other opportunities, BP announced that it had sold its Alaska operations to Hilcorp Energy Co. for $5.6 billion on August 29, allowing it to increase its focus on shale.Based on all of these positive developments, BMO Capital analyst Daniel Boyd initiated his BP coverage with a Buy and set a $53 price target on August 20. He thinks the stock price could rise 44% over the next twelve months. BP boasts a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus as well as a $53 average price target, implying 43% upside.

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 14:00:36	BP	BP p.l.c.	10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond	[Editor's note: &quot;10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond&quot; was previously published in July 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]It's not terribly easy out there for income investors at the moment. Dividend stocks to buy are tough to find. Equity markets are near all-time highs, meaning valuations are stretched -- and dividend yields are lower. Treasury yields have fallen amid expectations for a Fed rate cut: getting income from bonds is no easy task, either.Many longtime dividend growth stalwarts -- think McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) or Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) -- trade at or near all time highs. Those that aren't seem to be struggling, with the likes of General Electric (NYSE:GE), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), and Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) all cutting their dividends in recent years. Finding the middle ground -- an attractive valuation combined with a solid business -- is exceedingly difficult right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGiven lower commissions, investors can sell off small parts of their holdings for income -- most of which should have appreciated nicely in this decade-long bull market. But income investors usually are looking for &quot;set it and forget it&quot; dividend stocks to buy, not constant portfolio trading.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income These 10 stocks don't quite qualify as &quot;set it and forget it&quot; plays. All have some degree of risk. But the risks seem worth taking for the potential rewards, which include near-term income, longer-term growth, and potential capital appreciation. As such, investors should take at least a long look at these 10 dividend plays. Broadcom (AVGO)Dividend Yield: 3.85%Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) requires quite a bit of trust in management. The semiconductor giant has been built through acquisitions. As of late, AVGO has started moving away from chips and into software.Last year, the company acquired CA Technologies, an enterprise software play with a big presence in mainframe applications. Broadcom has bought  security play Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC).Investors haven't particularly liked either deal. AVGO stock fell on the news of the CA deal. It  slipped again as reports of the Symantec acquisition leaked. But CEO Hock Tan certainly deserves the benefit of the doubt at this point. And the decline after the CA announcement, in particular, proved a buying opportunity: before the recent pullback, AVGO shares had risen some 50% in roughly a year.AVGO may not provide that type of return over the next year -- but there's still a nice bull case here on another merger-related dip. AVGO yields 3.85%. The Symantec deal will add to the company's significant free cash flow, which keeps that yield secure. Diversification in the existing chip business limits the cyclical impact on earnings -- and AVGO shares. Investors do have to trust Hock Tan at this point -- but history shows they probably should. Kellogg (K)Dividend Yield: 3.7%On its face, Kellogg (NYSE:K) seems like a safe value play for income investors. Shares of the iconic American company trade for just 15x 2020 EPS estimates. Kellogg's dividend yields just under 4%. K historically has been a defensive stock, providing protection if the broader economy stumbles.But K stock is actually dangerous at this point. It's one of many consumer stocks struggling to adapt to a new reality, as I detailed last year. Grocers like Kroger (NYSE:KR) are looking to private-label and own brands to protect their thin margins. Cereal demand is falling. As a result, Kellogg's earnings are heading in the wrong direction.Revenue is guided to increase just 1%-2% this year excluding the impact of currency and the company's divestiture of several smaller brands. Adjusted operating income, on the same basis, is expected to be roughly flat. Guidance suggests overall non-GAAP earnings per share will decline more than 10% year-over-year.In other words, Kellogg isn't a defensive stock at this point. It's a turnaround play. And like with KHC and BUD, that creates downside risk if the turnaround stumbles.For investors who understand the risks, however, K stock is intriguing. As Barron's detailed last month, the company's Morningstar Farms business seems notably undervalued. It's larger by revenue than Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), which has soared to a $10 billion market cap. Kellogg is valued at just $21 billion; a sale or IPO of Morningstar could unlock significant value.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income Again, this is not the traditional, low-risk, dividend stock it used to be. But if Kellogg can jumpstart growth and monetize Morningstar, K stock could have enormous upside ahead. Gap (GPS)Dividend Yield: 6.2%The case for Gap (NYSE:GPS), particularly with the stock near a seven-year low, is that investors are missing the real story here. As I wrote back in November, Gap stock isn't about its Gap brand; it's about Old Navy, which likely generates somewhere in the range of three-quarters of operating profit.With Gap planning to spin off Old Navy later this year, that value might be unlocked. In the meantime, GPS stock yields 6.2%, a figure that might rise after the split.There are risks here, to be sure. Luke Lango called GPS stock one of the six worst in the S&P 500 in the first half -- and he's not wrong. GPS shares have plunged.Old Navy's sales performance recently has not been particularly impressive. Sales for the Gap brand continue to decline. In fact, analysts asked repeatedly on the Q1 conference call if the spin-off would still move forward: there's a risk that Gap and Banana Republic might not be enough to support a standalone company, even with growth from athleisure concept Athleta.Even a weaker-than-expected Old Navy still likely supports the entire valuation of GPS stock at the moment. The balance sheet is in good shape, and free cash flow continues to be impressive. Income investors can get yield now -- and if all goes well, by next year own growth at Old Navy and income from the company's other brands. SL Green (SLG)Dividend Yield: 4.4%REITs (real estate investment trusts) like SL Green (NYSE:SLG) long have been income investors favorites. REITs allow for diversified exposure to real estate. They offer tax benefits as well: as long as they pay out 90% of taxable income, they pay no tax at the corporate level.In an environment where 10-year Treasury bonds are yielding less than 1.5%, however, investors looking for dividend stocks to buy have the same difficulty in REITs as in the rest of the market. High-yield REITs generally have some flaws; most notably, even the best retail REITs like Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) and Macerich (NYSE:MAC) have struggled amid long-term concerns about demand. The more attractive plays, meanwhile, have been bid up as investors look for lower-risk yield.SL Green might be a nice middle ground. The stock has struggled for years now; in fact, it touched a five-year low late last year. Worries about the health of New York City real estate seem to be the culprit. Weakness in the company's suburban assets hasn't helped, either.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income But SL Green largely has exited the suburban business, refocusing on Manhattan. The dividend continues to rise. And longer-term, NYC still seems an attractive real estate market. With a 4.4% dividend, SLG provides attractive income. At 12x FFO (funds from operations, a typical REIT metric), it could provide upside as well if sentiment toward Manhattan real estate improves. Avista (AVA)Dividend Yield: 3.3%Utility stocks like Avista (NYSE:AVA) are another common area of focus for income investors. And like REITs, valuation is a question mark: AVA has risen 12% in three months, a big move for a utility.But AVA looks like one of the more attractive picks in the industry at the moment. The stock plunged late last year after a potential acquisition by Canada's Hydro One (OTCMKTS:HRNNF) was called off. Slowly but surely, however, dip-buyers have entered -- and there could be more buying ahead.Avista provides a solid 3.3% dividend yield. Its markets in Washington State, Idaho, and Montana are seeing strong population growth. Valuation is reasonable, and AVA still sits back at 2016 levels.It's likely the Hydro One deal -- announced in 2017 -- led to some dislocation among Hydro One's investor base. If that's the case, there's an opportunity for AVA to catch up to the rest of its sector as income investors return to the story. International Game Technology (IGT)Dividend Yield: 6.8%The risks facing International Game Technology (NYSE:IGT) are almost self-evident. Gaming stocks traditionally struggle in recessions. Suppliers like IGT generally aren't hit quite as hard, and the company's lottery business should provide support if the economy turns. But there is a decent amount of cyclical risk here.A good chunk of the company's profit comes from Italy, where economic growth has been stagnant and political risk seems high. The U.S. slot business has lost market share to smaller operators like Aristocrat Leisure (OTCMKTS:ARLUF) and PlayAGS (NYSE:AGS). On top of all that, IGT has nearly $8.5 billion in debt. The 6% yield here is attractive -- but on its own not reason enough to buy IGT stock.That said, there are reasons to buy, and in fact I personally own IGT shares. Free cash flow should ramp in the next two years, as the company moves past upfront payments required to maintain its concessions in Italy. The lottery business throws off cash as well. Debt should come down, and the U.S. slot business is showing signs of improvement.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income The rewards here are enormous as well. As I wrote last month, Wall Street sees huge upside for IGT. The average target price near $21 is 56% higher than IGT's current price. If IGT can get the U.S. business back on track and use the cash flow from Italy to pay down debt, its stock could have a big move ahead. State Street (STT)Dividend Yield: 3.8%State Street (NYSE:STT) is a clear &quot;value trap or value play?&quot; argument at the moment. For the last year, investors have made their thoughts clear: STT stock has dropped by roughly 45%.And State Street is fighting headwinds. The company rolled out the first ETF -- the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) -- but has since been passed by Vanguard and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in that key business. The same shift to passive investing driving ETF growth has pressured the company's asset management business. In Q1, fee revenue declined 4% year-over-year; earnings per share declined 27%.Cost-cutting simply hasn't done quite enough to protect margins, leading to the recent pressure on STT stock. But at this point, there's a question as to whether the sell-off simply has gone too far. STT stock is quite cheap, at a price-earnings ratio of nine.Meanwhile, a recent dividend hike moves the yield near 4%, and STT will repurchase $2 billion worth of stock as well. State Street has to find a way to manage pressure on its custody and management businesses -- but if it can, there's potential for a big reversal in STT stock. CVS Health (CVS)Dividend Yield: 3.4%Source: Shutterstock CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) has had a rough go of it in recent years. In March, CVS stock touched its lowest level in almost six years, and it has re-tested those lows several times since. The acquisition of Aetna is under review even after it closed. Lower reimbursement rates and reduced savings on generic drugs are pressuring the entire pharmacy sector: rivals Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) are struggling as well.But as I wrote previously,  at least some extent all of those headwinds seem priced in. CVS stock trades at historically low multiples. There are still benefits to come from the company's efforts to change healthcare, and the integration of Aetna with its existing pharmacy business.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income The headwinds are real, and the selloff in CVS stock does make some sense. But this remains an attractive business that is now priced for steady declines going forward. It will take little in the way of an upside surprise for CVS to outperform expectations -- and for CVS stock to claw back at least some of its recent losses. BP (BP)Dividend Yield: 6.7%For BP (NYSE:BP), the case is reasonably simple. BP is the integrated energy company with the best dividend yield, which currently nears 7%. With liabilities relating to the Deepwater Horizon tragedy finally behind the company, cash flow and earnings will improve as BP gets back to &quot;normal.&quot;That's a case I've made for some eighteen months now -- and it still holds. Oil price movements might seem a risk -- but BP's downstream businesses benefit from lower crude prices, which mitigates that effect somewhat. In this market, BP stock might even be considered among the safer plays out there, as counterintuitive as that sounds. For a nearly 7% yield the modest risks here seem worth taking. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)Dividend Yield: 3.4%Pharmaceutical companies, too, used to be a safe haven for income investors. They generally offered dividend yields of at least 2% -- and protection from market and economic downturns. That's no longer the case, however -- which highlights the potential risk in Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY).U.S. companies, in particular, have struggled to find blockbusters. As a result, patent expirations on key product lead companies to search for growth however it can be found. For Bristol-Myers Squibb, products like Orencia (which treats rheumatoid arthritis) and blood thinner Eliquis are losing their protection shortly. And so the company went and acquired biotechnology major Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG).Unfortunately for BMY stock, investors hated the deal. BMY shares dropped in its wake. They liked it less when Bristol-Myers announced last month that it would divest psoriasis treatment Otezla as required by regulators. BMY once again threatened a six-year low.But at this point, BMY is starting to look attractive. Even if the company overpaid for Celgene, to some extent that's baked into the stock price. The dividend yield now sits at 3.6% -- and could rise once the acquisition is completed. A 10x forward P/E multiple will come down as well.Pharma stocks are riskier than they used to be -- especially for those using debt to drive growth. Mallinckrodt (NYSE:MNK) is a good example of how pharmaceutical M&A can go terribly wrong. But Bristol-Myers Squibb's diversified base and long history suggest the downside shouldn't be that steep. And as Celgene comes on board and growth returns, investors might again start focusing on the potential rewards.As of this writing, Vince Martin is long shares of Gap Inc. and International Game Technology.

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 13:45:13	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP Exits Alaska After 60 Years in Sale to Hilcorp	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc agreed to sell its entire business in Alaska to closely held Hilcorp Energy Co. for $5.6 billion, ending a six-decade presence in the state as oil production there declines.The deal includes BP’s operating stake in Prudhoe Bay, the largest-producing oil field in U.S. history, as well as all its Alaskan pipelines. It makes Hilcorp, the oil company founded by Texas billionaire Jeffery Hildebrand, the second-largest producer in the state behind ConocoPhillips.It’s the latest example of a supermajor retiring from the frontier oil discoveries of the late 20th century that cushioned them from OPEC’s ascendancy and forced them to learn to drill in some of the harshest and most forbidding corners of the globe.Alaska, like Canada’s oil sands and the North Sea, is receding into a second-tier oil province as field depletion, cost-cutting and the rise of shale diminish the appeal of those resources.The state’s oil output has slumped from its heyday in the late 1980s as discoveries dried up and major producers sought easier-to-produce crude elsewhere, most recently from shale rock in Texas. Hilcorp, along with ConocoPhillips, is one of the few big oil companies still interested in investing fresh capital in the state, which is home to protected ecosystems.BP’s announcement on Tuesday surprised the market, with the divestment “proving that no asset is sacred even if it is 60 years old and synonymous” with the company, said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. “We see the transaction as a positive catalyst, which should help the shares recover lost ground this year.”BP has declined more than 10% in the past four months amid weakening oil prices. The stock rose as much as 1.8% in London on Wednesday, and traded up 1.7% at 496.35 pence as of 9:29 a.m. local time.The disposal includes BP’s stake in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which has been running below capacity for years as oil production in the state has declined.Wood Mackenzie Ltd. values the BP assets at a “slight premium” to the $5.6 billion purchase price, almost a third of which will be paid subject to production over time. But for BP the sale is strategic, as it shifts more toward shale basins and natural gas. It also accounts for the majority of its two-year, $10 billion divestment plan.“The Alaska transaction puts BP in a good position to reach its divestiture target,” Jason Gammel, an analyst at Jefferies LLC, said in a note. “The transaction is expected to close in 2020 and the upfront cash would reduce BP’s gearing by 2 percentage points.”Hilcorp’s ReachIn the past five years, Hilcorp has bought more than $6 billion of oil and gas assets, and produced about 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day of liquids, according to its website. The company in 2017 acquired assets in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico for $3 billion, and has holdings in Wyoming and Alaska.Prudhoe Bay has produced about 13 billion barrels over its life and has a further 1 billion barrels of potential, BP said.“Our production estimates for Alaska upstream are declining by about 5% to 7% per annum,” Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Europe Ltd., said in a note. “This deal highlights that it remains a buyers’ market for upstream assets, and big price tags require selling high-quality assets such as this one.”Exxon Mobil Corp. may be next to sell Alaskan assets, according to Wood Mackenzie. The oil major wants to raise $15 billion from sales globally by the end of 2021. In the past few years Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and Marathon Oil Corp. have sold out of the state, according to Wood Mackenzie.Alaska’s annual production peaked at 2 million barrels a day in 1988, the year before the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Last year, it averaged 479,000 barrels a day.The U.S. Interior Department is preparing to sell drilling rights in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge later this year. The refuge’s coastal plain, known as the 1002 area, is thought to contain billions of barrels of oil, but tapping it was off-limits for decades until 2017, when Congress ordered the government to sell drilling rights there under the premise it would raise money to offset tax cuts.BP was one of the original partners in building the 800-mile (1,300-kilometer) Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in 1977, designed to bring oil from the North Slope to the port of Valdez on Alaska’s southern coast. It was one of the largest privately funded construction projects in history. BP holds a 49% stake in the pipeline, with ConocoPhillips, Exxon and Unocal Pipeline Co. holding the remainder.(Corrects company name in 14th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Rachel Adams-Heard, Jennifer A.

BP Redraws Its American Map in Historic Shift South From Alaska	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc has closed one chapter in its U.S. business, exiting Alaska decades after transforming the state into an oil powerhouse. Now it’s time for a new phase in the company’s American story.The old BP, which discovered billions of barrels of oil on the country’s farthest frontier and laid an 800-mile pipeline across the frozen tundra, is fading. The new BP comes with a fresh focus on the fast and competitive shale business, and going high-tech to squeeze all the barrels it can out of existing fields.This future is designed to fulfill two mandates from investors: generate lots of cash, and steer clear of high-carbon oil reserves.“We are steadily reshaping BP,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in the statement announcing the sale of its Alaska business for $5.6 billion. “Today we have other opportunities, both in the U.S. and around the world, that are more closely aligned with our long-term strategy and more competitive for our investment.”Deep WaterSome of those opportunities are obvious. For example, BP has put its supercomputers to work analyzing seismic data on existing fields in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, a cheap and low-risk way to find extra resources.At its Thunder Horse project, the work helped it discover about 1 billion extra barrels of oil, and it approved a major expansion of the field in May which will add 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent to daily production starting in 2021. That’s an estimated one-third of what BP loses in output by selling its Alaska assets, according to an analysis by RBC Capital Markets.Other offshore projects in the U.S. will use BP’s existing platforms to “tie back” new oil and gas fields from more remote parts of the Gulf. The company plans to expand the Atlantis facility and could possibly tie new fields to its Na Kika platform. That’s a stark difference from the type of work BP did before the 2014 oil price crash, where it spurned incremental discoveries in favor of developing large fields known as “elephants.”Shale GrowthBP’s new onshore business is more challenging. While the entire world of energy has been upended by surging production out of America’s shale rock, the geology is nothing like the iconic Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska, which still forms the bulk of the company’s output there after its discovery in the 1960s. Shale wells deplete rapidly, meaning the business is more about drilling lots of wells as efficiently as possible, rather than finding the right spot and watching the cash flow for decades.Even so, BP has bet big on shale, spending $10.5 billion to buy a suite of onshore assets from BHP Group Ltd. It started operating the fields and pipelines earlier this year and plans to double its drilling capacity in the Permian Basin in West Texas in the coming years, according to Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary.U.S. shale “has been a prolific growth story,” Gilvary said in an interview on Bloomberg TV earlier this month.BP’s sale of its Alaska business was done partly to chase that growth. The British oil major took on debt to cover the BHP purchase, and said it would sell $10 billion of assets by the end of next year to reduce leverage. Offloading the mature, declining Alaska business is the most significant announcement related to that target so far.Carbon ConsiderationsWhile BP’s moves in the U.S. are highly symbolic, given its 60-year history in Alaska, it also reflects something bigger than America. Shareholders aren’t just demanding low-cost barrels, but low-carbon ones too, as they anticipate governments imposing harsher rules on the energy business to mitigate the risks of climate change.BP faced a shareholder resolution in May that asked it to outline how each individual investment decision aligns with the goals of the Paris climate accord. It was passed nearly unanimously and also supported by management.BP’s shale assets will produce far more natural gas -- a fuel emits less carbon dioxide than oil when burned -- than its Alaska operations. The onshore business is also close to the liquefied natural gas export facilities on the Gulf coast, which BP employs in its growing trading business.Back in July, before the Alaska deal, BP acknowledged some of its existing discoveries could be too costly or too high-carbon to develop. The company would either have to sell those assets, or leave the hydrocarbons in the ground, said Dominic Emery, its head of strategy.To contact the reporter on this story: Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Will KennedyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-redraws-american-map-historic-095905721.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 07:00:10	BP	BP p.l.c.	BP's Alaska Exit Is a Sign of Oil's Times	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There goes the other pipeline. Back in the day, BP Plc was sometimes dismissed as a “two-pipelines company.” This referred to two of its biggest positions: The Forties field and pipeline system in the North Sea and the Trans Alaska Pipeline bringing oil south from the Prudhoe Bay wells in Alaska. Forties was sold off in 2003 (the field) and 2017 (the pipes). Now, BP is leaving Alaska.In some respects, the $5.6 billion sale of the company’s Alaska portfolio is par for the course. BP has been selling assets for much of this decade in order to fund compensation and reshape the business after 2010’s Macondo blowout. More generally, selling mature oil and gas fields to smaller, independent companies planning to squeeze out more is a standard part of the development cycle. In 2003, Apache Corp. took Forties; the Alaska sale is to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co. To be an oil major is to be constantly ranking projects in terms of potential and deciding if you’re better off keeping them or flogging them.Yet the symbolism is inescapable. Alaska is embedded deeply in BP’s history and identity. Former CEO Lord John Browne, who led the late 20th-century mega-mergers that transformed BP from a two-pipeline company, kicked off his career there in 1969, just after BP struck oil. One of those big deals he ended up doing, the $33 billion acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co. in 2000, was predicated in part on consolidating BP’s position in Alaska – only for antitrust regulators to force the sale of those particular assets to Phillips Petroleum Co. (now ConocoPhillips).Back then, BP was on the hunt for “elephants,” or giant oil and gas fields that typically took many years – and country-sized balance sheets – to develop. Hence Browne’s acquisition spree.The world has moved on. While producers still relish big discoveries, the intervening boom and bust in oil prices has made investors leery of big-ticket investments and more demanding in terms of payouts. Apart from, by and large, holding capex budgets in check, oil majors have been retreating from traditional strongholds, with Royal Dutch Shell Plc virtually leaving the Canadian oil sands, Chevron Corp. recently exiting the U.K. North Sea and Exxon Mobil Corp. putting its Norwegian assets up for sale. BP put its own Norwegian business into a joint venture in 2016.Meanwhile, they have been diverting cash to dividends and buybacks in order to keep investors onside – BP’s stock yields almost 7% – as well as directing more of their capex to shorter-cycle shale development.BP paid BHP Group Plc $10.5 billion in cash for its shale assets last year. Besides reducing BP’s leverage at a dicey time for oil prices, the Alaska deal can be seen as swapping out of an old, conventional position to help fund expansion in unconventional oil and gas. In that sense, selling Alaska throws the spotlight on these new assets where, like several of its peers, BP is trying to prove that the majors’ scale – which worked in such places as Alaska – can also be an advantage in shale.Alaska is viewed by some as a growth area, particularly – with grim irony – as climate change and the energy-dominance aspirations of the current U.S. administration open up more of it for potential development. However, as a sensitive, remote and challenging environment, it carries extra risks and costs for producers, including the potential for future administrations to restrict activity there again. The state’s oil boom truly began when the panic of the 1973 oil shock swept aside opposition to the construction of the Trans Alaska Pipeline. Its future from here will be shaped at least in part by the challenges of excess oil and associated emissions.Faced with this much change and the need to adapt, there really can be no sacred cash cows.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

Precious metal.Gold and silver continue to press higher, with both metals making multi-year highs on Tuesday. Specifically, gold futures hit a six-year high, while silver prices hit their highest levels in more than two years.Given the macro environment right now, the momentum in the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD) and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSEARCA:SLV) is no surprise. Recession worries are climbing, sending investors scrambling for safe-haven assets. Further, with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, the dollar should be pressured. A weak dollar is good for commodities. Movers in the Stock Market TodayYesterday we reported on some rumblings about possible merger talks between Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) and Altria (NYSE:MO). On Tuesday, the former confirmed that it is indeed the case. The talks are reportedly for an all-stock deal, provided both shareholder bases support it. The tricky part may be getting regulators to approve it, though.After falling 4% on Monday, PM stock was down another 7.7% Tuesday. Altria initially jumped 8% on the news, but ended the day lower, down 4%.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow BP (NYSE:BP) is up slightly, climbing 0.8% after selling its entire upstream and downstream business in Alaska. The company will sell the units -- as well as its interests in Prudhoe Bay and the Trans Alaska Pipeline -- to Hilcorp in a $5.6 billion deal. It's part of BP's effort to divest $10 billion worth of assets over the next two years.Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stock fell almost 4% on Tuesday, with word that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is building an Instagram companion app called Threads. The hope is that users will find Threads helpful in communicating among a close group of people, sharing video, texts and photos, among other things. While it's not out in the wild yet, investors fear (at least on Tuesday), that it could dent Snapchat's usage. Heard on the StreetThere were plenty of notable analyst actions on Tuesday.Analysts at SunTrust upped their price target on Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). They bumped their target from $815 to $900, while maintaining a buy rating on the stock. It inspired investors to bid up CMG to new highs.Rosenblatt analysts upped their price target on Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) to a whopping $481. That's up big from the $395 target they assigned just a few months ago. The new Street-high target helped send SHOP stock to new all-time highs as well.Both hitting new highs on the day, it's no wonder SHOP and CMG both made the Top Stock Trades list.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter has an outperform rating and a $9 price target on Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA). However, the analyst added the stock to his list of top picks, sending shares higher by more than 2% on Tuesday. Even after the rally, Pachter's target still implies more than 50% upside.Analysts at Craig-Hallum Capital upgraded Weight Watchers (NASDAQ:WW) to buy from hold, and the move helped kick-start a 1.9% rally in the share price as a result.

Shares in the oil and gas giant have been stagnant year-to-date. The stock opened 2019 at $67.35. At the market close Aug. 23, shares traded at $67.49. But in the long term, could investors see a material boost in the XOM stock price? The company is making big moves to ramp up production, with expectations to double earnings by 2025.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Should investors join the ride and buy XOM stock? Or with the specter of a recession looming, should they sit tight and buy at a better price?Let's take a closer look at XOM and see what's the verdict.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Increased Exploration Offers Opportunity (and Risk)As I discussed in July, the company is pursuing high-ROI exploration opportunities. So far, their Permian Basin project has been a large success. Based on the most recent earnings announcement, production is up 20% from the prior quarter, and up 90% year-over-year. The company's Guyana project is still in the early stages. But Exxon Mobil expects gross production could be over 750,000 barrels per day by 2025.Exxon Mobil stock needs exploration success to move the needle. The company's upstream operations are the current profit driver. Downstream (refining and marketing) operations continue to struggle. The refining unit swung from a $256 million loss in the first quarter of 2019 to $451 million in earnings for the second quarter. But quarterly earnings continue to be down from the prior year's quarter ($724 million).Refining margins are starting to improve, and the company is wrapping up required maintenance. XOM's chemical unit also continues to struggle. Unit earnings for the quarter were $188 million, down from $518 million in the first quarter of 2019.  * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects But it isn't all smooth sailing. A lot could change in the oil market between now and 2025. A global recession could cause oil prices to fall further. Even if Exxon's new exploration efforts have a low breakeven point, the return on investment would be impacted.As InvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth discussed last week, the company is taking a big risk boosting exploration efforts. The potential payoff is significant. But when oil could potentially fall further in the coming years, their capital investments may not produce a significant return. In addition, cash flow could decline, threatening both the dividend and the XOM stock price.With this in mind, is XOM stock worth the risk? Let's take a look at valuation and see how Exxon Mobil stock stacks up to peers. XOM Stock ValuationExxon Mobil stock continues to trade at a premium to its integrated oil and gas peers. XOM stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.4. The company's enterprise value/EBITDA ratio is 9.4. Here are the corresponding earnings multiples of the company's closest competitors:BP (NYSE:BP): Forward P/E of 9.4, EV/EBITDA of 5.8Chevron (NYSE:CVX): Forward P/E of 13.7, EV/EBITDA of 7.4ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP): Forward P/E of 12.1, EV/EBITDA of 4.1Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A, NYSE:RDS.B): Forward P/E of 9.2, EV/EBITDA of 5.5The company's high dividend yield (5.2%) may help sustain the XOM stock price. With interest rates continuing to fall, it's tough to find a high-quality 5%+ yield in today's market. But is the company's dividend sustainable? Exxon's payout ratio is currently almost 80%. This means that the company needs increased earnings to grow the dividend. XOM is for now a dividend aristocrat. But a tougher oil market and increased capital expenditures could change that. Any sort of slowdown in the annual dividend increase (or a dividend cut) could materially impact the XOM stock price. Exxon Mobil Stock Is Stable, But Not a Big OpportunityExxon Mobil stock is not the biggest opportunity in the oil and gas space. While the company is making big moves with their Permian and Guyana projects, this ramp-up in capital investment is going on as global oil prices remain volatile. If oil sees a jump in price over the next five years, the XOM stock price will see a massive boost. But if oil prices continue to fall, the company may not be able to continue their long track record of growing the dividend.What does this mean for investors? Should they avoid Exxon Mobil stock? The other oil and gas names may be better buying opportunities. But a material drop in the XOM stock price could make it a screaming buy. However, with the stock's current high yield, it is doubtful the stock will start trading closer to the valuation of its peers.XOM stock is stable, but look elsewhere for big returns.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-08	2019-08-08 10:54:02	BP	BP p.l.c.	7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%	Editor's note: This story was previously published in May 2019. It has since been updated and republished.Google the question &quot;What's considered a high dividend yield?&quot; and you get more than 65 million results. That's because many investors are on the hunt for dividend stocks to buy that not only appreciate over time but also pay a high dividend. So what is a high-dividend yield stock? One that pays 1%? 3%? 5%? The truth is there is no strict rule. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you are interested in high-yield dividend stocks, it's better to focus on a company's history of growing its dividend rather than just looking for the juiciest dividend yields. That's because dividend yields are often high due to some problem with the business that's knocked its share price lower.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 That said, if you can find a group of stocks that yield 5% and have demonstrated the ability to grow the annual payment over a decent amount of time, double-digit total returns won't be nearly as difficult to achieve.The trick is finding those stocks. Here are seven high-yield dividend stocks to buy with a payout of 5% or more that I believe can get the job done. BP (BP)The integrated oil and gas company has come a long way since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. BP (NYSE:BP) currently yields 6.55%. It has paid a quarterly dividend for 34 consecutive quarters starting with a 42-cent payment in Q4 2010.Source: Shutterstock For 15 quarters between Q3 2014 and Q1 2018, it paid a 60-cent quarterly dividend, opting to retain more of its cash flow. With the September 2018 payment, BP increased its quarterly dividend to $0.6150 and has continued that right into 2019. In the past I have given InvestorPlace readers five reasons to own BP stock. Included in the mix was the company's projection that its free cash flow would grow from $1.8 billion to $24 billion by 2021. That projection was based on a $55 barrel of oil. In fiscal 2018, BP finished the year with $7.8 billion in free cash flow. It now expects to generate between $14-15 billion in free cash flow by 2021, down from its earlier projections, but much higher than where it was in fiscal 2016.    It expects to achieve its free cash flow projection for 2021 by adding approximately 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with many of the 16 projects required to add this capacity already underway.  Icahn Enterprises (IEP)Love him or hate him, Carl Icahn sure knows how to make money for his investors, and Icahn Enterprises (NYSE:IEP) is next on our list of high-yield dividend stocks.Source: Steve Pisano via FlickrOver the past 15 years, IEP's annualized total return was 14.8% with approximately 43% of those gains from dividends. Currently yielding just under 11%, IEP increased its quarterly distribution to $2 a share.In 2018, Icahn's investment fund made 7.8% on the year, when most hedge funds lost money and the S&P 500 was also down. Although Icahn is in his 80s, he's still able to jump on the latest trends.  * 10 Stocks to Buy on the Trade War Dip He might appear grumpy at times, but who cares when he delivers for shareholders. Brookfield Property Partners (BPY)Brookfield Property Partners (NASDAQ:BPY) invests in real estate. Whether we're talking office, retail, multi-family residential, self-storage, student housing, you name it, if there's money to be made, BPY is in the mix.Source: Shutterstock BPY acquired a 100% leasehold interest in 666 Fifth Avenue in New York in August 2018. The property, bought at the height of the real estate market, was Jared Kushner's money pit. He paid $1.8 billion for it. BPY took it off his hands for $1.3 billion. It plans to redevelop the building to bring up the rents and then hang on to it until the property is worth significantly more than the price Brookfield paid for it. Over the last five years, this high-yield dividend stock has completely reshaped its business, taking five publicly traded companies private, a move that kept a lid on its share price. As a result, the company's board's approved a $500 million substantial issuer bid to buy back its shares at prices between $19 and $21.AThe company offers a current yield of 6.9%. BPY is also affiliated with Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM), which owns 52% of the company. You could do a lot worse when it comes to high-yield dividend stocks. Cedar Fair (FUN)Who can resist a stock with the symbol FUN? Cedar Fair (NYSE:FUN) has been providing fun for kids and adults alike since 1870. Source: Jeremy Thompson via Flickr (Modified)It hasn't been a public company for 148 years, though. It went public in 1987. And a $10,000 investment in its IPO would be worth approximately $875,000 today. Its first park was in Sandusky, Ohio. Since then it's added ten additional amusement parks, two outdoor water parks, one indoor water park, and four hotels. The entire system welcomes close to 26 million guests each year generating more than $1.3 billion in annual revenue. The average guest spends almost $48 visiting one of its amusement parks spread across North America.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now Set up as a publicly traded partnership, Cedar Fair pays out most of its profits tax-free to its unitholders. Since going public, it's paid out more than $2.6 billion in distributions to unitholders.Cedar Fair might not grow its revenues by double digits but its current yield of 7.18% more than makes up for its lack of growth, making it one of the best high-yield dividend stocks to buy. BCE (BCE)BCE (NYSE:BCE) could best be described as a Canadian version of AT&T (NYSE:T).Source:  BCE, Inc. Canada's largest communications company, BCE generates 53% of its annual revenue from its wireline business, which includes broadband, TV, and voice, 36% from wireless, and the remaining 11% from Bell Media. Its media business includes 30 TV stations, 30 specialty networks, four pay-TV channels, 109 radio stations, and more than 200 websites.  BCE aims to pay out between 65%-75% of its free cash flow annually. In 2018, it paid out CAD$2.68 billion for dividends, 6.6% higher than a year earlier. It currently yields 5.18%, 140 basis points less than AT&T. However, its long-term debt is just CAD$19.8 billion, less than 10% of Randall Stephenson's baby.BCE continues to be a stock for widows and orphans -- in other words, one of the safest high-yield dividend stocks. Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)The second of two Brookfield picks, you might think I have a thing for the Brookfield group of companies; and, you'd be right. Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) is the renewable energy arm of Brookfield Asset Management, who own 60% of the company.   Source: Shutterstock Of the seven high-yield dividend stocks on this list, BEP has the most risk and reward of the bunch. On February 8, the company announced its Q4 results. On the top line, it had $3.0 billion in revenue, 13.6% higher than a year earlier. On the bottom line, it had $403 million in net income, almost eight times higher than in 2017. On a cash flow basis, its funds from operations (FFO) increased by 16.4% to $676 million. So, where's the risk, you might be asking? Well, renewable energy projects aren't cheap.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long In 2018, Brookfield finished the year with $10.7 billion in corporate and non-recourse debt. That debt comes with $6.5 billion in interest payments over the life of the obligations, 61% of which is due within five years.That said, all Brookfield companies bring to the table a level of conservatism to their investment practices, ensuring that your 5.53% dividend is most certainly money in the bank. Ford (F)Ford (NYSE:F) is currently yielding 6.3%, a mouth-watering number for any dividend investor. However, as anyone who follows the car company, an investment in the Detroit-based business comes with more than its fair share of risk.One of the risks is the company's CEO, Jim Hackett. I'm sure he's a fine man, but I've said many times in the past that he's the wrong person for the job.I argue that someone along the lines of General Motors' (NYSE:GM) CEO Mary Barra is what is needed to revive Ford glory.  Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford feels I'm 100% wrong about Hackett.&quot;I think the ability to hold the now, the near and the far all together at one time is something you don't always see in executives. And Jim (Hackett) has that,&quot; Ford told Reuters on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. &quot;We're changing a lot. And change is difficult.&quot;It sure is. That said, I do believe if you're going to buy a stock under $10, Ford is the one to buy because it's not going out of business anytime soon despite the lack of innovation. As of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

BP Wants to Add More Gas Stations as Indonesia Builds More Toll Roads	(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia’s PT AKR Corporindo is aiming to expand its gasoline station joint venture with BP Plc to as many as 350 outlets by 2027 to take advantage of a flurry of toll-road building across the archipelago.PT Aneka Petroindo Raya, set up by the two companies in late 2016, opened its first station last November and currently has nine outlets. The plan is to add as many as 20 to 25 stations before the end of this year and an additional 35 in 2020, said Suresh Vembu, AKR Corporindo’s business development and JV relationship director. The government’s $70 billion highway-building program will encourage Indonesians to make more long-distance car trips, he said.“You’re adding so many new cars, you’re adding more highways, people are driving,” Vembu said an interview in Jakarta on Tuesday. “Basically, the demand for gasoline in Indonesia is one of the fastest growing in the region.”President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, has announced plans to triple the length of Indonesia’s toll-road network to 5,400 kilometers (3,355 miles) by 2024, although there are questions about how the program will be funded. BP and AKR Corporindo are planning their expansion even as Indonesia considers a slew of incentives aimed at boosting the numbers of electric vehicles.BP expects to grow the gasoline station network together with its partner over the coming years, a spokesman for the London-based company said.The two companies are also setting up another joint venture to provide aircraft fuel, Vembu said. That business, called PT Dirgantara Petroindo Raya, will focus on serving the eastern part of the archipelago, he said.See also: BP, Reliance to Expand Partnership to Sell Transport Fuels in IndiaBP’s Indonesian initiatives are similar to what it’s doing in India, where it’s formed a joint venture with Reliance Industries Ltd. that will take over 1,400 Reliance-owned gasoline stations as well as aviation fuel operations at more than 30 airports. Meanwhile, in China, BP is focusing more on electric vehicles via a venture with Didi Chuxing Inc. to build charging infrastructure.AKR’s shares fell 1.9% as of 10:11 a.m. in Jakarta on Thursday as the Jakarta Composite Index rose 0.5%. They’re down 8.6% since Aug. 2, heading for the worst week since March, after the company reported a drop in first-half net income late last month.The Indonesian company is also focused on expanding its industrial estate business, according to Vembu. Several foreign firms have expressed interest in relocating some operations to its Java Integrated Industrial and Port Estate in Gresik, East Java, due to the deepening U.S.-China trade war, he said.PT Freeport Indonesia, a unit of PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium and Freeport-McMoRan Inc., will develop a smelter in the business park. Industrial estates could easily make up 15% to 20% of AKR’s net income in the next three to four years, Vembu said.“We want to make the industrial estate as our recurring income source,” he said. “Roads have been laid, ports have been constructed and the power plants are already ready.” (Updates with AKR Corporindo share move in eighth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Rakteem Katakey.To contact the reporters on this story: Tassia Sipahutar in Jakarta at ssipahutar@bloomberg.net;Harry Suhartono in Jakarta at hsuhartono@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Andrew Janes, Thomas Kutty AbrahamFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-wants-add-more-gas-031342905.html?.tsrc=rss

The Market Is Struggling to Deal With Millions of Barrels of Contaminated Oil	(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s contaminated oil crisis isn’t over yet -- at least not for the traders trying to find a home for the cargoes they unwittingly bought.BP Plc, the London-based oil giant, failed to find a purchaser for more than 700,000 barrels of Urals crude that got loaded onto a tanker almost three months ago at a port in the Baltic Sea, people with knowledge of a sales tender said Friday, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. The cargo has excessive levels of organic chlorides that could damage a refinery if not removed.In late April, it emerged that Russia was inadvertently sending millions of barrels laced with the contaminant through its Druzhba pipeline system to refineries across Europe, a situation that eventually caused flows to be halted. Some barrels also got sent to the port of Ust-Luga in the Baltic, where BP and other companies loaded them onto tankers.Russia’s pipeline operator Transneft said last month that it would pay $15 a barrel in compensation to Belarus for supplies sent by pipeline. Its eastern neighbor said recompense should not be dictated.It’s unclear what traders have been told about compensation. There was insufficient interest in the cargo for BP to be able to sell it, the people said. The shipment has an organic chloride content of about 29 parts per million. It needs to be less than 10. A spokesman for BP declined to comment.There are still about 5 million barrels of the tainted oil on tankers in northwest Europe, Singapore and other locations, according to traders and tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. That represents about 40% of the roughly 12 million barrels that were on ships at one stage during the height of the contamination crisis.To contact the reporter on this story: Sherry Su in London at lsu23@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaric Nightingale at anightingal1@bloomberg.net, Rachel GrahamFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-struggling-deal-millions-barrels-230100675.html?.tsrc=rss

Ondiflo Completes Blockchain-Based Pilot Project with BPX Energy	HOUSTON, Aug. 1, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Ondiflo, a blockchain platform for the oil and gas industry, today announced the successful completion of its Proof of Value (PoV) project of fluid hauling in East Texas in collaboration with BPX Energy, the U.S. onshore oil and gas unit for global energy company BP, and a selection of the operator's suppliers.  Throughout the pilot, during which Ondiflo's blockchain-based solution was deployed with three water hauling companies (C&J, Common and Select Energy Services), BPX Energy and its suppliers were able to identify substantial operational and financial benefits, including cost reduction by improved efficiency, reduced procure-to-pay time cycles and improved asset utilization.  Ondiflo's blockchain-based application for fluid hauling provides an automation platform for the optimization of field tracking activities, where tank-level data received from sensors, service orders, field tickets and invoices as well as regulatory documentation are transacted via smart contracts and key-data captured in the blockchain.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ondiflo-completes-blockchain-based-pilot-150000203.html?.tsrc=rss

Sign up here.BP Plc, the British oil giant that had to shelter one of its tankers in the Persian Gulf this month in fear it could be targeted by Iranian forces, is avoiding sending ships to the region after tensions flared between Tehran and London.BP is “certainly not sending British ships and crews” through the Strait of Hormuz, the only way for tankers to reach the world’s biggest oil-exporting region, Chief Executive Officer Robert Dudley said in a Bloomberg TV interview.Earlier this month, a BP tanker had to abandon a plan to load Iraqi crude and instead took shelter near Saudi Arabia because the company feared the ship could be targeted in a tit-for-tat response for British Royal Marines seizing a vessel transporting Iranian crude in the Mediterranean, a person familiar with the matter said at the time.Warship InterventionA British warship had to intervene to ensure the BP tanker’s safe exit of the Persian Gulf through Hormuz and the U.K. navy subsequently escorted other British-flagged vessels through the chokepoint responsible for a third of seaborne petroleum exports.“I think that’s a good thing, having open maritime trade is really important whether it is oil or any kind of trade,” Dudley said of the escorts.The British oil giant isn’t the only energy shipper taking precautions amid broader safety concerns in the Strait of Hormuz. Gaslog Ltd., which owns a fleet of liquefied natural gas carries, said Tuesday it won’t allow its ships to transit the key waterway without a naval escort, adhering to the current advice from its flag state Bermuda. The company has 26 LNG carriers on the water, according to its website.In early July, British Royal Marines stopped the Grace 1 tanker just off Gibraltar and the vessel remains in the British overseas territory’s waters now. The Gibraltarian government said it had reason to believe the vessel was carrying Iranian oil to Syria, which it said would be a breach of sanctions. Iran labeled the act “piracy” and, after the nation’s naval vessels approached the BP ship, another tanker, the Stena Impero, was eventually seized.History of Tension“It’s concerning but the Straits are open now and oil is moving,” Dudley said. “It’s not the first time in history we’ve had a lot of tension on the Strait of Hormuz.”The impact on BP from rising Hormuz tensions isn’t significant, Dudley said. While insurance premiums for tankers surged in the wake of six attacks on vessels in May and June, rates to charter the ships have stayed largely flat. That means freight -- as a proportion of the overall price of oil -- remains small. Crude prices also kept relatively stable as concerns about global demand offset the Middle East friction.Click here to read: Why the Strait of Hormuz Is World’s Oil FlashpointChief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary also confirmed that BP hadn’t sent any of its British-flagged tankers through the Strait since the July 10 attempt by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards to seize its tanker. The company was reporting earnings that beat estimates.BP has a fleet of 38 oil and gas carriers plying international trade routes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from the company itself and Clarkson Plc, the world’s biggest shipbroker.All but two of them start with the word ‘British’ in their name but none are inside the Persian Gulf at this time, according to ship-tracking. The U.K. government has recommended that ships flying the nation’s flag avoid the Persian Gulf for now.BP, as one of the world’s biggest oil companies, also hires hundreds of tankers each year, with many of them loading at ports and jetties inside the Persian Gulf. Dudley didn’t elaborate on what measures, if any, were being taken for those.(Updates with LNG fleet owner comment in sixth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Kelly Gilblom and Stephen Stapczynski.To contact the reporters on this story: Anna Edwards in London at aedwards49@bloomberg.net;Eddie Spence in London at espence11@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaric Nightingale at anightingal1@bloomberg.net, ;James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Rakteem KatakeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-avoids-sending-tankers-crews-095020319.html?.tsrc=rss

BP boosted by increased output despite lower oil prices	BP’s second-quarter earnings beat expectations as higher production offset lower energy prices and helped increase cash flow, paving the way for more shareholder handouts later this year.  Production from the oil major’s operations rose nearly 7 per cent from the same quarter a year ago to 2.6m barrels of oil equivalent per day after the acquisition of BHP's US shale assets and the ramp-up of major projects.  In the three months to June 30, underlying replacement cost profits — BP’s definition of net income and the measure tracked most closely by analysts — were roughly in line with the same period in 2018 at $2.8bn.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/cbc6471c-c681-3bc3-b74d-914e3a3dd4b4/bp-boosted-by-increased.html?.tsrc=rss

Sign up here.BP Plc bucked the trend of disappointing oil and gas earnings, beating expectations and increasing its cash flow as higher production offset the effect of lower energy prices.The company’s performance brightens what has so far been a weaker-than-expected second quarter for Big Oil. While companies are more profitable today than they were at $100 crude after slashing costs, they were caught in recent months by falling natural gas prices. Total SA, Eni SpA and Equinor ASA all fell short of analysts’ estimates even as their output rose.“What we have is solid performance in both upstream and downstream,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said in an interview. In the last couple of years “we’ve had four of what I would call strong quarters. Everything is going well across the piece.”London-based BP said adjusted net income was $2.81 billion in the second quarter, compared with $2.36 billion a year earlier. That exceeded even the highest analyst estimate, meaning the company has surpassed expectations in all but one of the previous ten quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“BP showed one of the best surprises of this quarter,” Ahmed Ben Salem, an analyst at Oddo BHF, said by phone. “Cash flow generation is robust” and trading results were positive, although downstream came in below expectations, he said.Shares of the company rose 3.4% to 545 pence as of 8:20 a.m. in London, the biggest increase in about six months.In April, BP paid the final cash installment for its purchase of U.S. shale oil and gas fields from BHP Group Ltd. Those assets helped boost output, which rose 3.4% to 3.79 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the quarter. That figure includes the contribution of Rosneft PJSC, the Russian oil company in which BP owns a nearly 20% stake. The company said it expects third-quarter production to be lower due to seasonal maintenance activities in the North Sea, Angola and the Gulf of Mexico.Click here to read how BP is responding to threats to tankers in the Persian Gulf.Cash flow from operations excluding payments related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill -- another key measure of whether the BHP deal is paying off -- rose 17% from a year earlier to $8.2 billion. On top of the payment for the U.S. fields, BP also paid about $1.4 billion in penalties associated with the 2010 Deepwater Horizon catastrophe.That spending pushed a measure of company’s debt to the highest in at least a decade. Gearing, the ratio of debt to equity, was 31%, the third-straight quarter above 30%. BP will sell $4 billion to $5 billion of assets this year, part of a plan to complete $10 billion in divestments by 2020 and use the proceeds to reduce gearing, Gilvary said.Adjusted profit in BP’s refining, marketing and chemicals division was down 21% from a year earlier to $1.37 billion due to significantly higher maintenance shutdowns, lower margins and weaker North American heavy crude differentials. That was partially offset by a stronger contribution from supply and trading, the company said.BP said it expects a lower level of maintenance in the third quarter, but also predicted lower refining margins.(Updates with share price in sixth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Rakteem Katakey and Eddie Spence.To contact the reporter on this story: Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-bucks-trend-big-oil-063604551.html?.tsrc=rss

Wind Threatens to Spread 52-Mile Oil Sheen From Leaking Well	(Bloomberg) -- Wind is threatening to spread a growing 52-mile (84-kilometer) oil sheen in Indonesia from an undersea well that began leaking about two weeks ago into the Java Sea.State crude producer PT Pertamina plans to install more booms in the south and east of the offshore oil platform to prevent the spread of the oil, spokesman Fajriyah Usman said in a text message on Monday. The flow of crude from the damaged well offshore Karawang, West Java, has declined to below 3,000 barrels per day, she said.The spill has contaminated beaches in at least 10 villages mostly to the west of the offshore platform, the energy ministry said Monday. Company officials have said it may take about eight weeks before the leaking well can be fully shut.The leak so far appears to be much smaller than BP Plc’s 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The blowout and explosion off the coast of Louisiana killed 11 workers and sent millions of gallons and oil into the gulf and surrounding wetlands. BP officials publicly stated that 5,000 barrels of oil a day was flowing into the gulf. Experts concluded later that the figure was more than 60,000 barrels a day, the U.S. government said.Pertamina said Sunday it has intensified clean up efforts by installing five high-speed water skimmers to suck the fuel from the sea surface and put up a static oil boom stretching 2,000 meters around the YY platform to contain the spill.READ: Pertamina Boosts Efforts to Clean Up Java Sea After Oil SpillPertamina has mobilized and alerted 32 vessels for oil-spill combat and firefighting among other measures, according to Sunday’s statement. A total of 800 people and more than 100 military personnel were also involved in cleaning up oil spills on the beach. The company said Saturday it has set up four health posts at coastal villages in Java.To contact the reporters on this story: Yoga Rusmana in Jakarta at yrusmana@bloomberg.net;Eko Listiyorini in Jakarta at elistiyorini@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Thomas Kutty Abraham at tabraham4@bloomberg.net, Aaron ClarkFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wind-threatens-spread-52-mile-080645670.html?.tsrc=rss

Credibility Issues Are Going to Keep Weighing down BP Stock	Say what you want about big oil firms: at the end of the day, they represent an indispensable part of our everyday lives. Until the time that renewable energy sources take over, oil is essentially what powers our high-tech societies. However, that concept alone hasn't done much for BP (NYSE:BP) or the BP stock price.As our own Dana Blankenhorn explained earlier this year, the company was at the center of the Deepwater Horizon explosion. Aside from sparking yet another Mark Wahlberg movie, the oil-rig explosion caused severe damage to the Gulf of Mexico. And after nearly a decade removed from the incident, Deepwater Horizon still levers an unfortunate impact on the ecosystem.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor environmentalists and those concerned about big corrupt corporations, it's quite fitting that the BP stock price never recovered from the incident. It got close in 2014, but for the most part, shares have traded well inside a bearish trend channel.  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season But even more startling, BP essentially hasn't moved on an adjusted basis since 1997. To put that into perspective, some of our readers weren't even born at that time.This is Wall Street's version of the money pit: BP does just enough to keep you interested. However, it never reaches its true potential.And Blankenhorn makes a strong case that you shouldn't hold your breath. The company is deeply in debt, oil supplies are booming everywhere, and renewables are making substantial progress. As a trade, the stock might be worth a shot. However, its days as a long-term investment are gone. BP Stock is a 50/50 PropositionUndeniably, the British multinational oil firm is one of the most frustrating names within the energy sector. Companies like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) have at least made progress since the 1990s.As I stated earlier, the BP stock price is largely flat over the same period.One of the reasons is that the stock price and oil prices don't have the strongest correlation. Let's face it: surging gasoline prices starting from the early 2000s coincided with the run-up in big oil.  Click to EnlargeUnfortunately, BP really didn't benefit from oil demand. Between June 1999 and June 2019, the correlation coefficient between oil prices and the stock price was only 54%. That's not the greatest strength in terms of a direct relationship between the two metrics.  However, from January 2017 onward, the correlation coefficient is 86%. In other words, as oil prices rise, so too does the BP stock price. Additionally, I would argue that finally, BP is becoming a rational or logical investment by tracking the underlying oil market.In terms of trading, I think this is good news. If you can forecast oil prices, you'll statistically have a better chance at actualizing profits from BP.But predicting the oil market is an especially tricky affair right now. Blankenhorn referenced reports that oil demand from automobiles will peak in the mid-2020s. If I'm reading the long-term chart for Brent Crude objectively, I admit this is a big concern.Oil prices peaked in the summer of 2008, and it has never reached that lofty point since then. Moreover, &quot;black gold&quot; appears to be charting a series of lower highs. BP Stock Has a Small Chance of SuccessIf oil declines or goes rangebound, I'm not sure if I trust BP. After all, the data suggests that the BP stock price is dependent upon a robust underlying market. Anything less than that may cripple shares because the company has a credibility problem.That said, I think oil prices may tick up. Due to a strong labor market, for example, more people are traveling. Yes, historically lower fuel prices may contribute to that, but robust labor plays a far larger role. Eventually, if this trend continues, oil prices will rise due to normal supply-demand dynamics.Finally, I think the renewable energy case as it relates to autos is overstated. While electric vehicles have captured consumer attention, they require an overhaul of our energy infrastructure. Even if that occurs, what happens if millions of drivers plug in their EVs during a record-breaking heatwave?As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-24	2019-07-24 14:30:41	BP	BP p.l.c.	With Cash for M&A or Buybacks, Chevron Stock Is Only Going to Get Better	It's been onward and upward for Chevron (NYSE:CVX). The company originally planned to acquire Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), a move the market did not like. The Chevron stock price dropped nearly 5% when the plan was announced.Source: Shutterstock Anadarko wound up selling to Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) instead, and with some recent help from higher crude oil prices, Chevron is again challenging recent highs.The question now is where Chevron goes from here. That's true for CVX stock, obviously - but that in turn depends on management strategy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsM&A may still be on the table. Shareholder returns could increase. With Chevron earnings coming next week, it's likely strategy will be in focus, as much in performance.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund  Is There Another Deal out There for Chevron?The obvious question after the Anadarko deal is whether Chevron still is interested in M&A. Anadarko wasn't necessarily a transformative move, but at $33 billion it was a material acquisition.And as I wrote at the time, the bidding war for Anadarko seemed like it could lead to a new wave of M&A in U.S. shale. With the worst of the 2016 plunge in crude prices behind the space, and a new focus on smart capital deployment, shale operators were in better shape.Meanwhile, majors like Chevron and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) seemed to be in a good position to acquire growth through acquisitions.Indeed, the logic behind Chevron's bid for Anadarko still exists. In making the offer, Chevron cited an increased presence in the Delaware Basin, cost synergies, and growth in LNG (liquefied natural gas). It might not be able to get all of those benefits from a single transaction, but it clearly has the firepower to make further deals. A $1 billion termination fee from Anadarko gives that firepower a modest boost.So far, however, the anticipated consolidation in the sector hasn't played out. Callon Petroleum (NYSE:CPE), one of the stocks often cited as a potential target, is merging with Carrizo Oil & Gas (NASDAQ:CRZO) in a smaller deal. QEP Resources (NYSE:QEP) reportedly was in talks to go private, but those talks appear to have fallen through.But the potential targets for Chevron - among them Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) and Pioneer Resources (NYSE:PXD) - are still out there. If Chevron wants to boost its already-extensive exposure to U.S. shale, it will have options to do so. A Chevron Stock Buyback?The other option is for Chevron to spend up buying itself. The bid for Anadarko included a bump in the company's share repurchase authorization from $4 billion to $5 billion. That offset some of the dilution that would have been issued to finance a portion of the acquisition.That increase should hold, and Chevron could add the $1 billion termination fee as well. There's also room to increase the Chevron stock dividend. The payout was increased by more than 6% in February, and Chevron could target a similar increase for 2020.The current yield, based on a CVX stock price of $125.31, is 3.8% below that of other majors like XOM and BP plc (NYSE:BP). Chevron might look to be more competitive for income investors - or target a yield over 4%, particularly at a time when 10-year Treasury bonds are yielding barely 2%. The CVX Stock Price Moves UpIt's likely that these strategic questions will be a point of focus on next week's earnings call. There's cash coming in both from Anadarko and another $2 billion in proceeds from a sale of assets in the North Sea. That sale moves Chevron toward a target of $5-$10 billion in disposals. Investors now are going to wonder when and how the company plans to play offense.Next week's call could provide at least some clues. Is Chevron still looking at U.S. shale? Is LNG a priority? Or does Chevron instead simply boost its repurchase authorization to $10 billion, or higher, promising higher shareholder returns while executing on current plans?In part because of this flexibility, last month I called Chevron one of the 7 best stocks to buy in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock already has gained, with some help from crude prices. From here, Chevron stock may depend more on what its management and board of directors decide.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Iran Confrontation With U.K. Reflects History of Bad Blood	(Bloomberg) -- The reopening of the British embassy in Tehran was meant to usher in a new era in relations. As the Union Jack flag was raised above the lush, landscaped gardens of the complex in August 2015, then-Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the event marked “an important milestone.”That was just six weeks after an international accord was reached to restrict Iran’s nuclear program in return for relief from penalties that had strangled its economy. But since the accord started to unravel last year, tensions between Britain and Iran have been growing.Then came Friday’s dramatic seizure of a British-linked tanker in the Gulf, a tit-for-tat response to the U.K.’s detention of a vessel carrying Iranian oil through the Mediterranean Sea. The U.K. has threatened Iran with “serious consequences,” which could include a package of sanctions.How did things get so bad? The U.K. is after all part of a European trio trying to rescue the nuclear deal U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of, triggering its demise. But it is also breaking away from the European Union and desperate for a free-trade agreement with the U.S., still the world’s dominant economy.It’s ComplicatedIn short, its geopolitical priorities are complex.Britain’s relations with Iran stretch back to the 1600s and are marked by periods of conflict, some were resolved fairly swiftly, others endure to this day. For example, Iranians still blame Britain for a famine 100 years ago. Underlying it all is a sense the U.K. is playing a double game.“Iranians are obsessed with the idea that the British are the arch-manipulators in the background, manipulating the U.S.,” said Ali Ansari, a professor of modern history in the Middle East at the U.K.’s University of St. Andrews. “It dominates the narrative in a way you’d never imagine.”Brexit-ravaged Britain is trapped in a political crisis, transitioning from one prime minister to another. The two Conservative candidates slugging it out to become leader also happen to be both the current and former foreign secretary: Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson, favored to win and whom Trump calls a friend.Iran was never a colony of the Empire on paper, but nevertheless the U.K. has wielded outsized influence in the country over centuries. During the Great Game of the 19th century, Victorian Britain and Tsarist Russia, battled for dominance in Central Asia, Persia was caught in the middle.Liquid GoldIt struggled to balance the demands of the two imperial powers and though Russia was always the more brutal of the two, Britain left deeper political scars. That’s partly because events of the early 20th century “altered the historical perspective,” Ansari said.Then, as now, those events revolved around oil.In 1901 British entrepreneur William Knox D’Arcy began searching for oil in Persia and under the terms of a deal struck with the monarchy, he became the sole owner of whatever oil he’d find, while Persia would get just 16% of profits annually and no say over how the company was run. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company was born seven years later when D’Arcy’s surveyors discovered crude beneath the southern desert.“Fortune brought us a prize from fairyland beyond our wildest dreams,” said Winston Churchill, who was in charge of the Navy at the time and oversaw its switch from coal to oil.Colonial BaggageThe British government injected new capital into the Company just before World War I, acquired a controlling interest and built the world’s largest refinery near the Persian Gulf to process the oil and ship it back to Britain.The Company ran the city like a virtual colony: British employees and their families lived in luxury in a peaceful oasis on one side of the city and non-British laborers in a shanty town on the other.Unsurprisingly, strikes and riots broke out sporadically. In 1951, as a wave of anti-colonialism swept the region, the Company was nationalized under the government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. Iran canceled its right to extract oil and seized its assets. Britain shut down refineries, blockaded Iran’s ports and froze Iranian bank accounts.When it became clear Mosaddegh had the upper hand, the U.K. lobbied the U.S. to install a shah sympathetic to the west. Together in 1953 they overthrew him in a coup.Birth of BPIranian oil began flowing again and the Company -- which had by then rebranded itself as British Petroleum and is now known as BP -- tried to regain its old position. But Iranian public opinion was so fiercely opposed the new government couldn’t let that happen. Instead it was forced to accept membership in a consortium of companies. After the repressive shah was exiled during 1979 Islamic Revolution, the anti-western regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini nationalized the oil industry again.The seizure of the tanker carrying Iranian oil off the southern tip of Spain earlier this month, like most of U.S. policy toward Iran under Trump, has unified rival political factions. It’s also given the Islamic Republic’s stalwarts a fresh opportunity to attack Britain as an imperialist, colonialist, pro-monarchist power intent on meddling in Iran’s affairs.‘Queen’s Pirates’On July 6 -- two days after British forces seized a supertanker suspected of carrying Iranian oil to Syria -- Iranian media was swift to respond. The headline in the moderate Arman newspaper read “A U.S. Scenario with British Actors” while the reformist Aftab spoke of “Extremism in Gibraltar.” The ultra-hardline daily Kayhan has called for retaliation against “the Queen’s pirates.”The Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, in which the U.K. backed Saddam Hussein, and a fatwa against the writer Salman Rushdie have been among low points in ties between Iran and Britain.More recently, the fate of U.K.-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe -- held by Iran on spying charges since 2016 -- has poisoned the well.She’s recently been transferred from the notorious Evin prison to a hospital psychiatric ward and is barred from contacting her family. Johnson, as foreign minister, was widely criticized for contributing to her fate by saying publicly she was in Iran teaching journalism.Should he become prime minister, as is widely expected, the crisis with Iran will demand his immediate attention.Just before Friday’s extraordinary seizure of the tanker by Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said he wouldn’t allow the “evil” acts of Britain to go unanswered. Such menacing rhetoric was used back in 2011 in the run-up to an attack on the U.K. embassy in Tehran by hardliners.They left behind scrawl on walls that read “Death to England” near a portrait of Queen Elizabeth and a bust of Queen Victoria.Britain closed the embassy.(Adds latest U.K. actions.)&#92;--With assistance from Tim Ross.To contact the reporters on this story: Caroline Alexander in London at calexander1@bloomberg.net;Golnar Motevalli in Tehran at gmotevalli@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rosalind Mathieson at rmathieson3@bloomberg.net, Mark Williams, Flavia Krause-JacksonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/history-bad-blood-u-k-161325022.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-19	2019-07-19 11:50:25	BP	BP p.l.c.	Stable Dividend, Minimal Growth Makes Exxon Mobil Stock a Hold	Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) stock is treading water. After rallying from roughly $69 in January up to over $83 in April, shares in the oil and gas giant have dipped below the $75 level.Source: Shutterstock While offering a solid dividend yield, a lack of catalysts means the XOM stock price will likely stay within the $70 to $80 trading range. Read on to see why Exxon Mobil stock continues to be a hold. Downstream Business Facing ChallengesFor the first quarter of 2019, the big oil firm saw quarterly earnings fall from $6 billion to $2.35 billion. Downstream (refining) was the biggest cause of the earnings decline.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne-time events such as asset sales in Q4 can explain some of the downstream earnings decline. But the lion's share was due to lower refining margins. The downstream segment went from a $2.7 billion profit in Q4 2018 to a $256 million loss in Q1 2019.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Scheduled maintenance was another factor in the downstream unit's weak performance. Moreover, the company expects to spend similar amounts on maintenance in Q2. Upstream Offers Stability in XOM StockWhile the downstream business faces headwinds, upstream provides some positives for the XOM stock price. The company continues to increase production in the Permian Basin. Exxon Mobil's exploration off the coast of Guyana has also yielded strong production opportunities.In their June 2019 JP Morgan Energy Conference presentation, Guyana and other projects provide a high internal rate of return with a low breakeven rate. The company's expertise in developing new production partially outweighs the cyclicality of the downstream refining business.The relative strength of the exploration and production segment has blunted refining challenges. But additional weakness across Exxon Mobil's other business lines could hurt Q2 results. Q2 Earnings OutlookExxon Mobil is scheduled to release Q2 earnings in early August. While the company expects improved refining margins, this may not be enough to counter additional issues. Analysts project the oil firm's natural gas and chemical businesses to lower operating earnings.A decline in natural gas prices offsets an estimated $400 million to $600 million boost to Exxon Mobil's profitability from increased crude oil prices. Low margins and continued maintenance negatively impact the chemical unit.While earnings growth does not appear to be in the cards, there is a positive takeaway: Exxon Mobil stock continues to pay out a solid dividend, providing income-oriented investors a strong reason to consider a position. XOM Remains a Dividend AristocratExxon Mobil stock has seen annual dividend increases for 37 consecutive years. The five-year average growth rate of the dividend is 5.6%. With a current dividend yield of 4.6%, XOM stock is a solid opportunity for passive-income investors.The XOM stock price receives strong price support from the dividend. This somewhat coerces Exxon Mobil to continue the payouts to keep shareholders happy.Without a long-time rise in oil prices, it may be tough for XOM to continue growing the dividend. However, thanks to continued global demand for oil, the company may have the long-term earnings growth necessary to sustain approximately six annual dividend increases.But can investors count on the dividend yield alone to deliver value? Is the current valuation sustainable, or could the XOM stock price see additional declines? Let's see how Exxon Mobil compares to its peers: Exxon Mobil Stock Overvalued Relative to PeersAt the current XOM stock price, the company trades for 20.2-times forward earnings, and an enterprise value (EV)/EBITDA ratio of 9.7. This valuation appears stretched relative to the company's integrated oil and gas rivals:BP (NYSE: BP): 13-times trailing earnings, EV/EBITDA of 6Chevron (NYSE: CVX): 16.9-times forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 8ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP): 12.4-times forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 4.8Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A): 11-times earnings, EV/EBITDA of 5.9One may think that the XOM stock premium is the result of a high dividend. But Exxon Mobil stock does not have the highest yield: For instance, BP has a 6.26% yield, while Royal Dutch Shell sports a 5.94% yield. And Chevron and ConocoPhillips aren't too far behind at 3.83% and 2.04%, respectively.Therefore, looking at both earnings power and dividend yield, it is crystal clear Exxon Mobil stock is not an outstanding opportunity for value or dividend investors. Bottom Line: Exxon Mobil Stock Is a HoldExxon Mobil stock has been hammered by weak refining margins. Despite these risks, XOM stock trades at a premium to its fellow integrated oil and gas companies.The company continues to be a dividend aristocrat, raising the payout for the 37th consecutive year. The dividend yield is solid, but not as high as those paid by BP and Royal Dutch Shell.With improved refining margins, Q2 earnings (anticipated for early August) could satisfy investors. However, weakness in natural gas and chemicals could outweigh a rebound in refining margins.With upside questionable but downside protected by the dividend play, XOM stock is a hold. Investors should consider entering a position if the company starts trading at a discount to its peers.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Transportation stocks, which I discussed yesterday, are dropping in response to mixed guidance from CSX (NYSE:CSX), but that looks like a buying opportunity ahead of a likely Federal Reserve interest rate cut later this month.One area of the market not looking good for new money, however, is energy. Oil and gas companies across the board are suffering nasty-looking breakdowns as geopolitical tensions with Iran have failed to materialize into any actual supply disruptions. The U.S. shale industry is too revved up, with a lowered cost base keeping the spigots turned on even as crude oil prices stagnate near $60.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip With the likes of Russia and Saudi Arabia unable to cut production enough to boost prices, the weakness looks set to continue. Here are six stocks to sell now:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Energy Stocks Spilling Lower: Marathon Oil (MRO)Shares of Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) are breaking down, threatening a return to the December lows and setting up a possible decline to the summer 2017 lows near $10.50. Such a move would be worth a loss of more than 20% from here. Shares were recently downgraded to neutral by analysts at Atlantic Securities.The company will next report results on Aug. 7 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 16 cents per share on revenues of $1.4 billion. When the company last reported on May 1, earnings of 31 cents per share beat estimates by 24 cents on a 30.9% decline in revenues. Nabors Industries (NBR)Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR), which provides drilling services to the onshore and offshore oil industry, is also suffering breakdown out of its recent trading range, That's setting up a possible excursion back to its December lows. Shares are already down a whopping 86% from the high seen in early 2017 as oil prices hold steady near $60 a barrel.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy The company will next report results on July 29 after the close. Analysts are looking for a loss of 22 cents per share on revenues of $802 million. When the company last reported on April 30, a loss of 36 cents missed estimates by 10 cents on a 10.2% rise in revenues. BP Amoco (BP)BP Amoco (NYSE:BP) shares are falling away from a multi-month challenge of its 200-day moving average. That's confirming a messy-looking head-and-shoulders reversal pattern that traces to a low of $37. That would mark a test of the December low. The stock has been in a sideways pattern since the summer of 2018, unable to top resistance near the $45-a-share threshold.The company will next report results on July 30. Analysts are looking for earnings of 80 cents per share on revenues of $72 billion. When the company last reported on April 30, earnings of 70 cents per share beat estimates by 3 cents on a 2.7% decline in revenues. Transocean (RIG)Transocean (NYSE:RIG), which provides offshore drilling services including the ultra-deepwater segment, is falling away from its 50-day moving average and setting up a retest of the June low. The stock has already fallen below a multiyear trading range between $14 and $8 per share. The range was in play between 2015 and 2019.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond The company will next report results on July 29 after the close. Analysts are looking for a loss of 33 cents per share on revenues of $766 million. When the company last reported on April 29, a loss of 30 cents beat estimates by a penny on a 13.6% rise in revenues. EnCana (ECA)Canadian oil company EnCana (NYSE:ECA) has violated its June low, which in turn violated its December low. That cleared the way for a decline to levels not seen since early 2016. Shares of lost more than two-thirds of their value from the highs seen as recently as late last year. The company recently announced it would sell its Arkoma Basin natural gas assets for $165 million.The company will next report results on July 31 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 18 cents per share on revenues of just over $2 billion. When the company last reported on April 30, earnings of 14 cents per share beat estimates by five cents. Devon Energy (DVN)Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is an independent oil and gas company based in Oklahoma. It has broken down out of its lower Bollinger Band to shy away yet again from its 200-day moving average. Watch for a decline back to the early June low and a likely violation back to the December low near $20. Such a move would be worth a loss of roughly 20% from here.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown The company will next report results on Aug. 6 after the close.

The idea has always been that these sectors provide less in the way of capital gains, compared to more volatile high-flying sectors like technology, but in exchange for the more moderate capital gains, investors get stability and yield.This year, however, as investors have tried to navigate the tail end of the business cycle and changing stances by the Federal Reserve, fund flows have gone to those classic defensive sectors. The result is double digit gains for the stock itself pre-dividend in year to date performance. Consumer Staples Select (NYSEARCA:XLP) is up almost 19%. The utility ETF Utilities SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLU) is not far behind, up 15%.Dividend yields have fallen under this scenario, and XLU yields just 3%, while XLP yields just 2.7%. It's clear then, that investors are going to need to look elsewhere for higher yields.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Energy, being rather out of favor this year, is offering some compelling opportunities. Dividend Stocks to Buy: Energy Transfer LPDividend Yield: 8.2%Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET) has been steadily executing on the strategic front. They have expanded their presence to China to meet growing demand for LNG and NGL products by opening an office in Beijing earlier in the year. ET signed a letter of intent with Sunoco (NYSE:SUN) to enter into a joint venture on a diesel fuel pipeline to West Texas. They have sold interests in certain pipelines to raise capital at attractive prices.Regardless of how the overall market is treating the energy sector, especially midstream master limited partnerships (MLPs), ET has not missed a beat. Financials are in good order with a distribution cash coverage ratio of 2.07x. Fiscal year adjusted EBITDA forecast of $10.7 billion have been reaffirmed.All the while the business keeps expanding. Plans on a Bakken pipeline optimization project will start next year. And on the Permian side, ET is expanding its Permian Express pipeline system by an incremental 120,000 barrels per day. The Permian Express 4 expansion is expected to be in service by the end of the third quarter of 2019.Cash flows are extremely healthy. The dividend is secure. And new projects are fueling growth. The future for ET looks better than good. DCP MidstreamDividend Yield: 10%DCP Midstream (NYSE:DCP) reported a strong first quarter yet yields remain sky high. This presents a great opportunity for patient investors who understand that equity sectors go on rotation and that there will be a day when the market wakes up and realizes how cheap companies have gotten.DCP owns and operates more than 60 plants and 64,000 miles of natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines across 9 states. On this diverse base of assets, the company generated record distributable cash flow of $224 million in the first quarter. This puts the distribution coverage ratio at 1.45 times. So, despite difficult times for the sector, a best-in-class operator will still produce best-in-class results.NGL Energy Partner's (NYSE:NGL) pipeline throughput volumes was extremely strong, increasing approximately 30% year-over-year. In particular, Sand Hills and Southern Hills drove higher volumes. As a result, adjusted EBITDA set a record as well for the quarter.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond Somehow DCP is just sitting there yielding 10%. Take advantage of the mispricing. BPDividend Yield: 6%BP (NYSE:BP) has a plan in place to secure long-term cash flow distributions to shareholders. Oil prices have been volatile, but their turnaround strategy is well underway.There are a number of ramp-up projects, three of which came on stream in Q1, and another that is scheduled to come on stream in Q2. These ramp-ups should make up for some lost volume that has certain analysts concerned.The good news is that most of the major turnarounds are behind BP, so the company is now in more of a steady state. There will be some impact in Q2 but not to the extent that the market seems to be pricing in.Lubricants, which has been a great business, has recently run into some issues with base oil prices, but management indicates that is leveling off. BP has made major efforts starting late last year to make that department more efficient, so there are ways to work around the headwinds.A recovery across a couple of BP's business lines going forward, in addition to the refinery system readying to go &quot;full tilt&quot; in 2020, has positioned the company well both from a growth and cash flow standpoint. Being paid 6% for the company's thought through strategy to play off isn't a bad deal. As of this writing, Luce Emerson was long shares of Energy Transfer LP.

Indeed, Exxon stock has proven tough to own for the past several years.Source: Shutterstock While rivals like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and BP (NYSE:BP) have, for the most part, fought their way back from their 2015 funk, Exxon Mobil hasn't been able to do the same.It's upcoming Q2 report isn't expected to be a barn-burner either, with weakness from its gas and chemical business expected to offset renewed strength from its downstream arm.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half So far, Exxon has been the disappointment investors and analysts alike expected it to be when it took a more aggressive path coming out of 2015's oil rout.That is, rather than act conservatively and defensively, Exxon Mobil is ramping up its bets on hydrocarbons. Next year's capital expenditures are budgeted 16% higher than this year's as part of an eye-popping plan to double 2017's income of $15 million by 2025.There may be a method to the madness, however, that current and would be XOM stock owners have to embrace. Exxon Stock in the Long TermMost oil companies, and other types of companies for the matter, seek a balance of short-term and long-term success. Exxon Mobil is far more concerned about the latter, and much less concerned about the former.The company has never explicitly said this. Rather, one must read between the lines.Exxon repeatedly has featured outlooks like this one, presented at the recent JP Morgan Energy Conference. In it the company claims that 2025 is a key milestone in terms of results. Simultaneously, Exxon is imagining what the oil market will look like not in 2020, but in 2040.Rivals are doing the same, to be fair, albeit nowhere near to the same extent.And, contrary to many hopes and dreams for a carbon-free world by then, we're likely to be burning more gas and oil then rather than less. The IEA report Exxon is relying on suggests we'll need, globally, on the order of 110 million barrels of oil per day within two decades. That's up from around 90 million barrels now.As for natural gas, the same forecasters anticipate the world will need around 450 billion cubic feet per day. We're presently using roughly 350 billion barrels per day.We're also depleting known gas and oil reserves in the meantime, forcing us to continue the hunt for more.That's where Exxon Mobil's capital expenditure plan, as big it feels, is actually dwarfed. The $150 billion or so the company will have laid out on new projects and improvements to existing properties is only a fraction of the $21 trillion the IEA says will need to be invested in order to meet that demand. Bottom Line on Exxon StockIt's worth noting that not every observer expects the consumption of oil to continue growing through 2040 and perhaps beyond. Bank of America analysts expect demand to peak in 2030 and then slide lower at a brisk clip after that.The paradigm shift's cause? The adoption of electric cars could force the energy market past its tipping point.If B of A is right, then Exxon Mobil's spending is largely for naught and XOM stock itself could face even greater pressure than it's faced in recent years.That's an oversized 'if' though. As uncertain as oil's future may be, the plausible supply of lithium needed to make the batteries that power EVs is even more obscured.Like any other commodity, the greater the demand for lithium on a so-far-strained supply, the more possible it becomes that electric vehicles become unaffordable.At the very least, all the infrastructure needed to refine oil and fill up vehicles with gasoline already exists.Whatever the reason, Exxon Mobil is in many regards going for broke. It's only given biologically-made fuels a modest look, while other names in the business appear to assume alternatives to drilling are the inevitable future.While Exxon's rivals are cautious about taking on new drilling prospects, Exxon is forging ahead as if little will change over the course of the coming two decades. It's made a huge bet on conventional oil and gas drilling in Guyuna.If the foreseeable future is indeed one that still relies on oil, Exxon Mobil will be at least five years ahead of its rivals.That's another big 'if' though.The only real certainty here is that investors won't be getting clear answers about the wisdom of the decision for at least a few more years. That makes XOM stock a tough name to bet on in the meantime, though perhaps the only game in town if the bets pay off.Either way, Exxon has to be viewed through a long-term lens.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Warship Escorting BP's Oil Tanker Is U.K.'s Only One in Area	(Bloomberg) -- The HMS Montrose, the naval vessel that protected a BP Plc oil tanker as it passed through the Strait of Hormuz, is the U.K.’s only warship in the area, according to Britain’s Ministry of Defence. It has several other naval vessels in the Gulf, it said.The U.K. government said the Montrose had to warn three Iranian vessels to stay away from the tanker, the British Heritage. The oil carrier didn’t load a planned cargo of Iraqi crude and instead left the region empty, according to a person familiar with the matter. BP was concerned it could be a target for Iran after British Royal Marines helped to seize a tanker transporting the Persian Gulf country’s crude in the Mediterranean Sea. The master and chief officer of that ship have been arrested, Gibraltar’s government said Thursday.Here are responses from the MoD to questions from Bloomberg:Question: For how long has HMS Montrose been in the area? Answer: HMS Montrose has been in the Gulf since late 2018.Q: Was it there to escort vessels through Strait of Hormuz? A: HMS Montrose was in the area providing a maritime security role.Q: Was it an Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps vessels? Or some other Iranian entity? A: IRGC vessels.Q: Where did the confrontation happen? (nearest city on the Iranian side/landfall?) A: The incident involving HMS Montrose took place in international waters.(Updates with information about arrest of tanker officials in 2nd paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Verity Ratcliffe in Dubai at vratcliffe1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaric Nightingale at anightingal1@bloomberg.net, Brian WingfieldFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warship-escorting-bps-oil-tanker-161056993.html?.tsrc=rss

Bunge Is in Talks With BP to Join Brazil Sugar-Ethanol Assets	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. agribusiness giant Bunge Ltd. is in talks with British oil major BP Plc to form a sugar and ethanol joint venture in Brazil, according to people familiar with the matter.The companies are in discussions to combine operations in the South American nation, one of the largest producers of both sugar cane and sugar-based ethanol, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Bunge and BP are currently valuing their sugar and ethanol assets to agree on the size of each company’s stake, and Bunge has hired Brazilian bank Itau Unibanco Holding SA as an adviser, the people said.No final agreement has been reached and the talks could fail to produce a deal.Joining forces with Bunge, the ‘B’ in the quartet of storied ABCD traders of agricultural commodities, would triple BP’s sugar-cane crushing capacity in Brazil, where ethanol is either blended into gasoline or used solely to power flexible-fuel cars. Forming a venture would allow U.S.-based Bunge to separate a struggling business in a tie-up similar to when Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Brazilian sugar and ethanol producer Cosan Ltd. created Raizen in 2010.Spokesmen for Bunge and BP declined to comment.Sugar traders have been struggling to make money as bumper crops from Thailand to India depressed prices and curbed volatility. Bunge, which sold its sugar trading business to Singapore-based trader Wilmar International, had been exploring options for its Brazilian milling business. The company said last year it would delay an initial public offering of the unit due to market conditions.BP started producing ethanol in Brazil in 2008 and its three mills currently have capacity to crush 10 million metric tons of cane a year. Bunge has eight mills with capacity to process 22 million tons.&#92;--With assistance from Mario Parker, Kelly Gilblom and Alfred Cang.To contact the reporters on this story: Fabiana Batista in Sao Paulo at fbatista6@bloomberg.net;Isis Almeida in Chicago at ialmeida3@bloomberg.net;Vinícius Andrade in São Paulo at vandrade3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tina Davis at tinadavis@bloomberg.net, Pratish NarayananFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bunge-talks-bp-join-brazil-123508339.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Oil Tanker Shelters in Persian Gulf on Fear of Iran Retaliation	(Bloomberg) -- An oil tanker run by BP Plc is being kept inside the Persian Gulf in fear it could be seized by Iran in a tit-for-tat response to the arrest by Gibraltar last week of a vessel hauling the Islamic Republic’s crude.The British Heritage, able to haul about 1 million barrels of oil, was sailing toward Iraq’s Basrah terminal in the south of country when it made an abrupt u-turn on July 6. It’s now off Saudi Arabia’s coast and a person with knowledge of the matter says BP’s concern is that it could become a target if Iran seeks to retaliate for the seizure near Gibraltar -- by British Royal Marines -- of the tanker Grace 1 on July 4.BP’s decision shows how rising tensions between Iran and the west are having an impact on the oil tanker industry that’s vital to the global trade in crude. Tehran’s foreign ministry said the arrest of Grace 1 was an act of piracy and a former leader of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said on Twitter the Islamic Republic should take a British tanker in response. The U.S. accused Iran of recent attacks on tankers just outside the Persian Gulf.“It’s a psychological game that’s being played,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of energy consultant Petromatrix GmbH. “Nobody wants to be that one whose vessel is seized in a ‘tit-for-tat’.”The overall oil market impact will probably be limited because Iran is unlikely to escalate the conflict beyond seizing one vessel in retaliation, he said, adding that companies will work hard to avoid being targeted.The ship, registered in the Isle of Man and flying under the British flag, had been chartered by Royal Dutch Shell Plc to transport crude from Basrah to northwest Europe, tracking data and shipbrokers said. It didn’t collect that cargo and the booking was canceled.British Heritage won’t be able to exit the Strait of Hormuz, the chokepoint through which about a third of global seaborne oil moves, without sailing close to Iran’s coast, thereby placing it at greater risk.Legal IssuesTensions between Iran and the U.K. may remain high until the legal issues surrounding the arrest in Gibraltar are smoothed out, Jakob said. That could take months, according to Anna Bradshaw, a partner at the law firm Peters & Peters, who specializes in sanctions.Tensions have escalated since the U.S. resumed sanctions on Iran, prompting the country to say it would enrich uranium in defiance of a global pact that was meant to stop that from happening.Iran may choose to enrich uranium at a higher purity level as its next step in a new policy that’s gradually undoing the restrictions imposed by a 2015 nuclear pact with world powers, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Monday, citing Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran.The escalation has heightened the risks for shipping companies exporting crude from the Persian Gulf. Insurance costs for both tankers and their cargoes soared in the aftermath of the attacks, while some wary owners are now choosing to refuel elsewhere.(Updates with analyst comment from fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Ladane Nasseri, Alex Longley, Anthony DiPaola and Sarah Chen.To contact the reporters on this story: Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.net;Serene Cheong in Singapore at scheong20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Alaric NightingaleFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-oil-tanker-shelters-persian-121447050.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-03	2019-07-03 17:40:48	BP	BP p.l.c.	5 Dividend Stocks to Buy From Across the Globe	Most income seekers and retirees have a sort of set playbook when it comes to dividend stocks. They either buy an exchange-traded fund that's heavy in dividend stocks like the iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:DGRO) or they stick to a few well-known dividend stocks like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). And there's nothing wrong with that approach. You certainly can get plenty of income and total return potential from going this route. But income seekers may want to move outside their comfort zone.Specifically, I'm talking about dividend investments that are outside of the U.S.The truth is, some of the best dividend stocks can be found outside the United States. The world is filled with a variety of strong multinational and international leaders. Even better is that valuations for many global stocks are lower than the U.S., while dividend yields are higher.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe yield on the internationally focused MSCI EAFE Index is about double that of the S&P 500. That should be music to an income seeker or retirees' ears.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice In the end, going global can result in some wonderful dividends stocks. With that, here are five international dividend stocks to buy today. Unilever (UL, UN)Dividend Yield: 2.96%Suave soap, Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, Q-tips … these are all brands most people are familiar with. In fact, you probably use some of these brands yourself. That goes to show just how powerful and big Unilever (NYSE:UL, NYSE:UN) is. The firm is a consumer products powerhouse and features 400 different brands and sales in more than 190 different countries.This portfolio of brands continues to pay some big results for UL and its bottom line. Sales continue to rise, jumping 3.1% during the first half of the year. That's not bad for a firm the size of Unilever. The firm has more than 10 brands that generate more than $1 billion in annual sales. So, this is a big ship. Moreover, emerging markets make up a ton of those sales. Here, UL continues to see plenty of growth and high single-digit sale boosts.The future looks rosy for Unilever as well. The firm has announced that it's doing away with its Anglo-Dutch dual share listing and moving to a single share structure. This will reduce costs. Moreover, the firm has undergone some strategic reviews and it has pruned itself of underperforming brands to improve margins and profits.All of this will translate into continued dividend strength. Since moving to a quarterly payout back in 2010, UL has managed to boost its payout by around 90%. This is a testament to its huge portfolio of brands and continued rising sales.Today, Unilever yields nearly 3% making it a top dividend stock to buy. Royal Bank of Canada (RY)Dividend Yield: 3.8%One of the most under-owned nations on the planet happens to be our neighbors to the North. For some reason, Canada isn't included in many international indexes. That's a real shame as the country features plenty of leading dividend stocks and multinational giants.This includes banking giant, the Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY).Historically, Canada's banks have been more conservatively run than U.S. ones. This has been the case for RY for decades. The firm's continued focus on risk management has allowed it to skate through various financial downturns relatively unscathed. Both the Great Recession and the recent Oil Bust didn't affect the bank's bottom line or financial position. This fact has allowed RBC to pay dividends for more than 100 years and keep its payout steady during both crises.But RY isn't a stodgy, old fuddy-duddy. In fact, Canada's banks were some of the first to embrace consumer technology, mobile banking, apps and A.I. Partnerships with tech for its small businesses, enterprise and wealth management divisions have directly boosted retention and overall usage, with digital payments at the bank are surging. All of these digital initiatives have paid off in a big way -- with RY now realizing more than $15 billion in annual revenues. The best part is that RBC now expects to pull in three times the number of new clients as a result of these moves. That'll only grow its base even more.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for A Summer Rally For dividend seekers, RY blends the best of both stable revenues with a huge upshot to its growth. With a near-4% yield, it could be one of the best dividend stocks to buy today. GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) Dividend Yield: 5.14%When it comes to dividend stocks, Big Pharma offers some of the biggest yields. And the U.K.'s GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK) offers a juicy 5.14% payout. GSK features a robust portfolio of consumer healthcare products with brands such as Aquafresh, Nicorette and Theraflu under its umbrella. However, the firm is also a prescription drug powerhouse with several blockbusters under its belt. Likewise, it has a huge vaccine business that it contains to generate steady revenues.All of this has made GSK a big-time dividend player throughout its history. As a U.K. company, GSK sends out a percentage of profits twice a year, so the amount varies. But it has been steady and consistent.But dividend and growth seekers have a lot to like about GlaxoSmithKline. That's because GSK is currently merging its consumer health division with Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE). This separate company will feature a massive portfolio of brands and produce plenty of stable cash flows. Meanwhile, the remaining biopharma company will feature a robust pipeline of new cancer fighters and other drugs. Investors will be able to get the best of both worlds -- growth and income -- from GSK.Buying GSK today, investors get a seat at the table and the ability to score a high yield. BP PLC (BP)Dividend Yield: 5.85%For a long time, BP (NYSE:BP) was the whipping boy of the energy patch. The Deepwater Horizon spill was horrific and cost billions upon billions of dollars in legal fees, damages and fines. Because of that, BP was pretty much dead for years. But lately, the energy giant has returned to its former glory days … at least in terms of dividends and growth.Thanks to the costs related to the spill, BP was forced to become &quot;lean and mean.&quot; That meant selling underperforming and non-core assets, spinning out its logistics infrastructure and reducing its overall debt load. All of this has made the firm a much better run energy stock than before. The results of this made themselves known last summer, when BP actually started to pull in some serious cash flows, Now, BP's operating cash flows currently cover its CAPEX spending and dividend payments when oil is around $50 per barrel.However, with continued technology improvements, BP estimates it should reduce its breakeven price to about $35 per barrel by 2021. With new major finds in the Gulf of Mexico, an increase in onshore shale drilling and other moves, BP is back on the prowl. Since suspending its dividend during the spill, BP has been able to increase its payout by 47% and completely end its so-called script dividend program, which paid investors shares rather than cash.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks With Critical Levels to Watch With a near-6% yield, BP makes a strong contender for investors looking for international dividend stocks. iShares International Dividend Growth ETF (IGRO)Dividend Yield: 2.87%Perhaps the best way to get a dose of international dividends is to own them all. We mentioned the popular DGRO ETF in the opening slide. That fund also has an international sister -- the iShares International Dividend Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IGRO).Similar to DGRO, IGRO tracks a basket of international dividend stocks. The key for the ETF is that it's not just about the payout, but the ability to grow that payout over time. The ETF's index screens for stocks that have been increasing dividends for at least five years straight. A second screen is used to ensure that firms aren't overreaching their ability to pay. Stocks with payout ratios of above 75% are removed. This leaves you with a basket of 408 different dividend stocks. There is some emerging market exposure, but developed markets garner the bulk of assets.Top holdings include pharma giant Sanofi (NYSE:SNY), consumer products superstar Nestle and tech firm Samsung.In terms of performance, IGRO hasn't been bad. The ETF is relatively new -- only opening shop in mid-2016. Since then, it has managed to produce a near-7% return annually. That's not too shabby. Moreover, IGRO yields a very healthy 2.87%. And as a member of iShares core group of funds, expenses for the ETF run at a dirt cheap 0.22%.All in all, when it comes to getting broad exposure to international dividend stocks, IGRO could be one of the best and cheapest ways.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

BP Says Some of Its Oil ‘Won’t See the Light of Day’	(Bloomberg) -- Oil companies are under increasing pressure to bring fuel to market faster and cheaper, leading BP Plc to conclude some of its resources “won’t see the light of day,” according to its head of strategy.Some of the “more complicated to extract” resources in the British oil major’s portfolio may have to be sold or stay in the ground, said Dominic Emery, the company’s group head of strategy. They’re going to be too expensive and too time-consuming to get out, and the industry is under pressure to shorten the duration and size of projects, he said.Part of the shift is due to climate change, which has caused investors to pressure BP to stick to lower-carbon projects. It’s also due to an oil price that’s half what it was five years ago, meaning some projects “simply don’t make money.”“There are classes of resources that are kind of much further out and more complicated to extract,” Emery said in an interview. “There’s no doubt that some of those resources won’t come out the ground.”Emery didn’t quantify the volume of BP’s resources that may stay put. The oil major said in an investor presentation last year it has 25 billion barrels of resources, 40% of which have been “booked and proved.” Emery said only unproved oil resources are at risk of being stranded.While he also didn’t clarify which resources are the most complicated to extract, research from consultants Rystad Energy AS and Wood Mackenzie Ltd. tend to point to ultra-deepwater, remote or extremely carbon-heavy projects, such as oil sands, as the longest-term and most expensive.A report from Wood Mackenzie showed that under a business-as-usual scenario, the call on oil that hasn’t yet been discovered will reach 16 million barrels a day by 2040. In that context, current spending on exploration “looks about right” to meet demand.However, under a scenario where the world cuts carbon from the energy system faster, the adoption of electric vehicles, biofuels and other competing energy sources may cut two-thirds of that oil demand. The report recommended companies stick to projects with shorter time horizons.To cope with the risk, BP has limited exploration spending and is mostly focused on investing in shale and fields near existing infrastructure, Emery said. He added that it isn’t necessarily the end for oil mega-projects, but there will probably be fewer of them in the future.BP’s position reflects spending in the industry overall, which slowed down sharply after an oil-price crash in 2014 and has plateaued over the past three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.In May, BP agreed to a request from its shareholders for greater detail on how each new capital investment decision is in line with the Paris climate accord, an international agreement that seeks to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. During its annual general meeting, some shareholders suggested they’re pushing behind-the-scenes for BP to stick to cheaper projects. Cost can be a proxy, albeit imperfect, for projects that have a lower carbon intensity.Emery said BP “has been working on that over the last few months” to fulfill the request and will share some initial results later this year.(Updates with information on industry spending in 10th paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Helen Robertson, Alaric NightingaleFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-says-oil-won-t-230100553.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-12	2019-06-12 16:25:44	BP	BP p.l.c.	Oil’s 2019 Weakness Has Roots in 2018’s Strength	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Oil has a demand problem. You can see it, most obviously, in headline crude oil prices, which slumped again Wednesday morning. You can see it in Asian refining margins and physical premia. You can see it in Saudi Arabia’s efforts to maintain supply cuts, rapidly turning into an oily version of Dylan’s Never Ending Tour.You can also see it in some historical figures in BP Plc’s Statistical Review of World Energy, the annual data bible that dropped on Tuesday. Looking at numbers for 2018 and prior years might seem superfluous to judging what’s happening in 2019. Moreover, the headline growth figure for 2018 of 1.4 million barrels a day, or 1.5%, is pretty robust. Its fragility lies beneath.BP breaks out figures for almost 80 individual countries, but only three really counted last year:That just three countries can pull global demand along may seem comforting to oil bulls. But it’s a narrow group to rely on, especially when two members are engaged in a trade war. Manufacturing indicators have weakened for all three in recent months, and vehicle sales have been particularly bad in India and China. Meanwhile, the U.S., which reports the most timely and transparent data on oil flows, reported another increase in inventories Wednesday – and that follows an extraordinary build-up in stocks of crude and refined products in May.In light of all that, it should worry oil bulls that demand growth across the rest of the world altogether vanished in 2018 – especially as global economic growth is forecast to be slower this year, partly because of that trade war, and the tailwind of exceptionally low fuel prices that prevailed in 2016 and much of 2017 is behind us.The other important aspect revealed in the Statistical Review concerns the types of oil being consumed. BP highlighted the increased importance of lighter liquids such as naphtha and ethane related to petrochemicals in the overall mix. You can see this in the chart below, where “other light distillates” and “other” liquids accounted for 54% of net growth in demand last year. Notice, too, what happened to gasoline and diesel.Naphtha prices have weakened considerably in Asia, along with gasoline. This is partly a function of Chinese refiners staying busy and taking advantage of looser export controls to dump excess products elsewhere in the region (something energy economist Philip Verleger has highlighted in several recent reports centered on the collapse in Singapore refining margins). Naphtha competes with natural gas liquids, and supply of the latter has also surged, largely as a by-product of the shale boom. The U.S., accounting for almost 40% of production, is the OPEC of natural gas liquids – apart from the crucial distinction that it shows no inclination to cut supply despite prices having slumped to their lowest level in more than two years:The thing about excess supply, though, is that it also suggests deficient demand. Coming amid weaker economic data, reliance on petrochemical demand represents a big risk for oil markets this year. It’s worth looking again at the BP data, which show that output from refineries actually increased by less than a million barrels a day in 2018, which also reflects the rising share of lighter liquids. Crude oil demand is ultimately a function of what refiners want to buy and process – they’re the direct customers, not you and me.As I wrote here, after a relatively weak first half, oil bulls’ hopes for 2019 rest largely on the usual seasonal upswing in refining runs in the third quarter. Yet the economic, inventory, and ultimately pricing indicators put that at risk. The International Energy Agency has been slow to cut demand forecasts, finally trimming them last month by a mere 90,000 barrels a day to 1.3 million a day. The IEA will update those later this week, and it will be surprising indeed if another cut isn’t forthcoming. After all, we now know the warning signs have been there since at least last year.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

This New Deal with Russia Makes Alibaba Stock Look Even Better	Back in September, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) announced a joint venture in Russia called AliExpress Russia JV. It now is a done deal. The question is how it might affect Alibaba stock.Source: Charles Chan Via FlickrSo let's take a look at the details: The company, along with the Russia sovereign wealth fund (RDIF), each agreed to invest $100 million and MegaFon (Russia's second largest mobile operator) will sell its 9.97% equity stake in Mail.RU to Alibaba for a 24.3% in the JV.Then Mail.ru will transfer its Pandao ecommerce business and $182 million for a 15% position. By doing this, the JV will have sufficient cash resources but also access to key technology assets and distribution, with access to about 77 million subscribers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Here's what the CEO of Alibaba, Daniel Zhang, said about the deal:&quot;This partnership will enable the AliExpress Russia JV to accelerate the development of the digital consumer economy of Russia and CIS countries in ways that no one party could accomplish alone. Together, we are uniquely positioned to offer consumers in Russia and neighbouring countries an innovative shopping experience by combining social platforms with commerce, as well as enabling regional brands and SMEs to sell their products locally and globally. Alibaba's mission is to make it easy to do business anywhere. This JV is an important part of Alibaba's international expansion and step toward our goal of supporting 10 million small businesses reach profitability and serving 2 billion consumers around the world.&quot;It's true that Russia can be a risky market. Let's face it, the government has a history of periodic interventions, which have resulted in losses for foreign partners. Just look at the challenges that companies like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and BP (NYSE:BP) have had to deal with.But then again, China is a tough market to navigate as well. And for the most part, Alibaba has thrived.Interestingly enough, the U.S.-China tensions may push China toward different alliances, such as with Russia. This would certainly make it more amenable for arrangements like AliExpress Russia JV.Something else to consider: It will get tough for BABA to keep up the growth in its ecommerce segment in the years ahead. While China still has lots of upside, this will likely come from smaller cities, which could be more difficult to monetize. In other words, BABA has little choice but to look at global expansion, even in riskier countries. Bottom Line on Alibaba StockIn the meantime, Alibaba's business is running on all cylinders. For the fiscal year ended March 31, revenues soared by 51% to $56.2 billion and net cash flows came to a hefty $22.5 billion.Although, this should not be much of a surprise as the company has a dominant platform. Note that the retail marketplaces have 654 million annual active consumers and there are 721 Mobile MAUs (Monthly Active Users).But of course, Alibaba stock is more than just about ecommerce. The cloud business, for example, continues to see much traction. During the latest quarter, the revenues for this segment jumped by 76% to $1.15 billion. In fact, BABA is the clear leader in the Chinese market. And as seen with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the cloud business can produce juicy margins.Alibaba stock is also trading at an attractive valuation, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple of about 24X, which is at a steep discount to the growth rate. It is also cheaper on a relative basis to other Chinese ecommerce operators, like JD.com (NYSE:JD), that is trading at 28X and is growing at a slower pace.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

Canadian oil pipeline congestion sets up lucrative storage play	CALGARY, Alberta/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Upheavals in the Canadian crude market are providing unique opportunities for firms with sizeable long-term leases on Alberta storage tanks, a cluster that sources say includes Mercuria Energy Group and oil major BP Plc's trading arm.  Canada holds the world's third-largest crude reserves, but years of delay in building new pipelines has led to oil production outpacing takeaway capacity.  A glut of crude has thus been created, increasing demand for storage tanks in the oil sands province of Alberta, which this year introduced production cuts to deal with the oversupply.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canadian-oil-pipeline-congestion-sets-141114648.html?.tsrc=rss

That's because many investors are on the hunt for dividend stocks to buy that not only appreciate over time but also pay a high dividend. So what is a high-dividend yield stock? One that pays 1%? 3%? 5%? The truth is there is no strict rule. If you are interested in high-yield dividend stocks, it's better to focus on a company's history of growing its dividend rather than just looking for the juiciest dividend yields. That's because dividend yields are often high due to some problem with the business that's knocked its share price lower. That said, if you can find a group of stocks that yield 5% and have demonstrated the ability to grow the annual payment over a decent amount of time, double-digit total returns won't be nearly as difficult to achieve.The trick is finding those stocks. Here are seven high-yield dividend stocks to buy with a payout of 5% or more that I believe can get the job done.

2019-04-16	2019-04-16 15:28:25	BP	BP p.l.c.	Is Chesapeake Energy Stock an Acquisition Target?	Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) stock is a popular name, partly due to its low price tag. After its latest breakdown, though, CHK stock is changing hands for just over $3 per share. After trading below $2 in December and north of $5 last summer, CHK stock has had quite a volatile ride, to say the least.But should  investors should have faith in Chesapeake Energy stock? That question is particularly relevant, considering Chevron (NYSE:CVX) surprisingly  bought Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) for $33 billion, edging out Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) . Some investors are now searching for the next M&A candidate in the space, and many are likely wondering if it's worth holding CHK stock in the wake of the Anadarko deal.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile  Is Chesapeake Energy Stock a Buyout Candidate?Given the Anadarko deal, some may be thinking that CHK is an M&A candidate. While CHK stock price  may be low , and the market cap of Chesapeake Energy  stock is below $5 billion, those numbers are low for a reason. While CHK stock currently has a market cap of $4.97 billion, it has an enterprise value of more than $15.6 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat doesn't mean a deal is out of the picture, but because of CHK's debt load, the number of companies that might be interested in buying it is limited. The company has more than $7 billion of long-term debt, and its current liabilities are almost double the value of its current assets.CHK has reported strong net income, totaling $949 million and $873 million, for the last two years. But its cash flows are not attractive, and Chesapeake has some rather obvious balance-sheet issues. That's not to say management isn't trying or that CHK can't improve. But CHK stock has  been below $10 for almost four years, and it's been a sub-$5 stock for most of the last two, years. That wouldn't be the case if things were going well for CHK.Acquirers can do the math, too. Trading Chesapeake Energy Stock  So is CHK stock breaking down at this point? The action isn't promising, but we're not wheeling out the coffin just yet. From its December lows, Chesapeake Energy stock has done a great job reclaiming its 20-day and 50-day moving averages and riding uptrend support (depicted by the purple line) higher. When Chesapeake Energy stock hit $3.50 earlier this month, the shares were up about 75% on the year.However, that level acted as resistance, which is no surprise given that it has been a relevant support level in the past. When a notable level of support breaks down, it generally turns into resistance and vice versa. The recent pullback from $3.50 was more than just a stall, though. CHK stock quickly tumbled through uptrend support and its 20-day moving average.As a result, those interested in CHK should watch the 50-day moving average and the $3 level. If these levels fail,  CHK stock will be flailing around looking for support, and could fall to $2.50.If the 50-day and $3 level hold though, Chesapeake Energy stock could rally. The first test will be if it can reclaim its uptrend support and the 20-day moving average.Bulls' sights are clearly set on $3.50. It will be critical for CHK stock to get through that level, but the 200-day moving average is also key for CHK. That is where bulls need to be careful with their expectations. In addition to the $3.50 hurdle, CHK stock also has the 200-day overhead, as well as downtrend resistance (depicted by the blue line). Clearing all of those marks will be difficult for Chesapeake Energy stock, to say the least. The Bottom Line on CHK StockMany investors love the fact that CHK stock is a sub-$5 stock with almost $10 billion in sales and a positive bottom line.But it doesn't matter, nor does it matter that Chesapeake Energy stock trades at just over five times its earnings. CHK has balance-sheet issues, and investors who buy CHK stock need to realize this is a speculative holding.Investors who want a safer energy holding should consider Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), BP plc (NYSE:BP), or Chevron, especially if the latter stock drops  down near $108.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-04-15	2019-04-15 14:47:37	BP	BP p.l.c.	Anadarko Deal Puts Chevron Stock on Steroids	It finally happened. After years of speculation, independent E&P firm Anadarko (NYSE:APC) finally caught a buyout bid. As expected, it was from one of the super-majors. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) took the plunge and offered to buyout APC in the sixth-largest oil and gas deal ever. Some analysts questioned what took so long and why now.Source: swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)But investors in Chevron stock should be smiling from ear to ear.For CVX, Anadarko offers the chance to boost several core drilling areas, instantly boost production as well as offer plenty of future synergies. A deal of APC was a long time coming and it was 100% worth the wait for Chevron.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Chevron Stock Scores Big With AnadarkoAnadarko belongs to sort of weird class of energy stock. It's an independent oil and gas firm, meaning it operates in the upstream sector of the marketplace and makes its money by physically drilling for oil. The problem for APC has long been that it's massive. It's seriously one of, if not the largest independent E&P firm out there. Most E&P are small or mid-cap companies. This end of the market-cap/size spectrum makes it easy to grow production/earnings. But when you're as large as APC, that proposition becomes a bit harder.  * 10 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now As a result, Anadarko has struggled since 2014 when oil crashed. It was never really able to move the needle enough to make a real bang with its profits or earnings potential. But it certainly tried and built upon its already world-class asset base.And that is why Chevron is willing to fork over $33 billion -- a 39% premium -- for APC shares. For that purchase price, CVX is actually getting one heck of a deal and it allows it to score on several fronts. The biggest of which starts with the letter &quot;P.&quot;The Permian Basin has become the hotbed of drilling activity in the U.S. and it's easy to understand why. The geology is very rich and bodes itself to horizontal drilling. High production values and low-costs have made it the spot for anybody looking to benefit from shale drilling. These days, shale is more about scale of operations to drive costs even lower. Both Anadarko and Chevron have been very active in the Permian and the deal will connect their acreage together. All in all, by buying APC, CVX will have over 1,400,000 net acres in the rich Permian.Chevron plans on exploiting that connection through new drilling technology and digital analysis to score even more oil production. The best part is, CVX anticipates saving about a $1 billion in costs per year by leveraging this greater scale in the Permian.In addition to those assets, CVX will score around 400,000 acres in the Niobrara/DJ Basin in Colorado. The Niobrara is quickly emerging as a top place for shale drillers to score cheap oil/naturals gas. APC is the leading producer in the region and Chevron will add instant production here. Chevron Scores Big Offshore TooThe next win for CVX in the buyout comes offshore. Anadarko has long been one of the Gulf of Mexico's superstars and features several deep-water fields and wells. Adding APC to its mix, Chevron will now have 16 deep-water hubs in the Gulf -- with many within a 30-mile radius of each other. This is significant as it allows CVX to capitalize on so-called tie-backs and link fields together via existing underwater hubs rather than building new offshore infrastructure.As if that wasn't good enough, CVX scores some major offshore points with its LNG ambitions. Already, Chevron has become a leader in liquefied natural gas. With APC, the energy major now has a huge source to fill those shipments. Back in 2010, APC discovered around 75 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in Mozambique's waters and is quickly gaining customers for this venture. Thanks to Chevron's expertise in this area, APC's Mozambique assets are almost plug and play for the integrated energy giant.  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy as Oil Booms  Chevron Raises the BarFor Chevron, buying Anadarko is a no-brainer. The best part could the actual timing of the deal. Like many of the integrated giants, CVX has seen production dip over the last few years. That's a problem when oil prices are rising as they are now. With the APC buy, Chevron instantly moves the needle today and it has the potential to keep growing in the future. That's very important.The beauty is that APC hasn't been surging on rising oil prices as, again, it was suffering under its immense size. Shares of the firm are down about 30% from its peak. CVX actually bought at a huge discount to what APC might actually be worth.Clearly, it outs CVX in the driver's seat when it comes to the major energy stocks. It also sets up an interesting situation for rivals like Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and BP (NYSE:BP). Like CVX, XOM and BP have seen production stagnate in recent years. With the APC buy, Chevron quickly vaults into the leadership spot. They'll be forced to make deals on their own.In the end, Chevron has smartly bought its way into some great assets that it can use to strengthen production profits and cash flows further. That instantly makes Chevron stock one of the best large energy stocks out there and investors should be pleased.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

At the start of this decade, deep-water drillers and integrated oil and gas firms enjoyed high oil prices. Markets and pundits all predicted oil prices would cross and sustain the $100/bbl level. This forecast proved very wrong. Excessive oil production and exploration led to excess supply and prices plunged.In the last two years, oil prices bounced off multi-year lows and by late last year, investors who bought at the bottom could have locked in gains. So far this year, most mega-cap energy firms are up nicely so investors may question how much more upside remains. With attractive dividend yields at current levels and dividend growth ahead due to higher free cash flow from operations, investing in the energy sector remains bright.  * 7 Marijuana Companies: Which Pot Stocks Should You Buy? If surging oil prices continue, what energy stocks should investors buy?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source: Shutterstock In the major integrated oil and gas segment, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) shares are close to 52-week highs and are trading at around $82. The company updated its growth plans and believes additional upside is possible. It now forecasts earnings growing by over 140% by 2025 from 2017 levels. Previously, it expected growth of 135%. Exxon assumes oil prices are at least $60 per barrel and margins are consistent with 2017 levels. From 2019 through to 2025, cumulative earnings should increase by $9 billion.By 2025, cash flow from operations will reach $60 billion, assuming the $60/bbl oil price and 2017 margin levels. This will result in cash flow from operations adding $24 billion more than previously expected.Successful exploration activities in upstream and in Guyana and Brazil will increase Exxon's resource base by 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels. And in Guyana, Exxon estimates that it has around 5.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels in gross recoverable resource.Exxon gets plenty of analyst coverage, with Tipranks reporting that 14 analysts have an average price target of ~$86 on the stock. Though the implied upside is just 5.6%, investors may start a small position on the stock while collecting dividends yielding 4%. Chevron Corporation (CVX)Source: swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)At the macro level, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) expects a supply gap of 42 mmbd will drive demand through to 2040. To grow its profitability from this demand-supply dynamic, the firm must maintain its cost discipline as it invests to capture more of the market. In the fourth quarter, Chevron earned $3.7 billion, an EPS of $1.95. Cash flow from operations totaled $9.2 billion. It maximized shareholder returns by paying out $2.1 billion and by buying back $1 billion in shares in the quarterly period.Chevron's cash flow growth trends in the last three years suggest that investors will get a stable dividend payout for years to come. In 2018, free cash flow totaled $16.8 billion while the company returned $10.3 billion to shareholders. The cushion of $10.3 billion in cash at the end of 2018 allows Chevron to deliver on four priorities. First, to maintain and grow its dividend, fund capital programs, having a strong balance sheet and to return the surplus cash to investors.Chevron forecasts upstream revenue of 4% -- 7%. Its dividend will increase $0.07, while share repurchase will total $1 billion. The firm's cost reduction trends will continue through 2020, thanks to the use of technology enabling increased efficiencies. Investors expect production costs to fall below the $10 level in 2020, down sharply from around $18 in 2014.  * 9 High-Risk Stocks to Buy for Massive Rewards Based on 15 analysts covering CVX stock, the average price target is $138, which implies that investors could get 10.6% in upside. BP (BP)Source: Shutterstock With a dividend yield of 5.5%, BP plc (NYSE: BP) remains an attractive investment for income investors. The vertically-integrated firm faced negative headwinds in the fourth quarter when Brent crude prices averaged $69 per barrel. This is down from $75 a barrel in the third quarter.BP is comfortable with oil prices at $50 because its books are balanced at that level. But with prices already higher than that, BP thinks $60 is more constructive and that prices will hold high levels. Regardless of energy prices, BP will continue disposing of assets through the back end of 2019 and into 2020. This will improve BP's balance sheet as its debt obligations shrink.Expect BP to build on a strong 2018 performance where it delivered $7 billion in free cash flow. This strong, positive momentum will put the firm on track to deliver on its 2021 targets. This is driven by marketing, continued expansion on its convenience partnership model, and the addition of over $1 billion in earnings growth in the next five years from business improvement plans. ConocoPhillips (COP)Source:  Martijn Koster via FlickrConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) offers a dividend yield of 1.8%. In 2018, COP delivered on its priorities by achieving a 12.6% ROCE, a $15 billion debt target ahead of plan, $3 billion in share buybacks, and returned 35% of cash flow from operations to shareholders.ConocoPhillips reported $4.54 EPS. Free cash flow topped $5.5 billion. Similar to BP selling assets, ConocoPhillips generated $1.1 billion from the disposition in proceeds. Within its portfolio, it completed its acquisition in Alaska and progressed in its exploration and appraisal in Alaska, Montney, and LA Austin Chalk.For 2019, COP is budgeting $6.1 billion for capital expenditures, plans $3 billion in share buybacks, and will deliver a total shareholder payout of over 30% cash flow from operations.  * 3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week COP assumes that each dollar change in the price of WTI crude will have a $30 - $40 million impact on net income. With Brent, the change will have a $155 - $175 million impact on net income. By building a price sensitivity of $45 - $75 on WTI crude, the company will have the flexibility in ensuring cash flow meets dividend and operating cost obligations for the year. Enbridge (ENB)Source: Shutterstock In the oil and gas pipeline subsector, Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) continues to perform well. The company reported strong Q4 results in February. With strong demand for energy, investors should expect the company to continue doing well this quarter and next.Enbridge generated $1.86 billion in distributable cash flow in the quarter and $7.62 billion for the year. EBITDA, which came in at around $13 billion, and distributable cash flow at $7.6 billion translates to $4.42 a share in DCF. In addition to the strong results, Enbridge accelerated its de-levering, streamline the business through cost cuts and efficiency gains and extending growth. Enbridge's de-levering progressed nicely since 2016. Consolidated Debt to EBITDA fell from 6x in 2016 to the 4.5 range in 2018.Enbridge's $9 billion of projects brought into service in 2018 will add meaningfully to results this year. Asset sales will offset EBITDA but ongoing cost management and revenue optimization will lead to another strong year. Last year, Ontario regulators approved a merger between Enbridge and Union Gas. Expect the company to realize synergies from the amalgamation this year.Looking ahead to 2020, expect EPS of $4.85 to $5.15 a share. Much of the 14% EBITDA growth over 2019 comes from the contribution from the Line 3 Replacement project. Free cash flow, net of dividends and maintenance costs, could top $3.5 billion. The $5 billion - $6 billion in available cash will give Enbridge lots of opportunities for deploying available capital in low-risk growth projects. Antero (AR)Source: Andy Arthur via FlickrAntero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) exceeded its operational goals in 2018.In Antero's production growth plans through 2023, the company assumes WTI crude will be in the range of $50 to $65 a barrel. Natural gas will be in the range of $2.85 to $3.15 per MMBtu. The key takeaway from the assumptions is that the company expects volatility in energy prices. But it will carry out projects in a flexible manner. When prices are low, Antero will spend within cash flow constraints and if prices improve, it will grow production to maximize its free cash flow.  * 7 Internet Stocks to Watch For 2019, management will continue to spend its cash efficiently on projects. But the markets are very bearish on this exploration firm: shares are languishing in the $8.30 range and show no sign of rebounding. Antero Resources set a drilling and completion capital budget of $1.3 billion to $1.45 billion. Transocean (RIG) Source: Katie HauglandVia FlickrTransocean (NYSE RIG) has divested 12 ultra-deepwater, 37 deep-water/midwater, and 15 jackups since 2014. It has liquidity of $3.2 billion and $12.3 billion in backlog. That the company's debt is too high is both a blessing and a curse. At current oil prices, Transocean is pressured to sell down assets to pay down its debt levels. But as prices improve, Transocean's levered balance sheet could result in relatively better results.Transocean has an estimated $12.3 billion backlog, 95% of which are with investment-grade companies. Although backlog is $2.4 billion this year and next, it will fall to $1.3 billion by $2023. Improving drill rates and energy demand could, over the next few years, drive backlog levels higher.With the markets still unfavorable for Transocean, the company must preserve EBITDA through the cycle. Still, Transocean's recent acquisitions will firm up day rates. It acquired Ocean Rig, Sonza Offshore, and took a 33% joint venture interest in Transocean Norge.Analysts are bullish on RIG stock and collectively have an average price target of $11.33 a share. At a recent price of $8.33, the potential upside for holding the stock is 29%.Disclosure: Author owns shares of Transocean and BP plc.

2019-04-12	2019-04-12 12:40:03	BP	BP p.l.c.	Moral Questions Have Little to Do with Amazon Stock	I didn't intend to discuss Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos' morality or lack thereof when I caught the ecommerce company assignment. However, one of my most recent articles discussed the very same thing only Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was the topic du jour. I looked at whether Facebook was morally bankrupt and how it might affect FB stock. I concluded that people are morally bankrupt, not companies. From that perspective, the fact that Amazon employees are upset about its involvement with the oil industry, I just had to assess the possible damage to Amazon stock.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives  Amazon Stock and Jeff Bezos' TroublesMore than 5,200 Amazon employees signed a letter addressed to CEO Jeff Bezos and the board April 10 that appeared in Medium. It highlighted their concerns about the company's cozy relationship with the oil industry. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe letter from the employee group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, pushed for the company to adopt an aggressive plan to tackle climate change:&quot;Amazon has the resources and scale to spark the world's imagination and redefine what is possible and necessary to address the climate crisis. We believe this is a historic opportunity for Amazon to stand with employees and signal to the world that we're ready to be a climate leader,&quot;It goes on to suggest that the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has an oil & gas initiative that helps companies like BP (NYSE:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) accelerate the speed at which they extract oil from the ground. The group believes that fossil fuels should remain in the ground. It proposes Amazon adopt six specific principles to address the global climate crisis. At the very least, these large employee cohort believes the company should not be in bed with Big Oil. &quot;Amazon absolutely should not be helping oil and gas companies extract oil from the ground,&quot; said Emily Cunningham, a user experience designer at the company.Jeff Bezos' recent and very public difficulties regarding his now open relationship with former news anchor Lauren Sanchez should have been a tipoff to investors that the world's richest person might not be super worried about morality. It's likely he won't care what his employees think about AWS' involvement with BP and Shell and the rest of the oil & gas industry. If he did, he wouldn't have let Andy Jassy, the head of AWS, speak at CERAWeek in Houston.  Morality and Amazon StockFull disclosure: I'm not religious. I do believe there's a spiritual power in the world and know the difference between right or wrong but feel investors have no business in the bedrooms of America. Bezos can do what he darn well pleases. It's not going to affect my life one bit. However, a person like Mike Pence, who's religious to the point of alienating the entire LGBTQ community in the great state of Indiana, is likely to have a problem with Bezos' actions while married to another woman. It's said he wouldn't have dinner alone with any woman who isn't his wife. I guess Mom's out of the question. The question of Bezos' morality is a lot dicier because it depends on your perspective.Jeff Bezos is one of the most brilliant people on the planet. It's hard to imagine that he doesn't know the difference from wrong or right. He does, or he wouldn't have been so amicable in his divorce proceedings. It's possible that he sees the company's work with the oil & gas industry as a job-saving technique. Faster extraction of oil means lower costs, higher profits, more jobs. On the flip side, he has to know fossil fuels are on their way out. Maybe not in his lifetime, but sometime in the not-too-distant future. Amazon has many stakeholders. Bezos is beholden to all of them. I don't think he'll move on the employees' call to action simply because they have spoken out. Like every decision he makes, I'm sure it involves a lot of reflection. Those are the hallmarks of a thoughtful person, not someone who's amoral or immoral.  The Bottom Line on Amazon StockAs the richest person in the world, Bezos attracts a lot of attention, something to which most of us can't relate. Therefore, I don't think any inaction on the part of the company on the climate front will hurt Amazon stock in the near term. However, if the company continues to mistreat a segment of its employees by overworking and underpaying them, that has the possibility of destroying shareholder value. Do I think the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice should give up their cause?Hell no. That said, I don't believe Amazon stock will be affected whether Jeff Bezos is proven to be any of the above. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-29	2019-03-29 17:51:01	BP	BP p.l.c.	Best Stocks for 2019: Viper Energy Stock Has Fangs	Editor's note: This column is part of our Best Stocks for 2019 contest. Neil George's pick for the contest is Viper Energy Partners (NASDAQ:VNOM).The InvestorPlace stock picking contest for 2019 is a showcase of ideas from the collection of editors and contributors. And it also demonstrates the process each different person uses to come up with a company.My recommendation is for Viper Energy Partners (NASDAQ:VNOM), which year to date is up in price by 27.7%. And with its dividend yielding 6.1%, the total return to date is over 29%. This compares to the price gain of the S&P 500 Index of 12.8% and a total return of 13.4%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsViper Energy Compared to the S&P 500 Index Total Return Source BloombergThis contest isn't about throwing darts but showcasing how ideas are generated and why. And in the process, throughout the rest of the year, you'll get a better feel for how each of us work.At Profitable Investing, one of my core mechanisms for finding the best stocks for growth and income is finding economic, market or even social or political developments that will spur more demand for specific goods and services.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business I do this by consuming a great deal of news from numerous daily papers, constant streaming of BBC World Service and Bloomberg Television, subscribing to many industry and professional journals and, of course, being glued to my Bloomberg Terminal with all of its analytical and data tools.When I find some developments that support more demand, I drill down and find the companies that are best focused to capitalize on that pending new demand. Then I identify the leaders and vet them to find the best of the best. I go through those to determine which will be sales growth leaders while watching for those with the best and most improving margins. After that, I ask what will go wrong to dampen future sales or result in higher costs. And I run what ifs to see how they will cope with challenges. And finally, I put my banker hat on and look at the debts of the companies.At the end of this process I determine if I would lend to this company. And if not, then I have no business recommending it as a buy for you.Viper Energy ticks all the boxes in a market with positive developments. And as a landlord of the petroleum market -- it is a unique company in that it doesn't drill or operate oil and gas equipment -- only collecting lease income and royalty payments.Read on to see how and why I recommend the company and its stock. Petrol is PowerfulPetrol is a big part of the U.S. and global economy, and that's why we have a collection of up, down and midstream petroleum companies inside the model portfolios of Profitable Investing. And like most market segments, the market for petroleum and the underlying companies and their stocks never moves in a continuous straight line.But as I've been writing in Profitable Investing this year and over the past year, there are some major overriding developments that favor profitability for US petroleum companies. And to start, all it takes is to look at price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. Since 2016, the market for U.S. crude oil has gone from a low of $35.70 to a current level of $60.01 a barrel for a gain of 68.1%.US WTI Crude Oil Price Source BloombergThe price, of course, was higher in October, but with the sell-off in the general stock market, oil slipped to a near term low on Dec. 24 -- corresponding to the lows in many of the stock market indexes.But like for stocks, the realities of a growing U.S. economy and profitability of U.S. oil companies at even lower crude prices has been supporting the underlying market. And note, as I've written, the much lower crude oil prices five years and more ago worked to drive U.S. producers and related companies to increase technology in the fields to drive down lift costs for crude. This means that U.S. companies can pump crude at lower costs so that margins at sale can be positive even with lower market prices.This had been leading to a continued upward march in U.S. production, which since 2016 has soared by more than 33%.US Crude Oil Production Keeps Climbing Source BloombergAnd according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), this continued climb in production should result in that the US will be a net oil exporter by 2021.Adding to the positive market developments are that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries plus Russia and other nations (OPEC+) continue to largely adhere to production cuts, resulting in the proven data from shipping records of December 2018 showing production cuts of 1.2 million barrels per day (MBPD), with only Russia and Iraq showing some slippage in their cuts. More Crude on the MoveWhat has been a limitation for U.S. crude has been domestic stockpiles of stored crude. One of the big limitations has been the infrastructure to move crude to refineries and marine terminals for export. But as I've been writing, the approval process for additional pipeline capacity has been stepped up with pipeline companies continuing to add capacity to move stuck crude to the market.This now is showing up with the dramatic drop in U.S. stockpiles of crude as tracked by the EIA. The stockpiles are now down to lows not seen since last June and may well head lower with the further developments in transportation.US Crude Stockpiles Down West Texas WTI Up Source EIA, BloombergThis drawdown in stockpiles is showing up in the export market. And what is particularly interesting is how much more U.S. crude is being shipped to Europe. Over the past five years, U.S. crude exports have gone from zero to nearly 1.4 billion barrels according to records from the U.S. Census Department.US Crude Exports to Europe Source US Census, BloombergThis surge in U.S. crude in Europe is now driving the price of European crude prices. For North Sea crude prices set at ports in the Netherlands, Argus Media (Private), a business intelligence analytics company, is stating that one third of the time, U.S. crude imports in Europe are driving the prices for European crude oil.That puts U.S. producers further on the way to narrowing the price discount of WTI in the U.S. to the higher Brent crude prices. And this in turn, should help to increase the margins for U.S. producers and related companies. Globe Takes More than MakesNow, OPEC+ isn't going to limit production forever. However, there are some reasons to see limits in their capacity to bring significantly more crude oil to the market. First, Iran remains under U.S. sanctions with no daylight in negotiations in sight. And waivers are running out, particularly with more availability of U.S.-exported oil such as what is now surging to Europe and noted above.In addition, even if other major former producers get sorted out politically -- they will take years to get back into the oil business. This includes the imploding nation of Venezuela, the broken-apart Libya as well as the very unsettled West African nations including Nigeria.Second, as I wrote in the September Issue, Saudi Arabia and Russia are both post peak in production with the major fields in Saudi Arabia being drained with dropping reserves.Meanwhile, the globe's demand for crude oil remains firmly on the ascent. And even with rising U.S. production and exports, there continues to be shortfalls in supply against global consumption of crude oil. The EIA tracks overall supply and consumption and as the graph shows -- consumption keeps peaking over supply on an ongoing basis over the past many years.And add in the U.S. drop in stockpiles -- and the supply and demand statistics favor supported crude oil prices.Global Oil Supply (White) Global Oil Consumption (Gold) Source EIA Bloomberg My Permian PlayThere are many companies, from upstream producers through midstream pipelines and downstream refiners, that are benefiting from the petroleum market developments that are underway.But the company that is right at the source of all of this additional U.S. production of oil and gas is Viper Energy, which I hold in one of the model portfolios of Profitable Investing.Viper Energy is the leading landlord of the petroleum patch primarily in the Permian Basin which is at the center of the shale oil development in the U.S. market. As a landlord, the company doesn't drill or operate a single well -- but instead, leases out its land for exploration and development companies (E&P) for fee income and royalties on the oil and gas that gets pumped out of its land.This means little capital is needed beyond the land. And it means that the company doesn't have to worry as much about the price fluctuations in oil and gas for its operations. But of course, the higher the price of crude and the higher the price for natural gas -- the higher in royalties and the higher the income.It has a large collection of operators on its land including Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), BP (NYSE:BP), XTO Energy, EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) and many others. Each and all continue to develop leased properties.Since coming to the public market in 2014 through a drop-down of assets from Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) in which it took land assets and set up Viper to manage and own the properties while taking and keeping an ownership stake in the company, the proven developed reserves of petroleum have climbed by 764%. And royalty income per acre of its land has grown by 368%.Overall oil and gas produced on Viper's land was up 63% in 2018. And the company is projecting that on an organic basis (meaning existing land statistics and not counting additional land and land development that production will climb at least by 24% for 2019.In addition, Viper completed an extra share sale this year. That additional cash is going to expand its land properties. And with Diamondback having much more land it its existing assets -- there is more room for a further drop down for more productive petroleum land in its portfolio. This will mean more growth potential for leases and royalty income. Venom Stock for Better ReturnsTotal Return for Viper Energy Source BloombergViper Energy has been a good performer. Over the trailing year, the stock has generated a total return of over 58%, including its ample and rising dividend. And this even includes the slip with the general stock market in the fourth quarter of last year.But since Dec. 24, 2018 to date, Viper has soared by 46% reflecting the realities of the economy and the market for high and rising royalty income from its leased lands. VNOM Stock by the NumbersViper, as noted above, is working well as a landlord. Revenues for the trailing year are up by 67.90%. And since it doesn't drill or pump oil -- its operating margin is a whopping 70.30%. This in turn drives a great return on shareholders' equity of 20.60%. It has gobs of cash and its debts are at a minimal 24.8% of its valuable assets so its credit is very good.Then we come to that nice dividend. The current distribution is at 51 cents which has been climbing over the last three years by an average annual gain of 37.32%. That distribution equates to a yield of 6.19%. And in recent tax filings, even though Viper changed from a passthrough to a taxable entity effective on May 10, 2018 the dividends paid on  August 20 and November 19, 2018 have been deemed as return of capital.The stock has been performing and paying well. And yet, the shares are reasonably valued with a price to book at nearly 3.19 times. This is down from over 4.5 times book seen earlier last year. And more important, the underlying book value per share has climbed over the past year by 36.36% meaning that the underlying value of the book of assets is up and growing and not just the stock price.Now that the additional shares have been placed in the market successfully, the stock makes for a continued good buy for growth and income under $38.00 per share.Neil George is the editor of Profitable Investing and does not have any holdings in the securities mentioned above.

The 63-year old, who took the helm shortly after the 2010 deadly Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, has overseen a large expansion in the company's production in recent years.

[$$] BP Beats Forecasts with Return to Profit	The London-listed oil company posted $2.72 billion in fourth-quarter replacement cost profit--a figure similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report--which compared with a replacement cost loss of $583 million in the year-earlier period.  BP said Tuesday that after stripping out one-off items its underlying replacement cost profit for the three months ended Dec. 31 rose to $3.48 billion from $2.11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017.

2019-02-01	2019-02-01 13:43:49	BP	BP p.l.c.	ConocoPhillips Stock Is a Growth and Income Double-Whammy	"ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has been around since 1875, doing pretty much what it does today -- it looks for oil (and natural gas, nowadays), produces it, then ships it to refiners and then sells the component parts.

COP isn't a completely integrated big oil like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) or BP PLC (NYSE:BP) but it has built a solid niche and knows how to get through good and bad times.

It also has expanded its operations around the world from its Texas home, although it is a significant player in the U.S. energy patch, having been one of its pioneers over 100 years ago.

Oil prices now sit in the low $50's, and nowadays, that's a decent price -- it's cheap enough for consumers in the U.S. but is still profitable for producers. This wasn't the case a few years back, when Saudi Arabia drove the price of oil down dramatically to run U.S. oil firms out of business.

Since then, exploration and production (E&P) firms have automated their operations and now have better margins, which gives them better downside protection.

  * 7 Stocks With Too Much Riding On China 



At this point, U.S. production is humming along and as the economy continues to recover, demand will also continue to rise. Right now it's in a sweet spot where margins are solid for E&P firms and prices are helping consumers and businesses.

But beyond the U.S. demand, the rest of the world is also looking for more energy, and they pay handsomely for oil and natural gas. And this is where COP's global strategy gives it an opportunity beyond the domestic market. It can supply into overseas markets from overseas facilities. This makes delivery easier and helps keep margins strong by shortening the supply chain.

The other strength COP brings to the table is its healthy mix of oil and natural gas operations. In 2017, oil made up about 50% of the company's production. Natural gas made up 38%. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) made up about 7% and bitumen (basically asphalt, which is derived from petroleum products) made up 5%.

Having this balance means COP isn't too heavily weighted into either energy market. That's a good thing when we're in the kind of economy we're in right now.

Companies are continuing to transition to natural gas from coal because it's a more efficient fuel, which means it's cheaper to burn. And it's cleaner, which means it's easier to keep the equipment that burns it operational.

Also, natural gas prices in Asia and Europe are several times higher than they are in the U.S., so the margins are incredible. Because COP stock has global distribution channels it can take advantage of these pricing disparities much better than US-focused companies.

And as an established energy company with a $78 billion market cap, it is shareholder friendly. It delivers a 1.8% dividend and the stock is up more than 8% in 2019.

While that kind of growth won't be typical, it will be a solid grower with a solid dividend as long you need gas in your tank or flames on your stove.

2019-01-10	2019-01-10 16:20:20	BP	BP p.l.c.	5 “Discounted” Oil Stocks to Buy After a Tough 2018	"Amid the uproar over the wildly unstable markets, the usual suspects like technology or retail garnered the most attention. However, the deterioration in oil stocks presents one of the more troubling economic indicators. While drivers appreciate the discount at the pump, a deflated energy sector typically means a slowdown in commerce.

That said, the benchmark indices have witnessed a sharp rise in sentiment. For instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained over 3% this month. Likewise, oil and energy stocks have benefited the most from the resurgence. West Texas Intermediate is up over 14% in January, while the international benchmark Brent Crude Oil jumped 13%.

Still, I'd take a cautious approach to oil & gas stocks at this juncture. Countries awash in &quot;black gold,&quot; such as Saudi Arabia, are attempting to diversify their economies away from commodity dependency. They know firsthand the threat that suddenly declining prices pose. Further, efforts to artificially raise demand with production cuts have failed.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But on the flipside, energy stocks offer longer-term opportunities, if you know where to look. A major oversight is the focus on quantity and not quality. For example, shale-derived oil is too light to meet industrial demand for diesel. Therefore, demand for midstream and downstream oil stocks can jump when the supply of appropriate commodities dwindles.

Under the current environment, upstream oil & gas stocks present challenges. However, this segment shouldn't be ignored. Proven companies that profit from their exploration dollars could move higher, especially if the newfound bullishness in oil sustains itself.

  * 10 Key Emerging-Market Stocks to Buy for Contrarian Investors 



Undoubtedly, this is a tricky segment. But if you have the nerve, here are five oil stocks to consider:

### BP (BP)

Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr

Drilling for oil is a centuries-old business. As such, it's easy to think that the industry remains an unsophisticated, crude affair, no pun intended. However, energy stocks are rapidly becoming dependent on innovative technologies, with BP (NYSE:BP) lending a recent example.

A few days ago, BP announced that it discovered one billion barrels of crude in the Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, the company hit pay dirt at its Thunder Horse field, which is located off the tip of Louisiana.

But what made this announcement distinct was how BP made its discovery: Using advanced seismic technology and data processing, BP accelerated its analytics. Management stated that using prior-generation tech, the Thunder Horse finding would have taken years. Now, it takes just weeks.

Of course, upstreaming is risky in a volatile market due to the expenses involved in exploration efforts. But BP's seismic tech sounds like a gamechanger that separates it from lesser oil stocks.

### Kinder Morgan (KMI)

Source: Roy Luck via Flickr

Part of the complexity involved in assessing energy stocks is the underlying product diversity. For instance, different oil viscosities lend to variances in performance and functionality. At its most elemental level, oil and gas products serve specific needs. Understanding these nuances can help navigate you toward the best investment.

With that in mind, if I had to make a pick among oil & gas stocks, I'm putting Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) on my short list. In recent years, natural gas production has skyrocketed in the U.S. This has created a viable market that didn't previously exist in such scale.

As a result, Kinder Morgan's midstream operations should continue to enjoy long-term demand. While KMI has exposure up and down the supply chain, its network of gas pipelines primarily rings the cash registers. Loosely speaking, the company operates a subscription business model: clients pay KMI based on the amount of gas sent through the pipelines.

No matter what happens to natural gas prices, transportation of energy-related commodities will remain a vital business venture.

### Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP)

Source:  Tony Webster via Flickr

Over the last few volatile years, most oil stocks simply operated on survival mode. After absorbing devastating losses in 2014 and 2015, most sector players' financials look understandably awful.

On the other hand, we have exceptions like Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP). Since 2015, MMP has provided consecutive annual revenue growth, and momentum remains strong. In its most recent quarter, MMP delivered sales of $638 million, up over 11% year-over-year. Moreover, the company generates consistently positive free cash flow and features a fairly stable balance sheet.

Despite the general wildness in oil stocks, MMP should continue to deliver the goods. Management is eyeing overall growth, as evidenced by the constant expansion of its refined-petroleum products pipeline in Texas. More importantly, the organization is broadening its scope while emphasizing fiscal discipline.

### Valero Energy (VLO)

Source:  Mike Mozart via Flickr

Even compared to other troubled energy stocks, Valero Energy's (NYSE:VLO) precipitous downturn surprised many observers. After putting up outstanding numbers throughout most of 2018, the final quarter proved insurmountable. Between the beginning of October and the end of December, VLO had sunk 34%.

But for current speculators, the extreme bearishness in Valero shares have taken down significant risk. For starters, we have to go back to November 2017 to see prices this low. More importantly, management has sparked a fiscal revival. Thanks to key acquisitions, Valero's revenue and profitability metrics have improved dramatically since 2016.

  * 7 Stocks at Risk of the Global Smartphone Slowdown 



I see more of the same in 2019, especially with its merger with Valero Energy Partners. Overall, the organization has solid financial standing, which has proven valuable in terms of shareholder payouts.

### Occidental Petroleum (OXY)

Source:  Hayden Irwin via Flickr

Like other energy stocks, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) incurred a disjointed year in 2018. In the first half, OXY appeared very promising, gaining over 15%. Unfortunately, sector turbulence combined with a broader market meltdown cratered the company.

After the dust settled, OXY had shed more than 13% last year. Still, I wouldn't rule out a comeback. Since hitting a sales bottom in 2016, Occidental has been on a tear. Prior acquisitions have proved vital, with OXY returning to annual profitability in 2017, and is on course for a repeat performance in 2018.

Moreover, the leadership team have anticipated multiple oil-pricing scenarios. Should a barrel of crude drop to $40, OXY asserts that it can pay its dividends, and not overspend its cash flow. The sector is volatile, but I doubt that it will get that bad. Therefore, OXY presents an intriguing contrarian case.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

## Analysts’ ratings for integrated energy companies

In the previous article, we began reviewing integrated energy companies’ analyst ratings ahead of their fourth-quarter earnings results. We compared the overall ratings of four companies: ExxonMobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A), BP (BP), and Chevron (CVX). We also looked at analysts’ rating details for Shell and Chevron.

Now let’s look at analysts’ rating details for BP and ExxonMobil.

## Why are analysts’ opinions on BP divided?

Analysts’ opinions on BP are divided likely due to the company’s high earnings growth expectation and weak debt position. In 2018, analysts expect BP’s earnings to rise ~96%, which seems achievable given its higher upstream and stable downstream earnings in the first nine months of the year. In the same period, BP’s adjusted earnings more than doubled YoY (year-over-year).

However, BP’s debt ratio (total debt-to-total capital) of 38% stood higher than those of its peers in the third quarter. ExxonMobil’s, Chevron’s, and Royal Dutch Shell’s ratios stood at 17%, 19%, and 28%, respectively, in the quarter. Analysts may keep their “hold” and “sell” ratings for BP until the company’s debt ratio plunges below the peer average.

BP’s mean target price stands at $49 per share, implying a potential 23% rise from its current level.

## ExxonMobil’s high “hold” and “sell” ratings

ExxonMobil is a financially healthy company with a comfortable debt position and an excellent liquidity position. In fact, in the third quarter, ExxonMobil had the lowest total debt-to-total capital ratio in the industry. Also, the company had surplus cash from operations after covering its capex and dividend payments in the first nine months of the year.

However, ExxonMobil stock is trading at a premium to the peer average. It has a forward PE of 13.9x, the highest among its peers. Presumably due to its premium valuations, many analysts have rated the stock as a “hold” or a “sell.”

Mostly flat performance through most of the year turned into a tailspin in October as oil prices plunged from above $75 per barrel to below $50. That in turn has pinched oil companies that rely on elevated commodity prices to drive larger profits.

The headwinds are clear. Demand has slowed to a crawl, and supplies have piled up despite production cuts from several nations. Fears about U.S.-China trade relations have weighed, as have worries about sanctions on Iran.

It's no wonder why energy stocks have taken it on the chin.

But the skies are starting to clear as we head into 2019. OPEC and other nations are beginning to discuss additional output curbs, and with U.S. shale producers running at full capacity, there really isn't much room for them to pick up any slack. The U.S. and China have made progress on trade talks, too, including a 90-day moratorium on increasing tariffs.

Investors diving into the sector still need to be choosy. A rebound in oil is far from a certainty, which means it's necessary to put a premium on quality right now. Here, we look at the 10 best energy stocks to buy for 2019 - those that can best take advantage of the current energy environment.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Analysts’ ratings for integrated energy companies

ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A), and BP (BP) have been analyzed by 22, 23, 11, and 11 analysts, respectively.

Of the total analysts rating each stock, 32%, 78%, 82%, and 55% have rated ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, and BP as “buys,” respectively. We’ll look at the details of Shell and Chevron in this article and the details of BP and ExxonMobil in the next article.

## Shell has the most “buy” ratings

Shell has received the most “buy” ratings among the integrated energy stocks under review. Shell’s mean target price is $79 per share, which implies a ~31% rise from its current level—the highest implied gain among the four companies.

Shell’s financials have been strengthening. In the third quarter, its adjusted earnings rose 35% YoY (year-over-year). Its total debt also reduced by $10 billion YoY in the third quarter—a vast improvement. The company’s total debt-to-total capital ratio and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood below the peer averages, implying a comfortable debt position.

## Chevron’s analyst ratings

Chevron has the second-best debt position in the industry. Its cash flow position improved in the first nine months of 2018. The company’s cash flow from operations rose 51% YoY to $21.5 billion in the first nine months of the year due to higher upstream earnings led by higher realizations and record volumes.

This volume growth indicates that Chevron’s capital-intensive megaprojects, such as Gorgon and Wheatstone, have now started yielding results, making its upstream portfolio and production healthier. Stronger cash flows also led to the initiation of its share buyback program, resulting in rising shareholder returns.

Chevron’s mean target price is $140 per share, which implies a potential ~26% rise from its current level.

The company claimed breathlessly this week it has found &quot;a billion barrels of oil&quot; in a previously explored region 150 miles south of New Orleans, and plans to spend $1.3 billion pumping as much as 38,000 barrels per day from it next year. The field is called Thunder Horse.

The usual suspects insist this makes BP stock a &quot;buy.&quot; 

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But is this a good place to invest your money? BP stock is dirt cheap, with a market cap of $134 billion on what could be $300 billion of 2018 revenue, while Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is worth $305 billion with almost the same revenue.

Bargain, right? Not necessarily.

### BP's Condition Today

BP's books show $55 billion in long-term debt, against just $19 billion for Exxon Mobil. CEO Bob Dudley, who was managing director at the time of the 2010 disaster, is crediting &quot;advanced seismic technology&quot; for the new find, but BHP (NYSE:BHP), the minority partner in what's called the Atlantis rig, has yet to make a final decision on new investment.

  * 10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market) 



The Atlantis rig has a lot in common with the one that failed. It operates in over 7,000 feet of water and can produce 200,000 barrels of oil and gas per day from a platform the size of two soccer fields. Dudley insists the production will be wildly profitable, even though there are many other producers there and a 14-year old spill nearby is still leaking. 

In fact, big oil finds are becoming routine. Exxon itself recently began drilling what it calls a 5 billion barrel field off Guyana.  Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A, NYSE:RDS.B) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) also announced major finds in the Gulf of Mexico last year.

New plays in West Texas and New Mexico have added a potential 46.3 billion barrels to the Permian field bonanza, which analysts are calling bad news for OPEC and other exporters.

New technology means oil may not be nearly as rare as people have been suggesting. America's known oil reserves have doubled and the potential global supply could also double.

### The Demand Side

At the same time, demand for oil is peaking. Electric cars are replacing traditional gasoline engines faster than previously estimated. The International Energy Agency, whose 2015 analysis was wildly optimistic on the demand side, now insists planes and ships will keep demand rising into the 2040's, but admits demand from cars should peak in the middle of the 2020's. Italy's gasoline demand has been cut in half over the last decade.

Supplies of renewable energy, mainly solar and wind, should total nearly 16 million megawatts this year, and while incentives to install renewables are going away, costs are falling below those of fossil fuels. The cost of utility-scale solar energy is now down to 3.5 cents per watt and continues to go down.

### The Bottom Line on BP Stock

BP may be partying like it's 1999, but the energy world has changed.

New technology is finding more oil and renewable energy prices are continuing to decline. Yet BP faces the same risks and costs in exploiting its new Gulf of Mexico find as it faced 20 years ago.

  * 7 5G Stocks to Buy as the Race for Spectrum Tightens 



The BP stock price is down 17% over the last five years, while the average stock in the S&P 500 is up 40%. The price of the shares is little changed from where they were in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.

The company's annual dividend of $2.46 per share currently yields 6.45%, and that's good. But that's the only reason you should own BP stock. Despite the hype, talk of oil riches is very 20th century.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Shell comes in last

In this series, we’ve ranked four global integrated energy companies that are likely to see YoY (year-over-year) rises in their earnings in the fourth quarter. Earlier, we looked at Chevron’s (CVX), ExxonMobil’s (XOM), and BP’s (BP) earnings estimates.

Chevron’s earnings are expected to rise 183% YoY in the quarter, the highest among its peers. ExxonMobil and BP are expected to post 33% and 26% YoY rises in EPS in the quarter. In this article, we’ll look at Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDS.A) expected fourth-quarter performance.

## Shell’s fourth-quarter estimates

Shell is expected to post earnings per ADS (American depositary share) of $1.45 in the fourth quarter, ~21% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ~8% higher than in the third quarter of 2018. Shell’s fourth-quarter estimated earnings per ADS are its highest quarterly earnings per ADS since the first quarter of 2016. Shell’s revenue is expected to be ~$95.2 billion in the fourth quarter, 11% higher than its revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Shell’s upstream earnings are likely to be higher due to increased oil prices in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. However, its downstream earnings are expected to fall due to weaker YoY refining cracks in the quarter, which we’ve discussed in earlier articles.

The improvement in Shell’s financials is expected to continue in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, Shell posted a solid set of numbers. The company’s earnings rose, its net debt fell, and its cash flows covered its necessary expenses. Shell is strengthening its financials by lowering its operating costs, optimizing its capital spending, divesting its noncore assets, and executing new projects on time and within budget.

In the upcoming articles, we’ll review analysts’ ratings for these integrated stocks ahead of their fourth-quarter earnings releases.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## The series so far

In the last two articles, we looked at the two highest estimated earnings growth achievers of the fourth quarter, Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM).

Chevron and ExxonMobil are expected to post 183% and 33% YoY rises in EPS, respectively, in the fourth quarter. Now let’s look at the company in the third-place spot, BP (BP).

## BP’s fourth-quarter estimates

As per Wall Street analysts’ estimates, BP is expected to post earnings per ADS (American depositary share) of $0.83 in the fourth quarter, 26% higher than its adjusted earnings per ADS in the fourth quarter of 2017 but 27% lower than its third-quarter adjusted earnings per ADS. BP’s revenue is expected to be ~$74.6 billion in the fourth quarter, ~10% higher than its revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017.

A dollar-per-barrel increase in Brent prices increases BP’s pretax replacement cost operating profit by $340 million annually. In the fourth quarter, Brent crude oil’s price has risen to an average of $69 per barrel compared to $61 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017, which could boost BP’s upstream earnings, assuming there’s no fall in yearly volumes in the fourth quarter.

However, BP’s downstream earnings could fall YoY in the fourth quarter because global RMM (refining marker margins), which are refining margin indicators in the areas in which BP operates, fell yearly in the quarter. As per BP, a dollar-per-barrel change in its RMM changes its pretax replacement cost operating profit by $500 million annually. BP’s RMM fell from $14.4 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $8.0 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Overall, in the fourth quarter, the expected YoY rise in BP’s upstream earnings could be partly offset by the anticipated fall in its downstream earnings.

Next, we’ll look at Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDS.A) earnings expectation for the fourth quarter. Shell stands last among the four integrated companies under review in this series.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Ranking series

In this series, we’re ranking four integrated energy companies based on their estimated YoY (year-over-year) earnings growth. ExxonMobil (XOM) occupies the second-place spot.

In the previous article, we reviewed Chevron (CVX), which is expected to post a 183% YoY rise in EPS in the fourth quarter.

In the third quarter of 2018, ExxonMobil’s earnings surpassed Wall Street analysts’ earnings estimates. Its earnings also rose from $3.97 billion in the third quarter of 2017 to $6.24 billion in the third quarter due to higher YoY upstream and downstream earnings partly offset by lower chemical earnings in the period.

## ExxonMobil’s fourth-quarter estimates

Wall Street analysts expect ExxonMobil to post EPS of $1.2 in the fourth quarter, 33% higher than its adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2017 but 20% lower than its adjusted EPS in the third quarter of 2018. Also, ExxonMobil’s revenue is expected to be ~$81.7 billion in the quarter, ~23% higher than its revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Better oil prices could result in higher upstream earnings for the company in the fourth quarter. Brent crude oil’s price fell from $61 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $69 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2018. Its downstream earnings could be lower due to the fall in refining cracks in the industry. The US Gulf Coast WTI 3-2-1, the benchmark crack, fell 19% YoY in the quarter.

Move on to the next article for a look at the next stock on the list, BP (BP).

## Integrated energy companies’ fourth-quarter estimates

In this series, we’ll rank integrated energy companies according to their estimated YoY (year-over-year) EPS growth in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

The four integrated energy stocks under consideration are ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A), and BP (BP).

If we rank these stocks according to their expected YoY growth in EPS in the fourth quarter, then Chevron occupies the top spot. Chevron is expected to post a massive ~183% YoY rise in its earnings in the fourth quarter. In contrast, Shell occupies the last spot despite the fact that it’s expected to post a 21% YoY rise in EPS in the quarter. ExxonMobil and BP rank second and third, respectively, in terms of the expected rises in their earnings in the quarter.

Three of the four above-mentioned companies are expecting less than 40% YoY growth in earnings in the fourth quarter mainly due to the likely marginal rises in their upstream earnings partly offset by the anticipated falls in their downstream earnings. Oil prices have been higher YoY on a quarterly average basis, but refining cracks have shown weakness, which we’ll discuss in the next few articles.

## Valuations

If we consider the valuations of these companies, ExxonMobil, which is expected to achieve the second-highest earnings growth, stands the highest at a forward PE of 13.9x. ExxonMobil is a fundamentally strong company with low debt and a solid liquidity position. Comparatively, Shell, which is last in terms of earnings growth expectations, has the lowest forward PE at 10.2x. Shell’s debt position has improved, but the company is expected to have relatively low earnings growth in 2018.

BP’s and Chevron’s valuations stand at 11.0x and 13.5x, respectively. BP’s lower valuation is mainly the result of its relatively high debt (total debt-to-total capital ratio). Contrarily, Chevron has the second-best debt position in the industry.

From the next article onward, we’ll look at individual companies’ fourth-quarter estimated earnings, starting with Chevron.

## Integrated energy stocks’ valuations

In this article, we’ll compare the forward valuations of ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A), and BP (BP).

The average forward EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value-to-EBITDA) and average PE multiples of these four companies are 4.9x and 11.6x, respectively.

ExxonMobil stock is trading at a forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple of 6.0x and a forward PE multiple of 13.2x, both higher than the peer averages. Chevron is also trading above the peer averages on both metrics. Shell and BP are trading below the peer averages on both metrics.

## ExxonMobil’s and Chevron’s superior valuations

ExxonMobil has a sound integrated earnings model capable of generating earnings in a harsh business environment. Its strength was reflected in its third-quarter earnings results, wherein its downstream earnings rose, contrary to those of Chevron, BP, and Shell. Its downstream earnings rose because it optimized its supply chain by utilizing its midstream assets to refine crude profitably. This performance demonstrates the strength of the business model built by ExxonMobil over the decades. ExxonMobil also has a healthy upstream portfolio and robust financials, including best-in-class debt and a cash flow surplus.

Chevron has a robust upstream portfolio, which is expected to drive its volume growth. Megaprojects such as Gorgon and Wheatstone have now started delivering results. Chevron expects its volumes to grow ~7% in 2018, at the higher end of its forecast range of 4%–7%. The company also has a sound debt and liquidity position. Wall Street analysts expect Chevron’s earnings to rise 121% in 2018, the highest among its peers.

## Shell’s and BP’s discounted valuations

Shell’s valuations are lower likely due to its lower earnings growth expectation for 2018. Shell’s earnings are expected to rise 29% in 2018, lower than the average growth of 68%. However, Shell’s debt and cash flow positions have improved. It also has a robust upstream portfolio.

BP stock continues to trade below its peer averages, presumably due to its debt and cash flow position. BP’s total debt-to-capital ratio stood above the peer average in the third quarter. BP also clocked a cash flow shortfall in the first nine months of 2018. However, BP has healthy upstream project pipeline that’s expected to bring production growth.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Short interest in integrated energy stocks

In the previous article, we analyzed the institutional holdings in integrated energy stocks. In this article, let’s consider the changes in their short interest.

Short interest changes showed a mixed trend in the fourth quarter. While short interest (percentage of outstanding shares) in ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) rose, it fell in BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A).

Short interest in ExxonMobil rose 0.10 percentage points over October 1 to its latest level of 0.77%. Usually, a rise in short interest implies a rise in the bearish sentiment in a stock. Short interest in Chevron rose 0.13 percentage points to 1.05% in the same period. However, short interest in BP fell 0.04 percentage points over October 1 to its latest level of 0.09%. Short interest in Shell fell 0.05 percentage points over October 1 to 0.16%.

In the fourth quarter, ExxonMobil and Chevron stocks fell 20.5% and 12.5%, respectively. Shell and BP fell 15.9% and 18.9%, respectively, in the quarter.

## Why the changes in bearish sentiment?

Bearish sentiments in ExxonMobil and Chevron likely rose due to the fall in oil prices. Since October 1, WTI, the benchmark oil, has fallen 39.7%. Oil prices are relevant to integrated energy companies, as they’re one of the main determinants of a company’s upstream earnings. The fall in oil prices in the current quarter could mean weaker upstream earnings for integrated energy companies in the fourth quarter.

However, BP stock seems to have been positively affected by other events. In the same period, BP posted robust third-quarter earnings, surpassing estimates. The company also announced an important upstream project update, which included information about Clair Ridge.

In the next article, we’ll compare integrated energy stocks based on their forward valuations.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Institutional holdings in Suncor

Previously, we reviewed Suncor Energy’s (SU) dividend yield, which has surged to 3.9%. Let’s now look at which institutions bought or sold Suncor in the third quarter, based on recent filings. Higher institutional holdings suggest that market participants have a favorable opinion toward the stock. Suncor’s institutional holdings currently stand at ~74%.

## Changes in Suncor’s institutional holdings

In the third quarter, Wellington Management, Fidelity Management & Research, and RBC Global Asset Management reduced their holdings in Suncor, while The Vanguard Group raised its holdings. These institutions are the top four holders of Suncor stock. Of the next six top holders, five (Fidelity Investments Canada, Capital Research Global Investors, Invesco Advisers, Dodge & Cox, and TD Asset Management) reduced their holdings. Therefore, eight of Suncor’s top ten institutional holders reduced their holdings in the third quarter.

## Peers’ institutional holdings

Suncor’s institutional holdings are higher than those of peers—ExxonMobil’s (XOM), Chevron’s (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDS.A), and BP’s (BP) are ~55%, ~67%, ~11%, and ~13%, respectively. Next, we’ll look at changes in Suncor’s short interest.

Analysts say markets are getting support from both a planned 1.2 million barrel per day production cut from OPEC members, which kicked in earlier this week, a bigger-than-expected fall in domestic stockpiles just prior to the Christmas holiday and reports that Saudi Arabia has slowed production over the final two months of last year.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6b0d7b04-eb02-384d-b1c6-c67510a7ea41/oil-extends-gains-as-china.html?.tsrc=rss

Oil Prices Drift Lower as US Drillers Add Rigs Amid OPEC Concern Over Cut Plan	Global oil markets extended declines again Monday, taking crude prices to the lowest levels since July of last year, even as OPEC leaders vowed over the weekend to extend their planned production cuts if they fail to re-balance global crude stocks.  Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, fell more than 10% last week to trade at the lowest levels since the summer of 2017 amid concern that a slowing world economy, coupled with record output from the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia, would continue to offset the 1.2 million barrel per day output cut agreed by OPEC members earlier this month in Vienna.  Against that backdrop, which has seen crude fall more than 38% since its early October peak, the United Arab Emirates energy minister told an industry conference Sunday that OPEC could re-visit its production cut agreement if it doesn't have an impact of prices.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6df94351-a999-30a7-a43d-35c7bf575dca/oil-prices-drift-lower-as-us.html?.tsrc=rss

Oil Continues Plunge to Fresh 16-Month Lows as Fed Move Ripples Through Markets	Global oil prices extended declines Wednesday, taking U.S. crude to the lowest levels since August of last year, as investors reacted to sharp pullbacks in stocks markets around the world following last night's surprisingly hawkish rate hike from the Federal Reserve.  The Fed's decision to lift its benchmark Fed Funds rate for the fourth time this year, while signalling two more hikes in 2019 and the continuing run-off of its $4 trillion balance sheet, has raised concern among global investors that tighter financing conditions in the world's largest economy will hamper growth prospects both at home at elsewhere.  Energy investors, in particular, are worried that a corresponding fall in oil demand will be compounded by record output from the world's largest producers, adding to a glut in global crude that will offset plans by OPEC to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day next year.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3f99c47c-941b-3e96-a1b9-67c0c97afd3e/oil-continues-plunge-to-fresh.html?.tsrc=rss

It could have used the output from the neighbouring area, the Deltana Platform's fourth block off Venezuela's eastern coast, to feed its growing operations on the island, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly.

[$$] Shell Lifts Profit, Reinforcing Industry Strength	LONDON—Royal Dutch Shell PLC on Thursday reported a surge in profit and cash flow for the third quarter, capitalizing on stronger oil prices, though investors remained wary amid the recent period of oil-market turbulence.  Shell said its quarterly profit on a current cost-of-supplies basis—a number similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report—was $5.6 billion, up from $3.7 billion a year earlier.  Investors, still burned from the sharp decline in oil prices in 2014, have taken a tough line on such surprises in recent quarters.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5189dab9-be93-370d-9ae2-2e5a00b1dee2/%5B%24%24%5D-shell-lifts-profit%2C.html?.tsrc=rss

BP Profit Smashes Estimates on Eve of Giant Shale Oil Deal	Key InsightsAdjusted net income was the highest since 2012 and Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said the shale acquisition will “transform” the company’s position in the U.S. However, abandoning plans to fund part of the BHP Billiton Ltd. deal with shares leaves BP relying on oil prices remaining in their recent range.It will also mean gearing, the ratio of net debt to equity, will edge above the company’s target of 30 percent in the first quarter.  BP said gearing should fall back toward the middle of its 20 to 30 percent target range by the end of next year.  Market ReactionBP shares rose 4.1 percent to 557.1 pence as of 8:04 a.m. in London, the biggest jump in a year.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-profit-surge-smashes-estimates-071712370.html?.tsrc=rss

[$$] BP Earnings Soar on Stronger Oil Prices	said Tuesday its profits more than doubled in the third quarter, as strong oil prices put big oil on track to deliver record levels of cash this year.  London-based BP said its replacement cost profit—a number analogous to the net income that U.S. oil companies report—was $3.1 billion in the third quarter, compared with $1.4 billion in the same period a year earlier.  Years of cost-cutting caused by the slump in oil prices are beginning to pay dividends for the industry’s giants as the market rebounds.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/335d806e-25d4-3d4e-8759-af743aeb4a1d/%5B%24%24%5D-bp-earnings-soar-on.html?.tsrc=rss

Underlying replacement cost profit jumped to $3.84 billion, the highest quarterly figure in five years, from $1.87 billion in the same quarter last year.  Oil companies are profiting after they cut costs and sold assets to adjust to an era of lower oil prices when crude dropped below $30 a barrel in January 2016.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-giant-bp-says-3q-earnings-more-double-074627867--finance.html?.tsrc=rss

The British oil giant said its replacement cost profit--a number similar to the net income that U.S. companies report--for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to $3.09 billion, from $1.38 billion in the year-earlier period.  The company said it expects to fund its acquisition of BHP’s onshore U.S. oil and gas units entirely in available funds, reflecting confidence in its cash generation, rather than using equity for the deserved consideration.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6902b4f4-9a8a-3d0f-8f33-eea2efd95b24/%5B%24%24%5D-bp-earnings-more-than.html?.tsrc=rss

FOCUS-Exxon Mobil bets big on China LNG, sidesteps trade war	HOUSTON/SINGAPORE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - In the middle of a  Sino-U.S. trade war, the world's largest publicly traded oil and  gas company is turning toward Beijing for business at a time  when most of Corporate America is looking elsewhere to avoid the  threat of tariffs.  Exxon Mobil Corp is placing big bets on China's  soaring liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, coupling  multi-billion dollar production projects around the world with  its first mainland storage and distribution outlet.  Its gas strategy is moving on two tracks: expanding output  of the super-cooled gas in places such as Papua New Guinea and  Mozambique, and creating demand for those supplies in China by  opening Exxon's first import and storage hub, according to an  Exxon manager and people briefed on the company's plans.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-exxon-mobil-bets-big-112841814.html?.tsrc=rss

The sale ends a disastrous seven-year investment by BHP in the shale business, which investors led by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management have been pressing the company to jettison for the past 18 months.  BHP first acquired shale assets in 2011 for more than $20 billion with the takeover of Petrohawk Energy and shale gas interests from Chesapeake Energy Corp, but suffered as gas prices collapsed, forcing it to book massive writedowns.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-buy-u-shale-assets-011826364.html?.tsrc=rss

BP pays $10.5 bln for BHP shale assets to beef up U.S. business	BP Plc has agreed to buy U.S.  shale oil and gas assets from global miner BHP Billiton  for $10.5 billion, expanding the British oil major's  footprint in oil-rich onshore basins in its biggest deal in  nearly 20 years.  The acquisition marks a big turning point for BP since the  Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010,  for which the company is still paying off more than $65 billion  in penalties and clean-up costs.  In a further sign of the upturn in its fortunes, BP said it  would increase its quarterly dividend for the first time in  nearly four years and announced a $6 billion share buyback, to  be partly funded by selling some upstream assets.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-fetches-10-8-bln-001216409.html?.tsrc=rss

BP bets on electric car switch with Britain's Chargemaster	BP is buying Britain's top electric vehicle charging firm Chargemaster and will initially roll out its ultra-fast chargers across its filling station network in the UK before turning its attention to China's rapidly growing market.  Oil and gas major Royal Dutch Shell and carmakers Volkswagen and Daimler have also made investments in the electric vehicle (EV) market, whose growth is being driven by a shift from polluting fossil fuels.  Like its rivals Shell and France's Total, BP is planning to use its vast global network of filling stations to carve out a position in the EV market, with demand for petrol forecast to peak as early as the end of next decade.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-bets-electric-car-switch-100435993.html?.tsrc=rss

The stock hit a two-year high of £6.58 on April 21, 2010, the day after the Deepwater Horizon explosion, which killed 11 and sent oil spewing into the Gulf  of Mexico, resulting in the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/4e1f443b-e259-3ee7-89b8-d6248baeee44/%5B%24%24%5D-bp-shares%2C-boosted-by.html?.tsrc=rss

PRESS DIGEST- Financial Times - Feb 7	BP Plc's fourth-quarter earnings more than quadrupled  from the year before as the UK oil and gas group benefited from  higher crude prices and a surge in production from new projects.  A multimillion pound criminal trial of three former Tesco  Plc executives accused of fraud and false accounting in  a 250 million pound ($349.05 million) scandal at the retailer  has been abandoned after one of the defendants had a heart  attack.  Tronc Inc is expected to sell the Los Angeles Times  to Patrick Soon-Shiong, the pharmaceuticals billionaire who  invested in the U.S. publisher in 2016, capping a tumultuous  period for its flagship newspaper.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-digest-financial-times-feb-010920557.html?.tsrc=rss

BP's profits surge as it leaves downturn behind	BP's profits more than  doubled in 2017 to $6.2 billion powered by higher prices and  output of oil and gas, allowing the company to resume share  buybacks as it recovers from a three-year downturn.  The company will be able to generate profits in 2018 at an  oil price of $50 a barrel, Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary  told Reuters, as years of spending cuts kicked in and as it  slowly shakes off a $65 billion bill for penalties and clean up  costs of the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill.  With a 20 percent bounce in oil prices in the last quarter  of 2017 to $61 a barrel, BP had a surplus of cash that allowed  it to buy $343 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter,  offsetting the scrip dilution.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bps-profits-surge-leaves-downturn-093203431.html?.tsrc=rss

BP sets $1.5 billion charge for U.S tax changes but sees long-term boost	Oil giant BP will take a one-off $1.5 billion charge to adjust to new U.S. tax rules, but expects a long-term boost from the corporate-friendly tax rates, it said on Tuesday.  BP's rival Royal Dutch Shell said last week it would incur a one-off charge of $2-$2.5 billion for the U.S. tax changes.  Like BP, Shell and many other international companies said they expected a long-term positive impact to U.S. earnings from the massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law last month.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-sets-1-5-billion-043229872.html?.tsrc=rss
