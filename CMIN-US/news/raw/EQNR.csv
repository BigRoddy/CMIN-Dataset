2021-05-29	2021-05-29 04:00:00	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Racing for Hydrogen: How Gas Giants Are Vying to Stay Relevant	(Bloomberg) -- The global gas industry is in an existential race: either find a way to be part of the next generation of energy or risk getting supplanted by alternatives.BP Plc, Sinopec, Equinor ASA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are among the producers looking to hydrogen to help secure demand that otherwise may falter as decarbonization speeds up. They want to utilize existing pipelines, storage tankers and fuel supply to make blue hydrogen, a process that uses natural gas but captures the carbon emissions and stores them.The straightest route to net-zero emissions uses hydrogen produced by renewable electricity -- known in the industry as green hydrogen -- but the blue variety is expected to be cheaper until at least 2030 as wind and solar power ramp up. Gas companies aiming to lower emissions now and avoid obsolescence next decade are planning to pour billions of dollars into building their blue businesses. At least 15 projects are scheduled to go online through 2027 in the U.K., Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden and New Zealand.“Green is the destination, but we’ll get there on a blue highway,” said Al Cook, executive vice president for development and production at Stavanger, Norway-based Equinor. “At some point, green hydrogen might well be lower cost than blue, but that will likely not be for at least a decade.”Clean hydrogen could meet a quarter of the world’s energy needs by 2050, with annual sales reaching 630 billion euros ($770 billion). Production of blue needs to be scaled up quickly because projects that don’t come online by 2030 risk becoming uncompetitive, according to BloombergNEF.Right now, hydrogen is expensive to make without expelling greenhouse gases, is difficult to store and is so highly combustible that NASA uses it to propel rockets into space.Still, demand is expected to increase six-fold by 2050 as the transportation, steel and chemicals industries move to reduce pollution, the International Energy Agency said in its road map for net-zero emissions published May 18.Natural gas is used in almost all hydrogen production today. That earns the disdain of ESG investors, environmental groups and governments trying to slow climate change because the most common method, called steam-methane reforming, also produces large amounts of carbon dioxide, which are dumped in the air.The quickest way to remedy that is by capturing the carbon and storing it underground or reusing it. The process has been around for decades, and it’s usually deployed in natural gas plants, fertilizer manufacturing and ethanol production facilities.Gas currently is cheaper than renewable electricity, giving blue hydrogen an advantage even with the added costs of carbon capture and storage.Bolting on carbon capture means blue hydrogen projects can be rolled out at scale from day one, said Paul Bogers, vice president for hydrogen at Shell. The Netherlands-based company is involved in several, including the U.K.’s Acorn Project and Net Zero Teesside, both scheduled to go online in 2025.“Industry by industry, you’ll see that the mix of where blue and green can be applied, and where it’s affordable, will be different,” he said. “It’s not as simple as saying: ‘Well, here’s the crossover, so from that point you only invest in one.”Swapping gas for hydrogen is one way energy companies could advance their efforts to meet increasingly strict mandates for lowering emissions. Shell previously pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% within a decade, but a court in The Hague ordered the company on May 26 to slash them by 45% in the same time period.China is the world’s largest producer of hydrogen, mostly by using fossil fuels. Spurred by the nation’s target for carbon neutrality by 2060, China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, said it plans to have a 1 million-ton carbon capture project by 2025.China also will cooperate with Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil producer, on blue-hydrogen projects.The urgency for gas companies stems from the near-universal backing for green hydrogen, made from water and renewable electricity. The cost of green hydrogen is expected to fall 80% by 2030 and be cheaper than blue in all 28 markets analyzed by BNEF as renewable energy and the electrolyzers using it to make hydrogen both come down in price.Iberdrola SA, Europe’s biggest utility, is focusing on renewable power and green hydrogen, bolstered by Spain’s commitment to spend 35 billion euros of EU stimulus on energy transition. American industrial giant Cummins Inc. said May 24 it will partner with Iberdrola to build a factory in central Spain for making electrolyzers.“In the short term, there are opportunities in which you can apply blue, but in the midterm -- five to 10 years -- it’s going to be a stranded asset,” said Diego Diaz Pilas, head of new ventures at Iberdrola.The European Commission wants to see as much as 470 billion euros of investment in the green hydrogen industry, with the goal of making 10 million tons by 2030 to help reach net-zero by 2050.Natural gas pipelines could be converted to carry hydrogen, with Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany leading the way, EC gas official Bartlomiej Gurba said at a January conference.“We are ready to grant subsidies for green hydrogen,” Germany’s deputy economy minister, Elisabeth Winkelmeier Becker, said in an interview. “Other hydrogen will certainly continue to be used, but its production will not be subsidized.”At the moment, though, some companies will take whatever color hydrogen they can get. CF Industries Holdings Inc. is one of the world’s biggest producers of ammonia used in fertilizers and chemical manufacturing.The Deerfield, Illinois-based company uses gray hydrogen, made from natural gas but releasing greenhouse gases. It now buys permits to cover emissions from U.K. production plants in Ince and Billingham, but it’s preparing to implement carbon capture as permit prices keep rising, Chief Executive Officer Tony Will said in an interview.Such transitions are important for getting the clean hydrogen market off the ground, said Daryl Wilson, executive director of the Hydrogen Council. The industry group’s members include gas giants, automakers and Microsoft Corp.“The marginal cost of converting gray hydrogen into blue hydrogen is much lower than jumping to green hydrogen directly,” Wilson said. “As long as blue hydrogen is useful from an economic point of view, there is no reason for it to go away.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/racing-hydrogen-gas-giants-vying-040000558.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-30	2021-04-30 06:47:00	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Correction: Equinor first quarter 2021 results - regarding the attached English press release	The attached English version of the press release (“Press release Equinor first quarter 2021 results.pdf”) wrongly contained information on page 5. The attachment has now been replaced with the correct version. * * * Equinor (OSE: EQNR, NYSE: EQNR) reports adjusted earnings of USD 5.47 billion and USD 2.66 billion after tax in the first quarter of 2021. IFRS net operating income was USD 5.22 billion and the IFRS net income was USD 1.85 billion. The first quarter of 2021 was characterised by: Strong results due to price recovery, sustained cost improvements and strict capital discipline.Very strong cash flow and a 7.1 percentage points reduction of adjusted net debt ratio to 24.6%.Solid operational performance and high production efficiency. Some impact from Covid-19 and restrictions on projects in execution.Significant gain of USD 1.38 billion from farm downs in offshore wind assets.Cash dividend of USD 0.15 per share. “With sustained improvements and capital discipline, we are able to capture value from recovering oil and gas prices and achieve our best quarterly results since 2014. We deliver a net cash flow above 5 billion dollars and reduce our adjusted net debt ratio to below 25 percent. The forceful response and solid operational performance delivered by our organisation during the pandemic is providing for a strong position for safe operations, value creation and cash flow generation in 2021 and going forward,” says Anders Opedal, President and CEO of Equinor ASA. “Equinor aims to be a leader in the energy transition and during the quarter we strengthened our position within offshore wind with the awarded offtake contracts from New York State for Empire Wind 2 and Beacon Wind 1. We also booked capital gains of around 1.4 billion dollars from farm downs, demonstrating our ability to create value from accessing and maturing renewable projects. Within low carbon solutions we have started construction of the Northern Lights terminal and secured funding for three low carbon projects in the UK,” says Opedal. Adjusted earnings [5] were USD 5.47 billion in the first quarter, up from USD 2.05 billion in the same period in 2020. Adjusted earnings after tax [5] were USD 2.66 billion, up from USD 0.56 billion in the same period last year. Higher realised prices for gas and liquids positively impacted the results from all upstream segments, further supported by sustained costs improvements and strict capital discipline. Results from the Marketing, midstream and processing segment were impacted by losses on derivatives for gas forward sales, shut down of the Hammerfest LNG plant and weak refinery margins. The Renewables segment delivers strong financial results with a capital gain from farm downs of around USD 1.4 billion, included in both IFRS and adjusted results, from the divestments of a 50% non-operated interest in the offshore wind projects Empire Wind and Beacon Wind in the US and a 10% equity interest in the Dogger Bank A and B in the UK. IFRS net operating income was USD 5.22 billion in the first quarter, up from USD 0.06 billion in the same period in 2020. IFRS net income was USD 1.85 billion in the first quarter, compared to negative USD 0.71 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Net operating income was impacted by higher prices for gas and liquids, gains from transactions, and lower impairments of USD 0.43 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Equinor delivered total equity production of 2,168 mboe per day in the first quarter, down from 2,233 mboe per day in the same period in 2020. Shut down of the Hammerfest LNG plant and maintenance at Peregrino were partially offset by higher flex gas volumes, increased gas volumes from the US onshore and increased production from Johan Sverdrup and Snorre Expansion. Equity production of renewable energy for the quarter was 450 GWh, down from 558 GWh for the same period last year, impacted by lower winds than expected for the season. At the end of first quarter 2021, Equinor has completed 5 exploration wells with 4 commercial discoveries and 11 wells were ongoing. The 4 discoveries at the Norwegian continental shelf have added around 60 million boe net to Equinor near existing infrastructure. Adjusted exploration expenses in the first quarter were USD 0.23 billion, compared to USD 0.30 billion in the same quarter of 2020. Cash flows provided by operating activities before taxes paid and changes in working capital amounted to USD 6.62 billion for the first quarter, compared to USD 4.50 billion for the same period in 2020. Organic capital expenditure [5] was USD 1.96 billion for the first three months of 2021. At quarters end, net debt to capital employed(1) was 24.6%, down from 31.7% last quarter. Including the lease liabilities according to IFRS 16, the net debt to capital employed(1) was 30.6%. The board of directors has decided a cash dividend of USD 0.15 per share for the first quarter 2021. The safety statistics for the first quarter of 2021 indicate fewer serious incidents and personal injuries in Equinor compared to the same period last year. The twelve-month average Serious Incident Frequency (SIF) for the period ending at 31 March was 0.5 for 2021, down from 0.6 in 2020. The twelve-month average Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) for the period ending at 31 March was 2.3 for 2021, down from 2.4 in 2020. * * *(1) This is a non-GAAP figure.

2021-04-29	2021-04-29 04:44:00	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Equinor first quarter 2021 results	Equinor (OSE: EQNR, NYSE: EQNR) reports adjusted earnings of USD 5.47 billion and USD 2.66 billion after tax in the first quarter of 2021. IFRS net operating income was USD 5.22 billion and the IFRS net income was USD 1.85 billion. The first quarter of 2021 was characterised by: Strong results due to price recovery, sustained cost improvements and strict capital discipline.Very strong cash flow and a 7.1 percentage points reduction of adjusted net debt ratio to 24.6%.Solid operational performance and high production efficiency. Some impact from Covid-19 and restrictions on projects in execution.Significant gain of USD 1.38 billion from farm downs in offshore wind assets.Cash dividend of USD 0.15 per share. “With sustained improvements and capital discipline, we are able to capture value from recovering oil and gas prices and achieve our best quarterly results since 2014. We deliver a net cash flow above 5 billion dollars and reduce our adjusted net debt ratio to below 25 percent. The forceful response and solid operational performance delivered by our organisation during the pandemic is providing for a strong position for safe operations, value creation and cash flow generation in 2021 and going forward,” says Anders Opedal, President and CEO of Equinor ASA. “Equinor aims to be a leader in the energy transition and during the quarter we strengthened our position within offshore wind with the awarded offtake contracts from New York State for Empire Wind 2 and Beacon Wind 1. We also booked capital gains of around 1.4 billion dollars from farm downs, demonstrating our ability to create value from accessing and maturing renewable projects. Within low carbon solutions we have started construction of the Northern Lights terminal and secured funding for three low carbon projects in the UK,” says Opedal. Adjusted earnings [5] were USD 5.47 billion in the first quarter, up from USD 2.05 billion in the same period in 2020. Adjusted earnings after tax [5] were USD 2.66 billion, up from USD 0.56 billion in the same period last year. Higher realised prices for gas and liquids positively impacted the results from all upstream segments, further supported by sustained costs improvements and strict capital discipline. Results from the Marketing, midstream and processing segment were impacted by losses on derivatives for gas forward sales, shut down of the Hammerfest LNG plant and weak refinery margins. The Renewables segment delivers strong financial results with a capital gain from farm downs of around USD 1.4 billion, included in both IFRS and adjusted results, from the divestments of a 50% non-operated interest in the offshore wind projects Empire Wind and Beacon Wind in the US and a 10% equity interest in the Dogger Bank A and B in the UK. IFRS net operating income was USD 5.22 billion in the first quarter, up from USD 0.06 billion in the same period in 2020. IFRS net income was USD 1.85 billion in the first quarter, compared to negative USD 0.71 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Net operating income was impacted by higher prices for gas and liquids, gains from transactions, and lower impairments of USD 0.43 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Equinor delivered total equity production of 2,168 mboe per day in the first quarter, down from 2,233 mboe per day in the same period in 2020. Shut down of the Hammerfest LNG plant and maintenance at Peregrino were partially offset by higher flex gas volumes, increased gas volumes from the US onshore and increased production from Johan Sverdrup and Snorre Expansion. Equity production of renewable energy for the quarter was 450 GWh, down from 558 GWh for the same period last year, impacted by lower winds than expected for the season. At the end of first quarter 2021, Equinor has completed 5 exploration wells with 4 commercial discoveries and 11 wells were ongoing. The 4 discoveries at the Norwegian continental shelf have added around 60 million boe net to Equinor near existing infrastructure. Adjusted exploration expenses in the first quarter were USD 0.23 billion, compared to USD 0.30 billion in the same quarter of 2020. Cash flows provided by operating activities before taxes paid and changes in working capital amounted to USD 6.62 billion for the first quarter, compared to USD 4.50 billion for the same period in 2020. Organic capital expenditure [5] was USD 1.96 billion for the first three months of 2021. At quarters end, net debt to capital employed(1) was 24.6%, down from 31.7% last quarter. Including the lease liabilities according to IFRS 16, the net debt to capital employed(1) was 30.6%. The board of directors has decided a cash dividend of USD 0.15 per share for the first quarter 2021. The safety statistics for the first quarter of 2021 indicate fewer serious incidents and personal injuries in Equinor compared to the same period last year. The twelve-month average Serious Incident Frequency (SIF) for the period ending at 31 March was 0.5 for 2021, down from 0.6 in 2020. The twelve-month average Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) for the period ending at 31 March was 2.3 for 2021, down from 2.4 in 2020. * * *(1) This is a non-GAAP figure.

It will provide enough power for 6 million U.K. homes when the project is completed later this decade.The companies have divided the project into three 1.2-gigawatt sections. The current sale will be for a stake in the final 1.2-gigawatt area known as Dogger Bank C.Each company is expecting to sell 10% of its stake in the project, as they did last year when they sold a combined 20% stake in the first two phases of the project to Italian oil company Eni SpA for 405 million pounds ($560 million). The ultimate decision to sell will be for each party to decide, an SSE spokesperson said.A spokesperson for Equinor declined to comment.(Adds detail in second-to-last paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sse-equinor-kick-off-stake-185618851.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-19	2021-03-19 06:58:00	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Equinor annual and sustainability reports for 2020	Today 19 March Equinor ASA (OSE: EQNR, NYSE: EQNR) presents its 2020 annual report and form 20-F, and its 2020 Sustainability report. “2020 was an extraordinary year with the pandemic causing human suffering and market turmoil. I am impressed by our employees’ hard work during this year, to keep people safe and operations running. We delivered solid operational performance during this demanding year, but our results were heavily impacted by the low prices for oil and gas,” says Anders Opedal, President and CEO of Equinor ASA. There was unprecedented volatility and decline in prices during the year, caused by the Covid-19 pandemic especially during the first half. In March, Equinor launched a 3-billion-dollar action plan to strengthen financial resilience. Delivery on the plan resulted in savings of USD 3.7 billion, including a reduction in fixed operating costs of around USD 1 billion. Equinor is positioning itself to create value and be a leading company in the energy transition and took major steps in 2020 to shape the future of the company. “We are preparing for a future that will be different from the past. Equinor aims to be a leading company in the energy transition and to build the energy industry of tomorrow,” says Opedal. Annual report In the Annual report for 2020, a new outline of the report and a table with more information on a country-by-country basis are added to facilitate a better overview of key events and results for 2020. IFRS net operating income was negative USD 3.42 billion and the IFRS net income was negative USD 5.50 billion. The results are impacted by lower prices and impairments mainly due to reduced future price assumptions. Equinor delivered adjusted earnings(1) of USD 3.49 billion before tax and USD 0.92 billion after tax, mainly adjusted for net impairments. In 2020, the cash flow from operations after tax amounted to USD 10.9 billion. As a reaction to the market uncertainty, and to further strengthen financial resilience, Equinor reduced its cash dividend significantly and suspended share buy backs under the share buy-back programme in the spring of 2020. Total capital distribution to shareholders for the year was USD 3.39 billion. For the full year, the serious incident frequency was 0.5, down from 0.6 in 2019. The total recordable injury frequency was at 2.3, down from 2.5 in the previous year. “Although we observed a positive trend in some of our safety indicators, serious incidents at our onshore plants are a stark reminder that we need to further improve our safety performance. Together with our suppliers and partners, we must ensure implementation of existing safety initiatives and focus on extracting learnings from previous incidents,” Opedal writes in the letter. Equinor’s management and external auditors have in accordance with requirements for SEC reporting companies assessed and concluded that Equinor’s internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2020 was not effective due to control deficiencies related to two specific areas. Equinor is actively undertaking remediation efforts to address the two material weaknesses. The auditors have provided an unqualified audit report on the consolidated financial statements. Sustainability report The 2020 Sustainability Report offers an overview of how Equinor works with its most material sustainability impacts. Sustainability is embedded in Equinor’s strategy, and the company is committed to long term value creation inspired and guided by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. “Society has to move towards net-zero emissions, and we aim to be a committed partner on that journey. Equinor has set clear ambitions for the future and we are delivering strong progress to achieve them,” says Opedal. In 2020, Equinor’s (scope 1 & 2) greenhouse gas emissions were 1.4 million tonnes lower than in 2019, due to energy efficiency projects, changes in the portfolio and lower activity level. The average C02 intensity of Equinor’s operated portfolio was 8.0 kg CO2 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe), down from 9.5 kg per boe in 2019. Going forward, Equinor expects fluctuations in the upstream carbon intensity from year to year, but the long-term direction towards lower emission intensity is clear. Renewables and low carbon solutions projects accounted for 4% of Equinor’s gross capex in 2020. The renewable share of all projects sanctioned, and investments committed in 2020 was around 60%. The company is reporting on new metrics on climate, security, human rights, and diversity & inclusion in the 2020 report. The material topics are also more clearly linked to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.

While the company, like other energy majors, has been hit by last year's fall in oil and gas prices, Equinor's new head of international business, Al Cook, said it lacked scale in the U.S. shale market and had underestimated the strength of local competition.  Equinor disposed of its operated shale assets in the Eagle Ford in 2019, and last week said it had agreed to sell its assets in the Bakken shale oil province in the states of North Dakota and Montana for around $900 million.	https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-equinor-considers-more-us-123936979.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-10	2021-02-10 16:34:24	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Oil Rallies With U.S. Supply Drop Further Draining Global Glut	(Bloomberg) -- Oil extended its longest winning streak in two years in New York as a decline in U.S. crude inventories further showcased how global supplies are shrinking.Futures rose almost 1% after a U.S. government report showed domestic oil stockpiles fell by 6.6 million barrels to the lowest since March 2020. Still, the data showed gasoline supplies are at the highest since June, while crude exports fell to the lowest level in weeks.“It was good to see the crude draw wasn’t just from one area, but constructive that it was throughout the whole U.S.,” said Brian Kessens, a portfolio manager at Tortoise, a firm that manages roughly $8 billion in energy-related assets. “If there was one thing to be concerned about, it was that gasoline inventories built.”Oil has climbed more than 9% so far this month as the OPEC+ alliance’s supply curbs, led by Saudi Arabia, continue to deplete global oil inventories. Iraq said OPEC+ is unlikely to change its production policy at next month’s meeting, providing a signal to the market that oversupply concerns will be kept at bay.The spread between Brent’s nearest contracts surged this week -- a key sign of market tightness -- while swaps tied to the physical North Sea market have also increased amid frenzied trading of derivatives late Tuesday. The so-called prompt spread for U.S. benchmark crude futures is also strengthening as declines at the nation’s largest storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, brings oil stockpiles there to the lowest levels since July.There are still concerns that the rally may be overdone, with technical indicators showing crude in overbought territory. Rising prices may also spur American oil explorers to boost drilling and production later this year, the Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report Tuesday.Meanwhile, the combined refining margin for gasoline and diesel fell toward $12 a barrel on Wednesday as the EIA report showed a nearly 4.3 million-barrel increase in gasoline supplies. At the same time, a rolling gauge for gasoline demand remains at its lowest seasonally in decades.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-holds-rally-report-points-234334336.html?.tsrc=rss

IFRS net operating income was negative USD 0.99 billion and the IFRS net income was negative USD 2.41 billion, following net impairments of USD 1.30 billion and a write down of USD 0.98 billion related to the Tanzania LNG project. 2020 was characterised by: Results impacted by low oil and gas pricesSolid operational performance during extraordinary circumstancesPositive cash flow in a low-price environmentDelivering USD 3.7 billion in capex and cost reductions, well above ambition for the action plan to strengthen financial resilienceProgressing and capturing value within renewablesSetting ambition to be a net-zero energy company by 2050 to create value as a leader in the energy transition “Our results are impacted by the market turmoil during the year, but with strong cost improvements and capital discipline we delivered positive net cash flow for the quarter and the full year. During 2020 we have delivered more than 3.7 billion dollars in savings, well above our ambition for the action plan we launched in March to strengthen financial resilience. We are well positioned for value creation and strong cash flow in 2021 and the coming years,” says Anders Opedal, President and CEO of Equinor ASA. “I am impressed by how the organisation has responded, delivering strong operational performance and production growth in a long-lasting challenging situation during the pandemic. We are increasing production volumes from Johan Sverdrup even further, and we used our flexibility to have high gas production as gas prices increased in the quarter. In addition, we have started production from Snorre Expansion ahead of time and well below cost estimates,” says Opedal. “Equinor is committed to ensuring long-term competitiveness and creating value as a leader in the energy transition, setting an ambition to be a net-zero energy company by 2050. During 2020 we delivered significant progress in our renewables portfolio, taking the investment decision for Dogger Bank A and B, winning the largest ever offshore wind award in the US, starting construction at Hywind Tampen and capturing value from transactions. We are also taking actions to optimise within oil and gas, building a more robust portfolio for the future, but resulting in a write down in Tanzania and an impairment related to an operated US onshore asset in the quarter,” says Opedal. Adjusted earnings [5] were USD 0.76 billion in the fourth quarter, down from USD 3.55 billion in the same period in 2019. Adjusted earnings after tax [5] were negative USD 0.55 billion, down from USD 1.19 billion in the same period last year. Low prices for liquids impacted the earnings for the quarter. Equinor launched an action plan of USD 3 billion in March 2020 to strengthen financial resilience, including a reduction in operating costs of USD 0.70 billion. Delivery on the plan resulted in savings of more than USD 3.7 billion, including a reduction in fixed operating costs of around USD 1 billion. Unit production costs are reduced by 5% since 2019, realising the 2021 ambition already in 2020. In the E&P Norway segment, Equinor realised weaker liquids prices and the production was reduced mainly as a result of turnarounds moved to fourth quarter due to the ongoing pandemic. Results in the E&P International segment were impacted by low prices and the impairment of the Tanzania LNG project of USD 0.98 billion. The E&P USA segment was also impacted by weak prices, partially offset by significant reductions in operating costs. The Marketing, midstream and processing segment captured value from strong trading results from gas to Europe, partially offset by low refinery margins and shutdown of production at Hammerfest LNG plant. New energy solutions delivered high availability on offshore wind assets. A capital gain of around USD 1 billion is expected to be booked from the divestment of a 50% non-operated interest of the offshore wind projects Empire Wind and Beacon Wind in the US. A capital gain from the farm down of 10% equity interest in Dogger Bank A and B in the UK is expected to be booked in the first quarter of 2021. IFRS net operating income was negative USD 0.99 billion in the fourth quarter, down from positive USD 1.52 billion in the same period in 2019. IFRS net income was negative USD 2.42 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to negative USD 0.23 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Net operating income was negatively impacted by net impairments of USD 1.30 billion, mainly relating to a refinery as a result of reduced margin assumptions and some increase in cost estimates, and to an operated unconventional onshore asset in North America due to reclassification as held for sale. Equinor delivered total equity production of 2,043 mboe per day in the fourth quarter, down from 2,198 mboe per day in the same period in 2019, with a minor increase in gas share due to high flexible production in gas fields. Adjusting for portfolio transactions the production growth for 2020 was 2.4%. In 2020, Equinor completed 34 exploration wells with 16 commercial discoveries and 1 well under evaluation. At year end, 12 wells were ongoing. Adjusted exploration expenses in the fourth quarter were USD 1.25 billion, compared to USD 0.44 billion in the same quarter in 2019. The proved reserves replacement ratio (RRR) was negative 5% in 2020, following capital discipline and the prioritisation of financial flexibility during market uncertainty, with a three-year average of 95%. With 5.26 billion barrels in proved reserves, Equinor’s reserves to production ratio (R/P) was 7.4 years. Cash flows provided by operating activities before taxes paid and changes in working capital amounted to USD 14.0 billion in 2020, compared to USD 21.8 billion in 2019. Organic capital expenditure [5] was USD 7.8 billion for 2020. At year end, net debt to capital employed(1) was 31.7%, stable from 31.6% at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Following the implementation of IFRS 16, net debt to capital employed(1) was 37.3%. The board of directors proposes to the annual general meeting a cash dividend of USD 0.12 per share for the fourth quarter 2020. Average CO2-emissions from Equinor’s operated upstream production, on a 100% basis, was 8.0 kg per barrel in 2020. The twelve-month average Serious Incident Frequency (SIF) for 2020 was 0.5, down from 0.6 in 2019. The twelve-month average Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) was 2.3 for 2020, compared to 2.5 in 2019. * * *(1) This is a non-GAAP figure.

2021-02-10	2021-02-10 05:42:00	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Equinor sells its US onshore assets in the Bakken	Equinor (OSE: EQNR, NYSE: EQNR) has agreed to divest its interests in the Bakken field in the US states of North Dakota and Montana to Grayson Mill Energy, backed by EnCap Investments, for a total consideration of around USD 900 million. The transaction covers all of Equinor’s operated and non-operated acreage, totalling 242,000 net acres, and associated midstream assets in the Bakken. Entitlement production from these assets in 4Q 2020 was 48,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (net of royalty interests). In parallel with this transaction, Equinor Marketing and Trading will enter into a term purchase agreement for crude offtake with Grayson Mill Energy. “Equinor is optimising its oil and gas portfolio to strengthen profitability and make it more robust for the future. By divesting our Bakken position we are realising proceeds that can be deployed towards more competitive assets in our portfolio, enabling us to deliver increased value creation for our shareholders. Over the past few years, we have improved the safety, cost efficiency and CO2 intensity of the Bakken assets significantly and I am confident Grayson Mill Energy will continue on this path,” says Anders Opedal, president and chief executive officer of Equinor. “We are taking action to improve the profitability of Equinor’s international oil and gas business. Today’s announcement on the exit of our Bakken assets is an important step in this process. We have worked closely with Grayson Mill Energy to preserve jobs and to ensure the transfer of expertise in the best possible way,” says Al Cook, executive vice president of Development & Production International at Equinor. As part of the agreed transaction, all Equinor field employees and a significant number of the support teams working on the Bakken assets will have the opportunity to transfer to Grayson Mill Energy. The effective date of the transaction is 1 January 2021. Closing is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including authority approvals. About Equinor in the USEquinor holds unconventional oil and gas operated and non-operated positions in the Bakken (North Dakota) and Appalachian Basins (Ohio and Pennsylvania), and has a large portfolio of offshore assets in the US Gulf of Mexico.

2021-01-29	2021-01-29 07:00:00	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Equinor ASA: Impairment at Tanzania LNG Project	Equinor (OSE: EQNR, NYSE: EQNR) has decided to write down the book value of its Tanzania LNG project (TLNG) on the company’s balance sheet by 982million USD. This will be reflected in adjusted earnings for EPI division in fourth quarter 2020 results to be reported on 10 February 2021. While progress has been made in recent years on the commercial framework for TLNG, overall project economics have not yet improved sufficiently to justify keeping it on the balance sheet. The TLNG project has an anticipated breakeven price well above the portfolio average for Equinor and is, at this time, not competitive within this portfolio. Equinor will continue to engage with the Government of Tanzania in negotiations on a commercial, fiscal and legal framework that may provide a viable business case for TLNG in the future. Equinor maintains an attractive portfolio of project development opportunities in oil and gas as well as renewables. This portfolio requires strict prioritization, ensuring capital is allocated towards projects yielding the most competitive returns. As shown at the Capital Markets Update in February last year, Equinor’s oil and gas projects with expected start-up by 2026 have an average breakeven below $35/bbl based on today’s estimates. Similar for non-sanctioned oil and gas projects with expected start-up within this decade, the average breakeven is below $40/bbl. Equinor has been present in Tanzania since 2007 when the company signed a Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) with the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC). Equinor is the operator with a 65% participating interest, along with ExxonMobil’s working interest of 35%. TPDC has the right to participate with a 10% interest. Equinor made nine gas discoveries in Block 2 offshore Tanzania with estimated volumes of 20 Tcf of gas in place.

2020-12-01	2020-12-01 10:00:04	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Even Exxon Mobil Is Capitulating to Peak Oil Demand	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Et tu, Exxon?Through all the shifts that have swept through the oil market in recent years, one thing has been a reliable constant: Exxon Mobil Corp. has remained resolute in its bullishness about the future of crude. In stark contrast to European competitors who've speculated about a peak in oil demand and switched investments toward renewables, Chairman Darren Woods has kept on preaching that old-time religion.The pullback by rivals shouldn’t be seen as a harbinger of doom for crude, but as an opportunity to spend more aggressively, Woods said at an investor day in March: “The best time to invest in these businesses is during a low, which will lead to greater value capture in the coming upswing.” Internal documents reviewed by Bloomberg Green earlier this year showed the company planned to increase its annual emissions 17% by 2025. Now even this most reliable of oil bulls seems to be having doubts. Exxon Mobil’s natural gas fields will be written down by as much as $20 billion, the company said Monday. More tellingly, those counter-cyclical spending plans are being marked to market. Annual capital investment through 2025 will be in the range of $20 billion to $25 billion, some $10 billion below the level that Woods forecast in March.That still sounds like a pretty substantial number — but when considered in the context of the wells Exxon Mobil is already operating, it looks markedly smaller. Depreciation, depletion and amortization is already running in the region of $20 billion every year. Subtract that amount, and you’re left with a growth capex figure of $5 billion a year at best, or zero at worst.Exxon Mobil likes to point to forecasts that the world will need new oil supplies to increase by 8% a year in the near term to meet rising demand as existing fields decline, with new gas requirements rising 6% a year, too. Its newly modest spending plans aren’t going to be sufficient to meet that scenario, let alone increase its own market share.In capitulating to a more subdued outlook, Exxon Mobil is simply following where other companies have led. It’s the only one of the big seven independent oil majors where analysts’ expectations of depreciation don’t already outstrip capital spending over the three years through 2022.Even if you look at the three years through 2023 to exclude the extreme circumstances of the current pandemic-hit year, BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and ConocoPhillips aren’t expected to spend enough to keep up with depreciation. Across the seven large independent oil companies, the deficit will amount to $4.82 billion. Investments in renewables by the likes of Equinor ASA and Shell are still too small to take a substantial chunk out of the industry’s petroleum-focused capex, but they certainly don’t help. Oil giants are divesting from petroleum as fast as any climate-focused fund manager.The same logic applies when you extend things further, to the listed national oil companies. Thanks to a $19 billion cut in capital spending by China’s big three oil majors this year and rising charges resulting from their spending splurge in previous periods, PetroChina Co. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, will be markedly more restrained in their investments in the years ahead. Growth capex totals of $3.18 billion and negative $4.76 billion respectively will be invested in the three years through 2022, based on analyst estimates.Petroleo Brasileiro SA, still recovering from a splurge in the early part of this decade, will reduce its net investments by $6.8 billion over the period. Equinor, aiming at a target of net zero emissions by 2050, will see depreciation exceed capex by about $656 million.Put together, the result looks like an oil industry that stopped spending four years ago and is showing no appetite to start again. Aggregate growth capex across a group of seven large independent and six national oil companies with adequate data will be a negative $23.8 billion this year and minus $6.77 billion next year. Even in 2022, when the sector as a whole should return to a measure of growth, the total will be about $8.8 billion — less than half the amount spent by Exxon Mobil alone in 2014.Oil gets used up quickly, so if the industry doesn’t spend, production will slump in short order. If investment continues at 2020 levels, supply will be 9 million barrels lower than forecast as soon as 2025, according to the International Energy Agency — equivalent to roughly 10% of the current oil market.It’s still probably too early to read oil majors’ miserliness as an indication that they expect demand to fall at quite that pace. The risks of under-investment are relatively limited, as long as everyone moves at the same time. If the world ends up seriously short of crude five years from now, they’ll end up raking in profits that can be recycled on belatedly plugging the deficit.Still, borrowing costs for investment-grade energy companies right now are the lowest they’ve been in six years. If oil majors were half as confident about the future of their core product as they claim to be, they’d be preparing to spend with abandon. When even Exxon Mobil closes its check book, the industry’s future looks truly doubtful.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2020-11-02	2020-11-02 20:25:27	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Oil Climbs With Russia in Talks on Delaying OPEC+ Output Hike	(Bloomberg) -- Oil rose the most in more than three weeks as Russian producers met with Energy Minister Alexander Novak to discuss the possibility of delaying an easing of OPEC+ output cuts by three months.U.S. benchmark crude futures gained 2.9%, bouncing back from an abrupt plunge to a five-month low earlier in the session. The OPEC+ alliance, led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, was already considering postponing the supply increase planned for January as crude prices faltered amid renewed lockdown measures.“The move higher was helped by reports that Russia was open to delaying the OPEC+ cuts,” said Ryan Fitzmaurice, commodities strategist at Rabobank. “More importantly though, today’s move also suggests there is strong investor appetite to own oil sub-$40 a barrel.”Futures had earlier sold off amid the double whammy of rising Libyan supply and a dwindling demand outlook as England joined the string of European countries to renew lockdowns. That could be just the curtain-raiser for a turbulent week of trading as Americans head to the polls Tuesday in an election that could reshape U.S. policy on everything from fiscal stimulus to Iran and fracking.See also: What to Watch in Commodities, the U.S. Election-Day SpecialExpectations that OPEC+ will postpone its planned easing of output cuts in January have increased recently as new threats to the fragile demand recovery are compounded by the group’s own rising production. The second wave of the virus around the world could push global oil demand to as low 88 to 89 million barrels a day, down 11% or 12% from last year, Trafigura Group boss Jeremy Weir said at a conference.“There’s not a whole lot that goes right for oil from here,” said Peter McNally, global head for industrials, materials and energy at Third Bridge. “Demand is unlikely to surprise to the upside, with lockdowns being reimposed.”Despite the recent price weakness, Vitol Group, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, characterized the latest lockdown measures as just a “speed bump,” with tightening global inventories likely to cushion the downside. The bigger picture is still a world in “stock-drawing mode,” Mike Muller, Vitol’s head of Asia, said in an interview Sunday with Dubai-based consultants Gulf Intelligence.At the same time, China raised the quota for use of overseas oil by non-state entities next year by more than 20%, presenting a bright spot for an otherwise precarious demand picture.Still, the futures curve signals further weakness, with the spread between WTI’s nearest contracts deepening into its widest contango since early September. Brent’s prompt spread also weakened on Monday.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-falls-five-month-low-074246774.html?.tsrc=rss

IFRS net operating income was negative USD 2.02 billion and the IFRS net income was negative USD 2.12 billion, following net impairments of USD 2.93 billion mainly due to reduced future price assumptions.  * Solid results from operations in a low-price environment  * On track to deliver on USD 3 billion action plan to strengthen financial resilience  * Strong value creation from renewables  * Net debt ratio(1) increased to 31.6%, due to net impairments and payment for government share of share buy-back“Our financial results are impacted by weak prices as regions across the world are still severely affected by the pandemic. We see the results of our forceful response to the market turmoil, with significant cost improvements and strict financial discipline. Net impairments in the quarter are mainly due to reduced price assumptions. Significant uncertainty remains around the future commodity price development underlining the importance of increased competitiveness and financial resilience,” says Eldar Sætre, President and CEO of Equinor ASA.“We deliver solid operational results in the quarter with an underlying production growth of nine percent. We progress our competitive project portfolio, supported by the tax policy measures in Norway, with the delivery of Plan for Development and Operation of the Breidablikk field. Our specialised organisation for late-life production at the Norwegian continental shelf had a successful start-up showing improved production efficiency and reduced cost,“ says Sætre.“We continue to capture value from our renewable energy portfolio and position ourselves for profitable growth in value chains for carbon capture and storage. This quarter we announced our partnership with BP, including the divestment of half of our share of offshore wind projects Empire Wind and Beacon Wind in the US. We are progressing H2H Saltend, a project for large-scale production of hydrogen in the UK, and in Norway we are progressing the Northern Lights project as part of creating full value chains for carbon capture, transportation and storage,” says Sætre.Adjusted earnings [5] were USD 0.78 billion in the third quarter, down from USD 2.59 billion in the same period in 2019. Adjusted earnings after tax [5] were USD 0.27 billion, down from USD 1.08 billion in the same period last year. Low prices for liquids and gas impacted the earnings for the quarter.Equinor is on track to deliver on the action plan launched in March 2020 of USD 3 billion to strengthen financial resilience, including a reduction of operating costs of USD 0.70 billion. Unit production costs are significantly reduced from third quarter last year.  In the E&P Norway segment, Equinor saw weak prices impacting the results but took advantage of the flexibility in gas production as gas prices in Europe recovered through the quarter.Results in the E&P International segment were impacted by low prices, partially offset by a substantial reduction in costs. The E&P USA segment was also impacted by weak prices, while continuing efforts to reduce activity and costs.The Marketing, midstream and processing segment captured value from gas sales to Europe, offset by slightly negative refinery margins in the quarter.New energy solutions delivered a positive result in the quarter, including costs related to maturation of new projects. A capital gain of around USD 1 billion from the divestment of a 50% non-operated interest of the offshore wind projects Empire Wind and Beacon Wind in the US is expected to be booked in the first quarter of 2021.IFRS net operating income was negative USD 2.02 billion in the third quarter, down from negative USD 0.47 billion in the same period of 2019. IFRS net income was negative USD 2.12 billion in the third quarter, down from negative USD 1.11 billion in the third quarter of 2019.Net operating income was impacted by net impairments of USD 2.93 billion mainly due to reduced future price assumptions as well as some reductions in reserves estimates. Net impairments include USD 1.38 billion in the E&P USA segment, of which USD 1.21 billion is related to US onshore. Impairments in the E&P International segment were USD 1.18 billion, while impairments within the E&P Norway segment was USD 0.37 billion. In total, USD 0.58 billion of the net impairment was recognised as exploration expenses.Equinor delivered total equity production of 1,994 mboe per day in the third quarter, up from 1,909 mboe per day in the same period in 2019, with an increased share of gas. Adjusting for portfolio transactions and government-imposed curtailments, this represents an underlying production growth of around 9% compared to the third quarter of 2019.At the end of the third quarter Equinor has completed 26 exploration wells with 13 commercial discoveries and two wells under evaluation. At the quarter end, 16 wells were ongoing. Adjusted exploration expenses in the quarter were USD 0.30 billion, compared to USD 0.26 billion in the same quarter of 2019.Cash flows provided by operating activities before taxes paid and changes in working capital amounted to USD 10.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared to USD 16.6 billion in the first nine months of 2019. Organic capital expenditure [5] was USD 5.99 billion for the first nine months of 2020. At the closing of the quarter net debt to capital employed(2) was 31.6%, up from 29.3% at the end of the second quarter of 2020, mainly impacted by the net impairment in the quarter, as well as share buy-back from the Norwegian state. Following the implementation of IFRS 16, net debt to capital employed(2) was 37.0%.The board of directors has decided a cash dividend of USD 0.11 per share for the third quarter 2020.The twelve-month average Serious Incident Frequency (SIF) for the period ending 30 September was 0.6 for 2020, similar to the same period for 2019.

2020-10-28	2020-10-28 20:03:45	EQNR	Equinor ASA	New Orleans Braces for Most Powerful Hurricane Since Katrina	(Bloomberg) -- Zeta rapidly strengthened to a near-Category 3 hurricane with winds of 110 miles (177 kilometers) per hour and is threatening to be the worst storm to hit New Orleans since Katrina devastated the city in 2005.While Zeta isn’t as powerful as Katrina, it will pass directly over the Crescent City, bringing the harshest winds in 15 years, said Jim Rouiller, chief meteorologist at Energy Weather Group LLC. The storm’s track could cause as much as $3 billion in damages, but New Orleans will likely escape massive flooding.“The center of circulation is going to pass directly over the the New Orleans metro area,” said Ryan Truchelut, president of commercial forecaster Weather Tiger. “New Orleans has had six or seven hurricane warnings in a row and nothing has happened but their number is definitely up.”Zeta, poised to become the record 11th named storm to hit the U.S. this year, is poised to make landfall at about 4 p.m. local time in the vast wetlands south of New Orleans. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards and New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell have declared emergencies. Hurricane warnings extend from Morgan City, Louisiana, to the Mississippi-Alabama border.After landfall, Zeta will rapidly move inland knocking down trees and powerlines across the South, even potentially knocking out power in Atlanta, Truchelut said.It will then slingshot into the Mid-Atlantic where it could leave a path of darkness straight through to Delaware, Rouiller said.“I think everyone is so tired of hurricanes, no one wants to think about what it can do, but it is going to be a major nuisance,” Truchelut said.Zeta is expected to make landfall between the sites where hurricanes Delta and Laura came ashore, to the west, and Hurricane Sally struck to the east. The larger storms all missed the area, but it was struck by Tropical Storm Cristobal in June. The multiple strikes have left residual damage throughout the Gulf Coast.“Any vulnerable structures -- specifically roofs or infrastructure that were lightly damaged from the past two storms and not repaired -- will be at risk,” said Lou Gritzo, vice president and manager of research with FM Global, a commercial insurer. “Hurricane Sally was less than six weeks ago, so it’s not likely that the damage has been fully repaired.”Zeta is the 27th named storm in a supercharged Atlantic hurricane season, just one short of the record reached in 2005. So many storms have formed this year that the hurricane center has run out of official names and is using Greek letters to designate systems.Chevron Corp., BP Plc, Enbridge Inc., Equinor ASA and other companies have evacuated Gulf installations. Noble Corp. moved its Globetrotter II rig out of the way. Nearly 67% of oil production and 45% of offshore natural gas has been shut in, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.Close to 36% of platforms have been evacuated and 30% of rigs, the agency said. Chevron has also begun preparations to shut a coastal Mississippi oil refinery, according to a person familiar with the operations, and a key seaport that serves deepwater oil installations is under a mandatory evacuation order.Zeta’s track is shifting to the east and it’s continuing to strengthen, so it may cause as much as $3 billion in damages and losses as it makes landfall later Wednesday, up from earlier estimates of about $1 billion, said Chuck Watson, a damage modeler at Enki Research. Its stronger winds bring more dynamic pressure on everything it hits, and there are simply more targets in the way the closer to New Orleans it gets.The storm surge, a wall of water that hurricanes drive onto land, could hit 9 feet (2.7 meters) in areas between the Pearl River in Louisiana to Dauphin Island, Alabama, the hurricane center said.As Zeta comes ashore and moves across Mississippi, Alabama, and northern Georgia, it will interact with a winter storm that’s brought snow to Texas and is now moving east, said Don Keeney, a meteorologist with commercial forecaster Maxar. The moisture from Zeta will enhance that storm, bringing heavy rains throughout the Midwest and eastern U.S.The U.S. Weather Prediction Center warned that as much as 5 to 7 inches may fall across the central and eastern states over the next few days. The confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, southern Appalachian Mountains and southern Mississippi may be hit hardest.There are some indications a 28th storm could form in the Caribbean in the next week, however the forecast isn’t completely clear yet, said Phil Klotzbach, hurricane researcher with Colorado State University.

2020-10-07	2020-10-07 07:55:16	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Fossil Fuel Firms Not Doing Enough on Emissions, Funds Say	(Bloomberg) -- None of Europe’s largest oil, gas and coal companies are on track to limit global warming to within 2 degrees Celsius, according to a report by money managers overseeing more than $22 trillion.Energy and mining companies have been under increasing pressure, from both environmental groups and their own investors, to demonstrate how their business models align with the Paris climate agreement and to show they’re taking action to curb their emissions.Only seven out of 59 companies studied -- Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Repsol SA, Total SE, Eni SpA, Glencore Plc, Anglo American Plc and Equinor ASA -- have set emissions reduction targets in line with pledges made in the Paris Agreement, according to a report by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The TPI is a global program based at the London School of Economics, which assesses climate risks and companies’ preparedness for a low-carbon economy.However, even these so-called Paris Pledges will still leave the world heading for 3.2 degrees Celsius of warming, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.Just three oil and gas companies studied -- Shell, Total and Eni -- are approaching a 2 degree Celsius pathway “but still need further measures to be assessed to align with this benchmark,” the TPI said in a statement.“We’re seeing a direction of travel that is going toward decarbonization that is really positive,” Bill Hartnett, stewardship director at Aberdeen Standard Investments said in an interview. “However, there is a lot of devil in the detail.” The asset manager, which is a funding partner for TPI, sees the report as providing a framework to allow it to engage with fossil fuel companies so that net zero ambitions can be formalized into commitments or targets over time, Hartnett said.“We need to look at the detail of this report, but we are pleased that the TPI recognizes both the leading nature of our ambition and that we are aligned with the emissions reduction pledges of the Paris Agreement,” a Shell spokeswoman said. “We continue to engage with TPI over their methodology so that hopefully their models will in future be able to show how Shell’s ambition to be a net zero emissions energy business by 2050 is aligned with society’s move toward the 1.5 degrees goal of Paris.”London-based BP Plc’s emissions are seen steadily declining over the next three decades. However, they’re still expected to remain above what’s needed to comply with the Paris Agreement, despite the company unveiling further details of its climate goals last month. BP said it hadn’t seen the full report and didn’t know if TPI’s analysis reflected its new strategy announced in August and September. The oil major said it believed its net-zero ambitions set it on a path consistent with the Paris goals.BP aims to eliminate all net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. However the company isn’t aligned with any of the Paris benchmarks because its climate target does not cover traded products, according to Valentin Jahn, research associate for TPI, part of the specialist team at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. These comprised more than half of its externally sold energy in 2019, Valentin said.Glencore declined to comment on the report. The company said in February it would cut so-called scope 3 emissions -- those generated by their consumers -- by 30% over the next 15 years. Anglo American said it was committed to responding to climate change and that it aimed to be carbon neutral across its operations by 2040.Equinor announced this year it would eliminate emissions from its global operations by 2030 and would reduce the carbon intensity of its products by at least half by 2050. “We believe the measures demonstrate that our company is acting in line with the Paris ambitions and our plans are more ambitious than in most jurisdictions,” an Equinor spokesman said.Repsol said it was firmly committed to becoming a “net-zero emissions company” and that it would “continue to engage with TPI to demonstrate our progress in this respect.”“We are pleased to see that TPI, in its most recent report, has given Eni a top evaluation,” an Eni spokesperson said. “In the pathway to keep the temperature increase to 2 degrees or below, we consider that the best way for companies to align with such goal is to set absolute emissions targets.”Total said it supports the goals of the Paris accord and that its ambition is to be carbon-neutral by 2050. The French energy company says it has already reduced its average carbon-intensity of the energy products it sells by 6% since 2015.Transatlantic DivideThe research also highlights the growing divide between European and North American companies’ approaches toward mitigating climate change. Neither of the two U.S. oil giants, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., have overarching emissions goals.On the contrary, Exxon Mobil has been planning to increase annual carbon-dioxide emissions by as much as the output of the entire nation of Greece, an analysis of internal documents reviewed by Bloomberg shows.“There has been some movement, with seven European companies now aligned with the Paris pledges, and Shell, Total and Eni getting close to meeting the 2°C benchmark,” TPI co-chair Adam Matthews said. “But U.S. fossil fuel giants have yet to take meaningful action to reduce their emissions and the gap with their European peers is stark.”Utilities ProgressUtilities are making better progress on curbing emissions than oil, gas and coal producers. According to the TPI, 39 of 66 firms analyzed are already aligned with the Paris pledges, while a third are on track to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by 2050, the study showed.“The electricity sector is heavily regulated with regards to its emissions in some regions such as the EU,” said Professor Simon Dietz, one of the authors of the report. “More broadly, the technologies needed for decarbonizing electricity production are already there and often competitive on cost with fossil fuels, so the core business model is not under threat.”(Adds BP, Total comments from eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fossil-fuel-firms-not-doing-075516699.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-10	2020-09-10 19:45:39	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Oil Falls With Growing U.S. Crude Supplies and Fuel Demand Fears	(Bloomberg) -- Oil resumed its trek downward after U.S. government data showed growing domestic crude supplies and wavering gasoline demand.Futures in New York fell toward $37 a barrel after an Energy Information Administration report showed domestic crude stockpiles increased for the first time since mid-July. Inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub rose to the highest since May and crude production edged up.Diminished gasoline and distillate inventories provided a bright spot, but signs that the pandemic-stricken global economy will take longer than anticipated to recover weighed on U.S. stocks and pressured oil prices.The build in crude inventories is a “precursor that we’re not going to see the draws that people were expecting,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member of the global macro program at Tyche Capital Advisors LLC. “Demand globally is just not coming back the way people were hoping it was going to.”The beginning of September has not been good to oil prices. U.S. benchmark futures have fallen about 13% since the end of August, as gasoline demand is seen stalling with the American summer driving season coming to an end. Globally, the outlook for crude consumption also looks grim, with S&P Global Platts forecasting oil demand to decline more than 8 million barrels a day this year and unlikely to get back to 2019 levels before 2022.While U.S. gasoline stockpiles are gradually approaching normal levels for this time of year, it is mostly a result of low refinery runs rather than more Americans taking to the road. In fact, the four-week rolling average of gasoline supplied -- a gauge for demand -- fell for the first week since the end of July, according to EIA data. The onset of the refinery maintenance season is also clouding prospects for consumption already devastated by the pandemic.“Gasoline inventories are now in the five-year high-low range, which is encouraging, but seasonally, demand is going to tick down over the next few weeks,” said Peter McNally, global head for industrials, materials and energy at Third Bridge. “You’re coming into a weaker period and the underlying fundamentals don’t look great.”Brent’s six-month timespread was $2.88 a barrel in contango -- where prompt prices are cheaper than later-dated ones -- compared with $1.97 at the end of August. The change in the market structure indicates growing concern about a glut and may also, together with falling tanker rates, incentivize floating storage.Still, there are some bright spots for the oil market. Since the start of the month, road traffic has grown in Europe and Asia. In China, the nation’s next five-year plan beginning in 2021 will call for increases to its mammoth state reserves of crude, strategic metals and farm goods, said officials with knowledge of the discussions, a potentially bullish driver for crude in the longer term. Meanwhile, some see the recent drop in oil prices stressing the need to tighten supplies.“The fundamentals are not bad enough to send prices significantly below these levels, even in the relative near-term,” Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities said in a note. With “a pragmatic OPEC+ supply philosophy and expected shale output moderation, after the recent price drop, a more moderate production trajectory should resume market rebalancing.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-holds-rebound-report-u-070205403.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-10	2020-09-10 11:39:58	EQNR	Equinor ASA	BP’s $1.1 Billion Deal Marks First Step Into Offshore Wind	(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc, the oil giant that announced a seismic strategy shift last month, made its first venture into offshore wind power with a $1.1 billion purchase of U.S. assets from Norway’s Equinor ASA.The deal marks the start of an offshore-wind investment partnership in the region for the two companies, which have been at the forefront of the rapid changes in the oil industry as companies seek to adapt to the realities of climate change.BP has taken the boldest steps so far in abandoning the oil-supermajor business model. Just six months after taking the helm, Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney said in August he’d shrink oil and gas output by 40% over the next decade and spend as much as $5 billion a year building one of the world’s largest renewable-power businesses.Read: BP Walks Away From the Oil Supermajor Model It Helped CreateBP will receive a 50% stake in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind developments off New York and Massachusetts, respectively, the companies said in two separate statements on Thursday. Equinor will retain 50% in both, and continue to be the operator.Empire Wind, whose first phase could start in 2024-25, has a potential installed capacity of more than 2 gigawatts, and Beacon Wind more than 2.4 gigawatts. Together they’ll be able to power more than 2 million homes. Equinor earlier estimated total investments in Empire Wind’s first phase at about $3 billion.Future CooperationThe companies plan to participate in more offshore wind projects in the U.S., bringing together their significant balance sheets and experience of handling large projects.“Our ambition would be to replicate this across the U.S.,” Dev Sanyal, executive vice president for gas and low-carbon energy at BP, said in an interview. “States are going through their own process of looking at the offshore wind sector, and as offshore leases come available both of us would like to be a part of that.”Norway’s state-controlled Equinor has so far been the most aggressive oil major in offshore wind, seeking to capitalize on its experience in operating big industrial projects at sea. It’s now reaping the rewards of its early-mover status, expecting to book a $1 billion gain from the BP transaction.The company’s shares rose 0.6% in Oslo trading as of 1:37 p.m. local time, while BP declined 0.3% in London. Also read: Equinor’s $1 Billion Gain on BP Deal Shows Edge in Offshore Wind Equinor last year sold half its stake in a wind farm off Germany, recouping its initial investment. Bloomberg has also reported that the company is in talks to reduce its stake in what will be the world’s biggest offshore wind farm in the U.K.Equinor beefed up its climate strategy earlier this year, and incoming CEO Anders Opedal has vowed to increase the pace of the transition when he starts in November.BP’s boss Looney has set a target to boost renewable-power capacity to around 50 gigawatts by 2030 from 2.5 gigawatts last year. It won’t explore for oil in any new countries -- a major step away from the traditional business that made the company an energy supermajor for decades.BP and Equinor are looking to leverage each other’s strengths in the clean-energy sector in this and any future partnership. While the British company is already a big player in solar and onshore wind, its Norwegian counterpart has major offshore wind projects. Both have energy trading units that can squeeze out profits from the market.“We are complementary in many ways,” Equinor’s Executive Vice President for New Energy Solutions Pal Eitrheim said in an interview. “I see this as the hand and the glove coming together in an attractive growth market.”(Updates with the companies future plans, and executives’ comments from the sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-1-1-billion-deal-073054910.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-10	2020-09-10 05:45:00	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Equinor partners with BP in US offshore wind to capture value and create platform for growth	Equinor (OSE: EQNR, NYSE: EQNR) has entered into an agreement with BP (LSE: BP, NYSE: BP) to sell 50% non-operated interests in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind assets on the US east coast for a total consideration before adjustments of USD 1.1 billion. Through this transaction, the two companies are also establishing a strategic partnership for further growth within offshore wind in the US.Currently Equinor holds a 100% interest in both the Empire Wind lease, located off the coast of New York State, and the Beacon Wind lease, located off the Massachusetts coast. The transaction is in line with Equinor’s renewable strategy to access attractive acreage early and at scale, mature projects, and capture value by de-risking high equity ownership positions.Equinor will remain the operator of the projects in these leases through the development, construction and operations phases and it is anticipated that the wind farms will be equally staffed after a period of time.“We look forward to working with BP who share our strong ambition to grow in renewable energy. Our partnership underlines both companies’ strong commitment to accelerate the energy transition and combining our strengths will enable us to grow a profitable offshore wind business together in the US,” says chief executive officer in Equinor, Eldar Sætre.“This transaction with BP demonstrates Equinor’s ability to create value from developing offshore wind projects. Over the past decade Equinor has built world-class technical expertise in offshore wind. This has enabled us to access and high-grade wind acreage, resulting in a material, high-quality project pipeline. Optimising equity and bringing in new partners allow us to realise value, increasing our financial flexibility to fund further growth,” says executive vice president for New Energy Solutions in Equinor, Pål Eitrheim.Through this partnership Equinor and BP will consider future joint opportunities in the US for both bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind and will leverage relevant expertise to jointly grow scale. As the partnership develops, both companies hope to expand this cooperation further in a market that is forecast to grow to between 600 and 800 gigawatts (GW) globally by 2050.Equinor has already set ambitions to grow its renewables capacity to 4 to 6 GW by 2026 and 12 to 16 GW by 2035, and has recently announced its expectation to accelerate these ambitions. Equinor is working to build scale in core areas – the North Sea, the United States and the Baltic Sea – while securing growth options in other selected markets for both bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind.BP’s acquisition of the interests in Empire Wind and Beacon Wind has an effective date of 1 January 2020 and is expected to close in early 2021, subject to customary conditions including purchase price adjustments and authority approval.About the assets  * Empire Wind is located 15-30 miles southeast of Long Island and spans 80,000 acres, with water depths of between 65 and 131 feet. The lease was acquired in 2017 and is being developed in two phases with a potential total installed capacity of more than 2 GW.  * Beacon Wind is located 60 miles east of Montauk Point and 20 miles south of Nantucket and covers 128,000 acres. The lease was acquired in 2019 and has the potential to be developed with a total capacity of more than 2.4 GW.  * The turbines used at each site are each expected to have an installed capacity of more than 10 megawatts.  * Power generation from each site will be sufficient to power more than 1 million homes.About the partnership  * Equinor and BP are creating a strategic partnership in offshore wind in the US covering both current and potential future projects.  * The partnership will leverage both companies’ expertise in order to expand and scale the business over time.  * The transaction marks the first step in the partnership, where Equinor will remain the operator in the development, construction and operations phase for both assets with secondment participation from BP.  * It is anticipated that the wind farms will be equally staffed after a period of time.About EquinorEquinor is a broad energy company and is building a material position in renewable energy. Equinor powers more than one million European homes with renewable electricity from offshore wind farms in the UK and Germany. The company is building material offshore wind clusters in the North Sea, the US east coast and the Baltic Sea. The company commissioned the world’s first floating offshore wind farm in 2017 off the coast of Scotland and is positioned for future floating wind options in several geographies, including the UK, Norway and Asia.Further information from:Investor relations:  Peter Hutton, senior vice president, Investor Relations,  +44 7881 918792 (mobile)Press:  Eskil Eriksen, Media Relations,  +47 958 82 534 (mobile)This information is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 the Norwegian Securities Trading Act	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equinor-partners-bp-us-offshore-054500106.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-26	2020-08-26 20:06:34	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Oil Edges Up With Traders Assessing U.S. Gulf Hurricane Impact	(Bloomberg) -- Oil eked out a gain following a choppy trading session as traders eyed declining U.S. stockpiles and expected weaker demand from the shutdown of Gulf Coast refineries ahead of Hurricane Laura.Domestic crude inventories fell nearly 5 million barrels last week for a fifth straight week of declines, U.S. government data show, a positive development for a market in which inventories are still at the highest seasonally in decades because of the pandemic’s demand destruction.Meanwhile, more than 80% of oil output in the Gulf of Mexico and nearly 3 million barrels of a day of refining capacity has been shut ahead of the storm’s landfall. Overnight, Laura shifted further east and is less likely to significantly disrupt refineries and ports in the Houston area.There’s going to be “a drop in crude demand because of pretty healthy shutdowns for refiners,” said Bill O’Grady, executive vice president at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. Plus, “you still have this big overhang of inventory.”Hurricane Laura has strengthened into a powerful Category 4 storm and will likely hit the U.S. Gulf Coast early Thursday. It’s already forced a wave of refinery shut-ins in Texas and Louisiana, raising concerns that U.S. East Coast gasoline could spike following the storm. Still, gasoline demand in key consuming nations is stuck at about 10% to 15% below year-earlier levels and supplies are plentiful.Even with the storm, gasoline stockpiles “are still above normal,” said Michael Hiley, head of over-the-counter energy trading at New York-based LPS Futures. “At the same time, you also destroy some demand in the region.”The storm is also upending flows of oil and products. About 64 crude oil and refined product tankers in the western U.S. Gulf are waiting on Laura to pass, according to ship tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. crude imports are dropping steeply this week as ports close and vessels steer away from the storm, according to ClipperData.The EIA report also showed gasoline supplies declined to the lowest since the middle of December and refinery runs rose to the highest since March, signaling an uptick in demand.That’s reflective of the outlook that refiners have of the need for refined products in anticipation of future demand, said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise. “Refineries clearly are seeing the indication that there’s a recovery that’s underway.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-holds-five-month-high-065617632.html?.tsrc=rss

Meanwhile, a recovery in the U.S. is seeing some momentum: new Covid-19 cases have decelerated by the most since the start of the pandemic and applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a pandemic low.Further supporting sentiment, crude demand in Asia is almost back to pre-coronavirus levels, Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said Sunday.Prices are supported by a “continued risk appetite,” said Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities. “At least there are signals from Washington that imply growing likelihood that economic stimulus is pending.”Oil is on the precipice of breaking through the top end of the range where it’s been stalling for months, but remains weighed down by the Covid-19 pandemic that’s casting doubt on a sustained economic rebound. Adding to price pressure, the OPEC+ alliance is unleashing crude back onto the market this month following historic output cuts.“We have prices rallying, but it’s probably unlikely they are going to go to new highs,” Melek said. “OPEC has a great amount of spare capacity that they will move into the market along with growth.”Yet, in a sign of recovering consumption, the quantity of commercial flights around the world rose almost 6% in the seven days to Sunday, according to FlightRadar24 data. The average number of 67,000 planes in the sky was still far below the more than 100,000 pre-Covid.“We are seeing a partial recovery in the energy market as countries around the world take steps to ease restrictions and reboot their economies,” Nasser said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-rallies-asia-saudi-aramco-223025409.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-30	2020-07-30 16:36:40	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Oil Trading Bonanza Saves the Quarter for Shell and Total	(Bloomberg) -- The secretive oil-trading businesses of Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SE saved both European majors from posting losses in the second quarter, bringing a torrent of cash that countered the impact of the coronavirus crisis.Investors had already been warned that the pandemic hammered almost all parts of the energy giants’ businesses -- from forecourts, to oil and gas production, to the long-term value of assets. But that was offset by gains from speculating on energy markets, the companies said Thursday.In keeping with tradition, Shell and Total didn’t disclose exactly how much money their trading operations made, but acknowledged they were able to exploit extreme price volatility during April’s record supply glut.The quarter was “the best on record” for Shell’s trading unit, Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said on a call with reporters. “It was a really outstanding performance.”When asked by investors on a separate call about how much money the traders made, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne responded: “The oil trading is a secret.” He would only say it made about $500 million more than usual, but refused to disclose what’s the normal baseline.Shell took advantage of its sprawling infrastructure that allowed it to capitalize on the market’s volatility -- from storing oil cheaply to adapting its refineries to meet changes in demand. Shell benefited from “all sorts of arbitrages that opened up in unusual parts of the world,” Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in a Bloomberg Television interview.U.S. DifferenceWith trading floors that resemble the operations of Wall Street banks in cities from London to Singapore, the European majors have an edge over their main American rivals, which market their own energy production but largely eschew pure trading as a means of generating profits. That means that Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., which publish results on Friday, are unlikely to report a similar boost in the second quarter.Shell’s adjusted net income was $638 million in the second quarter, down 82% from the same period a year earlier but far better than the average analyst estimate of a $664 million loss. Total posted a surprise profit of $126 million, compared with expectations for a loss of $443 million.Those figures exclude tens of billions of dollars of writedowns on the value of the companies’ assets resulting from the slump in oil and gas prices, which had already been disclosed to investors.Shell’s B shares fell 5.7% to 1,113.8 pence as of 4:55 p.m. in London. Total fell 1.6% to 31.93 euros in Paris.Contango TradeWhen oil prices plunged last quarter, traders were able to buy crude on the cheap, store it and lock in a profit from the future sale by selling forward in the derivatives market. The profit was possible because spot prices were much lower than forward prices, a situation known as contango.With its vast access to data from its shipping network, its refining positions and high flow of trades, Shell was able to capitalize on the market structure more extensively than the average trader, finding contango plays in more obscure non-benchmark crudes.“We do contango on steroids,” Van Beurden told analysts in a call.It’s unlikely that profits from trading will remain at the same level during the rest of the year, since the contango has since diminished significantly and market volatility has eased.Shell’s “very strong trading and optimization performance that we saw in the second quarter is not necessarily an indication for the third quarter,” CFO Uhl said. While she wouldn’t disclose how much money the company’s traders made, there were some clues in its statement.Shell’s entire refining and trading business delivered adjusted net income of $1.5 billion in the period, more than 20 times larger than a year earlier. Considering that the part of Shell’s business that actually manufactures fuel suffered one of its worst-ever quarters, with low margins and sales volumes, it’s possible that the bulk of those earnings came from trading.Last week, Norway’s Equinor ASA said its trading division made a record $1 billion gain in the second quarter. British oil giant BP Plc, which runs a large trading business similar to those at Shell and Total, is also likely to report gains from that unit when it announces results next Tuesday.“Trading platforms always deliver a positive surprise in terrible macro conditions,” said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein Ltd.Those conditions prompted dismal results in most other areas of the companies’ operations. And not every producer was able to avoid the expected loss. Italian oil giant Eni SpA, which also published earnings on Thursday, lost 714 million euros ($839 million) and announced a dividend cut.(Updates with comments from Total, Shell CEOs starting in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-saved-dismal-second-quarter-061535588.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-30	2020-07-30 06:00:29	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Total Makes Surprise Profit as Trading Gains Offset Oil Slump	(Bloomberg) -- Total SE made a surprise profit after “very good” trading gains offset some of the slump in oil and gas prices due to the coronavirus pandemic.Mirroring the performance of some of its peers, the French energy giant published a litany of grim figures -- including an $8.1 billion writedown -- for the second quarter, when much of the world was plunged into lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. Yet its traders successfully exploited the extreme volatility in oil and gas prices resulting from the crisis, helping the company avoid the loss that analysts had expected.Second-quarter adjusted net income was $126 million, Total said in a statement on Thursday. That’s down 96% from a year earlier, but better than the average loss of $443 million expected by analysts.Total endured an energy-market crisis, “gas prices dropping to historic lows and refining margins collapsing due to weak demand,” Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said in the statement. Yet the company still made a profit thanks to “the outperformance of trading.”The combination of slumping demand due to Covid-19 lockdowns and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia meant the oil market started the second quarter deep in a price structure called contango. This allowed traders to make easy money by buying crude cheap, storing it, and selling it forward.The biggest players with access to onshore storage tanks or ships could make the most money. Norway’s Equinor ASA gained about $1 billion in the second quarter as its traders exploited the contango.E&P LossTotal’s earnings report wasn’t short on bad news. Its exploration and production division posted a $209 million loss, compared with a profit of $2 billion a year earlier. The company’s fuel-retail networks in Europe suffered a 30% drop in demand in the quarter and its refineries ran at just 60% of capacity. Its writedown was related mainly to the value of Canadian oil sands assets.Energy consumption and prices started to recover in June, but the company emphasized the uncertainty, volatility and potential for continued weakness in global markets. The price of liquefied natural gas on long-term contracts is expected to decline in the second half, and significant deliveries of the fuel may be deferred, it said.Where it really mattered, Total offered some more good news for investors. It maintained its dividend at 66 euro cents a share and reaffirmed that it was sustainable with Brent crude at $40 a barrel.Equinor and Royal Dutch Shell Plc have already slashed their payouts, and BP Plc and Eni SpA are expected to follow, meaning Total may be the only European oil major to fully withstand the current storm.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-makes-surprise-profit-trading-060029527.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-29	2020-07-29 12:50:09	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Oil Holds Above $41 With Weaker Dollar, Falling U.S. Stockpiles	(Bloomberg) -- Oil gained as industry data showed a drop in U.S. crude stockpiles and the dollar extended its decline.Futures in New York rose 0.8%, after falling on Tuesday. U.S. inventories shrank by 6.83 million barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute reported, according to people familiar with the data. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot index headed for its weakest close since September 2018.Investors are awaiting the conclusion of a Federal Reserve policy meeting on Wednesday, with the U.S. central bank expected to signal it will keep interest rates near zero as the coronavirus continues to spread. Florida reported a record death toll, while a resurgence of cases across the Asia-Pacific region is being viewed as an early warning sign for the rest of the world.After rebounding swiftly from April lows, crude prices have struggled to find direction in recent weeks as new outbreaks of Covid-19 threaten the global demand recovery. Consultant Rystad Energy AS said it expects a second virus wave and additional barrels from the OPEC+ alliance to result in a supply glut for the next four months.“API proved supportive for oil prices after showing a surprise fall in crude stockpiles,” said Kevin Solomon, an analyst at brokerage StoneX. “It might be theoretically possible that the weaker dollar would ignite a rapid increase in crude demand,” but renewed virus outbreaks call this into question, he said.The U.S. crude benchmark’s three-month timespread was 70 cents a barrel in contango -- where near-dated contracts are cheaper than later-dated ones -- compared with 31 cents at the end of June. The change in the market structure indicates concerns about oversupply have grown this month.As the market recovery teeters, the world’s largest independent oil storage company, Royal Vopak NV, said its tanks are filling and almost all space is booked up. While not necessarily a repeat of the scramble for storage that pushed prices below zero earlier in the year, it’s a reminder of the level of uncertainty that persists in the oil market.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-holds-near-41-traders-230454253.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-24	2020-07-24 16:50:54	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Oil Fluctuates With Dollar and Demand Sending Mixed Signals	(Bloomberg) -- Oil is caught in a tug-of-war as investors weigh the prospect of a slowing global economic recovery and strained U.S.-China relations against signs of a weaker dollar.U.S. crude futures fluctuated between gains and losses during Friday’s session, but are poised to post a second weekly increase. With crude inventories mounting and virus cases surging around the globe, fears over a demand slowdown continue. Plus, escalating Chinese-American tensions are casting an even darker cloud over the economic outlook, with Beijing telling the U.S. to shut its consulate in Chengdu.“The market seems to be getting batted back and forth over concerns about what’s going on with Covid-19 and today, worries about U.S.-Chinese tensions,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy. “Overall, I don’t think we really have seen the new shoe drop that will give us our new direction.”Still, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index weakened to the lowest since January, increasing the appeal of commodities priced in the greenback.U.S. crude’s recovery from negative territory in April has stalled as futures trade range-bound this month amid signs the coronavirus is flaring up again around the world. In the U.S., coronavirus cases surpassed 4 million, doubling over a span of six weeks after infections surged in Sun Belt states. In South Africa, cases doubled over the past 17 days and the virus count in Brazil sits above the 2 million mark. Schlumberger Ltd. warned that new waves of Covid-19 could derail the nascent recovery in global energy demand.Yet, crude markets have gathered some support by the weaker dollar, which is headed for its worst month since the start of 2018 as investors line up to short the greenback. Reports of euro-area growth also boosted sentiment.“The market’s caught between two strong and opposing forces,” said Bill O’Grady, executive vice president at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. “On the one side, you’ve got a storage overhang that is persistent, on the other hand, you’ve got a weakening dollar, you’ve got negative real interest rates and these factors tend to be bullish for commodities in general and crude in particular.”Adding to the trouble, OPEC+ will start returning supply next month after historic production cuts, while China’s lackluster demand is continuing to roil the physical crude market in Asia.While stressing the uncertainty of the demand outlook, Equinor ASA CEO Eldar Saetre said the risk of underinvestment in supply is being overlooked by the market. The slump induced by the pandemic has had an effect on exploration, and the capacity of suppliers may also drop, he said Friday.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-holds-near-41-amid-015005176.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-24	2020-07-24 13:27:14	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Oil Trading Profits Soar for Energy Majors Who Made Storage Bets	(Bloomberg) -- In March and April, as oil prices plunged to their lowest in a generation, Norwegian energy giant Equinor ASA was busy doing the opposite of what oil companies usually do: pumping as much crude as possible underground into giant caverns on the nation’s North Sea coast.Equinor also filled oil tankers with crude, turning them into floating storage facilities, and put even more barrels into onshore tanks elsewhere. Its traders were trying to soften the blow of rock-bottom prices by buying cheap crude, storing it, and simultaneously selling it on the forward market at higher prices.The trade, known in industry jargon as a contango play, combined with other oil trading activity delivered a record of about $1 billion in pre-tax adjusted earnings in a single quarter. And the Norwegian oil company wasn’t alone: it’s a pattern likely to be repeated throughout the industry from oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc to independent commodity trading houses like Glencore Plc.The price difference between a Brent contract for immediate delivery and the six-month forward contract -- a key measure of the contango -- plunged to a record of nearly -$14 a barrel in early April, surpassing the contango witnessed during the 2008-09 financial crisis.Equinor on Friday said that its midstream business line, which includes trading, made adjusted profit before taxes of $1.16 billion in the second quarter, an increase of $951 million from a year earlier. “The increase was mainly due to contango market during the quarter and good results from liquids trading,” the company said.The key to the contango play is access to a place to park millions of barrels of crude, perhaps for as long as a year. And Equinor had plenty. “We have storage at Mongstad,” Eldar Saetre, the company’s boss, said in an interview, referring to the underground caverns able to hold almost 9.5 million barrels of crude under the country’s west coast.“And we have storage capacity that we rent in Korea, we’ve done that for many years, and some other storages here and there,” he said. As onshore storage ran out, oil companies turned to tankers. “We have a lot of floating storage for this purpose,” Saetre added. “We have increased capacity for this purpose, increasing our shipping capacity for storage use.”Others in the oil industry were doing the same. Although better known for their oil fields, refineries and filling stations, Shell, BP Plc and Total SA also run huge in-house oil trading businesses that dwarf independent commodity trading houses.The three companies are expected to deliver strong oil trading results when they report their quarterly earnings over the next two weeks, according to people familiar with their business. Some of their so-called trading books made significantly more money in the first half of 2020 than they did in the entirety of 2019, the same people said, asking not to be named because the information isn’t public.Shell in particular made huge amounts of money on its jet-fuel book, one person familiar with the matter said.The trading units of Shell, BP and Total handle more than 25 million barrels a day of crude and refined products -- equal to a quarter of global consumption. The trio don’t disclose their trading results separately, and many investors consider the operations essentially black boxes. But in the past they have said that contango plays are extremely profitable, able to give a $500 million boost in a single quarter to their trading businesses.The three oil companies declined to comment.Few other publicly-listed oil companies trade at the scale of the European oil majors and Equinor, although Eni SpA and Lukoil PJSC also have trading desks. While the extra profits from trading are unlikely to offset much larger losses of revenue from lower oil prices, they could help the three majors to weather the crisis and, perhaps more importantly, beat analysts’ estimates.The independent traders also enjoyed a bumper period. Glencore, which earlier this year hired the world’s largest oil tanker to play the contango, made nearly $1 billion in earnings before interest and taxes in oil trading in the first six months of 2020, similar to what the company made in the whole of 2019, according to people familiar with the matter.Glencore, which declined to comment, reports results in early August.Other independent oil traders, including Trafigura Group, Mercuria Energy Group Ltd and Gunvor Group, have already announced bumper trading results. Mercuria, one of the top-5 independent oil traders, told bankers it enjoyed record profits for the first six months.Likewise, Gunvor told employees it made bumper profits thanks to its tankers, whose value surged as companies rushed to hire the vessels for storage.“Given our sizeable fleet of ships under management, this allowed for substantial earnings for the quarter,” said billionaire Torbjorn Tornqvist, the co-founder and head of Gunvor.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-trading-profits-soar-energy-132714522.html?.tsrc=rss

Click CVID on the terminal for global data on coronavirus cases and deaths.H.K. Reports Over 100 Local Cases for Third Day (4:53 p.m. HK)Hong Kong saw a record 115 new local virus cases on Friday -- the third day of infections breaching a hundred -- as the city’s outbreak continues to worsen despite tightened restrictions.Of the additional local infections, 53 were unlinked to previous cases, according to data from the city’s health department. The Asian financial hub has been caught off-guard by the sudden outbreak, with the number of untraceable cases signaling that hidden chains of transmission are widespread.Cases Rise in Dalian (4:47 p.m. HK)The coastal city of Dalian in northeast China reported a jump in new infections on Friday. Nine new local cases and 27 asymptomatic infections were reported from July 23 to 3 p.m. on July 24. All of the nine cases were confirmed after being reported as asymptomatic cases earlier.The city has a total of 12 confirmed coronavirus cases.Europe Returns to Growth (4 p.m. HK)The euro-area economy saw activity grow for the first time in five months in July, keeping it on track for a recovery from the deep virus-related slump. IHS Markit’s composite Purchasing Managers Index rose to the highest in more than two years, with both services and manufacturing seeing a solid improvement on the month. The figure was better than economists had predicted, and puts the gauge above the key 50 level that divides expansion from contraction.But while the headline reading keeps the economy heading in the right direction after a devastating slump in the second quarter, the report also contained warning signs. Demand remains weak, relative to capacity, and firms cut jobs for a fifth straight month. The decline in payrolls was particularly sharp in manufacturing, close to the worst since 2009.Turkey Tests Indicate Positive Ratio of 0.25% (3:50 p.m. HK)The Ministry of Health conducted random tests on about 150,000 people nationwide and 2.5 people out of every 1,000 tested positive.Tokyo Finds 260 New Cases (3:30 p.m. HK)Tokyo recorded 260 new cases of coronavirus on Friday, FNN reported, without attribution. That is down from a record 366 infections reported for Thursday. Hospitalizations in Tokyo have jumped about five-fold over the past month, though authorities have said the medical system isn’t under stress. The city has reported more than 4,000 cases this month, more than the previous peak in April when the city entered its state of emergency.Vietnam Stocks Slump on Report of Local Case (3:23 p.m. HK)VnExpress reported that the coastal city of Da Nang has quarantined more than 50 people who came into contact with a man who tested positive for the virus, potentially the first instance of local transmission in the country since April 16. Vietnamese stocks fell, with the benchmark VN Index dropping the most in more than a month.A 57-year-old male had tested positive for the virus twice and authorities are waiting for more tests to confirm, according to a statement by the health ministry. Da Nang’s health authorities have also tested people who came into close contact with the suspected patient and 102 samples turned out negative. The coastal city will continue checking and isolate people and areas as needed, it said.Schindler Cuts Jobs, Thales Warning: Earnings Roundup (2:53 p.m. HK)The pandemic’s impact on business continues to escalate, with job losses and sales hits in industrial companies plus uncertainty for the education sector, though earnings beats are still flowing through against low expectations.Swiss elevator maker Schindler Holding AG is planning 2,000 job cuts and French aerospace firm Thales SA said about 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) of revenue will disappear this year. Pearson Plc meanwhile reported a wider loss than expected as its U.S. education business is hit hard by school closures.Still, the news is far from all bad. Dassault Aviation SA’s first-half earnings topped estimates as demand for Rafale military fighters remained constant. Vodafone Group Plc said its first-quarter organic service revenue declined by less than analysts estimated, while Norwegian oil firm Equinor ASA reported an unexpected profit owing to a good quarter for its trading arm.U.K. Retail Sales Surge in June (2:22 p.m. HK)U.K. retail sales jumped by a record in June as a lifting of coronavirus restrictions allowed more stores to open up.Sales volumes including fuel rose 13.9% from May, the most since records began in 1996, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. That left a measure of total sales 0.6% below the level seen in February, while a reading that excludes fuel was higher than its pre-virus position.S. Korea May Report More Than 100 Cases Tomorrow (1:32 p.m. HK)South Korea is likely to report confirmed coronavirus cases of more than 100 when the announcing the daily tally tomorrow, Kwon Jun-wook, deputy director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says at a briefing.The expected increase may be due to South Korean construction workers returning from virus-hit Iraq and more cases from Russian ship in Busan port, the official said.World Bank Sees $1 Billion Philippine Projects Approved by September (01:12 p.m. HK)The World Bank has disbursed $1.2 billion in concessional financing as of April to support the Philippines’ efforts to curb the coronavirus spread and the impact of pandemic, Department of Finance says in statement.Thailand Reports 10 More Cases (12:45 p.m. HK)Thailand confirms ten new cases on Friday, all found in state quarantine after returning from Sudan, Pakistan, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.S. according to Taweesilp Witsanuyotin, a spokesman for the Covid-19 center.S. Korea to Allow Fans to Attend Baseball Games (11:04 a.m. HK)South Korea, one of the first countries to allow professional sports to resume without fans in early May, will allow spectators to attend baseball games from July 26. Fans, limited to 10% of the stadium’s capacity, will be required to wear masks, sit at least a seat apart and prohibited from eating food in the stands.Once the second worst hit, South Korea now ranks among the countries with the lowest rate of cases and fatalities.Read: Masked Fans Return to Stadiums as Baseball Inches Back in JapanTop Glove’s 450% Rally Makes It Malaysia’s Second-Biggest Stock (10:49 a.m. HK)Top Glove Corp. has vaulted past Public Bank Bhd. to become the second most valuable stock on Malaysia’s equities benchmark, capping a dizzying rally by the rubber glove maker.Glove makers have been standout performers in the wake of the global pandemic as they benefited from supernormal demand, burnishing their investment appeal.Australia’s Victoria Reports Mounting Death Toll (09:50 a.m. HK)Australia’s Victoria state reported a mounting death toll from the coronavirus, weeks after a surge in cases sent Melbourne into a second lockdown.Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews reported six deaths, all of them connected to aged-care facilities, and 300 new cases on Friday. That took total deaths in the state to 55.The number of new infections is down from 403 yesterday and Wednesday’s record of 484.CDC Says Covid Risks for Kids Low (08:37 a.m. HK)U.S. health officials issued guidelines for reopening schools as districts across the country weigh whether to bring kids back amid the coronavirus pandemic, a move that follows calls by President Donald Trump for classrooms to resume in-person instruction this fall.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laid out an argument on Thursday for bringing students back to campuses, citing the developmental harm that could be caused to children from missed education.The CDC said in a statement titled “The Importance of Reopening America’s Schools This Fall” that while parents, teachers and school officials are concerned about the risk of transmitting the coronavirus in classrooms, the “best available evidence indicates if children become infected, they are far less likely to suffer severe symptoms.” The CDC also said death rates from the virus among children are much lower than among adults.Brazil Reports Second-Highest Increase; Mexico Cases Hit Record (6:30 a.m. HK)Brazil reported 59,961 cases, its second highest on record, for a total of 2,287,475. The nation, with the worst outbreak after the U.S., recorded another 1,311 deaths for a total of 84,082. Last week the World Health Organization said Brazil’s outbreak had hit a plateau, and on Monday the nation reported 20,257 cases and 632 deaths.Mexico’s cases rose by a daily record of 8,438, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Deaths climbed by 718, the data show, although Mexico’s government had yet to release its official daily figures. Despite the record rise in cases, health officials have maintained that the spread of the virus is slowing in much of the country. Yet Mexico overtook Italy last week to have the world’s fourth-most virus deaths.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/victoria-reports-six-deaths-u-025647751.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-24	2020-07-24 08:54:11	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Equinor Reports Surprise Profit	(Bloomberg) -- Equinor ASA reported a surprise profit in the second quarter, helped by trading gains in chaotic markets and a tax change designed to help the Norwegian oil industry through the Covid-19 crisis.The state-controlled producer, among the first oil majors to report results for the period, could prove to be an outlier in a quarter that’s set to be the most painful yet for the industry since the global pandemic destroyed demand earlier this year. Equinor also set itself apart from European competitors including BP Plc by not reducing its long-term crude price forecasts, thereby avoiding huge impairments.Read: Big Oil’s Worst-Ever Loss Puts Historic BP Dividend Cut in PlayThe Stavanger-based company reported an adjusted net income of $646 million, down from $1.13 billion a year ago but well ahead of the expected $250 million loss in a Bloomberg survey. The marketing division delivered record high results in the quarter, and the company also benefited from a tax refund.It was in many ways “the most dramatic quarter in the history of the oil markets,” Chief Executive Officer Eldar Saetre said in a Bloomberg television interview. Equinor exploited volatile prices and a collapse in the value of short-term crude contracts to deliver “a strong trading performance in the quarter. It was really good to see that in a quarter where we need it.”Rivals Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP and Eni SpA have flagged huge impairments in their upcoming quarterly reports, but Equinor only wrote down the value of assets by a net $374 million.Also see: Equinor Defies Big Oil’s Gloomy Take on Crude Market’s FutureThe marketing, midstream and processing division reported net adjusted earnings of $696 million from $74 million a year ago, compensating for losses in the international and U.S. units. Equinor was able to take advantage of the market structure called contango, which encourages companies to store cheaper oil to sell it a profit later, but analysts cautioned the performance was a one-off.“While the strong trading result was positive, we believe this should not be extrapolated,” DNB Markets said in a note to clients.In Norway, Equinor reported a profit thanks only to the positive tax effect of temporary changes in local rules. It accounted for a net $291 million of levies in its favor in the quarter.The company’s shares rose as much as 1.9% in Oslo, but pared those gains to 1.2% as of 10:52 a.m. local time. The Stoxx Europe 600 Oil & Gas index was down 0.6%.Dividend StableEquinor earlier this year slashed spending plans for 2020 and became the first oil major to reduce its dividend in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Equinor will maintain its payout at 9 cents a share for the second quarter, two-thirds lower than the level at the beginning of the year.Production was 2.011 million barrels of oil equivalent a day during the quarter, compared with a forecast of 2.053 million, according to the average of three estimates. That’s stable from a year ago.The company in May abandoned its previous forecast for a 7% increase in output this year due to market uncertainty and mandatory supply cuts in Norway and elsewhere. It, however, maintained its long-term growth ambitions.(Updates with analyst comment in the seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equinor-reports-surprise-profit-061834546.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-24	2020-07-24 04:44:00	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Equinor second quarter 2020 results	Equinor (OSE: EQNR, NYSE: EQNR) reports adjusted earnings of USD 0.35 billion and USD 0.65 billion after tax in the second quarter of 2020. IFRS net operating income was negative USD 0.47 billion and the IFRS net income was negative USD 0.25 billion.The second quarter was characterised by  * Financial results impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and very low commodity prices.  * Strong trading results, capturing significant value in volatile markets.  * Overall solid operational performance and cost reductions.  * After tax results positively impacted by temporary tax changes in Norway.  * Net debt ratio (1) increased to 29.3% due to very low commodity prices and tax payments from 2019 earnings.“Our financial results for the second quarter were impacted by very low realised oil and gas prices due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but also by a strong trading performance in volatile markets. We now see gradual reopening of society in some parts of the world, while other regions are still heavily impacted by the pandemic. Equinor has taken forceful actions to protect the safety of our people, and to contribute positively in society and mitigate the spread of the virus. We have also been able to maintain stable operations and implemented several measures to safeguard our financial strength,” says Eldar Sætre, President and CEO of Equinor ASA.“We have reduced costs, maintained solid operational performance and continued to prioritise value over volume by deferring significant flexible gas production to periods with higher expected prices. We also continued to progress our highly competitive project portfolio, supported by active policy measures in Norway enabling the industry to continue to work on planned projects that will stimulate new investments and maintain activity in a challenging period. Since the start of the quarter, we have signed contracts and framework agreements for more than 10 billion kroner to competitive suppliers in Norway,” says Sætre.“We expect market volatility to continue going forward. The long-term market implications from Covid-19, with possible lower demand and reduced investments in the industry, remain uncertain. However, Equinor’s strategic direction remains firm and we are committed to develop Equinor as a broad energy company to create value in a low carbon future. Together with our partners, we have taken positive investment decisions for transportation and storage of CO2 in the Northern Lights project and for the Sleipner field to be partly electrified with renewable energy from shore,” says Sætre.Adjusted earnings [5] were USD 0,35 billion in the second quarter, down from USD 3.15 billion in the same period in 2019. Adjusted earnings after tax [5] were USD 0.65 billion, down from USD 1.13 billion in the same period last year. Very low realised prices for both liquids and gas impacted the earnings for the quarter, while trading operations in volatile markets captured significant value.Equinor is on track to deliver on the announced plan for reducing costs (2) for 2020 by around USD 700 million compared to original estimates. Upstream operating costs and the unit production costs are significantly reduced from the second quarter of 2019.For E&P Norway Equinor saw very low commodity prices and production was impacted by deferring significant gas volumes to later periods to capture higher expected value as well as government imposed oil production curtailments.As from the second quarter, Equinor has established E&P USA as a separate reporting segment. Results in this segment were impacted by very low commodity prices, while significant cost reductions contributed positively. Results in the E&P International segment (excluding E&P USA) were also impacted by low prices, despite a reduction of operating costs.The Marketing, midstream and processing segment delivered a record high result in the quarter, particularly from crude oil and liquids trading where values were extracted from a market in contango and ability to utilise the asset portfolio. In addition, there was positive a contribution from renegotiations of gas contracts.New energy solutions delivered an around neutral result in the quarter, including costs related to maturation of new projects.IFRS net operating income was negative USD 0.47 billion in the second quarter, down from USD 3.52 billion in the same period of 2019. IFRS net income was negative USD 0.25 billion in the second quarter, down from USD 1.48 billion in the second quarter of 2019.Net operating income was impacted by net impairment charges of USD 0.37 billion, mainly related to a gas processing plant in Norway and exploration.Equinor delivered total equity production of 2,011 mboe per day in the second quarter, at the same level as in the same period in 2019, with strong growth in liquids production on the NCS. Adjusting for portfolio transactions and government-imposed curtailments, this represents a production growth of more than 4% compared to the second quarter of 2019. The flexibility in some gas fields was used to defer significant production into periods with higher expected gas prices. Successful ramp-up of new fields, including Johan Sverdrup, as well as new well capacity, contributed to growth in production.At the end of the second quarter Equinor has completed 15 exploration wells with 6 commercial discoveries and 2 wells under evaluation. 17 wells were ongoing at the quarter end. Adjusted exploration expenses in the quarter were USD 0.28 billion, compared to USD 0.24 billion in the same quarter of 2019.Cash flows provided by operating activities before taxes paid and changes in working capital amounted to USD 6.86 billion in the first half of 2020, compared to USD 12.0 billion in the first half of 2019. Organic capital expenditure [5] was USD 4.11 billion for the first six months of 2020. At the closing of the quarter net debt to capital employed (3) was 29.3%, up from 25.8% at the end of the first quarter, mainly as a result of very low commodity prices and tax payments related to 2019 earnings. Following the implementation of IFRS 16, net debt to capital employed (3) was 34.7%.The board of directors has decided a cash dividend of USD 0.09 per share for the second quarter 2020.The twelve-month average Serious Incident Frequency (SIF) for the period ending 30 June was 0.6 for 2020, compared to 0.5 in 2019.

2020-06-25	2020-06-25 12:46:36	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Big Oil’s Long Bet on Hydrogen Offers a Climate Lifeline	(Bloomberg) -- On particularly cold winter days, the vast majority of the U.K.’s energy comes from burning natural gas. That arrangement will have to change radically—and soon—if the country is to hit its legally mandated target of net-zero emissions by 2050. As other countries adopt similar targets to align with the Paris climate agreement, they too will have to find an alternative to natural gas. That leaves fossil fuel companies with a ticking clock.Hydrogen burns cleanly, leaving only water behind. That’s made it an attractive alternative fuel source—not just for governments looking to satisfy climate mandates, but also for oil companies trying to ensure their continued relevance. Oil-and-gas majors such as Shell, Equinor, and BP have spent tens of millions of dollars on pilot projects. Now in the face of record-low oil prices, frozen international travel, and growing shareholder unease over greenhouse gas emissions, investing in hydrogen has taken on a new urgency. Hydrogen also burns very hot, making it useful for high-polluting heavy industries such as cement- and steel-making. These sectors have long relied on coal, and established renewables such as wind and solar can’t deliver the necessary heat. Supplying hydrogen could potentially become a huge new market that oil companies could dominate quickly thanks to their existing expertise in transporting and selling gas.“Some oil and gas majors see it as a lifeline,” says Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and former special representative on sustainable energy at the United Nations. “Now you need regional governments to take the helm and drive it forward.”With European governments unveiling tens of billions of euros in new spending to re-start economies and satisfy pre-existing climate commitments, hydrogen development could get a major funding kickstart—Germany, for example, has allocated €9 billion ($10 billion) to the nascent industry. That spending will be crucial for the technology around hydrogen production to reach a scale that can compete in the international market.Despite all the interest, major obstacles remain before hydrogen can fully replace fossil fuels in any sector. The world currently produces more than 110 million metric tons of hydrogen annually, according to BloombergNEF. Most of that is used to make ammonia, NH₃, needed in fertilizers and to convert crude oil into more valuable products such as gasoline and diesel. About three quarters of that hydrogen is derived from the chemical conversion of natural gas—the primary component of which is methane, CH₄—through a process that also produces carbon dioxide, CO₂. If that CO₂ is released into the atmosphere, the resulting fuel is known as “grey hydrogen.” When the CO₂ is captured and buried underground, it’s known as “blue hydrogen,” a cleaner alternative. The cleanest form, called “green hydrogen,” is derived from water, H₂O, through a process that runs on renewable electricity. While all three types of hydrogen are equally clean-burning, green hydrogen has by far the least negative effects on the environment. It’s also the most expensive: the price today can run as high as $7.50 per kilogram, compared to $2.40 per kg for blue hydrogen, according to the Global CCS Institute, a think tank aimed at accelerating carbon capture and storage development.Less than 1% of the world’s current hydrogen fuel supply is green. Scaling up renewable electricity production enough to reach 100% will be difficult, especially since consumers and other businesses are seeking renewable power for their homes and workplaces. “Probably you need both routes”—green and blue—“if you’re really serious about decarbonizing all the use cases,” says Oliver Bishop, general manager for hydrogen at Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Shell was among the first oil companies to show interest in hydrogen, as far back as 20 years ago. One of its early bets was on hydrogen-powered cars, an intriguing idea at a time when lithium-ion batteries were prohibitively expensive. But hydrogen cars proved expensive, too, and needed a completely new fueling infrastructure; electric cars could be charged up in the garage at night. “One of the reasons battery-powered electric vehicles jumped ahead so decisively is that there was a parallel industry—consumer electronics—scaling up the use of lithium-ion batteries, increasing performance, and hammering down the costs,” says Colin McKerracher, head of transport analysis at BNEF. Hydrogen didn’t have that kind of push. As the cost of lithium ion batteries has dropped, the electric car market has grown from barely visible two decades ago to one of the fastest-growing segments of the auto industry. Last year, more than 2 million passenger EVs were sold globally, according to BNEF data, while there are still fewer than 20,000 hydrogen-powered cars on road.Hydrogen could still be useful for transport, but it’s more likely to find its way into buses and trucks than cars and motorcycles. The bigger chance for hydrogen is likely to be in heating and industry. Blue hydrogen could be a particularly effective tool for oil and gas companies looking to re-purpose their existing investments—namely pipes. The same infrastructure that today carries natural gas up to the surface could instead be used to move carbon dioxide in the opposite direction.“We’ve built this competence over decades,” says Steinar Eikaas, vice president of low carbon solutions at Equinor ASA. His team has proposed converting a natural gas power plant in the Netherlands to run on blue hydrogen. “If you want to store CO₂ safely, there is no other industry but the oil and gas industry that can do it.”This isn’t purely theoretical. A hydrogen production facility in North Dakota has been capturing and burying as much as 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year since 2000. Ultimately, blue hydrogen is an easier way for an oil company to pivot to clean energy than going full-on renewable. “It’s a way to avoid having stranded assets from the current fossil fuel-based system,” says Pierre-Etienne Franc, who leads hydrogen projects at Air Liquide and represents the company on the Hydrogen Council. “Hydrogen is a way to continue to use [fossil assets] with no CO₂ emissions.”Others are more bullish about the future of green hydrogen. The price of renewable electricity is falling considerably faster than the prices of natural gas and carbon capture; same goes for the price of the industrial scale electrolyzers used to separate the hydrogen atoms in water from the oxygen atoms. With the help of government policies such as funding for research, subsidies for deployment, and a system to put a modest price on carbon emissions, BNEF projects that by 2050, green hydrogen could cost less than a third of what it does today. Annual sales could reach $700 billion by then, compared to about $1.5 trillion currently for the oil and gas sector.“Electrolyzers may very well be at the same stage as solar power was more than a decade ago,” says Varun Sivaram, senior fellow at the Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. The sums governments invested in the technology as part of the stimulus measures after the 2008 financial crisis helped solar power become cheaper and, now, ubiquitous, Sivaram found in a study published this month. The post-pandemic stimulus measures could do the same for hydrogen.Currently, governments are investing in both green and blue hydrogen. The U.K., for instance, plans to spend £800 million ($993 million) to create carbon capture and storage clusters. These would enable capturing carbon dioxide not just from blue hydrogen production, but also from other industries such as cement production and oil refineries. The Netherlands is planning to spend €2.8 billion ($3.1 billion) on offshore wind turbines to power green hydrogen production for heating and energy. Equinor is investing millions of euros to build a green hydrogen facility in Norway that will power ships for people and cargo.To meet BNEF’s optimistic projections, the world will need to spend $11 trillion over the next 30 years. Much of that will come from private players, but governments will have to provide early support to unlock that capital. Europe's proposals so far promises to “make Europe the leader in low-carbon hydrogen production over the coming decade,” according to BNEF.From a long-term perspective, the spending is more than worth it, says Marc Elliott, an analyst at Investec Securities Ltd. in London. “If we’re going to decarbonize,” he says, “I view hydrogen as the best silver bullet we’ve got.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-long-bet-hydrogen-090042611.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-12	2020-05-12 17:06:46	EQNR	Equinor ASA	World’s Biggest Wealth Fund Faces Record $37 Billion Withdrawal	(Bloomberg) -- Norway plans to draw a record 382 billion kroner ($37 billion) from its wealth fund, forcing the world’s biggest sovereign investor to embark on an historic asset sale to generate cash.The unprecedented withdrawal, revealed in Norway’s revised budget for 2020, is more than four times the previous record set in 2016.The development exposes the scale of the economic damage done by the twin crises of Covid-19 and a collapse in global oil markets, with western Europe’s biggest crude exporter now facing its worst economic slump since World War II.For the first time, Norway’s government is set to withdraw considerably more than the $1 trillion fund generates in cash flow from dividends and interest payments. A Finance Ministry spokeswoman said the estimate for the fund’s cash flow this year is 249 billion kroner. That means asset sales could reach 133 billion kroner, or $13 billion. In the published budget, the Finance Ministry lists cash flow of 258 billion kroner, which includes income from Norway’s domestic wealth fund, the spokeswoman said.“It’s obviously an historic event,” SEB Chief Strategist Erica Dalsto said. “But we’re also in a crisis that lacks historical parallels. This illustrates the double-whammy that’s hit the Norwegian economy, with repercussions from both containment measures and the oil-price collapse.”Bond SalesThe fund is likely to focus on its bond portfolio to generate the cash the government needs, both in the form of outright sales and by retaining cash as some bonds mature. (It needs to replenish its holding of stocks after its equity portfolio fell below a required 70% target of the total portfolio.)Norway’s government uses its oil wealth to plug budget deficits every year. Until 2016, the so-called structural oil-corrected deficit was covered by the state’s income from petroleum, namely taxes, stakes in offshore fields and dividends from Equinor ASA.As long as the government was generating a surplus, it could deposit money into the fund. In 2016 and 2017, deposits were replaced by withdrawals, as petroleum revenue dwindled due to a slump in prices. But the fund was still able to cover that easily with its cash flow.In 2020, everything changed. The government now expects to spend a record 420 billion kroner of oil money on crisis packages to prop up its economy, with the collapse in petroleum revenue compounding the shock. The government predicts its net cash flow from petroleum activities will drop by 62% to 98 billion kroner, the lowest since 1999.‘Financial Muscles’Norway has a self-imposed fiscal rule stating it should use no more than 3% of the fund’s value each year to plug budget holes (which represents the long-term real-return expectation for the fund). But it’s allowed to stray from that limit to help the economy during downturns. At 4.2% this year, spending will exceed the cap for the first time since the financial crisis in 2009.Norway must eventually return to the 3% limit, but this year’s breach is entirely justified, said Finance Minister Jan Tore Sanner.“Even if it’s expensive, it’s necessary,” he told a news conference. “We are lucky in Norway. Where other countries need to borrow money -- maybe even before they’ve paid back following the financial crisis -- we have solid financial muscles.”(Updates with Finance Ministry comment on cash flow estimate from fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-biggest-wealth-fund-faces-080732585.html?.tsrc=rss

State-run Saudi Aramco, which earlier this year initiated a war by offering massive discounts on its crude, raised prices on almost all grades for June. The move comes as the kingdom and its OPEC+ partners embark on record production cuts in a bid to balance a glutted market.“The higher prices by Aramco suggest a recovery of demand,” said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.The OPEC+ coalition that includes Russia started implementing output cuts of 9.7 million barrels a day this month. The move follows a record build-up in inventories as demand was ravaged by the coronavirus outbreak that has seen oil tanks filling up globally. There have been tentative signs from China to Germany and Florida that demand for fuel -- particularly gasoline -- is starting to pick up.Some of the biggest moves in Saudi oil pricing came for refiners in Europe and the Mediterranean, also the main market for Russian crude. It’s possibly a sign that the price and market-share wars are easing after Riyadh and Moscow agreed last month to work together again as part of the OPEC+ alliance. Prices in those regions were hiked by between $5.80 and $7.50 for June, according to the price list.“The price increase suggests Saudi Arabia will not just cut their production as part of the OPEC deal, but also reduce their crude exports by making them more expensive,” said Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Group AG.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-claws-back-supply-concerns-221652771.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-24	2020-04-24 02:58:07	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Petronas Mulls More Dividend to Fund Malaysia’s Stimulus	(Bloomberg) -- Malaysia’s state oil company is considering raising this year’s dividend to help the government fund its nearly $60 billion stimulus package, according to people familiar with the matter.Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or Petronas, could increase the payout by as much as 10 billion ringgit ($2.3 billion), said one of the people, who asked not to be named as the information is private. The company had earlier announced that it would pay 24 billion ringgit in dividend this year.A higher payout would help Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin fund the government’s 260 billion ringgit stimulus package, which is aimed at shoring up an economy that’s struggling with the impact of the pandemic and a crash in oil prices. Even with the stimulus, the central bank expects gross domestic product to shrink as much as 2% or grow up to 0.5% this year.Deliberations on the dividend increase are still ongoing, the people said. Any additional dividends, which is subject to approval of the board, will need to take into account factors including funding requirements for operations and ability to service debts and other obligations, a representative for Petronas said in an emailed response to Bloomberg News.As Petronas mulls boosting its dividends, oil giants around the world are cutting or at best scrambling to maintain their shareholder payouts amid the historic price rout, which even plunged into negative territory this week. Occidental Petroleum Corp. slashed its dividend by 86% last month, while Norway’s state-backed Equinor ASA on Thursday became the first international major to announce a cut.Petronas was asked to pay 54 billion ringgit of dividend last year, including a 30 billion-ringgit one-time special payment, as the government struggled to narrow the budget deficit after revising its consumer tax policy. The payout increase this year would come after the company sold $6 billion of bonds this month, the biggest offering by a company in Asia in 2020.Fitch Ratings revised its outlook of Petronas to negative, from stable, while affirming its A- rating on April 14. The state oil firm had cash holdings of 123 billion ringgit against total debt of around 55 billion ringgit at end-2019, and the government is expected to support the company in maintaining a healthy credit profile due to its importance to state revenue, Fitch said in the report.(Updates with payout outlook of other oil majors in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petronas-mulls-more-dividend-fund-011201420.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-23	2020-04-23 15:31:03	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Oil Recovers After Furious Selloff But Still Struggles With Glut	(Bloomberg) -- Oil extended its recovery from Monday’s plunge below zero, but trading remains volatile with the market under intense pressure from a swelling global glut.Futures in New York rose as much as 32% on Thursday. Already inundated with bearish signals, the market shrugged off a warning from one of the world’s top oil traders that a crunch point is fast approaching, where refiners will have nowhere to put their products.The rebound from negative territory is likely a correction, according to Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy. “Until we see some kind of resolution to the idea of how much demand is being destroyed from the Covid crisis, rallies will be short-lived,” he said.U.S. benchmark crude has plummeted about 70% so far this year as the coronavirus pandemic shutters economies and keeps drivers off the road. The World Bank says global commodities markets will face lasting disruption because of the outbreak.The OPEC+ coalition agreed earlier this month to slash daily production by about 10 million barrels a day in an effort to reduce the oversupply. The cuts, due to start in May, are slowly being brought forward, with both Algeria and Kuwait saying they’ll now curb output immediately. In the U.S., operators have started shutting wells and halting drilling, steps that could reduce output there by 20% and leave thousands of workers unemployed.“The oil market is still running with a solid surplus and inventories are building by the day,” said SEB chief commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop. “The market is now trading higher in relief, knowing that it is almost a full month until the WTI June 2020 contract is set to roll off.”Oil markets are also having to grapple with a wave of volatility spurred by exchange-traded funds. The United States Oil Fund may roll more of its WTI contracts forward due to extraordinary market conditions, while at least two brokerages, including INTL FCStone Financial Inc., are limiting the ability of some clients to enter into new trades in the most active oil benchmarks.Oil’s collapse has also caught out funds from Beijing to Seoul and Mumbai, and caused Chinese banks to suspend new positions on crude products.Stockpile GainsIn the U.S., crude stockpiles are at the highest level since May 2017, according to the Energy Information Administration, while inventories at the nation’s key storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, increased each week since early March and are inching closer to its maximum capacity of around 76 million barrels.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-extends-recovery-furious-selloff-221644140.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-18	2020-04-18 00:00:23	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Saudi Arabia Should Spend Like the Debtor It Is	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There’s a certain devil-may-care glamour about going on a shopping spree when you’re already living beyond your means. It’s probably not the best way to convince your creditors to keep putting up the cash, however. Saudi Arabia might want to reflect on that after its recent splurge on oil companies, cruise ships and soccer. In the past month, the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund has bought or been linked to plans to buy an 8.2% stake in cruise operator Carnival Corp.; about 80% of Newcastle United Football Club; and holdings in Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA, Eni SpA and Equinor ASA. Alarmingly, the most sensible item on that shopping list may well be the 13th-placed team in the English Premier League. Carnival shares, for instance, are already down by about a third since the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund completed its acquisition of stock in the business last month.A country as over-exposed to crude as Saudi Arabia shouldn’t be using its sovereign wealth fund to buy more oil, either. Equinor’s controlling shareholder, the state of Norway, last year instructed its pension fund to sell off investments in upstream oil and gas, so as to “make the government’s wealth less vulnerable to a permanent drop in oil prices.” Saudi Arabia is doing the opposite.Even the PIF’s more prudent attempts to diversify its exposures into businesses distant from oil demand haven’t panned out so well. A pre-listing investment of $3.5 billion in Uber Technologies Inc. is worth less than $2 billion now. Its 38% stake in South Korea’s Posco Engineering & Construction Co. has lost more than two-thirds of its value since it was bought in 2015. And the kingdom managed to sell out of Tesla Inc. before its extraordinary rally at the start of the year.As rich heirs have known since time immemorial, a string of failed business ventures doesn’t need to cramp your style as long as that endowment cash keeps flowing — but the problem for Saudi Arabia is that, as we’ve argued, those days are fast running out.As recently as 2014, years of outsize profits on crude had left the government sitting on net assets equivalent to 47% of gross domestic product. Since then, lower prices and incontinent spending have eroded Saudi Arabia’s nest egg with astonishing speed. Net debt will hit 19% of GDP this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, before rising to 27% next year, while coronavirus and oil-fight measures could push gross borrowing to 50% by 2022.That’s still modest by rich-country standards, but none is as leveraged as Saudi Arabia is to the price of a single commodity, as my colleague Liam Denning has written. Barring extraordinary cuts to its budget or a 2008-style oil price spike, the kingdom is likely to remain a net debtor for the foreseeable future. Lenders already appear to be taking notice. Thanks to the general virus-inspired market panic and the specific effects of the current oil-price war, five-year credit default swaps insuring against non-payment of Saudi Arabia’s debt are currently running at about 179 basis points. That puts the country in the company of India, Indonesia, and Russia in terms of perceived credit risks, and far worse than the likes of Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Iceland.Its sovereign bonds still have a weighted average coupon of 3.43% and maturity in the latter half of 2030, so for the moment things seem comfortable enough. But lower-for-longer oil prices could cause that outlook to unwind remarkably quickly, especially if the kingdom’s fast-shrinking foreign reserves start putting pressure on the riyal’s dollar peg.Despite the PIF’s shopping spree, there are signs that Riyadh is aware of how constrained its circumstances are starting to become. Last week's announcement of a ceasefire in the bloody five-year war in Yemen is welcome for humanitarian reasons — but it’s also necessary on a more pragmatic level. Saudi Arabia’s military spending is the third-biggest globally after the U.S. and China, and amounts to an extraordinary 8.8% of GDP — the highest share of any country for which the World Bank has recent data.The ceasefire is being attributed to the impact of Covid-19, but it’s hard not to notice that military spending this year will fall to its lowest level in a decade. When the finances get tight, you just don’t have the money to spend on a quagmire that you once did.That willingness to make cuts is welcome — but once you add the amounts dedicated to domestic security, some 28% of Saudi Arabia’s budget is still going on such expenditures. It’s not surprising that a government lacking popular legitimacy in the middle of a strife-torn region should be spending a lot of money on self-preservation. Still, a country where 40% of the 33 million-strong population is under 25 might want to invest more on health, education and other longer-term goals.It’s probably that 1 trillion riyal ($271 billion) government budget, rather than splashy overseas acquisitions, where the biggest savings need to be made right now. The message is the same, though: Riyadh needs to start cutting its coat according to its cloth, and fast.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2020-04-09	2020-04-09 04:25:34	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Saudi Wealth Fund Buys Stakes in European Energy Companies	(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund has built up stakes in European oil firms, including about $200 million in Equinor ASA, as the kingdom navigates the coronavirus pandemic and plummeting crude prices.The Public Investment Fund amassed shares in Norway’s largest producer mostly through the open market last week, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified, adding that it’s unclear exactly when the fund bought the holding or if it’s still buying.Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported that PIF also built up stakes in Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and Eni SpA, worth about $1 billion combined across all four oil majors, citing people familiar.Saudi Arabia’s $320 billion sovereign wealth fund, run by Yasir Al-Rumayyan and controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is taking advantage of a slump in stock market valuations as it steps up deal-making to become the world’s biggest manager of sovereign capital. The fund last month built an 8.2% stake in cruise operator Carnival Corp. after shares slumped due to the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.Representatives for the PIF, Equinor and Shell declined to comment. Total and Eni weren’t immediately available to comment outside of normal business hours.Decline in AssetsOn top of the collapse of oil prices and a meltdown in global markets, Gulf sovereign wealth funds are channeling some of their billions back home to counter slowing economic growth triggered by the coronavirus. The decline in assets from funds in countries such as Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia could exceed $300 billion this year, according to the Institute of International Finance, the industry’s global association.In contrast to 2015, the last time crude prices collapsed, Saudi Arabia will likely focus on borrowing rather than drawing down PIF funds, according to the IIF.

2020-04-09	2020-04-09 04:25:34	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Saudi Wealth Fund Builds $200 Million Stake in Norway’s State Oil Company	(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund has built up stakes in European oil firms, including about $200 million in Equinor ASA, as the kingdom navigates the coronavirus pandemic and plummeting crude prices.The Public Investment Fund amassed shares in Norway’s largest producer mostly through the open market last week, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified, adding that it’s unclear exactly when the fund bought the holding or if it’s still buying.Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported that PIF also built up stakes in Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and Eni SpA, worth about $1 billion combined across all four oil majors, citing people familiar.Saudi Arabia’s $320 billion sovereign wealth fund, run by Yasir Al-Rumayyan and controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is taking advantage of a slump in stock market valuations as it steps up deal-making to become the world’s biggest manager of sovereign capital. The fund last month built an 8.2% stake in cruise operator Carnival Corp. after shares slumped due to the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.Representatives for the PIF, Equinor and Shell declined to comment. Total and Eni weren’t immediately available to comment outside of normal business hours.Decline in AssetsOn top of the collapse of oil prices and a meltdown in global markets, Gulf sovereign wealth funds are channeling some of their billions back home to counter slowing economic growth triggered by the coronavirus. The decline in assets from funds in countries such as Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia could exceed $300 billion this year, according to the Institute of International Finance, the industry’s global association.In contrast to 2015, the last time crude prices collapsed, Saudi Arabia will likely focus on borrowing rather than drawing down PIF funds, according to the IIF.

But they quickly moved on to bring 11 new investment-grade dollar deals, and T-Mobile is marketing a jumbo offering for its acquisition of Sprint Corp. Carnival Corp.’s new debt issue is expected to price today after increasing the size of the offering and cutting the coupon. Europe has 17 new deals, its busiest day since January.Investors rounded out March on a high note, marked by rampant demand for new issues and tightening spreads in the last two weeks, propelled by unprecedented fiscal and monetary support. U.S. investment-grade issuance topped $259 billion for a new monthly record, while European supply passed 135 billion euros ($148 billion), the most since 2016. Asia’s dollar market was quiet for most of the month, though Chinese internet search giant Baidu Inc. announced a deal to start April.Still, returns were dismal. Even with the Fed’s help fueling a late stage rally, March was still the worst month for returns since the end of 2008, with U.S. high-yield down 11.5% and investment grade dropping 7.1%. The European index lost 6.9% in March, its biggest loss ever. Spreads on top-rated Asian dollar bonds ended the first quarter 146 basis points wider, the worst blowout since 2009.Wednesday’s busy lineup in the U.S. materialized after a subdued start, with Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and Norwegian oil company Equinor ASA leading the docket.

After record issuance in January, sales of dollar securities by the region’s issuers, including financials and sovereigns, sputtered in the first quarter, totaling about $86 billion, up only about 3% on the year-earlier periodOne reason for that is that unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank has had more direct benefits in the U.S. and European marketsAnother factor is that Asian companies have been able to tap local-currency markets.

2020-03-13	2020-03-13 09:28:13	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Norges Bank Slashes Key Rate by Half Point to Fight Crisis	(Bloomberg) -- Norway’s central bank delivered an emergency half-percentage point cut to its main interest rate and signaled more will come as policy makers pump stimulus into the oil and trade reliant economy a week ahead of a scheduled meeting.“A lower policy rate cannot prevent the coronavirus outbreak from having a substantial impact on the Norwegian economy, but it could dampen the downturn and mitigate the risk of more persistent effects on output and employment,” the bank said on Friday.The krone, which had suffered a dramatic sell-off earlier in the week, rebounded after the central bank announced its support measures, gaining as much as 1.6% against the euro. But the exchange rate remains historically weak.Policy makers in Norway are the latest to join a global wave of stimulus efforts. The Federal Reserve slashed its main rate by a half point on March 3, and was soon followed by others including the Bank of England. The European Central Bank opted not to cut its main rate, choosing instead to add liquidity. In Sweden, the central bank has provided emergency liquidity in the form of bank loans, but has also refrained from extra rate cuts for now.“Sweden and Norway both face a trade-related slump plus a hit to domestic demand from their own virus outbreaks,” said Johanna Jeansson of Bloomberg Economics. “We expect today’s emergency measures will be followed by more central bank action in the form of rate cuts in Norway and bond purchases in Sweden. But primarily, it will be governments that will have to shoulder the responsibility this time.”In addition to its rate cut to 1% from 1.5%, Norges Bank said it “is monitoring developments closely and is prepared to make further rate cuts.” In measures specifically targeting banks, Norway will also cut the so-called countercyclical capital buffer to 1% from 2.5%, to encourage the industry to keep lending to businesses.Policy makers in Norway are racing to protect their economy from the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic and a crash in crude prices. Some economists warn that a recession is coming, and investors have dumped the Norwegian krone as the panic spreads.The number of coronavirus cases in Norway has soared to above 600, prompting school shutdowns and the closure of borders to travelers from the hardest hit countries.“In the near term, activity in the Norwegian economy will decline considerably owing to the coronavirus outbreak,” Norges Bank said. “Unemployment is expected to rise. Economic prospects have also weakened on the back of the sharp fall in oil prices.”Read: Virus Shutters Nordic Schools as Number of Cases Hits 2,000The Norwegian government is set to present a stimulus package later on Friday, with measures expected to range from new layoff-rules to efforts to help the struggling airline industry.Some of Norway’s biggest companies have been devastated by the latest developments, given the nation’s exposure to oil and trade. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA on Thursday extended its plunge so far this year to 80% after the U.S. imposed a partial travel ban targeting Europe. DNB ASA, Norway’s biggest bank and a major provider of loans to the offshore industry, has plunged by a third this year. Equinor ASA, the country’s biggest oil and gas producer, also slumped with crude prices.As recently as the second half of last year, Norway’s central bank was raising rates to help steer the economy’s growth. The nation’s vast oil wealth, which has helped build a $1 trillion wealth fund, has generally helped Norway weather most storms, but policy makers say it remains unclear what effect the current crisis will have.(Adds Bloomberg Economics comment, reference to easing in Sweden)&#92;--With assistance from Nick Rigillo and Zoe Schneeweiss.To contact the reporter on this story: Mikael Holter in Oslo at mholter2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norges-bank-slashes-key-rate-074041225.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-10	2020-03-10 07:26:52	EQNR	Equinor ASA	The Oil Crisis Is Even Worse News for Shell and BP	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The collapse in crude prices has brought into relief the correlation between oil majors’ financial leverage and the valuation of their shares. It’s a relationship that looks like particularly bad news for the bigger European firms.Investors’ knee-jerk reaction to the downward lurch in the oil price was, naturally, more severe toward the companies that were more indebted. So shares in BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Equinor ASA and Eni SpA suffered more than Total SA and the two big U.S. majors, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., when European markets closed on Monday.Investors’ worries about leverage are longstanding. The top five European oil majors have a ratio of net debt to total capital — a leverage measure known as gearing — averaging 28% based on their 2019 annual results. Meanwhile, Exxon and Chevron were at 20% and 15%, respectively, at the full year, according to Bloomberg data. Valuations based on forward earnings have historically been lower in Europe than in the U.S., and analysts have suggested that leverage may help explain why investors rate the European sector less favorably. As research from UBS Group AG noted ahead of Monday’s sell-off, balance-sheet strength would define which oil majors got “less badly hurt” in a market where there would be no winners.Despite these dynamics, the most levered of the European groups have been making relatively slow progress at debt reduction, and the latest crisis is only going to hamper this further. BP and Shell’s gearing is already above their own near-term targets of 20%- 30% and 25% respectively. These targets assumed a different environment, and preventing gearing going back up would require some painful compromises around uses of cash.Shell’s free cash flow in 2019 was only just enough to cover its dividends and debt interest, adjusting for working capital and excluding what it made selling assets. That was with oil prices in the $55-$70 per barrel range, against around $37 now. Capex was also already below the company’s stated floor, and the group has just gone through a colossal efficiency program following the 2016 acquisition of BG Group. As for debt reduction, this is a terrible market in which to be selling assets. True, Shell could scrap its share buyback program, but that would halt progress on reducing the share count and in turn the absolute cost of the dividend.BP, on the other hand, provocatively raised its dividend last month, anticipating cash from recently agreed-on disposals and from the sale of a putative $5 billion worth of assets yet to find buyers. But the number put on that fresh divestment program must now be in doubt.The oil crisis should force a fresh appraisal of gearing targets and dividend levels. But investors crave the income, and the pressure to maintain payouts will be immense. The firms with lower leverage may feel they have earned the right to let borrowings tick up as a way of maintaining investment and cash to shareholders. For others, Shell in particular, the room for maneuver is more limited.

2020-03-06	2020-03-06 04:00:00	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Exxon, Shell Face Uphill Legal Battle Over Soured Nigerian Deal	(Bloomberg) -- Oil majors including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are facing uphill battles to convince U.S. courts to enforce multi-billion dollar arbitration awards they secured against Nigeria’s state oil company.The companies accused the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. of taking more crude than it was entitled to under four deals that were signed in 1993 to incentivise them to develop deep offshore blocks. Those projects today account for about 30% of the country’s 2 million barrels of daily output.Independent arbitration tribunals seated in Nigeria sided with the companies and awarded them damages. But the NNPC successfully challenged the awards in the Nigerian courts, which ruled the disagreements were either tax disputes and not subject to arbitration, or the tribunals had no right to impose the penalties.In September last year, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed a lawsuit filed by Exxon and Shell units that aimed at enforcing a 2011 arbitration ruling requiring NNPC to pay them $1.8 billion for a contractual breach. Judge William Pauley noted that the companies had multiple appeals pending in Nigeria.‘No Justice’The companies have appealed the U.S. judgment, saying the Nigerian courts denied them due process by annulling the award and they are now owed $2.7 billion with accrued interest.The case was filed in the U.S. because Nigeria’s courts have never ordered NNPC to pay monetary damages to a foreign plaintiff over two decades and lack “the political independence to render impartial judgments in a high-value dispute,” the companies said in a court filing. It could take at least a decade for Nigeria’s Supreme Court to adjudicate in the appeals process, “which renders the prospect of justice so illusory as to amount to no justice at all,” they said.Umar Gwandu, a spokesman for Justice Minister Abubakar Malami, didn’t respond to a request for comment. NNPC must file its response to the U.S. appeal by April 10.The companies “face a formidable challenge” to persuade a U.S. judge to reinstate damages already set aside by a Nigerian court, said Tafadzwa Pasipanodya, a Washington-based partner in Foley Hoag LLP’s international litigation and arbitration department.Read more about another legal dispute has with the oil majors. Separate tribunals in Nigeria instructed NNPC to pay a Shell-led consortium $1.4 billion in damages in 2013, and Eni SpA more than $500 million the following year, while Chevron Corp. and Equinor ASA secured a $1 billion award in 2015. Those awards were also set aside by the local courts.Chevron and Equinor initiated their own proceedings in the Southern District of New York in March 2018 to enforce their award, with oral argument scheduled to be heard on April 20. Eni approached the same court in mid-2017, but suspended its legal action in November while Nigeria’s Federal High Court considers the matter.While U.S. courts can enforce arbitration awards made and subsequently overturned in other countries, they “apply a strong presumption in favor of following the foreign court’s ruling,” according to Jonathan Blackman, New York-based senior counsel at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP.The parties must show the decisions of the Nigerian judiciary were “repugnant to basic U.S. principles of justice and fairness or due process,” he said. “This is a difficult -- but not impossible -- standard to meet.”Industry SupportThe case brought by Exxon and Shell meets that threshold, according to the American Petroleum Institute, which filed a brief in support of the companies’ appeal. The conduct of Nigeria’s courts “runs contrary to central concepts of justice in the United States,” it said.Spokesmen for Exxon, Chevron and Equinor said their companies don’t comment on ongoing litigation. Representatives of Shell, Eni and NNPC didn’t respond to requests for comment.There is an example of an arbitration decision that went against Nigeria being enforced in the U.K., which threatens to put further strain on the nation’s already stretched finances.In September, a British judge ruled that Process & Industrial Developments Ltd. can collect on a compensation award for losses incurred on an aborted gas-processing project in Nigeria -- a claim that now stands at $9.6 billion, or more than a quarter of the nation’s foreign reserves. Nigeria’s government, which is appealing that ruling, alleges the company paid bribes to secure the contract. P&ID denies any wrongdoing.Read more about the U.K case.

2020-03-05	2020-03-05 14:47:30	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Germany Sees No Role for Natural Gas in Draft Plan for Hydrogen	(Bloomberg) -- Germany will include only the greenest sources of hydrogen in a package of incentives designed to build up the fuel as a low-carbon source of energy, according to a draft government strategy document.The move, if endorsed by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet, would be a blow to natural gas producers, which increasingly see hydrogen as part of the way they can adapt to tightening rules on greenhouse gas emissions.Hydrogen burns without producing carbon dioxide and has the energy to provide temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius or more needed by steel makers and oil refiners. Yet much of the fuel currently is derived from natural gas, throwing off carbon emissions in the process. Germany wants to focus its support on green hydrogen, where the gas is made with electricity from renewables.“From the federal government’s point of view, only hydrogen that is produced on the basis of renewable energies is sustainable in the long term,” according to the draft government document seen by Bloomberg News. “It is therefore the goal of the federal government to use green hydrogen and to support a rapid market ramp-up and to establish corresponding value chains.”Germany is the main importer of natural gas in Europe, and the industry is drawing up plans on how to adapt the fuel and its systems to a future hydrogen market. Germany’s main objective is to produce hydrogen on a large scale, and the natural gas industry wants to maximize its involvement in that work.“It is disturbing that the government wants to slash any ideas of technology openness,” said Timm Kehler, chairman at the gas industry lobby group Zukunft Erdgas. “It will limit Germany’s production capacity of CO2-neutral hydrogen and eliminate the country’s own industry from the game.”Economy and Energy Ministry spokesperson said the ministry doesn’t comment on drafts that are still in preparation. The document is due to be discussed by Merkel’s Cabinet on March 18.An earlier draft of the strategy that circulated in January included stimulus for hydrogen produced from fossil fuels -- so long as those are coupled with solutions to eliminate emissions from the production process. An example is so-called blue hydrogen, which is conventionally produced from natural gas coupled with carbon capture and storage. Another is “turquoise” hydrogen, made from natural gas with pyrolysis and permanent storage or binding of carbon.Natural gas producers from Equinor ASA to Gazprom PJSC are looking to tap into the potential for hydrogen in the German market.The decision to eliminate natural gas from the stimulus package is the result of an intense debate among different areas of the government. The Economy Ministry saw the use of natural gas as something that could leverage the hydrogen market quickly. The Environment, Development and Research ministries believes that this could only delay the development of a clean hydrogen market.It’s also a further evidence that the natural gas industry is struggling to find its place in a future low-carbon economy. Demand for fuel in Europe is expected to fall 4% by 2030 and another 6% by 2040 under a scenario set out by the International Energy Agency. The outlook is negative even with countries like Germany eliminating coal and nuclear energy production, which could open up great opportunities for less polluting fossil fuel.“We would like to see a hydrogen economy being developed in a cooperation between large industrial users, gas transmission operators and gas producers,” Tor Martin Anfinnsen, a senior vice-president at Norway’s Equinor, said in an interview last month. “This also requires governments to regard hydrogen from decarbonized gas as one of the viable solutions.”Heating sectorAnother big change from the government’s first draft to the last one is the withdrawal of heating from the sectors to receive incentives to use hydrogen.Germany is focusing on sectors that cannot be decarbonized in any other way, namely the steel and chemical industries. Certain areas of maritime, heavy shipping and long-distance transportation might also be ripe for using the fuel, according to the new draft.Germany already uses blue hydrogen in various chemical and industrial processes as the production of ammonia. But “as far as possible,” these applications also must be converted into green hydrogen-based production to qualify for support, according to the document.Production CapacityGermany’s government considers developing a strong production capacity as a first step for the hydrogen market ramp-up.In the first draft, the target was to raise production of the gas using electrolysis to as much as 5 gigawatts from less than 1 gigawatt at present in order to have a fifth of hydrogen consumption via renewable resources by 2030. Now, Germany is considering to raise that target to up to 15 gigawatts of electrolysis capacity. No final decisions have been made yet.To contact the reporters on this story: Vanessa Dezem in Frankfurt at vdezem@bloomberg.net;Brian Parkin in Berlin at bparkin@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net, Andrew ReiersonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/germany-sees-no-role-natural-144730126.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-25	2020-02-25 13:26:43	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Oil Steadies Following Virus Sell-Off as Fallout Unknown	(Bloomberg) -- Oil steadied after the biggest drop in almost seven weeks as investors attempted to gauge the economic impact of the fast-spreading coronavirus and the potential response from producers.Futures held above $51 a barrel in New York after tumbling 3.7% on Monday amid a broad market sell-off driven by an increase in cases of the virus in South Korea, the Middle East and Europe. Prices ticked higher earlier Tuesday when Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman expressed confidence in the OPEC+ partnership, while saying the group hasn’t made a decision yet on whether to extend or modify its production-cut agreement.Crude had rallied over the past couple of weeks on optimism the virus would be mainly contained within China and the global economy would avoid a major slowdown. Those assumptions are now in doubt following the rapid spread in recent days, which may also pile pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to take action to stabilize oil markets.“The longer the crisis drags on, the more severe the economic consequences would be, meaning further downward revisions in GDP and oil-demand forecasts,” said Tamas Varga, an analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd. in London.West Texas Intermediate for April delivery rose 12 cents to $51.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 8:25 a.m. local time. It slumped $1.95 on Monday to $51.43, the lowest close since Feb. 13. Brent for April settlement also advanced 12 cents, trading at $56.42 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, after falling 3.8% on Monday.Vitol Group, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, estimates the virus is currently reducing China’s oil demand by about 4 million barrels a day, or around 4% of global consumption. While Vitol and others are positioning for a demand rebound, forecasts for when that will come may now need to be pushed back as the outbreak goes global.See also: At London’s Oil Week, Clues About Demand Will Be All AroundRussia -- which had asked for more time before committing to additional production cuts recommended by OPEC+ officials -- may be forced to agree to the reductions if the rapid spread of the virus pushes oil prices down further, according to Vandana Hari, the founder of Vanda Insights in Singapore.&#92;--With assistance from James Thornhill.To contact the reporters on this story: Ann Koh in Singapore at akoh15@bloomberg.net;Grant Smith in London at gsmith52@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Amanda Jordan, Christopher SellFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crude-holds-losses-demand-concerns-231316164.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-02-25	2020-02-25 05:28:39	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Equinor Drops Australia Oil Plan in Win for Green Activists	(Bloomberg) -- Equinor ASA has dropped plans for oil drilling deep in the ocean off Australia’s south coast following a sustained campaign from environmentalists who said the project posed too big a risk to the vast and unique marine ecosystem.The Norwegian company won’t drill the Stromlo-1 exploration well in the Great Australian Bight because “the opportunity is not commercially competitive,” it said Tuesday.Current lower oil prices and the outlook for plateauing demand amid a shift to electric vehicles and concerns over climate change has forced a rethink of many big-ticket energy projects. On Monday, Canada’s Teck Resources Ltd. pulled its application for a controversial $850 million oil-sands project, which was proposed at a time of $100 oil and also faced a pushback from environmentalists. Australia’s government on Tuesday renewed its commitment to tapping the Bight.“Many will find Equinor’s decision not to proceed with this oil exploration project in the Great Australian Bight extremely disappointing, and it is particularly hard for South Australia,” Resources Minister Keith Pitt said in a statement. “The Bight Basin remains one of Australia’s frontier basins.”Equinor earlier this month boosted its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even as its production hit record highs. Climate groups said its plan to open up a new region to fossil fuel production was at odds with its aim to become the world’s most carbon-efficient oil and gas company.“The decision is likely to have been driven by stronger carbon reduction targets of the European oil companies,” said Graeme Bethune, chief executive officer of energy consultants EnergyQuest. “Carbon costs are starting to bite and the European companies appear to be setting higher hurdles for oil projects than gas.”Industry estimates suggest the Bight could hold the equivalent of 1.9 billion barrels of oil, making it a hugely prospective resource. Other energy major have struggled to make it stack up, with both Chevron Corp. and BP Plc walking away from projects in the area in recent years.“With three global oil giants abandoning their plans to drill in the Bight, the time for the government to give the South Australian community certainty and permanent protection for the Great Australian Bight has come,” The Australia Institute, a lobby group that researches environmental issues, said Tuesday.Sarah Hanson-Young, a Greens senator for South Australia, welcomed the decision, saying it was good for tourism and the environment.Three other companies also have interests in Bight exploration permits: Murphy Oil Corp., Santos Ltd. and Bight Petroleum Corp. Karoon Energy Ltd. relinquished its permit last year.Equinor also holds an exploration permit offshore Western Australia and said it would continue with other ongoing activities in the country.“We will engage with the federal and state authorities regarding our decision to discontinue the exploration program” for the Great Australian Bight, Equinor said.(Adds other Bight permit holders in 10th paragraph.

2020-02-07	2020-02-07 14:22:54	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Britain Is Getting Ready to Scale Up Negative-Emissions Technology	(Bloomberg) -- British companies are preparing for the U.K. government to decide how to spend more than $1 billion on infrastructure capable of capturing and burying millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution.The money — 800 million pounds — will go toward partially funding a “cluster” that captures emissions from factories and power stations by the middle of this decade. In a bid to shore up its climate credentials, the Conservative party made the promise to spend the sum in its manifesto, before it won a majority in the general election in December.In 2015, a previous Conservative-led government made the surprise decision to scrap a $1.4 billion carbon-capture and storage contest. Yet no pathway to limit global warming to tolerable levels exists that doesn’t envision some use of the technology. Even if all electricity came from renewables, it doesn’t address the emissions from cement and steel plants—more than 10% of the global total—which have few technology alternatives working at scale.Last year, the U.K. became the first major country to target net-zero emissions by 2050. That might seem like a long time in the future, but it isn’t, said Dominic Nash, utilities analyst at Barclays Plc. In energy project investment terms “30 years is basically tomorrow.”Carbon capture projects would make most sense in five main clusters of industrial plants in the U.K. including near the Humber River, Merseyside, Teesside, Runcorn and Grangemouth, according to a report by the consulting group Element Energy Ltd. Those places employ more than 90,000 people in chemicals and oil refining. The utility Drax Group Plc wants government support for an initiative in the Humber region of England. The system would remove emissions and potentially pipe them to an oil field under the North Sea. “The government would be able to make the greatest contribution toward delivering its world-leading climate ambitions,” said Will Gardiner, chief executive officer of Drax.Drax’s consortium, which includes Equinor ASA and National Grid Plc, is already working on a system that removes carbon dioxide from burned biomass. It says this will create “negative emissions” because the trees removed CO2 from the atmosphere as they grew and the capture plant would then additionally bury the emissions from burning them.The technology is called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS, and it’s being tested by Drax in a partnership with Leeds-based startup C-Capture Ltd. The pilot plant is currently capable of capturing 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide each day. With an investment of 50 million pounds the plant can be scaled up this year to capture 100 metric tons each day, said C-Capture chief executive Tom White.Scaling up the current pilot to one biomass unit that could capture 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each day is “like going from a tricycle to an aircraft,” White said, adding that he’s confident he can accomplish the task in five to seven years.That one unit would capture about a quarter of the emissions at Drax in 2027, assuming one of its four biomass units is fitted with BECCs and the two currently burning coal are closed. Drax still has the U.K.’s highest stack emissions at the point of combustion. Drax notes that the plants grown to provide biomass for its furnaces absorbed CO2 as they grew and that those forests tend to capture carbon faster than they are harvested.“The U.K. has been toying with CCS for more than a decade,” Nash said. “This year is the year it might actually push the button on a project.”Whether that’s likely is unclear. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the government wants to be a world leader on carbon capture technology and that reaching net-zero emissions will require decisive action across the economy. In an indication of the government’s interest in CCS, U.K. Energy Minister Kwasi Kwarteng visited Drax last week. (Updates with detail from Drax in ninth and 10th paragraphs.

But the committee failed to set a date for an emergency meeting in February to implement the suggestion after Russia asked for more time.“There’s a little bit of hope OPEC will support the market,” said Michael Loewen, director of commodity strategy at Scotiabank. “Even before the virus, OPEC’s prior production cuts still left markets oversupplied and Russia has been reluctant to stick to these, so that also casts doubt on what they’re willing to do here.”Crude is down about 17% this year as the spread of the virus disrupts travel and fuel consumption, upending trade flows worldwide. The oil market’s structure also deepened further into a bearish contango this week, suggesting ample supply will persist. Major companies from BP Plc to Total SA expect the disease to wipe out up to a third of global demand growth in 2020, but OPEC itself has predicted a more modest decline even in its worst-case scenario.West Texas Intermediate crude advanced 0.2% to $50.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 11:04 a.m. local time, after earlier gaining as much as 2.9%.Brent traded 30 cents lower at $54.98 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.See also: Commodity Shippers Face ‘Crisis in Demand’ on Virus OutbreakOil prices rallied earlier in the day after proposals by China to lower tariffs on U.S. goods, effective Feb. 14.

Equinor is also now ahead of BP, Eni and U.S. companies Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have not yet included Scope 3 emissions in their carbon reduction targets.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equinor-fourth-quarter-profit-beats-055952383.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-20	2020-01-20 17:34:21	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Blackstone Gets Final Bids for North Sea Oil Producer	(Bloomberg) -- Siccar Point Energy Ltd., the North Sea oil producer backed by Blackstone Group Inc., has received final bids from suitors including Chrysaor Holdings Ltd. and Equinor ASA, people with knowledge of the matter said.Canada’s Suncor Energy Inc., Chinese oil major Cnooc Ltd. and a company backed by private equity firm HitecVision AS also submitted binding offers, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Many proposals fell short of the price expectations of Siccar Point’s owners, and some parties expressed interest only in certain assets, they said.Blackstone and Blue Water Energy LLP were earlier planning to seek about $2 billion to $3 billion from a sale of Siccar Point, the people said. They are now evaluating the bids and will decide whether to proceed with a transaction or hold on to the business for longer, the people said.Siccar Point’s owners started gauging interest from potential buyers last year. The company has grown through acquisitions including the $1 billion purchase of OMV AG’s U.K. unit in 2016, a deal that cemented its footprint in the British North Sea.Representatives for Blackstone, Chrysaor, Cnooc, Equinor, HitecVision, Siccar Point and Suncor declined to comment, while a representative for Blue Water didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The North Sea will continue to be an active spot for oil and gas deals this year, after $15 billion of assets changed hands in 2019, consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. said this month. Private-equity buyers have come in as larger companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. sold projects to focus on more profitable regions.Siccar Point has stakes in six projects including Rosebank, one of the U.K.’s largest undeveloped fields. The company’s overall output is expected at 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day this, rising to 80,000 a day by the second half of the 2020s, according to documents seen by Bloomberg last year.The Rosebank and Schiehallion projects are in waters west of the Shetland islands, a less developed area where majors still hold a strong presence. BP Plc operates the Schiehallion field, while Equinor is operator of the Rosebank development.&#92;--With assistance from Feifei Shen.To contact the reporters on this story: Laura Hurst in London at lhurst3@bloomberg.net;Dinesh Nair in London at dnair5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, ;Ben Scent at bscent@bloomberg.net, Rakteem KatakeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackstone-gets-final-bids-north-173421673.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-10	2020-01-10 18:49:46	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Energy Markets Have an Interesting Year Ahead	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The start of a new year brings with it a raft of data on the world’s energy systems. So far, electricity sector figures show a transition well underway — some sources increasing, others collapsing. Each market is different, but the trends in markets as diverse as the U.K., Spain, Australia and Texas all show profound changes in what is a very short period of time.Coal has nearly vanished in the U.K.: Figures from National Grid Plc show that coal-fired power made up just 2.1% of the power mix last year — down from 75% in 1990. Coal was the single-biggest generation type just six years ago; now, it is smaller than what analysis group Carbon Brief classifies as “other.” Gas is now by far the largest source of power generation in the U.K., followed by wind power, which surpassed nuclear last year.Coal collapsed in Spain, too: Coal-fired electricity in Spain dropped to its lowest levels since the country’s grid operator began keeping records in 1990. At less than 5% of total generation in 2019, Spain’s coal sector isn’t quite as shrunken as it is in the U.K., but it’s also 85.6% less than it was in 2002, when coal was at its peak, according to an El País analysis of the grid operator’s data. BloombergNEF analysis from October anticipated this change; as analysts said, Spanish coal hit an economic wall and utilities are now phasing out coal at a far faster rate than climate and energy policies dictate.U.S. coal power is now back to 1970s levels: According to Rhodium Group analysis, the U.S. power sector’s coal consumption fell 18% in 2019, bringing it back to the same level as in 1975. The resulting drop in power sector emissions was good enough for a 2% drop in economy-wide emissions, even with emissions from transportation, industry and agriculture all increasing.Wind almost — but not quite — blows away coal in Texas: As my colleagues pointed out in research earlier this week, Texas wind power came within a few gigawatt-hours of exceeding the Lone Star State’s coal-fired power generation last year. It’s worth seeing Texas’s wind, coal and gas-fired power charted together. Wind is structural, with steady growth since 2011; coal is cyclical, and it is essentially the inverse of gas-fired power at any given moment. The state is expected to add another 11 gigawatts of wind capacity by 2025.Solar crosses gas in Australia: Wind also surpassed coal in Australia last year — well, one kind of coal, at least. Wind generation exceeded brown coal generation in 2019. Brown coal, also called lignite, is not the main coal fuel in the country, however. Wind remains quite a ways behind black-coal-fired power generation.Perhaps more significant is another crossover point: Customer-owned rooftop solar now generates more power in Australia than all the country’s natural-gas-fired plants. Rooftop solar generation is also quite close to equaling wind generation as well. The next month will bring more global energy data, and more significant market activity, with BlackRock Inc. joining Climate Action 100+, the $41 trillion investor climate campaign. More market transitions are coming, from electrons and molecules to the capital that enables both.Weekend readingGreen bonds and loans totaled $465 billion in 2019, up 78% from 2018. 2019 was the warmest and driest year on record in Australia. 2019 was the second-wettest year on record in the U.S., and the hottest year ever recorded in Alaska, which was 6.2 degrees warmer than the long-term average.  IKEA of Sweden AB plans to be “climate positive” by the year 2030. JetBlue Airways Corp. aims to become carbon neutral by July.   Turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems A/S aims to become carbon neutral “no later than 2030.”   Oil producer Equinor ASA aims to cut its emissions to “near zero by 2050.” Philanthropy must stop fiddling while the world burns.

2020-01-08	2020-01-08 08:58:10	EQNR	Equinor ASA	A $20 Billion Danish Fund Won’t Remove Norway’s Equinor From Black List	(Bloomberg) -- Equinor ASA just unveiled its most ambitious climate plan yet, but it isn’t enough to get Norway’s biggest oil company off the exclusion list of a major Danish pension fund.State-controlled Equinor wants to make its production in Norway carbon neutral by 2050. Yet critics say it isn’t addressing the much more substantial pollution that comes from using the fuel after it’s exported.MP Pension, which oversees about $20 billion in assets, tossed out the 10 biggest crude producers last year. It says it sees no reason to adjust that decision, after taking a closer look at Equinor’s latest climate goals.Read: Oil Giant Reveals Survival Tactics in Age of Climate AnxietyAnders Schelde, the chief investment officer of MP, said Equinor’s targets are really what should be expected from any company, and don’t yet include any risk assessments of its business model in different scenarios in the transition to cleaner energy globally.“The steps taken by Equinor may perhaps stand out as ambitious within the fossil extraction sector, but less so when you compare across all sectors,” he said in an email. “They are not there yet in your view. They will remain on MP’s exclusion list also after this announcement.”‘Very Ambitious’Investors need to make individual assessments of their strategies, Equinor’s head of development and production in Norway said in an interview at a conference in Oslo on Wednesday.“We believe these are very ambitious and important measures toward meeting the climate challenge,” Arne Sigve Nylund said.Equinor said on Monday it will present a “holistic climate platform” next month, but declined to say whether it would provide specific targets for emissions derived from the use of its products, like some rivals have.“We will revert to that at the capital markets day” on Feb. 6, Nylund said on Wednesday.(Updates with Equinor comment in last paragraphs)To contact the reporters on this story: Mikael Holter in Oslo at mholter2@bloomberg.net;Christian Wienberg in Copenhagen at cwienberg@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-billion-danish-fund-won-162822331.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-07	2020-01-07 16:34:46	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Oil Giant Reveals Survival Tactics in Age of Climate Anxiety	(Bloomberg) -- The largest oil company in western Europe’s biggest petroleum exporter wants to drastically cut its carbon footprint.Equinor ASA, which is based in the Norwegian town of Stavanger on the edge of the North Sea, is trying to adapt its business model to a world increasingly alarmed by the fallout of climate change.Eldar Saetre, the chief executive of Equinor, puts it simply. “The most important question for us as a company and as an industry -- and also for Norway as a nation -- is this: how do we remain relevant and competitive?”Equinor, which is controlled by the Norwegian state, just launched its most ambitious climate goals to date. The idea is to make oil and gas installations virtually emissions-free by 2050.“This isn’t politics, it’s business,” Saetre told reporters in Oslo on Monday.Read: Equinor Plans to Make Norway Oil Operations Emissions-FreeEquinor, which not that long ago was called Statoil, is betting that lower emissions in the production phase can keep the company competitive. And with roughly a quarter of Norway’s total emissions coming from Equinor, any cuts the company can achieve would make a meaningful difference to the whole country.To be sure, the emissions caused during production represent just a small fraction of the total over an oil barrel’s life cycle. And other oil companies are chasing more ambitious goals. Repsol SA of Spain said last month it would cut all emissions by 2050, including from the products it sells, as opposed to Equinor.$20 Billion Fund Is Keeping Equinor on Black ListEquinor just unveiled its most ambitious climate plan yet, but it isn’t enough to get Norway’s biggest oil company off the exclusion list of a major Danish pension fund. Click here to read more. In Norway, which has become one of the world’s richest countries thanks to its vast oil reserves, figuring out how to adapt to climate change is becoming an increasingly fraught subject. Its $1.1 trillion sovereign-wealth fund (locally dubbed the oil fund) has tried to exit fossil-fuel stocks. But Norway has so far proved unable to wean itself off oil.Calls from activists and some politicians for an end date to oil production are growing more frequent. Meanwhile, uncertainty over key parameters such as industry taxes has grown.Equinor stressed that its emission cuts depend on stable framework conditions. In an interview, Saetre said he hopes the steps Equinor is taking will “strengthen and make more robust the political support the industry has enjoyed.”“This is something we don’t wish to be dragged into,” he said. “We want to be at the forefront and the driver’s seat.”Equinor and its partners plan to invest about 50 billion kroner ($5.7 billion) to reach a first target to cut emissions by 40% by 2030. That will mostly be done by connecting offshore platforms and onshore plants to Norway’s electricity grid, which is dominated by clean hydropower. Reductions will then reach 70% in 2040 and almost 100% by 2050.Though the investment needed to switch to clean energy in the production stage will have a “neutral to positive net present value,” Saetre said the expectation is that Equinor will become more cost competitive over time, as carbon pricing increases.Good Enough?Equinor’s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint will bring it in line with the overall climate goals of Norway, which is a signatory of the Paris Agreement. But the measures are unlikely to satisfy drilling opponents, given that the cuts do nothing to address emissions from the oil’s combustion, which makes up more than 90% of the total.“These ambitions ignore the elephant in the room,” said Mark van Baal, the head of Dutch investor advocacy group Follow This. “An oil company with targets for its own emissions, and not for its products, is like a cigarette producer that promises that all employees will quit smoking, while increasing cigarette production.”A good illustration of why activists are concerned can be found in the giant Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea, which is being officially opened on Tuesday by Prime Minister Erna Solberg. It’s slated to continue pumping oil for several decades after starting in October. Emissions from the field are way lower than those elsewhere in the industry, at less than 1 kilogram of CO2 for each barrel that’s produced. But emissions from the oil itself, if all 2.7 billion barrels are used, would amount to more than 20 times the annual total for Norway.The new targets “will obviously have a positive reputation effect in Norway,” said Klaus Mohn, an economics professor at the University of Stavanger. “But I don’t think it will be enough to calm the debate about the industry’s future.”(Adds reference to MP Pension’s black list)To contact the reporter on this story: Mikael Holter in Oslo at mholter2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-giant-reveals-survival-tactics-040000834.html?.tsrc=rss

The cuts could allow Norway, western Europe's top oil and gas exporter, to continue to pump millions of barrels of oil even as the country seeks to fulfil obligations under the 2015 Paris climate agreement to slash domestic emissions.  The initial cuts will primarily come through replacing electricity from gas turbines with renewable energy at major installations, including offshore wind turbines and hydroelectric power via subsea cables.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equinor-seeks-40-greenhouse-gas-085846290.html?.tsrc=rss

Norway has not discovered any major new oil deposits and green groups and young politicians are increasingly calling for production to be curbed or even a shut down due to climate change.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norway-ramps-western-europes-largest-154344215.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-12-05	2019-12-05 00:00:00	EQNR	Equinor ASA	The Lonely Oil Giant That’s Saving Norway’s Crude Production	(Bloomberg) -- The giant Johan Sverdrup oil field is coming to the rescue of Norway’s oil industry -- again.The improbable mega-project in the North Sea, years after the oil province’s heyday, already provided a lifeline to engineers and platform builders starved for work during a historic slump in the crude market. That was evident during a visit to the project this week as some of the more than 500 workers on the facility zip by on the scooters used to cut travel time between the four connected platforms.Now that it’s started producing, Equinor ASA’s flagship project is showing what it can do. The field is redressing production figures for the Nordic country and the state-controlled company in a year that’s been worse than expected, and will help them both increase output in the years ahead. It also temporarily masks the decline of older fields and a dwindling pipeline of Norwegian projects.Sverdrup’s earlier-than-expected start in October broke a long trend of underperformance for Norway’s overall oil production. Output lagged forecasts in 28 straight months through September, even after the industry regulator slashed its 2019 prognosis to a 31-year low.While the field is unlikely to compensate fully for unplanned outages earlier this year, it ramped up output quicker than planned to as much as 350,000 barrels a day recently, Arne Sigve Nylund, Equinor’s executive vice president for development and production in Norway said on Tuesday. Loading programs suggest production will be close to 400,000 barrels by January, not far from its first-phase maximum rate of 440,000 barrels a day expected by the summer.“The project is running well,” Nylund said aboard the massive facility on a windy day in the North Sea. The screen-filled control room is connected by fiber optics to subsea sensors almost 2 kilometers below and workers carry digital tablets to access the data they need from anywhere on the 700-meter long installation.Sverdrup has allowed Equinor to maintain a target for stable production in 2019 despite a 3% drop in the first nine months of the year, driven mostly by its Norwegian fields. It’s also given a huge boost to smaller owners Lundin Petroleum AB and Aker BP ASA.In the coming years, Sverdrup will drive output growth both for Equinor and Norway as a whole. National oil and gas production is expected to reach a peak in 2023, near the 2004 record, and Sverdrup will account for a third of Norway’s crude output at that time.The dismal performance of Norway’s oil production before Sverdrup has mainly been due to unplanned outages, which have compounded significant planned maintenance programs. The biggest impact came from Equinor’s Snorre field, according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. One of the platforms on the field was shut from early March to the middle of August after a riser broke off and fell to the sea.That and other outages have raised concerns that too much maintenance was delayed during the crisis years from 2015 to 2017, when a collapse in oil prices led to huge efficiency gains but also pushed operators to keep installations running to maintain cash flow. Equinor’s Nylund rejected the notion that unplanned events in 2019 were due to a lack of maintenance. The Snorre incident was due to corrosion caused by a design fault that the company had actually monitored, he said.Yet oil companies slashed the number of man hours related to operations and maintenance on production facilities by 30% in 2015 and then a further 12% by 2017, according to figures from the Petroleum Safety Authority. The level in 2018 was close to 2015, and it’s an open question in the industry whether that is sustainable, said analyst Simon Sjothun of Rystad Energy AS. “The jury is still out,” he said.While a PSA spokesman said there’s no general concern about a maintenance backlog, some equity analysts have raised the issue of performance from Equinor’s more mature fields. “We still see weaker performance from legacy fields,” DNB ASA’s Jon Masdal said in a note on Nov. 22.The issue will become even more dire after Sverdrup’s production has peaked. Equinor has pledged to drill as many as 3,000 wells in the next two decades, but it has few big projects lined up after 2022, and certainly none the size of Sverdrup.To contact the reporter on this story: Stephen Treloar in Oslo at streloar1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net, Mikael Holter, Rakteem KatakeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lonely-oil-giant-saving-norway-000000176.html?.tsrc=rss

U.S. equities drifted after Trump said the U.S. hasn’t agreed to a tariff rollback with China, dimming hopes for a preliminary trade deal next month. Investors have been whipsawed the past two days amid an onslaught of contradictory headlines about progress in the trade war.“The U.S. is still looking to get something done so it’s just an on again, off again thing with bantering back and forth,” said Kyle Cooper, research director at IAF Advisors and Cypress Energy in Houston. “Optimism regarding the U.S.-China trade deal is the driving force behind it.”Oil has fallen about 15% since hitting this year’s peak in April as the trade spat saps crude consumption and global supplies expand. OPEC and its partners will probably keep output steady when they meet next month as markets are on track to re-balance, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Trafigura Group Ltd.“OPEC’s ability to cut production and help prices firm has neared its limits and Saudi Arabia might find it difficult to convince other members to deepen product cuts,” said Daniel Ghali, commodity strategist at TD Bank in Toronto. “If OPEC can’t deepen their commitment we are set for an oversupply and that is going to be bearish for prices.”See also: Aramco Taps Billionaire Olayans, Saudi Prince for IPO OrdersWTI for December delivery rose 16 cents to $57.31 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 12:27 p.m. local time.Brent for January settlement rose 17 cents to $62.46 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.15 to WTI.“The U.S.-China trade talks are heading in the right direction” but “there are still several obstacles that will need to be overcome,” said Stephen Brennock, an analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd. in London. “The road to a final resolution will be bumpy. The upside for the risk-asset complex is limited and the current momentum is built on wobbly foundations.”Rolling back tariffs would pave the way for a de-escalation in the trade war that’s cast a shadow over the world economy. China’s key demand since the start of negotiations has been the removal of punitive tariffs, which by now apply to the majority of its exports to the U.S.“If anything Trump’s statements were a dose of reality,” said Ashley Petersen, oil market analyst at Stratas Advisors in New York. “Investors got a little to optimistic and too excited and spiked these prices and now we are seeing a rollback as the White House comes out with fairly firm statements.”To contact the reporter on this story: Jacquelyn Melinek in New York at jmelinek@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Mike Jeffers, Joe CarrollFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-set-weekly-gain-u-231817934.html?.tsrc=rss

Prices dropped further after Reuters reported that a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump could be delayed until December.The narrative around the OPEC cuts is changing, said Rob Thummel, managing director and portfolio manager at Tortoise, a Kansas firm that oversees more than $21 billion in assets. “If that’s the case, along with the higher than expected build in oil, oil prices should continue to fall for the day.”U.S. crude inventories built by 7.93 million barrels last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. Gasoline and distillate supplies fell, while stockpiles stored at the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub rose 1.7 million barrels. The U.S. registered its first petroleum trade surplus in over four decades in September as production surged to a record.Oil gained earlier this week on optimism that trade tensions between the U.S. and China are easing, potentially alleviating downward pressure on the global economy. Yet prices remain about 15% below the peak reached in April amid concern that tepid consumption growth and record American shale-oil output will create a new surplus next year.West Texas Intermediate for December delivery fell 88 cents to settle at $56.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Brent for January settlement declined $1.22 to end the session at $61.74 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange.

Locations in Asia and Europe are now being considered instead, the person said, asking not to be identified because the discussions aren’t public.“The crude market is much more skeptical about a deal,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York.

2019-10-30	2019-10-30 00:00:00	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Norwegian Workers Lash Out Against Oil Shame	(Bloomberg) -- Ole Lie, a drilling supervisor who’s worked for Norway’s oil giant Equinor ASA since the 1990s, is feeling unloved as many are starting to turn their backs on an industry that’s made the Nordic country one of the richest on Earth.“I feel stabbed in the back,” said Lie, 54, who works on the Gullfaks C platform in the North Sea. “Politicians are very fond of re-distributing the money we make, but not of providing the support needed to keep the industry alive.”Western Europe’s biggest petroleum producer has a complicated relationship with oil amid growing concern over its impact on the global climate. Oil was discovered in the North Sea in the 1960s and has made Norwegians rich, but that fairy tale is now losing sway as a growing number of politicians and environmental groups are calling for a shut down of production with as much half of the estimated resources still in the ground.‘Proud Oil Worker’As neighbors in Sweden are grappling with “flying shame” from the pollution air travel causes, offshore workers across the fjord-edged nation are complaining about “oil shame.” They are now fighting back against what they perceive as a new stigma on their profession and a disregard for the industry’s economic contributions. Many have fitted their Facebook profile picture with a filter proclaiming to be a “Proud Oil Worker” -- thousands according to the graphic’s creator.Oil and gas accounts for about half of the country’s exports and the industry employs almost 200,000 people. This year, the government expects to get $26 billion from taxes, stakes in fields and dividends from Equinor. Almost all of it goes straight into the budget. The rest will top off Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s biggest at about $1.1 trillion. Equinor also just started Norway’s biggest oil field in decades, promising a revival of production and revenue in the coming years.Yet some polls show that popular support for the industry is eroding. While the biggest political parties remain supporters of the industry, they’re being challenged by other groups and even their own youth wings. The stability of Norway’s oil regulations, one of the high-cost country’s main selling points, could be in jeopardy in coming elections.Read: Fear Grips Norway’s Oil Industry as Political Risk ExplodesThe provenance of “oil shame” is unclear. In past months it has been increasingly used in discussions on whether Norway has a moral obligation to phase out production to help fight climate change -- or at least stop making money off of it. It follows on the proliferation of “flying shame” in Sweden, a campaign against flying that has hurt air travel.Oil workers started a push back on social media after Norway’s local elections in September, according to Idar Martin Herland, an electrician at Equinor who created the filter. The election had little immediate impact on the industry, but saw the Green Party gain a record number of votes in the capital, where its top politician, Lan Marie Nguyen Berg, proclaimed on election night that “the time when it was OK to make money by destroying our future will soon be over.”While she was addressing the powerful oil lobby, many offshore workers took it personally, Herland said.“They used to say we were paid too much and worked too little,” he said in a phone interview this month. “Now we’re also destroying the world!”Green JobsThe Green Party, which has only one lawmaker in parliament but could add seats in the next general election in 2021, argues that it’s difficult to avoid polarization over an issue as important as climate change. The party wants to phase out oil production over 15 years but sees oil workers as key participants in the transition to a more sustainable energy system with offshore wind power and carbon capture, spokesman Arild Hermstad said.“The oil workers’ know-how is enormously important,” he said in a phone interview. “Oil workers have nothing to be ashamed of. They aren’t responsible for the big political decisions that must be made to secure a safe transition to green jobs.”But Lie, the drilling supervisor, said even his own company feels guilty.

American crude inventories unexpectedly shrank by 1.7 million barrels last week, according to EIA data released Wednesday. Still, concerns over a slowing economy persisted after IHS Markit’s measure of German manufacturing and services signaled the nation’s slump will persist into the fourth quarter.“The tone has changed a bit here, especially that to a certain degree, we are exiting turnaround season and that maintenance may have already hit its low point,” said Bob Yawger director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. “That means you’re going to start seeing some more draws here.”Oil is down 15% from an April peak as the prolonged trade dispute between Beijing and Washington dents global demand. That’s putting pressure on The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners to consider cutting production further when they meets in December. However, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday that none of the OPEC+ members have submitted a proposal to change the existing terms of their deal.West Texas Intermediate for December delivery added 26 cents to settle at $56.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Brent for December settlement rose 50 cents to $61.67 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a $5.44 premium to WTI.See also: Andurand Heads for Second Annual Loss Despite October GainTotal U.S. stockpiles of crude and oil products, excluding the strategic petroleum reserve, fell by 9 million barrels last week to the lowest level since May, according to the Energy Information Administration released on Wednesday.

2019-10-24	2019-10-24 07:58:32	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Norway’s New Crude a Threat to Rivals in Prized Asia Market	(Bloomberg) -- Norway’s new oil grade is making inroads in Asia, threatening to undermine sales of similar crudes from Africa and South America.China’s Unipec, at least one of the nation’s independent refiners and South Korea’s Hyundai Oilbank Co. have bought Johan Sverdrup for December delivery, said traders and refinery officials in Asia. The North Sea oil produced by Equinor ASA has been likened to Brazil’s Lula and Angola’s Saturno crudes.Oil with low-sulfur content is in demand ahead of stricter ship-fuel rules that take effect Jan. 1, while supply of medium-density crude has been tight due to the attacks on Saudi Arabia and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. Johan Sverdrup has both of those qualities, and it’s also attractively priced, which may have lured refiners that are typically cautious about new grades.If Johan Sverdrup continues to gain traction it may jeopardize exports of its rival grades to the world’s top crude-consuming region. Angolan and Brazilian oil accounted for 10% and 8%, respectively, of Chinese imports in the first eight months of the year, according to government data. By comparison, Norwegian crude had a minuscule 0.04% share.“I have no doubt we’ll see a trend of more Norwegian flows to Asia, especially China, in the coming months,” said Sengyick Tee, an oil analyst at SIA Energy in Beijing. “Given the soaring freight rates and high Chinese stockpiles, Equinor will need to price it attractively,” he said, adding that the company has a strong presence among Shandong’s teapots.See also: Trade War, Sanctions Aiding Appeal of New Equinor Oil GradeShandong Qingyuan Group, a Chinese teapot, bought about 1 million barrels of Johan Sverdrup at a premium of $6 to $6.50 a barrel to Brent crude on a delivered basis, said traders who asked not to be identified as the information isn’t public. That’s around $1 a barrel cheaper than Lula and 20 to 30 cents less than Saturno, the traders said.Unipec -- the trading arm of Chinese giant Sinopec -- has bought two shipments of Johan Sverdrup for October loading, while Hyundai Oilbank took an undisclosed volume of the grade, the traders said. The prices for these deals aren’t available.Whether or not Equinor can keep offering the grade at lower prices over the longer term remains to be seen. The Norwegian company may have hedged shipping costs in advance, said one of the traders. Equinor is also giving buyers the option to co-load with other varieties, which may help reduce the cost of shipping to Asia.Johan Sverdrup has an API gravity reading of 27 degrees with sulfur content of 0.8%. While that’s a slightly higher sulfur reading than most sweet crudes -- loosely defined as having 0.5% or less of sulfur -- processors looking to produce more IMO 2020-compliant fuel may seek out the grade as part of a lower-sulfur oil feedstock blend.The disruption of Middle East supplies and declining output from Angola have created a market opening in Asia for Johan Sverdrup, said Senthil Kumaran, a senior oil analyst at industry consultant FGE in Singapore.(Adds analyst comment in 10th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Alex Longley.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Sarah Chen in Beijing at schen514@bloomberg.net;Serene Cheong in Singapore at scheong20@bloomberg.net;Sharon Cho in Singapore at ccho28@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Serene Cheong at scheong20@bloomberg.net, Andrew Janes, Ben SharplesFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norway-crude-competitive-threat-prized-210000855.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-07	2019-10-07 13:32:09	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Norway’s Huge New Oil Project Clashes With Growing Focus on Climate	(Bloomberg) -- The timing of Norway’s biggest oil project in decades is a bit awkward.Equinor ASA kicked off its massive Johan Sverdrup field, a rare mega-project in the aging North Sea, at a moment where the pressure on the oil industry and governments to act against the climate crisis has never been greater. The field is set to produce crude for 50 years, well beyond the time where the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions should be net zero to avoid warming of more than 1.5 degrees.“It’s understandable that it could be viewed as a paradox in times like these,” said economics professor Klaus Mohn, the rector of the University of Stavanger, the country’s oil capital. “But Norway has stubbornly maintained a separation between its oil policy on one side and climate policy on the other.”Sverdrup has already been a boon for Norway’s offshore industry, and now promises to deliver a big production boost for its owners and the country as a whole. Yet, it comes the year after Equinor changed its name from Statoil, to reflect increased investments in renewable energy, and as political debate about the post-oil era in Norway is accelerating.Equinor anticipated the apparent contradiction on its website, with the main banner reading: “We’re celebrating the opening of the Johan Sverdrup oil field. But what about the climate?” The platforms will receive electricity from Norway’s onshore grid, dominated by hydropower, meaning each barrel of oil will generate 0.67 kilos of carbon dioxide in the production phase, compared to averages of about 9kg in Norway and 18kg globally.Equinor and Norway have long used Sverdrup as a prime example of why they should be the last to stop producing oil, even betting that barrels produced with lower emissions will become a competitive advantage in a world where higher prices on carbon pollution will reduce demand for crude.Emissions from the production process account for just a fraction of the life cycle of a barrel of crude. If all of Sverdrup’s oil is burned, it could produce more than 1.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide -- more than 20 times Norway’s total annual emissions, based on a U.S. government estimate of how much CO2 is generated from burning a barrel of oil.Sverdrup’s startup is a “fantastic day for Equinor and state coffers,” economics professor Knut Einar Rosendahl said on Twitter. “Not such a fantastic day for global climate-gas emissions.”Discovered in 2010, in an area that had been disregarded by most explorers, the site started production on Saturday and is set to reach 440,000 barrels a day by next summer. That represents a 33% addition to Norway’s crude output in the first half of this year, a hike not seen since the 1980s.It’s hard to overstate the importance of Sverdrup for its owners, the Norwegian state and the country’s entire oil industry.Confidence about the field’s startup was key for state-controlled Equinor’s decision to kick off a long-awaited $5 billion buyback program in September, and Sverdrup will be a driving force in the company’s production growth in the next years. It also helped to transform Lundin Petroleum AB -- which made the initial discovery -- and Aker BP ASA into two of the most important companies in Norway’s oil industry.With as much as 3.2 billion barrels in reserves, it’s Norway’s biggest discovery since the 1970s. In an illustration of how unusually large the field is, Aker BP considered going to court over a few decimals in ownership.Equinor expects Sverdrup to contribute about $100 billion to Norway’s state coffers. The field’s timing was also perfect for the Nordic country: green-lighted in 2015, just after a historic collapse in the crude market, it offered a lifeline to the embattled oil-service industry, even if the market slump forced suppliers to cut prices.For Equinor and the other owners, the timing was even better. The discount on services and equipment allowed them to slash investments by as much as 44% compared to the highest early estimates, giving the field an overall break-even price of less than $20 a barrel.Sverdrup was originally scheduled to start production in December this year, but Equinor advanced the date to October. The field will reach maximum output of 660,000 barrels a day in its second phase in 2023.To contact the reporter on this story: Mikael Holter in Oslo at mholter2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Helen RobertsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norway-huge-oil-project-clashes-133209092.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-25	2019-09-25 19:00:00	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Big Oil Faces Watershed Test Over Plan to Drill Off Australian Coast	(Bloomberg) -- A continent-sized bay south of Australia is set to become a battleground, pitting the nation’s powerful environmental lobby against the world’s biggest offshore petroleum company in a test that could prove a watershed moment for big oil.Australia’s offshore petroleum regulator is due to decide by Nov. 14 whether to approve Norwegian energy giant Equinor ASA’s plan to drill exploration wells in the Great Australian Bight. Early estimates suggest the Bight could hold the equivalent of 1.9 billion barrels of oil, though it’s been lightly explored and experts believe the true figure could be much higher.Environmentalists argue that it makes no sense to drill more than 2 kilometers (1.2 mile) under the seabed in the notoriously rough waters of a unique marine environment while fossil fuels are rapidly being eclipsed by renewable energy.“The idea of opening up a new oil and gas field in the Bight, which wouldn’t really start delivering oil for at least 10 years if not closer to 15, is madness in today’s era of needing to reduce carbon pollution,” said Sarah Hanson-Young, a Greens Party senator and leading campaigner against Bight development.Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, has pledged its support for the Paris climate accord, and advocates for exploration in the Bight argue that the gas reserves would help reduce the need for more-polluting coal-fired energy. Environmental lobby group Carbon Tracker says an oil industry pipeline of some $50 billion in new projects isn’t compatible with the Paris agreement to limit a rise in global temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius.“Most scenarios still show oil as being an important product for many decades to come,” Equinor said in an email. “Producing fields are being depleted, and even in a 2 degrees scenario, current discovered commercial resources still leave a gap to meet the expected future demand.” The company said its exploration activities were complemented by plans to reduce its emissions by investing in renewable energy.“If the exploration is successful, there are significant economic benefits in an environment where Australia’s oil production has been declining,” said Matthew Doman, director of external affairs at the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association, an industry group, adding that APPEA supported the Paris climate targets.A study commissioned by the group in 2018 said an oil industry in the Bight could create over 2,000 jobs in South Australia and boost the country’s GDP by A$5.9 billion ($4 billion) a year. The government’s Resources Minister Matt Canavan said earlier this year that offshore oil exploration is a “national priority.”Brand DamageThe Bight has been a prospect that oil majors have struggled to understand. Some, including Chevron Corp. and BP Plc, have walked away in recent years. More than 85% of the species found in the Bight are unique to the region, which is a migratory path for the endangered southern right whale.Equinor has long experience of deep-sea drilling in the North Sea and the company acquired two exploration permits in the Bight in 2017 as part of a swap deal with BP. If it gets regulator approval, it plans to start drilling in late 2020.“Equinor has safely drilled more than 65 deepwater wells and operated for decades in stronger winds, higher waves and colder waters than the Great Australian Bight,” the company said in a 1,500-page draft environment plan released in February.The company will face strong opposition. Australia’s environmental lobby has been growing in recent years, highlighted by the long battle with India-based Adani Group over development of the massive Carmichael coal mine in Queensland. While the project was eventually approved, it was drastically reduced in size after the Indian group failed to get external financing for the development amid intense lobbying.Another Norwegian company, Petroleum Geo-Services ASA, in August postponed to 2020 seismic testing in the Bight that had been planned for this year, a move welcomed by environmental groups and the local fishing industry.Hanson-Young said it’s ironic that the charge into the Bight is being led by Norway, a strong advocate for climate change that sought to divest its sovereign wealth fund’s oil assets.“This is brand damage for Norway,” she said. “You can’t on the one hand be getting all the accolades for divesting and taking climate change seriously and then on the other hand a state-owned company goes down south and opens up a massive new carbon bowl.”Hanson-Young said Equinor has yet to fully understand the strength of community opposition and she questioned the economic benefits, noting that most of the oil and profits would likely be exported. She said most of the jobs created would be fly-in, fly-out roles for technical experts unlikely to relocate permanently to South Australia.To contact the reporter on this story: James Thornhill in Sydney at jthornhill3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Adam MajendieFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-faces-watershed-test-190000939.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-20	2019-09-20 09:53:07	EQNR	Equinor ASA	The World’s Biggest Offshore Wind Farm Will Be as Cheap as Coal	(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.The world’s biggest offshore wind park planned off the coast of England will probably in the next decade generate power cheaper than by burning coal.A number of offshore wind projects won contracts to sell power at guaranteed prices in a U.K. auction Friday. The price of 39.65 pounds per megawatt-hour ($49.70) was 31% below the level in a similar auction two years ago.The plunge highlights how offshore wind, which only a few years ago was a niche technology more expensive than nuclear reactors, is changing the economics of energy around the world. Both utilities and, increasingly, energy majors, are planning to spend $448 billion through 2030 on an eightfold capacity increase, according to BloombergNEF.Projects from developers including SSE Plc, Equinor ASA and Innogy SE won offshore wind power-purchase contracts that will have the capacity to generate as much as 5.5 gigawatts of power, the government said. That includes a joint SSE-Equinor project off England’s east coast to build the biggest single offshore wind park in the world.“The auction results today show offshore wind is in line with current power prices - it is already competitive with existing fossil fuel plants, let alone new fossil fuels,” said Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in London. “In the next auction in 2021 we will see costs go well below that of existing fossil fuel plants.”One of the winning areas, known as Dogger Bank, is off the coast of Yorkshire. Three projects by Equinor and SSE were approved in the zone for a total generation of 3.6 gigawatts. Another 1.4 gigawatt project developed by Innogy was also approved in the same area.Equinor’s success at the auction is a key step in its transition to becoming a broader energy company than just an oil and gas major. The state-controlled Norwegian company has a target of investing as much as 20% of its capital in new energy solutions by 2030.“Dogger Bank, together with the recent award for Empire Wind in the U.S., positions Equinor as an offshore wind major,” said Pal Eitrheim, Equinor’s executive vice president for new energy solutions. “These projects provide economies of scale and synergies, making us an even stronger competitive force in offshore wind globally.”Equinor Races Ahead of Big Oil Pack in Bet on Offshore WindSSE winning capacity will accelerate its shift away from a traditional utility to an energy company focused on renewable power and grids. The Scottish company has agreed to sell its U.K. domestic supply business to Ovo Energy Ltd.The agreements give the projects a guaranteed buyer through what’s known as a contracts-for-difference mechanism. If the wholesale rate is lower than the set price, the government pays the developer the difference. If it’s higher, the company pays it back. U.K. month-ahead power is trading at 42.05 pounds per megawatt-hour, down 34% this year.Even as wind power moves away from a reliance on government subsidies, the contracts could still play an important role going forward. The guarantee helps developers secure financing and also make the assets more attractive to institutional investors who want reliable returns. The next U.K. auction round is set to take place in 2021.The Crown Estate said Thursday it plans to open the first contest in a decade for sites around the British coast that could draw as much as 20 billion pounds of investment in offshore wind.For SaleThe contracts also open up a track for investors to take stakes in some of these projects. Earlier this year, Iberdrola sold a stake in its 714-megawatt East Anglia One project to Macquarie Group Ltd. for 1.63 billion pounds. Projects that have the backing of government-supported purchase agreements are often more attractive to investors who favor the guaranteed prices.Innogy will likely sell a stake in it 1.4 gigawatt Sofia Offshore Wind Farm development in the Dogger Bank Area, according to Richard Sandford, the company’s director of offshore investment and asset management. The company hasn’t decided how big of a stake it will sell, but plans to make a final decision sometime next year. SSE also said it will look to sell equity in a 454-megawatt project in Scotland that it won a contract for in the auction.(Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Mikael Holter.To contact the reporter on this story: William Mathis in London at wmathis2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net, Lars Paulsson, Rob VerdonckFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worlds-biggest-offshore-wind-farm-074625096.html?.tsrc=rss

Sentiment continues to be dominated by an International Energy Agency report highlighting the challenge facing OPEC and its allies in balancing the market as production surges from their competitors. U.S. crude production is set to grow 1.3 million barrels a day next year at current prices, IEA’s executive director Fatih Birol said at an event in Washington D.C. Friday.Also fueling oversupply concerns, U.S. President Donald Trump was said to weigh easing sanctions on Iran, a move that RBC Capital Markets estimated could bring back around 700,000 barrels a day to the market. Meanwhile, the U.S. and China showed signs of rapprochement in their trade war and Saudi Arabia’s new energy minister downplayed oil-demand concerns, leaving any talk of deeper output cuts to OPEC’s next ministerial meeting in December.“Lackluster investor positioning, potential thawing of the trade war and concerns of an Iran deal have clouded both investor appetite as well as the fundamental market outlook,” said Michael Tran, a commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “Oil prices are caught in a cycle of trendless volatility.”West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery declined 24 cents, or 0.4%, to settle at $54.85 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Brent for November fell 16 cents to $60.22 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange, and traded at a $5.42 premium to WTI for the same month.

2019-09-07	2019-09-07 12:00:00	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Hurricane Dorian Rips Roofs Off Bahamas Oil Storage	(Bloomberg) -- Hurricane Dorian has left oil seeping into the ground on the island of Grand Bahama after the storm blew the tops off five crude-storage tanks on the island.“According to the information we have right now, the roofs of five tanks are gone,” Norway’s Equinor ASA, which owns the storage facilities, said in a statement. “We do not know if they are been carried away by the winds or fallen into the tanks.”Equinor said Thursday that a flyover it conducted showed oil had seeped into the ground but not the sea. The tanks can hold 6.75 million barrels -- almost 1 million tons. The terminal was shut on Saturday in preparation for the storm and will stay closed until further notice, the company said Friday.During July and August, the terminal had a few ships come through, one of which delivered crude from West Africa. The rest loaded supplies from the facility to deliver to Jamaica, and the U.S. Gulf and East Coast, according to ship tracking compiled by Bloomberg.A video tweeted by Coral Vita, which works to protect coral reefs on the island, appeared to show that crude reached a nearby road and was outside a perimeter fence.Oil from the terminal had leaked onto nearby grass and trees, according to Sam Teicher, founder and chief reef officer for Coral Vita, who was in the area around the terminal doing relief work Thursday. “We could see as we were approaching that some of the big dome roofs were gone,” he said by phone. “When we got there, you could smell the oil.”In addition to the tanks whose roofs were gone, some other roofs had been partly ripped off and were covered in oil, he said.The environmental impact from the spill is one of many brutal blows for Grand Bahama after the storm put large tracts of the Bahamian island under water and left thousands homeless.Here’s a satellite image of South Riding Point, the storage facility, provided by Maxar Technologies Inc. It was taken on Wednesday, after the worst of the storm:And here’s how the same site looked back in April:Equinor said Friday that it’s still to soon to estimate how long the response will take and that it doesn’t have information about oil reaching the sea.“The situation in the Bahamas is still challenging and infrastructure has sustained severe damage,” Equinor said. “All required resources are being mustered and our primary concern is to ensure the safety of our employees and the environment. We are mobilizing people and equipment to respond to the spill as soon as possible.”Meanwhile, a larger facility in the Bahamas operated by Buckeye Partners LP suffered “minor damage” from Dorian, according to the company. Buckeye continues to communicate with its customers regarding a timeline for a return of partial operations of the 26-million barrel capacity facility. Known as Borco, it also handles refined products such as gasoline, which is stored, blended to supply to the U.S. East Coast.Restoring operations at affected areas in the Bahamas would depend on restoring power supply, unless backup generators are already in place. The storm, which reached Category 5 on Sunday, ravaged the power grid on Grand Bahama island where the two oil facilities are located.&#92;--With assistance from Bill Lehane, Julian Lee and Stephen Cunningham.To contact the reporters on this story: Aaron Clark in Tokyo at aclark27@bloomberg.net;Sheela Tobben in New York at vtobben@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, David Marino, Catherine TraywickFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/satellite-images-show-hurricane-dorian-020713436.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-03	2019-09-03 23:00:01	EQNR	Equinor ASA	North Sea Oil Poised for Last Hurrah With Giant Norway Field	(Bloomberg) -- The rise of a huge new Norwegian oil field is poised to give North Sea output one of its biggest boosts in years. The surge won’t last.Johan Sverdrup, one of the five largest offshore oil fields ever discovered in Norway, has been given the green light to begin production, with operator Equinor ASA scheduled to start loading crude onto tankers as soon as next month. The field will single-handedly deliver the biggest increase in oil production for Norway next year since the 1980s. While that’s good news for its owners and Norway, the North Sea will still have to grapple with declines in supply from more mature fields that have been operating since the 1970s.The problem for North Sea producers is that there’s just no other project under development that comes close to Sverdrup in scale. The next biggest field due to start by the end of 2020 is Martin Linge, according to Energy Aspects Ltd. Also part of Equinor’s pipeline, it pales in comparison.“With the inclusion of Sverdrup, we see an increase in production in the near term,” said Sonya Boodoo, an analyst at Rystad Energy. “Without Sverdrup, production would have stagnated.”The scale of Johan Sverdrup is also evident in reserves. While Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie Ltd. forecasts a massive increase in reserves being brought into production this year, that’s mostly down to Sverdrup: it accounts for just over 60% of 4.2 billion barrels this year. Those figures from the researcher also include natural gas.Norway and Britain are by far the biggest producers in the North Sea. While Sverdrup will boost Norway’s production growth, U.K. supply will decline into the next decade as production falls at mature fields including Buzzard, Golden Eagle and Elgin.The next largest field due to start in the U.K. is Bentley, according to Energy Aspects, which forecasts output of about 60,000 barrels a day. That’s a fraction of the size of Sverdrup, which will deliver 440,000 barrels a day in its first phase, rising further into the next decade once a second stage is complete. Norway’s production is forecast to decline after Sverdrup reaches peak production.&#92;--With assistance from Alex Longley.To contact the reporters on this story: Timothy Abington in London at tabington@bloomberg.net;Mikael Holter in Oslo at mholter2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaric Nightingale at anightingal1@bloomberg.net, Rachel Graham, Alaric NightingaleFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/north-sea-oil-poised-last-230001167.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-03	2019-09-03 07:34:08	EQNR	Equinor ASA	U.S. East Coast Braces for Dorian Chaos as Bahamas Battered	(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. East Coast from Florida to the Carolinas was bracing for devastating winds and a life-threatening storm surge from Hurricane Dorian as the Category 3 storm wreaks havoc on the Bahamas.Dorian sat just north of Grand Bahama, about 100 miles east of Florida’s West Palm Beach, the National Hurricane Center said in a 3 a.m. advisory. While its winds continue to weaken as it widens out, the storm has inflicted huge damage, killing five on one island, according to Prime Minister Hubert Minnis, who called the destruction a “historic tragedy.”Even if the U.S. mainland dodges a head-on blow as the hurricane follows a track up the east coast over the next few days, that would still bring it “dangerously close” to Florida through Wednesday, according to the NHC. It’s threatening to inundate coastal communities with rain and rising sea levels. In Georgia and the Carolinas, coastline residents are being told to evacuate.Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster ordered residents in coastal areas to flee before Dorian arrives, according to state web sites. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said residents in his state should heed evacuation orders from local leaders.“We know that these evacuations are inconvenient, difficult and sometimes costly,” Cooper said in a televised statement. “But we must realize the potential deadly cost of refusing to evacuate when told.”A slow north-westward motion is expected to occur early Tuesday, according to the NHC. The hurricane will then move close to Florida’s east coast late Tuesday through Wednesday evening, very near Georgia and South Carolina coasts Wednesday night and Thursday, and near or over the North Carolina coast late Thursday.While the current forecast keeps Dorian’s center offshore, forecasters are keeping a close eye for changes, according to Ken Graham, the hurricane center’s director. “It doesn’t take much, a little wobble, a little wiggle and you have hurricane-force winds on shore,” he said in a Facebook update.In the meantime, Dorian continues to devastate Grand Bahama, one of the nation’s northernmost islands, and has caused widespread flooding in many of the islands of the northwest and central Bahamas, the National Emergency Management Agency said in a bulletin Monday.Parts of the northern Bahamas are in the “midst of a historic tragedy” Prime Minister Minnis said in a post on Twitter. Based on reports out of Abaco, one of the first islands to be hit, “the devastation is unprecedented,” he said earlier.Dorian will cause at least $25 billion of insurance losses, according to analysts at UBS Group AG, the costliest of any natural disaster since 2017. Depending on whether it hits the eastern coast of Florida in the next few days, the storm could cost as much as $40 billion, they said.An 8-year-old boy drowned in Abaco, his grandmother told local television station Eyewitness News. Authorities have not confirmed the death, the station said. The Bahamas Press said that Grand Bahama International Airport was under 5 feet of water.The damage to some of the region’s large tourist hotels will likely hit revenue in a country where tourism accounts for about half of gross domestic product, said Andrew Stanners, investment director for Aberdeen Standard Investments, which owns the nation’s dollar bonds. The Bahamas has recently taken “strident steps” to improve government finances, which leave it better placed to repair the devastation, he said.There are also two major petroleum terminals in the Bahamas. Buckeye Partners LP operates a large crude and refined products terminal at Freeport, roughly 100 miles from the Florida coast, and Equinor ASA has a terminal in nearby South Riding Point. The Buckeye terminal has a capacity of 26 million barrels of crude, gasoline and diesel, the Equinor terminal has a storage capacity of 6.75 million barrels of crude and condensate.Buckeye media contacts didn’t respond to multiple emails seeking comment. Equinor was in the process of shutting its terminal ahead of Dorian, the company said.The Bahamian government was preparing orders to allow donated relief supplies to move quickly to areas that need it most, local Eyewitness News reported.In Florida, storm surge warnings now extend up the coast into Georgia and forecasters say the ocean, pushed by Dorian, could start inundating the shoreline and rivers by Tuesday.In a briefing, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said Florida utilities have assembled 17,000 personnel to help restore power quickly as needed. He said 72 nursing homes and assisted living centers along the coast have been evacuated, and hospitals were starting to evacuate as well.Meanwhile, airlines have canceled 1,300 flights within, into and out of the U.S. today, according to FlightAware, a Houston-based airline tracking company. Fort Lauderdale and Orlando are the two hardest hit airports.Mandatory evacuations have been ordered in parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, including for the Mar-a-Lago club owned by U.S. President Donald Trump, which he often uses as a “Winter White House.” While Dorian is forecast to stay offshore there will be extensive damage along the coast from storm surge, high winds and flooding rains.To map assets in Hurricane Dorian’s path, click here.(Adds new wind speed, location of storm in third paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Serene Cheong, Sharon Cho, David R.

2019-08-30	2019-08-30 21:24:20	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Oil Caps Its Worst Month Since May as Trade-War Concerns Linger	(Bloomberg) -- Oil extended its biggest monthly decline since May as concern over U.S.-China trade tensions outweighed signs that OPEC’s supply cuts are trimming stockpiles.Futures fell 2.8% in New York, extending the month’s slide to almost 6%. Concerns about demand for swelling U.S. production have been stoked as China gets set to start taxing U.S. oil from Sunday. American oil explorers, even as they cut drilling to a 19-month low, are producing record volumes of crude.“It’s simply positioning ahead of the long weekend,” said Bob Yawger, futures director at Mizuho Securities USA in New York. “If you were long, would you want to go home this weekend still long, with really no idea what kind of twitter feed the POTUS is going to unload while you hanging out at the beach bar?”Oil remains under pressure as the outlook for the global economy continues to be weak and the U.S. pumps out crude at record-high levels. Further, Russian earlier said it was cutting production but not as much as it had agreed to with OPEC and its allies.At the same time, there are signs that inventories are being drawn down. U.S. stockpiles fell in the week ended Aug. 23 to the lowest level since November, government data show.The impending Beijing 5% tariff on U.S. oil is particularly responsible for the recent weakness in WTI relative to Brent. The American benchmark is now fetching a $5.49 a barrel discount to its global counterpart, the widest in nearly a month.“The wider spread is a sign of the trade war,” said Rob Haworth, who helps oversee $151 billion at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. Chinese buyers would have to find alternatives since U.S. oil has become more expensive, he said. “That will push up Brent prices, while weakening U.S. oil.”West Texas Intermediate for October delivery sank $1.61 to settle at $55.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Brent for October settlement, which expires Friday, fell 65 cents to $60.43 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange. The more-active November contract sank $1.24 to $59.25.Traders are also keeping an eye on Hurricane Dorian that’s now expected to become a Category 4 storm and make landfall on Florida’s east coast, the first major hurricane to hit the area in 15 years. Threats of the storm has already forced Chevron to remove some non-essential staff from two of its platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.To contact the reporter on this story: Sheela Tobben in New York at vtobben@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Catherine TraywickFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-heads-best-week-seven-064603421.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-25	2019-07-25 08:04:09	EQNR	Equinor ASA	Total Profit Drops as Lower Gas Prices Offset Rising Output	(Bloomberg) -- Total SA’s second-quarter profit fell short of estimates as the price of natural gas and oil dropped, while record hydrocarbon production and continued cost cuts boosted cash flow.Adjusted net income was almost a fifth lower than a year earlier, but cash flow rose and the French giant went ahead with a planned share buyback. While trade tensions and signs of a global economic slowdown have weighed on commodity prices in recent months, years of cost cuts have improved energy companies’ resilience and they continue to boost shareholder returns.Total would have been able to cover its expenditures and dividends at an oil price of less than $50 a barrel, well below the current level, Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement on Thursday.Pouyanne said the company will sell $5 billion of other assets from 2019 to 2020. The move should keep a lid on debt as the French oil major agreed in May to buy the African assets of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. for $8.8 billion. Most of those future divestments will be in exploration and production, including areas with high technical costs such as the recently divested North Sea fields, Total said.Total’s adjusted net income fell to $2.89 billion from $3.55 billion a year earlier, according to the company, which is based near Paris. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast $2.98 billion on average. The shares of the French company were trading 0.5% higher at 9:18 a.m. in Paris.Oil and gas production climbed 9% from a year earlier to 2.957 million barrels equivalent a day. Sales of liquefied natural gas more than doubled to 8.5 million tons, due to last year’s acquisition of Engie SA assets and the ramp-up of projects in Australia and Russia.“The overall picture appears to be on track, with upstream volumes growing by 9% year-on-year, fueled by recent activity and growth projects,” Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Europe Ltd., said in a note. He expressed skepticism that Total and peers may divest all upstream assets at “reasonable prices” because of high volume of planned divestments.Record output wasn’t enough to compensate for a sharp drop in natural gas prices, with key benchmarks in Europe and Asia more than 40% lower than a year earlier. Warm winter weather crimped demand, while additional supplies came onto the market from Russia, Australia and North America.Other major energy companies are also expected to suffer from the slump in gas prices, with Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc predicted to report lower earnings next week. Russia’s largest LNG producer, Novatek PJSC, posted a decline in second-quarter revenue on Wednesday, and Norwegian explorer Equinor ASA on Thursday slashed its investment plan for this year as it also reported quarterly earnings that dropped more than analysts had forecast.Operating cash flow before working capital charges, a measure of oil majors’ ability to keep paying generous dividends and investing in growth, rose 5% to $6.71 billion. Total is on track to complete its $1.5 billion share buyback target this year. Its interim payout was unchanged from the previous quarter at 0.66 euros ($0.74) a share.To cement future growth, Total agreed in May to buy the African assets of Anadarko, which include a giant LNG project in Mozambique as well as producing oil and gas fields in Ghana and Algeria. Earlier this year, it took a stake in the Arctic LNG 2 project in Russia, reinforced its commitment to Tellurian Inc.’s project in the U.S., and made progress on a venture in Papua New Guinea.The downstream division, which has been undermined in recent months by a pipeline issue in France and tainted Russian oil supplies in Germany, should benefit from the restart of the Grandpuits and Leuna refineries, the company said.(Updates with analyst comment and Equinor results from seventh paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Francois de Beaupuy in Paris at fdebeaupuy@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Helen Robertson, Christopher SellFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-profit-drops-lower-oil-060000868.html?.tsrc=rss

Adjusted earnings before interest and tax fell to $3.15bn in the second quarter, missing analyst expectations of $3.4bn by almost 10 per cent and down from $4.3bn during the same period last year.  Equinor said the results were hit by lower oil liquids production in the quarter — which generally fetch higher prices than gas — though total output was on a par with the same quarter last year at around 2m barrels of oil equivalent per day.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d1824626-e404-3516-8ba4-9c128b465519/equinor-earnings-knocked-by.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-19	2019-07-19 12:19:34	EQNR	Equinor ASA	New York Signs Biggest Offshore Wind Project Deal in the Nation	(Bloomberg) -- New York has signed the biggest-ever deals for offshore wind power in U.S. history, a key part of the state’s plan to get all of its power from emissions-free sources by 2040.On Thursday, Governor Andrew Cuomo awarded contracts for two projects off Long Island that will total 1,700 megawatts in capacity. Equinor ASA and a joint venture between Denmark’s Orsted A/S and Massachusetts-based Eversource Energy were chosen to build the farms, which will supply enough power to light up a million homes.Cuomo is counting on the wind projects to achieve the most aggressive clean energy goal in the U.S., and signed the state’s 100% renewable energy target into law right after announcing the wind contracts. New York’s ultimate plan is to get enough turbines erected off its shores to generate 9,000 megawatts by 2035.“The actions we take today will be the most consequential of my administration,” Cuomo said Thursday at a press conference, where he was joined on stage by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. “They literally will determine the future, or the lack thereof.”The contracted wind farms will be completed by 2024, he said. Based on cost estimates from BloombergNEF, the projects may be valued at more than $5 billion.The Orsted-Eversource joint venture, Sunrise Wind, will provide 880 megawatts from a site about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Montauk Point -- adjacent to the South Fork Wind Farm and Revolution Wind projects the two companies are also jointly developing. Equinor will generate 816 megawatts from its Empire Wind project, about 20 miles south of Long Island, east of the Rockaways.Shares of Springfield, Massachusetts-based Eversource gained 1.3% to a record $78.40 at the close in New York.Construction will begin in the early 2020s pending permits, said Thomas Brostrom, chief executive officer of Orsted Americas. “We have to go flying out of the gates to have service by 2024,” he said. Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA is set to supply the turbines for the Orsted-Eversource project, the company said in a statement.The contracts -- requiring utilities to buy power from the wind projects -- have proven crucial to the financing and development of offshore wind power in the U.S. Analysts have projected that the business could grow into a $70 billion industry along the East Coast, where states from New York to Massachusetts to New Jersey are holding auctions.New York’s contracts were so sought-after that project developers spent months wooing officials in the state with promises of jobs, training programs and port upgrades leading up to the auction results.Erecting wind mills in the ocean remains one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. But costs are falling, and states see the technology as key in bringing clean energy to densely populated coastal areas. The U.S. government has leased more than a dozen sites to develop projects in the Atlantic from North Carolina to Massachusetts. New York’s request for bids drew offers from four developers who have building sites off Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey.In June, New Jersey awarded a contract to Denmark-based Orsted to supply 1,100 megawatts of offshore wind at an initial cost of $98.10 a megawatt-hour. That’s roughly triple the average wholesale power cost in the region.Excluding subsidies, the cost of offshore wind power have plunged 64% since 2012 to a global average of $89 a megawatt-hour last year, according to BloombergNEF. That’s still more than double the $35 a megawatt-hour that New York City has paid on average for wholesale power over the past five years, according to data compiled by Genscape.&#92;--With assistance from Christopher Martin.To contact the reporters on this story: Will Wade in New York at wwade4@bloomberg.net;Millicent Dent in New York at mdent13@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Will WadeFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/york-signs-biggest-offshore-wind-190719274.html?.tsrc=rss

This is another disappointment for Norway which hoped that the Barents Sea could become its new oil and gas province, helping to sustain its key industry, whose production is set to fall from mature fields in the North Sea.  The area in the southeastern Barents Sea was opened for seismic acquisition and exploration after Norway and Russia's border agreement came into force in 2011.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-equinors-norwegian-arctic-exploration-110529796.html?.tsrc=rss

Oil companies led by state-controlled Equinor ASA, the biggest Norwegian producer, have said that gaining access to Lofoten is key if the country wants to maintain production as resources are being depleted.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norway-walking-away-billions-barrels-040000233.html?.tsrc=rss

""Even though strategies for each NOC depend on a number of factors such as the relationship with their national governments and prices in local markets, national oil companies overall have strived to cut costs, adjust growth strategies or sell assets as much as non-sponsored private oil companies have done,"" says Steve Wood, Moody's Managing Director for the Oil & Gas Team.

2018-05-01	2018-05-01 05:09:07	EQNR	Equinor ASA	[$$] Oil’s Biggest Benchmark, Brent, Needs More Oil	A North Sea oil field named after a 19th century Norwegian prime minister could soon spark a shakeup in the Brent crude benchmark that prices oil around the world.  The Johan Sverdrup field, about 87 miles west of Stavanger, Norway, is due to begin production in 2019 and could offer Brent a lifeline by boosting the volume of crude used to price it and making it more reflective of the wider market, analysts say.  Falling output of the oil grades used to set Brent, and the small number of companies that produce it, has also raised concerns that the market is vulnerable to manipulation.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/62d04c6d-cf54-3e68-a033-9cb66eb3540b/%5B%24%24%5D-oil%E2%80%99s-biggest-benchmark%2C.html?.tsrc=rss

Its flagship project, the development of the Johan Sverdrup oilfield in the North Sea, now has a break-even price so low it challenges the efficiency of OPEC countries, said one analyst.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/statoil-raises-dividend-capex-oil-103849962.html?.tsrc=rss
