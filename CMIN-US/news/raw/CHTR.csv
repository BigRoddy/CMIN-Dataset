2021-05-07	2021-05-07 17:13:44	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	7 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade	Nowadays, it’s very popular for younger investors to get their advice on social media forums or from YouTube financial gurus. To me, it sounds like the blind leading the blind. Every year, a new hotshot claims to have the inside path to profitable stocks to buy. And more often than not, the market eventually blindsides them. That’s why folks should listen to those who’ve been there before like Warren Buffett. For one thing, Warren Buffett has been investing in blue-chip stocks since the birth of Christ. He’s lived through multiple economic and market cycles so nothing really surprises him. Yes, the individual stocks to buy may look different but in the end, it comes down to the free market principles of supply and demand. And one of the best teachers of profitability exploiting such dynamics is experience. Yet we should realize that Warren Buffett was once young too. Born on Aug. 30, 1930, Buffett graduated from high school when he was 17 years old. He never intended to go to college. However, his father insisted that he attend the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. But the younger Buffett only stayed two years, “complaining that he knew more than his professors,” according to The Balance contributor Joshua Kennon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This sounds to me like Warren Buffett was the original YouTube guru. But the difference is that unlike all the junk that you see on the blogosphere, he knew what he was talking about. Eventually, he would amass a financial empire that would allow him to take control of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). If you read his bio, you’ll find that Buffett wasn’t just great at picking stocks to buy — he was a real OG. 7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto In my view, if you’re going to learn from somebody, it should be a person like Buffett, a man who was born during the Great Depression, went through his youthful exuberance phase, formed a time-proven investment strategy and still continues to fight like the best of ‘em at 90 freaking years old! Below are some key stocks to buy from the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway. AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) American Express (NYSE:AXP) Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Itochu Corporation (OTCMKTS:ITOCF) Verisign (NASDAQ:VRSN) Now, I should note that despite my high praise for Warren Buffett, he’s not the ultimate arbiter of equity valuations: the market is. Even though these stocks to buy are compelling because they’re on the Berkshire list, nothing is infallible. Maintain money management discipline and a long-term prospective, though, and you should do well in the end. Stocks to Buy: AbbVie (ABBV) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Berkshire Hathaway has a number of healthcare-related companies on its list. But the one that caught my attention was AbbVie. Yes, I have some personal bias in that I’ve discussed the bullish case for ABBV stock. But well beyond that, I like to think that Warren Buffett and I are on the same wavelength — well, at least as long AbbVie specifically is concerned. Yes, everybody knows AbbVie as one of the giant pharmaceutical stocks to buy. It’s perhaps most popular for the drug Humira, which has been formulated to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and psoriasis, among many other conditions. As well, AbbVie features an extensive list of oncology-related solutions. Should the novel coronavirus outbreak fade out completely, the treatment for long-term diseases should take precedence based on pent-up demand, if you will. But what may really drive ABBV stock is Botox, which came under the AbbVie umbrella when it acquired Allergan. During the Covid-19 lockdowns, there was little incentive to look good. Now that we’re slowly but surely returning to our normal schedules, we have a “right” to be vainer. Cynically, this is good news for ABBV, making it one of the best Berkshire-held stocks to buy. Amazon (AMZN) Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com Admittedly, Berkshire doesn’t have nearly as much allocation toward Amazon shares as it does many of its other holdings. At only a 0.1% stake, it’s not Buffett’s highest-conviction trade, that’s for sure. Still, a 0.1% stake is a non-zero number, which means AMZN is one of the stocks to buy or at least to consider. I’m going to get the bad stuff out of the way. Certainly, you can’t deny that AMZN stock has a PR problem. Back during the early days of the Covid-19 crisis, many workers demanded basic dignities, such as paid time off for employees who were sick or displayed Covid-19 symptoms. Not helping matters is that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos consistently swapped places with elite tycoons as the richest person in the world. Yeah, we can talk all day about free market capitalism but come on — sometimes enough is enough. Still, despite the troubles, Amazon’s relevance can’t be denied. When the brick and mortars had to shut down based on government mandates, e-commerce filled the gap. And Amazon dominates e-commerce. 7 Hot Stocks to Consider for a Greener Future While the percentage of e-commerce sales relative to total retail sales has come down since the peak of the crisis, it’s still very much elevated from pre-pandemic norms. I don’t see this reversing anytime soon, which is why Berkshire includes it on its list of stocks to buy. Stocks to Buy: American Express (AXP) Source: Shutterstock For me, American Express represents a perhaps delusional notion that in certain circumstances, Warren Buffett and I think alike. Generally speaking, I’m somewhat hesitant on credit cards. Certainly, I can see their appeal in the present context. Throughout most of last year, the Covid-19 crisis deflated consumer sentiment, which naturally boosted the personal saving rate. Today, with much of the economy reopening, consumers are ready to spend. Further, you have the stimulus checks that former President Donald Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden signed off on. Thank you, gentlemen. But will such measures really boost spending holistically? Sure, I get the narrative that spending will rise because Americans want to catch up on their retail therapy. But credit cards are debt instruments and consumers historically haven’t shown much restraint with debt instruments. But AXP stock may not suffer from such concerns as the underlying company caters to wealthier individuals. It seems that the folks at Berkshire Hathaway understand this point very clearly. AXP features an 18.9% stake. In contrast, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) both have a 0.5% stake. So if you’re going to get Buffett-inspired credit card stocks to buy, go for American Express. Charter Communications (CHTR) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com A classic Warren Buffett move, the inclusion of Charter Communications by Berkshire Hathaway doesn’t surprise me in the least. As a telecommunications and mass-media company under the Charter Spectrum brand name, CHTR was one of the most relevant stocks to buy. Providing high-speed cable and fiber-internet access, along with mobile services, Charter is integral to our modern infrastructure. But with the Covid-19 crisis, CHTR stock became even more ingrained. With millions of white-collar workers forced to operate out of their living rooms, reliable high-speed internet services commanded a premium. Not that it should bear any influence on whether you should acquire shares of Charter Communications but I personally made the switch to Spectrum and I couldn’t be happier. While anecdotal, I’ll tell you what makes CHTR compelling among the Buffett-inspired stocks to buy. Yes, Spectrum’s coverage area spans 44 states. But it’s also where they dominate that matters. For instance, Spectrum has the widest coverage in California, Texas and New York. When you combine the GDP of these three states, you’re talking about $6.55 trillion of economic activity. 8 Blue-Chip Stocks With Strong Earnings Such a combined entity would make it the third-biggest country in the world, usurping Japan. Thus, CHTR is sticking around, which is why Berkshire owns it. Stocks to Buy: Chevron (CVX) Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com Chevron might be one of the surprising stocks to buy on the Berkshire Hathaway list, prompting criticism that perhaps Buffett might be losing it. As you know, American consumers have gravitated toward electric vehicles. And that’s not just a “fashion statement.” Millennials care about sustainability and growing evidence suggests that Generation Z is taking cues, increasing the magnitude of holistic awareness. On the surface, CVX stock doesn’t seem to make much sense. Yes, Chevron and the big oil machinery are relevant today. But tomorrow, the tide will likely turn. It’s not just millennials that consistently influence current affairs. More significantly, government leadership is also pivoting toward a cleaner, more sustainable future. Obviously, the Biden administration wishes to push its environmental protection agenda. Up and coming politicians will probably carry the torch. Big oil stocks to buy are done for. Then again, maybe not. I think CVX may represent a case of Buffett’s contrarianism. This is speculation on my part but it’s possible that Buffett and the Berkshire team don’t view the electrification of transportation as economically viable just yet. Even if it became so, Buffett probably recognizes that oil will be around for a very long time, in part due to the high energy density of fossil fuels. So yeah, CVX is a keeper. Itochu Corporation (ITOCF) Source: VladSV / Shutterstock.com I’m familiar with most of the stocks to buy under the Berkshire umbrella. But the name that caught me by surprise was Itochu Corporation. Frankly, I understand both value and growth investors pivot to Asia. However, this almost always means Chinese companies. On the other hand, Japan hasn’t been making much news aside from deflation-related headlines. So why Itochu? If somebody would ask that question to Warren Buffett, I’d be most grateful as it would give us all a deeper insight into one of the world’s greatest investors. But if I had to guess, it would be Itochu’s exposure to world-class Japanese manufacturing. Itochu is one of Japan’s biggest general trading companies and thus touches on many relevant sectors. But the underlying theme is manufacturing. Interestingly, Harvard Business Review did a story on Japan’s manufacturing prowess. Initially, business experts attributed its outperformance to superior methodologies. But later, these same experts noted that Japan’s production attributes were contradictory to commonly held beliefs: “…many Japanese factories practicing lean manufacturing appeared to surpass their U.S. counterparts on several dimensions; they achieved lower cost, higher quality, faster product introductions, and greater flexibility, all at the same time.” 7 Consumer Stocks to Buy Before Picnic Season Begins In other words, there’s something in the water when it comes to Japanese manufacturing. Buffett might be recognizing this, thus explaining the inclusion of ITOCF stock. Stocks to Buy: Verisign (VRSN) Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com Warren Buffett is old. But what I really appreciate about him is that he continues to defy stereotypes. Honestly, at 90 years old, he should be referred to in the past tense. But he’s still out there, leading one of the biggest companies in the world. Good for him and it’s a powerful lesson for all of us. What I especially like is that Buffett isn’t just out there as a charity case. Instead, he’s making bold calls regarding stocks to buy, one of them being Verisign. Well before anyone knew about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, VRSN was an incredibly relevant idea due to its internet network infrastructure operations, including managing the registry for .com and .net domains. That’s serious influence right there. But Covid-19 has dramatically changed the paradigm of work. Though many employees are heading back to the office, several organizations — including high-level blue chips — remain open-minded about a full return to normal. And a ton of them are not in a hurry to have everyone clocking back in. There’s also the narrative that many folks who got a taste of the gig worker’s life want to maintain such freedom. To be fair, I’m not sure if companies will allow employees to work 100% from home. Therefore, we could see an increase in independent contract work, which should bolster Verisign’s business. Overall, VRSN stock is one to watch closely as we navigate the post-Covid world.

2021-05-06	2021-05-06 17:41:48	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Cable Firms Fear Being Left in Dust in Biden Broadband Quest	(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration’s multitrillion-dollar infrastructure proposal includes $100 billion to bring high-speed broadband to every American, an idea that might be expected to win applause from those who provide the service.But cable companies such as Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. that connect about two-thirds of U.S. homes that have broadband service fear the plan’s specific call for “future-proof” technology could leave them facing subsidized competitors.That’s because the traditional coaxial lines that cable companies still use to serve most of their subscribers don’t handle the upload speeds that consumer advocates say should be required to receive federal infrastructure aid. Many say subsidies should go only to systems that can download and upload traffic at speeds of at least 100 megabits per second.Cable can download at that speed but averaged only 11 megabits per second for uploads in 2019, according to a January report by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Carriers using fiber lines averaged 193.“Why do you want to spend the people’s money on an interim technology?” Tom Wheeler, a former Democratic FCC chairman, said in an interview. “We ought to be building it in a future-proof manner -- which means fiber.”Technology GapsCable systems that incorporate fiber can be part of the solution in coming years, and are to be preferred over technologies such as wireless broadband and satellite-based internet services, Wheeler said.At issue are potentially billions of dollars earmarked for closing the technology gaps revealed by the pandemic, where remote work and schooling were hampered by patchy internet speeds and access. Proposals to require lofty minimum speeds have already sparked a lively debate in Congress where investing in broadband is otherwise one of the less controversial elements of President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan.The White House hasn’t defined the speed it wants. In announcing its “American Jobs Plan” on March 31 it called for bringing “affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband to every American.” It cited rural areas bereft of broadband, and urban areas where some shun broadband because of high prices. It flatly said: “Americans pay too much for the internet” and pledged to work for reduced prices.Congress will ultimately decide whether to tie aid to the higher speeds. Four U.S. senators, including two Republicans, an independent and Democrat Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, earlier this year wrote to Biden administration officials in support of a 100/100 standard.“There is no reason federal funding to rural areas should not support the type of speeds used by households in typical well-served urban and suburban areas,” the senators said in their March 4 letter.The idea has drawn opposition from Republicans, though, including Ohio Representative Bill Johnson who said it could lead to subsidies in areas that already have broadband, while rural areas wait. “That sounds like the exact opposite of what needs to happen,” he said at a March 22 hearing.The congressional focus on broadband continued on Thursday with a House hearing on unequal access to the technology.‘Digital Divide’“There is a digital divide between races and ethnicities,” Democratic Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey, chairman of the Energy & Commerce Committee, said at the hearing before his panel. “While 80% of White households have broadband access, that is true of only 70% of Black households and 65% of Hispanic households.”Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington Republican, criticized Democratic proposals that she characterized as creating “arbitrary speed thresholds that favor fiber-only projects with no restrictions to prevent overbuilding in areas where broadband already exists.”Cable providers say it doesn’t make sense to demand very fast uploads, since most home broadband traffic consists of video downloads where their download speeds often exceed 100 megabits. Rather than subsidizing new ultra-fast networks in areas already served by cable systems, the government should focus on areas without broadband, they argue.Federal money should go to places with “no broadband, or very little broadband, or really inadequate broadband,” Michael Powell, president of the trade group NCTA-The Internet & Television Association, said last month on the C-Span network program “The Communicators.” The group’s members include the biggest cable provider, Comcast, and No. 2 Charter.The current broadband benchmark established by the FCC is 25/3 -- 25 megabits per second download, and 3 megabits per second for uploads. About 20 million Americans lack access to such service, according to the FCC.If the 100/100 standard is adopted for determining what areas are eligible for subsidies, federal broadband-construction aid could flow to areas with fast downloads but that lack speedy uploads. Funds could subsidize competition where established cable providers such as Comcast and Charter operate. Under a bill proposed in March by Democrats and that could be the basis for eventual infrastructure legislation, that would happen only after money first flows to areas with no broadband or very poor service.Shares in Comcast and Charter slipped in the days after Biden’s plan was announced but have since recovered that ground and more as each company reported earnings. Comcast said it signed up 461,000 new broadband subscribers in the first quarter, and Charter announced 355,000 new internet subscribers, surpassing analysts’ expectations.Consumer ComplaintsNeither company publicly discloses how many of its customers are served by fiber to their doorstep. About 16% of cable subscribers are connected with fiber optic lines, according to research by Cowen & Co.Jon Peha, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said complaints about upload speeds soared during the pandemic.“Upstream is critical if you’re working or taking classes from home,” Peha said in an email. “We found that after the pandemic hit, downstream speed stayed about the same but upstream speed was significantly degraded, and consumer complaints about speed tripled.”FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican, said the proposed faster standard could have perverse results, with money flowing into already-well-wired cities.“You’re going to seriously dump taxpayer money on top of that?” Carr said in an interview. “When we have many areas with zero connections, that seems like a mistake.”The 100/100 mandate could spur cable providers to offer higher speeds, said Gigi Sohn, a former Democratic FCC aide who’s now a distinguished fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law & Policy.“It incentivizes them to up their game,” Sohn said in an interview. “You’re seeing that with Charter, Comcast and Altice -- the three biggest cable operators.”Cable’s FiberComcast President David Watson told investors April 29 that symmetric service -- the same speeds up and down -- “is a focus” for the company. Charter in February said it would spend $5 billion on a new fiber optic network to serve mostly rural areas as part of an FCC subsidy program. Altice USA Inc. Chief Executive Officer Dexter Goei on April 28 told investors the company, with 4.4 million customers, has surpassed 1 million fiber-to-the-home connections and is building more.“Customers are increasingly appreciating higher upload speeds,” Goei said.The push for higher speeds is coming from a White House with cable critics in key policy roles. National Economic Council Deputy Director Bharat Ramamurti led a team for Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren that criticized Comcast as a “market-dominant” company. Special assistant Tim Wu has long said cable prices are too high, and he helped New York assemble a lawsuit that accused Charter of ripping off customers with promises of faster internet speeds than the company knew it could deliver. Charter agreed to pay $174 million to settle the claims.Even Vice President Kamala Harris, who Biden has asked to lead the broadband effort, oversaw cases against Comcast when she served as California’s attorney general.“The administration might view the infrastructure bill as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build competition in that market,” Paul Gallant, a Washington-based analyst with Cowen & Co., said in an interview. “Is this a paradigm shift?”(Updates with congressional hearing testimony beginning in 12th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cable-firms-fear-being-left-060000923.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-19	2021-04-19 12:00:00	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority To Bring Free High-Speed Broadband To More Than 4,500 Residents Of Affordable Housing Units In A New Collaboration With Charter Communications	CMHA to Provide Spectrum Internet® to Residents in 18 PropertiesCOLUMBUS, Ohio, April 19, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- More than 4,500 residents at 18 properties owned by the Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority (CMHA) will soon receive free access to high-speed broadband service through a new collaboration with Charter Communications, Inc. and its Spectrum Community Solutions organization. Leaders for CMHA and Spectrum hailed the agreement as an innovative solution to help an estimated 1,800 low-wage-earning households in the Columbus area bridge central Ohio’s “digital divide,” which is the gap between those who have ready access to computers and the internet and those who do not. More than half of CMHA's 4,000-plus apartments are set aside for families earning 30% or less of the area median income, approximately $26,500 annually for a family of four. “Our new agreement with Spectrum reflects CMHA’s commitment to providing our residents with the dignity of access to internet service that is affordable and available for all uses, including school, work, telehealth and social media,” said CMHA President and CEO Charles Hillman. “This collaboration is made possible due to the financial contribution of CMHA and the decision of our board of commissioners to deliver a service to the residents of our affordable units that today is as essential as water, sewer, gas and electricity,” Hillman said. Spectrum will provide each CMHA affordable residential unit with Spectrum Internet, including starting speeds of 200 Mbps with Spectrum in-home WiFi and no data caps or modem fees. The service will also include Spectrum WiFi access in common areas, as well as connectivity supporting additional security measures at these properties. Beginning later this month, Spectrum will work with CMHA management to schedule rapid installation, deploying teams of technicians to activate service quickly in each unit. “This collaboration helps close the digital divide by providing high-quality, high-speed broadband for families who need reliable connectivity,” said Adam Ray, Executive Vice President of Spectrum Community Solutions. “Our team is committed to working with Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority to ensure our dedicated service organization delivers the very best onboarding experience to residents.” A 2020 report commissioned by The Columbus Foundation and conducted by the Columbus branch office of AECOM, an international civil infrastructure research and planning company, reported that even in the lowest income areas of Columbus, there is at least one high-speed internet provider and adequate broadband infrastructure for service. However, the study found that gaps in access were largely due to a variety of barriers, including economic challenges, technology literacy and lack of computers or other devices. The CMHA collaboration with Spectrum aligns with the report’s conclusion that “long-term, public-private collaborations and new technologies will be necessary components to ensure high-speed internet access to all community members.” Spectrum Community Solutions offers industry-leading wired and wireless broadband and video services — including gigabit connections — to residents of apartments, off-campus student housing, senior residences, RV parks and marinas throughout Spectrum’s 41-state service area. While the digital divide existed before the spread of coronavirus, Columbus officials said that the pandemic has exposed the issue of lack of access to high-speed internet even more. CMHA’s collaboration with Spectrum will enable hard-working, low-income households to overcome that burden, especially students, according to Franklin County Board of Commissioners President Kevin Boyce. “I applaud the leadership that CMHA and Spectrum are demonstrating in Franklin County by expanding access to high-speed internet to underserved communities,” Boyce said. “I believe public policy and the actions that we take can be the catalyst to changing long-term situations such as the digital divide that negatively impacts the ability of students to learn and succeed in the classroom and in their community,” Boyce added. “The new CMHA-Spectrum collaboration definitely moves the needle on improving the quality of life for CMHA residents.” The Federal Communications Commission’s Tenth Measuring Broadband America Fixed Broadband Report highlighted how Spectrum is outperforming benchmarks and delivering superior services to our customers. Spectrum Internet exceeded 100% of advertised speeds during peak times on all speeds measured — three downstream speeds and two upstream speeds. About CMHA CMHA helps people access affordable housing through collaborative partnerships, promote neighborhood revitalization and assist residents in accessing needed social services. CMHA has more than doubled its portfolio of housing over that last five years, including over $200 million in investment in 2020. We own over 4,000 units of mixed income and affordable housing and through our Housing Choice Voucher and Project Based Rental Assistance Programs provide rental assistance to more than 250,000 Ohio and Washington DC residents. CMHA has been a Section Eight Management Assessment Program (SEMAP) High Performer for the last ten years. More than half of CMHA's 4,000+ apartments are set aside for families earning 30% or less of the area median income, approximately $26,500 annually for a family of four.

Media stocks used to be television and radio station conglomerates that owned stations around the country. There were also cable companies that were running the parade of cable-infused services that were very popular a couple decades ago. But consumers once labeled “cable cutters” are now the norm. Streaming services, smart phones and much better connectivity have taken over. What’s more, in this mobile age, it’s much easier to get internet connections from cell towers than it is from cable, especially if you’re a company that has to invest in laying and maintaining that cable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Media Stocks Ready for the Next Decade The seven outdated media stocks to ignore here may well be household names, but that doesn’t mean they’re going to earn you much money in coming years. They were exciting ideas a couple decades ago, but the world has moved on. Let’s take a closer look at why each of these stocks has grown stale: Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI) Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR) Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOX) Sinclair Broadcast Group (NASDAQ:SBGI) Groupo Televisa (NYSE:TV) Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) Source: Shutterstock Satellite radio is one of those ideas like satellite phones. On paper it seems like a great idea. I mean, what radio station wouldn’t want national coverage? And what person wouldn’t want to listen to their favorite radio stations wherever they went? But in reality, it’s a tough sell and it’s expensive. All the content and talent has to be original. And you have to maintain all the telecom equipment to keep the whole thing running smoothly. All that comes before you can secure advertising. And drawing advertisers to this new concept is tough, especially in a bad economy. There’s also the internet and streaming services available where you can listen to almost any of your favorite local stations online. It’s true that SIRI still has significant contracts with automakers and it has a nearly $25 billion market cap. But its best days are over; there’s nowhere else to grow. This media stock is down 17% over the past 12 months and almost 6% year to date. Shaw Communications (SJR) Source: JL IMAGES/Shutterstock.com This Canada-based cable television and telecom services company has been around since 1966. But the same challenges that are affecting the U.S. market are hitting the Canadian market. And there are few people in Canada, so SJR is competing against massive streaming companies and big telecom firms with little ability to grow. That’s not a good place to be for a media stock. Looking at SJR’s efforts over the past decades, you can’t fault its efforts in trying to remain relevant. But it’s ultimately a niche telecom provider with a limited future. Even a takeover wouldn’t amount to much premium. These 7 Semiconductor Stocks Are Actually Winning From the Chip Shortage SJR stock is down almost 9% over the past 12 months and that means its 5% dividend doesn’t help keep investors in the black. Charter Communications (CHTR) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com This media stock represents the second-largest cable operator and third largest pay TV operator in the U.S. market. It has more than 26 million customers in 41 states. The problem is, cable ain’t cool any longer. It’s a legacy system and usually in the areas where providers operate, it’s a monopoly. And over the years, cable companies have used that only-game-in-town mentality to reward shareholders, not customers. That’s why cable providers regularly end up on the list of most hated companies in the U.S. Now, as internet connectivity becomes available to more people, they’re happily leaving these legacy cable providers, even if their cable providers are selling internet. Those still stuck with cable providers are cancelling all the other services that are revenue drivers for streaming services. That’s not a viable long-term model for growth. CHTR stock is up 16% over the past 12 months and trades a whopping price-to-earnings ratio of 40x. DISH Network (DISH) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com For a while there, it looked like satellite television was going to be the upstart competitor to the greedy cable companies. And it was certainly giving its media competitors a run for their money — until streaming hit. Think of satellite media stocks as the intermediary step that video tape was to thumb drives and hard drives. It had a good run that was cut short by a better technology that finally overcame its price point disadvantage. Also, it was tough to remain competitive by offering internet services because satellite internet is still more potential than functional. It’s trying to pivot to 5G, but it’s up against big competition. 7 Blockchain Stocks to Buy to Go Beyond Crypto DISH stock is down 20% in the past year, and growth will remain challenged for this media stock. Fox Corp (FOX) Source: Leonard Zhukovsky / Shutterstock.com FOX has certainly built a strong foothold in the news business in the U.S. as the counterweight to more established mainstream media. And that has been its strategy in every market media magnate Rupert Murdoch has entered. But the company is much bigger than its political talk division. It’s a news organization, entertainment company and sports company. And that means it relies on advertisers for revenue. Given the current economic challenges, advertisers are looking for alternatives to their legacy strategies. And some are pulling back on advertising altogether. That’s tough for FOX. There’s no doubt FOX will stick around and stay a viable entity, but it’s not a growth stock. It’s down 16% over the past 12 months and may well be about the same spot next year. Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI) Source: Shutterstock This media stock is the second largest television station owner in the U.S. It also owns a handful of radio stations as well as other streaming media properties. But its core is local television stations. The organization also self-identifies as a more conservative voice in the broader media world, so it’s no surprise that many of the television stations it owns are FOX stations. But as you noticed, the featured stock before this one is none other than FOX. That means these affiliates are running into the same challenges — if not more — as FOX. With content getting sliced and diced and more segmented, local TV isn’t what it used to be. And that means it’s tougher to earn a buck in these media markets, especially during a pandemic. 7 Media Stocks Ready for the Next Decade Even for its breadth, SBGI only sports a $2 billion market cap, so it doesn’t have the heft of FOX or other big media companies. Economic recovery may help, but that may be some time off. The stock is up 8% over the past 12 months and sports a 2.4% dividend. Grupo Televisa (TV) Source: Tooykrub / Shutterstock.com As a key member of the North American triumvirate of economic partners, Mexico is a nation that has one foot in Latin America and one foot in the U.S. During good times, the country gets a boost from its emerging market neighbors as well as rising trade with the U.S. But in tough times, the emerging markets slump and trade with the U.S. slows. TV is Mexico’s leading media company and it reflects these expansions and contractions as well. However, it’s also coming under competition from streaming services that are borderless. And its content, like telenovelas, are landing big contracts on streaming services, so content is also under pressure. TV stock is down 25% over the past 12 months, but this is no time to try to catch a falling knife. On the date of publication, Louis Navellier has no positions in the stocks in this article.

2021-02-04	2021-02-04 21:59:17	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Musk’s Internet-From-Space Subsidy at Risk as Rivals Protest	(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Federal Communications Commission faces pressure from rural internet service providers to deny a planned $886 million subsidy to Elon Musk’s SpaceX for beaming broadband to underserved areas from outer space.Even before winning a competition for the funds, SpaceX had set up its service and begun launching satellites. More than 1,000 of the Starlink craft are now aloft, providing service to test subscribers. The company says its system “is uniquely positioned to deliver high-quality broadband service to the hardest-to-reach rural Americans.”But that hasn’t stopped complaints about it winning a competition for subsidies from the FCC’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, in part because the service was being built without the aid and isn’t limited to rural areas. The planned awards to Space Exploration Technologies Corp., as it’s formally known, and to other companies have lawmakers raising questions about the entire $9.2 billion program.SpaceX is “still in beta testing - not a proven technology,” said Jim Matheson, chief executive officer of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, which has members that vied for the funding.Matheson at a news conference Thursday cited “technology that may not be capable of connecting millions of rural Americans with real broadband” and called on the FCC to “actively, and aggressively, and thoughtfully vet” subsidy applications by SpaceX and others.SpaceX placed 60 more satellites in orbit on Thursday with another batch set for launch from a Florida facility Friday, according to the company’s Twitter feed. Separately, the company defended its service in a filing.“Starlink’s performance is not theoretical or experimental,” the company said in the filing posted Thursday on the FCC’s website. “Over 10,000 users in the United States and abroad are using the service today.”The Rural Digital Opportunity Fund is a centerpiece of federal efforts to connect millions of people without home broadband, many of them in thinly populated areas that are costly to serve -- a need underscored by the Covid-19 pandemic. The fund is poised to distribute public money to extend broadband in 49 states over 10 years.In December, it announced winning bids at auction for 180 companies and bidding groups, most of which provide broadband over more established technologies, such as cable or wireless service.“We have a rigorous and extensive process in place to vet winning bidders before authorizing any support,” Anne Veigle, an agency spokeswoman, said Thursday in an email.SpaceX was approved for its plan to provide service to 642,925 locations in 35 states. But consumer advocates say those locations include parts of New York City and airports in Newark and Miami -- places that don’t fit the program’s goal of bringing service to rural people beyond the reach of broadband networks.The decisions were made when Trump administration appointees still controlled the FCC and now the agency is led by Biden appointees who could cut off applicants it considers dubious. Last month, 160 House and Senate members urged the FCC to scrutinize recipients, in part because network construction takes time. “We fear that we will not know whether funds were improperly spent for years to come,” said the lawmakers.There is a “a need for proper upfront assessment,” Representative Jim Clyburn, of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat, said in an email. He said many applicants claim to be able to deliver faster service to new customers than they are delivering to current subscribers.Some of the bidders have promised ultra-fast gigabit speeds they haven’t offered before. Others missed earlier deadlines to build subsidized networks, or promised cut-rate network construction.The review falls to FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, who last year said the program was being pushed ahead too fast in a case of “rush-it-out-the-door electioneering” by the Republican chairman, Ajit Pai.Pai defended the timeline, saying while chairman that unserved Americans “cannot afford to wait” for service.Beginning in October, the FCC ran an auction to determine how to split the pot of rural money, which is funded by fees on consumer telephone bills. The agency designated discrete areas without service, and invited bids. The companies that offered to build broadband for the lowest price emerged as winners of subsidies.Winners announced in December included three that were promised more than $1 billion in subsidies: cable provider Charter Communications Inc., the Rural Electric Cooperative Consortium made up of 95 co-ops, and a company called LTD Broadband that was the top subsidy winner, claiming $1.3 billion for service in 15 states.Charter on Monday said it would use its $1.2 billion subsidy in a $5 billion project to deliver fast internet service to more than 1 million unserved homes and businesses across 24 states.LTD Broadband, which was founded in 2011, offers broadband distributed wirelessly from 2,100 tower sites in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota, according to its website. It said it will fulfill its obligations with fiber connections, which generally offer quicker speeds than wireless.“We have seen a lot of naysaying from competitors,” Corey Hauer, president of LTD Broadband, said in an email. “We take our obligation very seriously and will not disappoint the rural residents that have been waiting for broadband service.”SpaceX’s chosen locations include two slivers by the Harlem River in the Bronx. Other spots selected by SpaceX include the terminals at Newark Liberty International Airport and Miami International Airport, according to research by the policy group Free Press.“The FCC never should have allowed SpaceX to participate,” S. Derek Turner, research director for Free Press, said in an interview. “They will serve those customers who request service with or without the FCC subsidy.”Free Press calculated that $111 million of Starlink’s subsidy is due to urban deployments. More than $700 million of the overall $9.2 billion in subsidies was awarded for deploying broadband in non-rural areas, the policy group said.The FCC in announcing the results said the funding would bring broadband to more than 10 million rural Americans.It might be hard to enforce commitments to build networks, said Blair Levin, an analyst for New Street Research.“While there is evidence of a policy success,” the FCC “may have to clean up a variety of messes,” Levin said in a note(Updates with FCC comment in 10th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-broadband-space-subsidy-irks-070000411.html?.tsrc=rss

(NASDAQ: CHTR) is rolling out a multibillion-dollar initiative to deliver high-speed broadband access to more than 1 million unserved customer locations across 24 states. What Happened: Charter was awarded a contract through the Federal Communications Commission's the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) Phase I auction. Charter budgeted approximately $5 billion for the project, which will be offset by $1.2 billion in support won from the RDOF auction. The initiative is designed to reach mostly rural areas with 1 Gbps high-speed broadband access, with starting speeds of 200 Mbps. Charter said this new connectivity will enhance telemedicine, remote learning and work and other applications that rely on high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity. Charter is preparing to hire more than 2,000 employees and contractors to support this project, which will also expand the company's national network mileage coverage by 15%. Charter will also introduce its Spectrum product line of voice, television and mobile products to the business and residential customers in these markets. The company said its new customers will not be subject to data caps, modem fees or annual contracts. Why It's Important: ""The pandemic has further highlighted the need for broadband availability and adoption and Charter is committed to furthering its efforts as part of the comprehensive solution needed to address these challenges,"" Tom Rutledge, chairman and CEO of Charter Communications, said in a statement. ""As Americans across the country increasingly rely on broadband to work, learn, access health care and stay in touch with family and loved ones, bringing broadband access to more unserved areas should be a priority for all stakeholders."" Rutledge added that he's hopeful that more public-private initiatives could be created for ""expanding networks to unserved areas."" The markets being served in this initiative are located within Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. Charter in headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. Charter's Financials: Last week, Charter announced its customer base reached a total of 31.1 million residential and small and medium business customers by the end of 2020, with 1.9 million customers added last year. The company also announced fourth-quarter revenue of $12.6 billion, up by 7.3% year-over-year, which it attributed to a residential revenue growth of 5%, mobile revenue growth of 80.9% and advertising revenue growth of 43.9%. For calendar year 2020, Charter reported revenue of $48.1 billion, a 5.1% year-over-year increase, and an adjusted EBITDA of $18.5 billion, up 9.9% from the previous year.

2021-02-01	2021-02-01 13:51:23	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	A Look Into Charter Communications Debt	Shares of Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) fell by 5.28% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Charter Communications has. Charter Communications's Debt Based on Charter Communications's financial statement as of January 29, 2021, long-term debt is at $81.74 billion and current debt is at $1.01 billion, amounting to $82.75 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $998.00 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $81.75 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Charter Communications's $144.21 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.57. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Why Investors Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

Charter expects to invest approximately $5 billion to support its buildout initiative - offset by $1.2 billion in support won from the RDOF auction - expanding Charter's network to lower-density, mostly rural communities that do not have access to broadband service of at least 25/3 Mbps.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charter-communications-launches-multiyear-multibillion-130000841.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-29	2021-01-29 18:51:23	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	AT&T Stock: Money for Bits	AT&T (NYSE:T) bought DirecTv and Time Warner in the last decade, after becoming convinced that just moving bits was a bad business. Now, with 5G and the promise of the Machine Internet, bits are becoming a very good business. The question is whether T stock can make the turn. Source: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock AT&T opened for trade Jan. 29 at $28.80. It traded at over $38 before the pandemic but has only briefly breached $30 twice since it began. This is despite holding what should be prime pandemic assets in WarnerMedia’s TV and film studios, its program libraries and CNN. The company’s Jan. 27 earnings release saw it bringing in $10.1 billion in operating cash flow from $45.7 billion of revenue. But its past still haunts. It wrote off $15.5 billion from its “video business,” reporting a net loss of 75 cents/share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips T Stock and the Video Disaster While the numbers beat estimates, with analysts calling it a “good quarter,” shares only briefly touched $30 before returning to their pre-earnings price. At its current price, the company’s 51 cent/share dividend yields an incredible 7.14%. It’s now clear that former CEO Randall Stephenson buying DirecTv, and later, WarnerMedia, were among the biggest business mistakes of the 21st century. The 7 Safest Stocks to Start Off 2021 on the Right Foot DirecTv cost $67.5 billion, including the assumption of debt. AT&T recently sought bids on the asset, which came in at $15 billion. WarnerMedia cost $108.7 billion, again including debt. WarnerMedia revenue dropped 21% during the quarter, due to cord-cutting and less advertising. During the quarter AT&T also decided it will release future movies to its HBO Max streaming platform at the same time they go to theaters. This boosted subscriptions to 41.5 million, but fewer than half of current HBO subscribers eligible for the package signed up. The company eventually signed distribution deals with Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but the damage in the fourth quarter was evident. CEO John Stankey blamed COVID for the WarnerMedia troubles. He promised an ad-supported version of HBO Max will be launched in the second quarter. More Bits AT&T’s base business of moving bits did well. It added 800,000 net postpaid wireless customers during the quarter. Churn was just .76%. The company also added 273,000 new AT&T Fiber customers. The future isn’t all rosy. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) may have teamed up to buy a competitive 5G spectrum position, albeit at nosebleed prices. The results will be announced later this quarter. But AT&T already has its network assets operating. It had $2.1 billion in capital spending during the fourth quarter. New equipment will be expensive but it can be bolted onto the existing network, which is highly profitable. While most attention is focused on the “C-Band,” at around 4 GHz (WiFi runs at either 2.4 GHz or 5.5 GHz) 5G signals run in three different bands. These range from the old broadcasting spectrum at 450 MHz to former satellite spectrum at over 50 GHz. Peak data rates for a mature network can be as high as 20 Gbps down, 10 Gbps up, in each network cell, all of it subject to backhaul. This means 5G services can be run at either very short distances or very long ones, along with current cellular distances. It means backhaul, which AT&T has in abundance, becomes more important. It means new applications inside factories, homes, and cities, what I’ve called the Machine Internet, is on the way. The Bottom Line AT&T is burdened by its past mistakes. That’s why its stock is down and rivals stocks like T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) are up. But there are also opportunities ahead. If AT&T can bring its asset base to bear on them, huge profits can be won over the next decade. You can get a 7% return while you wait for that.

Charter sees customer growth slow, stock falls after earnings	"Charter Communications Inc. reported better-than-expected earnings and in-line revenue for its fourth quarter Friday morning, though the company added fewer customer relationships than it did a year earlier. Shares were off 4.5% in premarket trading. The company posted net income of $1.2 billion, or $6.05 a share, up from $714 million, or $3.28 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. That beat expectations for earnings per share of $4.83, according to FactSet. Charter generated revenue of $12.6 billion for the quarter, up from $11.7 billion a year earlier and roughly even with the FactSet consensus. The company said it added 216,000 residential internet customers during the fourth quarter, compared with 313,000 in the year-ago period. The drop in residential internet additions relative to a year earlier ""is a function of lower sales activity caused by adding 1.9 million residential Internet customers in the prior three quarters as well as lower market churn, resulting in fewer selling opportunities in the fourth quarter,"" the company said in its release. Residential video customers increased by 19,000, versus a decline of 484,000 in the prior fourth quarter. Charter's overall residential customer relationships increased by a net 167,000 in the quarter, compared with a 416,000 increase in the third quarter and compared with a 240,000 increase in the year-prior quarter. Charter shares have gained 14% over the past three months as the S&P 500 has risen 14%."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ae6e448a-b33a-3821-944f-fd97d1c676f8/charter-sees-customer-growth.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-04	2021-01-04 23:01:54	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	5G Airwave Bids Surge Past $76 Billion to Set Auction Record	(Bloomberg) -- Bidding in a 5G airwaves auction in the U.S. surged past $76.5 billion, fueled by a frenzied demand for capacity that could send carriers like Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. to the debt market to finance the tab.The auction run by the Federal Communications Commission started last month with a field of 57 potential bidders, including the third major wireless carrier, T-Mobile US Inc., and pay-TV providers such as Dish Network Corp., Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. Within days, the tally exceeded analysts’ estimates of $47 billion.“It blows all auctions away,” said Sasha Javid, chief operating officer of wireless data company BitPath. The previous top FCC airwaves auction attracted almost $45 billion in bids in 2015. The current sale of frequencies in the so-called C-band could approach $80 billion as bidding extends for another week or more, Javid said in an interview.The go-for-broke bidding underscores how crucial these midband frequencies are to companies trying to seize global leadership in emerging 5G technology. The airwaves are expected to drive a yearslong surge of profits when deployed for next-generation mobile devices, autonomous vehicles, health-care equipment and manufacturing facilities.“It’s great spectrum, there’s a lot of it, and it’s coming right as carriers are gearing up to get ready for 5G,” said Doug Brake, director of broadband and spectrum policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit research outfit.Verizon VersusWhile Verizon was expected to be the biggest bidder in the auction, the carrier may have run into a formidable counterbidder in T-Mobile, thanks to the financial backing of its controlling stockholder, Deutsche Telekom AG.“If you’re Verizon and you don’t get this spectrum, you’ve basically lost the race to 5G,” Javid said.With about $10 billion in additional cash from Deutsche Telekom, New Street Research says T-Mobile could be using the auction to build on an already-large holding of midband 2.5-gigahertz airwaves gained with the takeover of Sprint Corp. in April.T-Mobile already has “a powerful network advantage today, and they may extend it,” New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin wrote in a note Monday.Collectively, the largest bidders had about $70 billion in cash available at the beginning of the auction. But with the total already higher than that, companies like Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Dish and Comcast “may have to tap the bond market in early 2021,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Stephen Flynn wrote in a note Monday.In addition to the airwaves licenses, winning bidders also will pay an estimated $13 billion or more to current users of the airwaves, including satellite providers Intelsat SA and SES SA. The satellite companies will change their use of frequencies to make room for the 5G providers.(Update new bid total in first paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5g-airwave-bids-surge-past-230154070.html?.tsrc=rss

Source: Shutterstock
	
First up on this list of media stocks to buy is Cable One. This Arizona-based broadband provider offers internet, phone and cable TV services to over 950,000 customers in 21 states. The company is also active in both residential and business markets, working under its Sparklight and Clearwave brands.
Cable One is growing, both organically and through acquisitions. In its third-quarter earnings report, the company noted the closing of two recent acquisitions of regional telecommunications providers. CABO also posted big yearly gains. Those acquisitions helped boost residential customers by over 165,000 year-over-year (YOY) for a 26.7% gain. Revenue was also up 18.9% YOY.
Now CABO stock is up 51% year-to-date (YTD) in 2020 and up nearly 419% over the past five years. Finally, adding to its attraction, Cable One also pays investors a dividend. So, it’s clearly one of the better media stocks for investors focused on growth.

Charter (CHTR)

Charter is a broadband provider that operates in 41 states under the Spectrum Brand. With over 30 million residential and business customers, it’s one of the top three providers in the U.S. market. Demand for broadband access to internet and streaming video has helped CHTR stock achieve sustained growth. Shares are up nearly 35% YTD and 257% over the past five years.  
Additionally, the company’s push into mobile internet access is also paying off. In Q3, Charter added 363,000 new mobile lines for a total of 2.1 million. Mobile revenue growth was also up 91.8% YOY in Q3.
The Wall Street Journal is tracking 28 investment analysts who are covering the name. They give CHTR stock a consensus overweight rating and an average 12-month price target of $704. That offers a modest 7.5% upside. However, based on this year’s 35% gain, I suspect they are being conservative.


					The 7 Safest Stocks to Start Off 2021 on the Right Foot				

Right now, the pandemic has proven that broadband access is more important than ever. Moreover, Charter’s impressive mobile growth will also drive ongoing gains. That makes this pick one of the better media stocks to buy.

Dolby (DLB)

Dolby is one of those companies that is immediately identifiable as a key part of the media landscape. You see the name everywhere. But this company doesn’t generate content nor does it deliver it. Instead, Dolby is primarily focused on making content sound better.
Whenever you see the Dolby logo on a product — a TV, a soundbar, a home or car audio system, headphones, a game console or something else — the company is collecting a licensing fee. And when it comes to the pandemic, people stuck at home and streaming shows or playing video games want the experience to be as immersive as possible. As such, they’ve been snapping up soundbars with Dolby Atmos for three-dimensional surround audio.
While that’s been good for business, though, the company has also been feeling the negative effects of the pandemic, with many movie theaters closed. In fact, Covid-19 has caused an overall hit to Dolby this year. Revenue for 2020 was $1.16 billion, down about 6.5% from the $1.24 billion it made in 2019.
However, DLB stock has still posted an impressive gain of 41% YTD. Plus next year, with positives like a vaccine and the iPhone 12 now supporting Dolby Vision, there may still be upside for this media creation and consumption stock. Even if a theater recovery is already priced into the current value, five-year growth of 183% suggests this pick of the media stocks to buy is worth considering for its long-term prospects.

FuboTV (FUBO)

Have you heard of FuboTV? If not, think Netflix but for live sports. Now, you would imagine that during a pandemic year — when professional sports have been highly impacted — FUBO might be feeling some pain. Instead, it’s actually been the opposite.
In fact, sports-starved consumers are forking over their cash for FuboTV subscriptions. In Q2, the company reported that paid subscribers topped 286,000. That’s a 47% YOY increase. Additionally, revenue was up 53%. More specifically, advertising revenue posted a 71% gain year-over-year.
On top of that, as professional sports leagues slowly began to return to action, FUBO reaped further rewards recently. In Q3, it exceeded guidance and delivered one of its best quarters ever. Paid subscribers hit 455,000 while revenue of $62.1 million was up 47%. Advertising revenue grew by 153%.
FUBO stock was flat through most of 2020. However, the Q3 results kickstarted a rapid growth cycle. That increased as the company gained visibility and rumors began to swirl about it signing a deal for exclusive sports coverage. 


					9 Long-Term Stocks for the Next Decade				

So, after spending most of the year in the $10 range, FUBO stock took off in November. Now after a correction, it still stands at around 230% YTD growth at $29.30. Based on its pandemic performance, increased visibility and the possibility of an exclusive deal in the future, FUBO is one of those media stocks to buy that has big growth potential.

Liberty Broadband Series C (LBRDK)

Next on my list of media stocks to buy is Liberty Broadband, a name that owns or invests in a range of communications businesses. The company’s holdings include a 29% stake in the previously discussed Charter. It also owns 100% of both GCI — an Alaskan telecommunications provider — and Skyhook, a global mobile-positioning company. 
In its third quarter, Liberty Broadband reported revenue up just over 13%. What’s more, the pandemic has had relatively negligible adverse effects on its business:
“We are not presently aware of any events or circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that would require us to update our estimates or judgments or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities.”
Right now, LBRDK stock has had 26% growth so far in 2020. What’s more, analysts covering the stock have rated it as a consensus buy. Their median price target of $182 has 16% upside, showing confidence that this is one of the better media stocks to buy with a solid growth trajectory.

Netflix (NFLX)

You can’t talk about media stocks to buy in 2020 without mentioning the company that kicked off the video streaming era. Of course, Netflix has had some big positives this year, but it has also faced challenges that scared off some investors. 
The first two quarters of 2020 brought a surge in subscriber growth as pandemic lockdowns boosted demand for entertainment. That slowed in Q3, but the unexpected gains were still a big win for the year. They helped soothe fears that the dramatic increase in streaming competition would drag Netflix down. In addition, Netflix saw cash flow significantly improve in 2020. Right now, the company is approaching the point where it can finance its own productions without having to borrow money. That is a good sign for long-term sustainability.
After early gains and a roller-coaster summer and fall, NFLX stock is showing growth of nearly 67% YTD. You can’t argue with that kind of performance. Plus, currently NFLX is still well off its 52-week high. That makes it an even more attractive buy.

New York Times (NYT)

Last on this list of stocks is the old gray lady of media — the New York Times. Now, NYT may be the last company many people think of when it comes to media stocks to buy. Streaming video companies, sure. But a newspaper?
Here’s the thing. People still want to read the news –it’s just that they want to do it on their tablet, phone or laptop. Recognizing that trend, the New York Times is doing a far better job than most in transitioning to the digital world. More importantly, it’s doing a far better job of convincing people to pay for access. The news organization first launched a paywall in 2011.
Just in November, it also announced it had reached a significant milestone in digital transformation. For the first time ever, revenue from its digital subscribers surpassed revenue from print subscriptions. Those 7 million digital subscribers helped the company to double net income in the last quarter, even though advertising revenue continued to slowly slide.
Despite plummeting in the early 2000s as ad revenue fell and the future of newspapers was in doubt, NYT stock has been in growth mode for the past five years. Currently, it’s up 61% YTD. So, this name is well worth considering if you’re looking for a media stock that can survive and thrive in a rapidly transforming marketplace.

(NASDAQ: CHTR) is trading at $639.34, after a 1.07% decrease. Over the past month, the stock fell by 0.47%, but over the past year, it actually spiked by 34.42%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 6.22%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings. View more earnings on CHTRMost often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries. Charter Communications Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 52.61 of the Media industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. There are many limitations to price to earnings ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company.

2020-12-08	2020-12-08 23:52:15	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Trump FCC Pick Confirmed Over Democrats’ Objection	(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Senate on Tuesday confirmed President Donald Trump’s nominee to the Federal Communications Commission, potentially setting up a partisan deadlock that could leave the agency unable to advance President-elect Joe Biden’s policies.Nathan Simington, 41, a Commerce Department official, won approval by a party-line vote of 49-46 over the opposition of Democrats.Simington will replace Michael O’Rielly, a Republican FCC commissioner whose nomination was withdrawn after he criticized Trump’s plan to weaken legal protections for social media companies. Simington’s term is to run until July 2024.He will initially be part of a 3-to-2 Republican majority. But Republican Chairman Ajit Pai has announced he will depart the agency next month as Biden takes office, leaving four members.That would produce a 2-to-2 split along party lines until the Senate confirms a choice from Biden. Though Biden will have the authority to appoint a chairman from among the remaining commissioners, the body would be unable to advance initiatives that don’t have bipartisan support.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, urged lawmakers to reject Simington. Normally nominees advance in bipartisan pairs to ensure balance, but in this case “the Republican majority is rushing to approve a single Republican nominee,” Schumer said.Schumer called Simington “far from uncontroversial” and cited the nominee’s support of Trump’s efforts to weaken social media’s legal shield against liability for curating posted remarks.“What we will have at the FCC now is potential gridlock,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat. He said Biden promised to increase access to the internet, reinstate net neutrality rules that limit broadband providers, and renew a commitment to consumer protection.“This nomination threatens all those goals for a new administration,” Blumenthal said.Simington didn’t respond to messages seeking comment left at his office.Some conservatives back Simington in order to ensure deadlock. They oppose Democratic priorities such as increasing internet subsidies and restoring net neutrality rules that bar broadband providers from interfering with web traffic.Simington, a lawyer, had no previous government experience before June when he became a senior adviser at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a Commerce Department arm that advises the president on communications.Before that, he served as senior corporate counsel for Brightstar Corp., a wireless device services, logistics and insurance company, according to his resume as provided to the Senate.Simington told lawmakers at his Dec. 2 confirmation hearing that he prizes “regulatory stability” and said the FCC must be “thoughtful about potential chilling effects” from “intrusive, disruptive and burdensome” regulations.His nomination was supported by Charter Communications Inc. and CTIA, a trade group representing carriers including AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.“He has shown a keen recognition of the value of competition and private investment in securing U.S. leadership in broadband,” Meredith Attwell Baker, president of CTIA, said in an emailed statement Tuesday.NCTA-The Internet & Television Association, a trade group representing cable companies including large U.S. provider Comcast Corp., congratulated Simington.“We look forward to working with him and his colleagues to find creative solutions that will promote private sector investment and innovation rather than returning to obsolete regulatory models of the past that would only stifle broadband deployment,” Michael Powell, NCTA’s president, said in a statement.(Updates with reaction in last three paragraphs.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-fcc-pick-simington-confirmed-223403523.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-08	2020-12-08 00:11:18	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Opposition Grows to GOP Nominee Who Could Deadlock FCC	(Bloomberg) -- A rush to seat President Donald Trump’s nominee on the Federal Communications Commission is generating complaints by Democrats that it could tie up the agency in partisan deadlock, unable to advance President-elect Joe Biden’s policies.The Senate is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the appointment of Nathan Simington, who is opposed by Democrats. Simington was approved by the Commerce Committee on a party line vote.Simington, a Commerce Department official, would replace a sitting FCC commissioner whose term is expiring and would initially be part of a 3-to-2 Republican majority. But Republican Chairman Ajit Pai has announced he will depart the agency next month, leaving four members.That would leave an agency split 2-to-2 along party lines until the Senate confirms a choice from Biden. Though Biden will have the authority to appoint a chairman from among the remaining commissioners, the body would be unable to advance initiatives that don’t have bipartisan support.The vote would break a Senate norm of advancing nominees in bipartisan pairs so each party has reason to move forward, said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat.“The FCC should be truly an independent agency that serves the public interest,” Blumenthal said in a news conference Monday “Not a political football which is what Donald Trump is trying to make it.”Some conservatives are backing Simington in order to leave the commission in the 2-2 deadlock. They oppose Democratic priorities such as increasing internet subsidies and restoring net neutrality rules that bar broadband providers from interfering with web traffic.“Republicans should not underestimate the harm that a Democrat-led FCC could impose on the American economy during Biden’s first 100 days,” Grover Norquist, president of the policy group Americans for Tax Reform, said in a Dec. 1 letter to McConnell. Norquist said confirming Simington could “forestall billions in economic damage.”Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr has taken up the theme, telling Fox Business News on Dec. 2 that Simington’s arrival could “help forestall what really would be billions of dollars worth of economic damage.”A Republican-controlled Senate would lack incentive to approve a Biden nominee, said Blair Levin, an analyst with New Street Research.“The incentives to engage in the tactics of confrontation and polarization are far stronger than the incentives to compromise,” he wrote.A tie would bring about delays in policy making, uncertainty around mergers and “significantly greater political gamesmanship. In short, we think the FCC could become a lot more like Congress,” Levin said.The path to Democratic control would be eased if the party takes control of the Senate with victories in runoff elections in Georgia early next month.Simington has won support from Charter Communications Inc. and Meredith Attwell Baker, president of CTIA, a trade group representing carriers including AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. Simington helped to write a proposal that’s before the FCC to increase social media companies’ exposure to greater legal liability.David Popp, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said Monday he had no “additional guidance or announcements on the FCC beyond the Simington nomination.”(Updates with remarks from senator, beginning in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opposition-grows-gop-nominee-could-211853163.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-02	2020-12-02 22:07:40	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Fox News Is Holding More Cards Than Trump Realizes	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- President Donald Trump and a pair of fledging conservative news networks seem intent on taking down Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News. Do they have a shot?In the weeks since he lost his re-election bid, Trump has stepped up broadsides against his one-time channel of choice, goading followers to switch from Fox to the more MAGA-friendly alcoves of Newsmax TV and One America News Network. Both have been more willing to hawk the president’s spurious claims of voter fraud, which at Fox are relegated to its nighttime opinion shows — and even there are beginning to fade. For Newsmax and OAN, hitching their wagon to the reality-TV star, even as he’s set to leave the White House, has given them the best chance at pillaging Fox’s ratings and springing from obscurity.Christopher Ruddy, Newsmax’s CEO and majority owner, is clearly enjoying the sudden attention on his business, giving interviews in the last few weeks to CNN, CNBC, the Daily Beast, the New Yorker and Variety and making swipes at Fox along the way. He’s right about one thing: Fox can’t keep up its clashing interests. It can’t be taken seriously as a journalistic operation while at the same time cozying up to the conservative fringes and peddling conspiracy theories. And now places like Newsmax are doing the latter part better. Trump’s loss has effectively put Fox at a crossroads.But whether Newsmax or OAN will seriously dent the No. 1 primetime cable-TV network or remain kooky wannabes depends on several unpredictable factors, including how politically relevant the Trump family is after 2020 and whether it forms its own media brand, further fragmenting that corner of the industry.There’s also one wall Trump helped build that offers Fox immense protection: its profit parapet. Fox Corp., the $18 billion parent company, depends on the Fox News and Business channels for the overwhelming majority of its income. Michael Nathanson, an analyst for MoffettNathanson LLC, pegs it at more than 80%. And most of that comes from affiliate fees, which are the contractually obligated payments cable providers make to be able to offer channels such as Fox on their TV packages. The key word is contract; these agreements last years, often five to seven. In August, Fox said it had renewed 70% of the previous year’s affiliate revenue, and only about 5% is up for renegotiation in each of the next two years. That means Fox has its biggest source of profits locked in for quite a while at favorable rates even as U.S. households continue cutting the cord. So even if a chunk of viewers tune out of Fox, the business may be relatively safe. Meanwhile, OAN isn’t even carried on packages offered by Charter Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. or Dish Network Corp. And AT&T Inc.’s DirecTV, which does carry it, is rapidly losing customers as the company shifts its focus to streaming and 5G. Newsmax — where Sean Spicer and Diamond and Silk have their own shows — is more widely distributed and perhaps more of a threat. Fox News’s primetime viewership dropped 29% in the three weeks after the election, while Newsmax posted an average of 370,000 nightly viewers — a 277% boost, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. CNN and MSNBC had increases as well. And yet, Fox’s audience still dwarfs them all. As long as that’s true, cable packages will need to pay what they must to keep it.Fox will be “the last company standing in linear because of their news and broadcast sports businesses,” Nathanson said in a phone interview. Cable is “going to melt down to a smaller universe where Fox and other news networks get paid more as a percentage of the bundle than they do now.” Even if a network like Newsmax were to steal 20% of Fox’s audience by 2024, Nathanson said that would reduce his Ebitda estimate by only $200 million, which isn’t enough to alter his bullish view on the stock. It’s cheap relative to shares of other media companies:Rather than a traditional cable network, Trump is said to be considering the cheaper route of creating a streaming-video subscription similar to Fox Nation, according to Axios. But there are serious doubts about his ability to run a successful media company. It’s one reason Newsmax may be better off hiring Trump than selling to him. (Ruddy has said Newsmax won’t be rebranded as “Trump TV” but called the idea of a Trump talk show “terrific.”) As for Fox, trying to compete directly with Trump over his own base could prove futile. Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan suggests that instead Fox up its journalistic standards as a right-leaning, but reputable, news channel. That could help it draw more moderate young people into its orbit. Then again, that demographic is quickly moving to the streaming world. In fact, Fox needs to do something about the fact that almost 60% of its audience is over the age of 65. Becoming the unofficial Trump network didn’t help it there. Fox did say Wednesday, citing Nielsen, that primetime viewership among ages 25 to 54 surged 97% in November from a year earlier. Yet even if it distances from Trump, it may be hard to disentangle the brand from the man. (The final paragraph was updated to add Nielsen data released by Fox on Wednesday.)This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-11-03	2020-11-03 13:37:31	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	The Real Reason Fox News Needs Trump to Win	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Fox News needs Donald Trump to win — but not for the reason you think.  A press release landed in media reporters’ inboxes last week: “Fox News Channel Earns Highest-Rated Primetime Monthly Average in the History of Cable Led by Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Carlson, Fox’s biggest moneymaker, drew more than 5 million viewers on average to his show last month, with Sean Hannity’s program close behind. Ratings for Fox News overall surged 43% during the third quarter from a year earlier as it moderated the first U.S. presidential debate and covered the race — and the many controversies surrounding it — in its own Fox way. Stirring outrage among an ever-loyal audience of President Donald Trump’s supporters has worked for Fox these last four years, but the election result could make or break the next four, or longer.Fox’s continued dominance is all but ensured if Trump wins again as they both fight the same perceived enemy, the “radical left.” But should Democrat and former Vice President Joe Biden be elected, as polling predicts, Fox may face a new, genuine adversary: Trump TV.There is no such cable network or streaming service yet, but it seems to be the most obvious way for Trump to keep capitalizing on MAGA mania outside the White House in the best way he knows how. A round-the-clock Trump channel — well, an official one — would easily threaten Fox’s ratings supremacy. While Rupert Murdoch’s news networks and the Trump administration have enjoyed a cozy relationship, the president has already started turning his followers against Fox for not being pro-Trump enough:Trump TV wouldn’t even necessarily have to start from scratch. One America News Network — described by my Bloomberg News colleagues in their recent profile of the company as a “24/7 Trump boat parade” — may be ripe for a Trump takeover or partnership. The network makes Fox look almost moderate. It’s willing to go further than Fox in peddling conspiracy theories and pushing controversial far-right viewpoints, much to Trump’s liking. According to a Wall Street Journal article in January, OAN received an overture from Hicks Equity Partners, which is owned by a family with close ties to Donald Trump Jr.If Trump were to shift from ratings driver to business foe, it could damage Fox’s parent, Fox Corp. By positioning itself as the anti-media network, Fox has separated itself from the crowd of mainstream news networks. That said, Fox’s audience skews old — it’s your parents’ news channel. And it has so deeply embraced Trump that it has inspired in viewers greater allegiance to him than to its own network. If Trump emerges as Fox’s first true competitor and he comes for its large base of cable-loving retirees, what then?Fox’s growth would have to come from appealing to younger voters who lean more liberal (but who advertisers would much like to reach). That would entail a bigger digital push as young consumers ditch cable TV. The country’s four biggest pay-TV service providers — AT&T Inc., Charter Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Dish Network Corp. — together lost about 3.4 million subscribers in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, online streaming use surged 57% in North America last quarter, according to Conviva. Social media has become the news hub for millennials and Gen Z, and while important context and nuance is often missing from online meme-speak, it’s a language in which Trump is fluent.Fox has tiptoed into streaming with its direct-to-consumer Fox Nation on-demand app and its $445 million acquisition of Tubi in April. But make no mistake, the business still depends on cable’s profits and aging demographics. The same can be said for Comcast’s MSNBC and, to a slightly lesser extent, AT&T’s CNN, but neither faces the immediate threat that a social-media-savvy, Trump-branded network would pose to Fox. The company reported quarterly results Tuesday that beat analysts’ estimates. That lifted its shares about 4% in early trading on Election Day, even though that outcome is far more important to Fox’s stock price going forward than its latest business report card.At stake is a 67% cash flow margin and $16 billion of shareholder money, much of which makes up the Murdoch fortune. It was just last year that the elder Murdoch and his son Lachlan, the company’s CEO, sold Fox’s Hollywood studios, entertainment networks and popular TV and film franchises to Walt Disney Co. for some $85 billion, including debt. Murdoch saw that the industry was heading toward the less profitable future of streaming and wanted out. Focusing solely on news and sports, as the anchor tenants of the lucrative cable-TV bundle, seemed like the safer bet — before Covid-19 at least. Trump — along with this family — always seemed to want fame more than the presidency. If he loses, the real loser is Fox News. It will be interesting to see how that plays out, but investors already know what happened to Dr. Frankenstein.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-11-02	2020-11-02 07:38:02	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Weekly Stock List	Our rating on the Communication Services sector is Over-Weight. While existing pressures on the sector continue, including assaults by regulators on social media companies and intense competition among telecom companies, these concerns have been superseded by COVID-19. In this &quot;barbell&quot; sector, telco giants Verizon and AT&T are now apparent islands of relative stability and secure income. Simultaneously, internet giants Alphabet and Facebook are acting as forums for community concerns about the coronavirus. The style mix of the sector is approximately one-third &quot;value&quot; and two-thirds &quot;growth.&quot; The adjusted pro-forma beta is approximately 1.0 (like the old Telecoms), while the yield is 0.9% (reflecting the impact of Google and Facebook).  The smoothed growth rate is 7% and the P/E ratio is 21-times. The sector accounts for 11% of the S&P 500. We think investors should consider allocating 12%- 14% of their diversified Portfolios to the sector. Here are some of our top picks.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/eb1db187-9901-38ac-ae49-b85c510c395b/weekly-stock-list.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-11-02	2020-11-02 03:08:21	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Stonepeak to Buy TPG’s Cable Unit Astound for $8.1 Billion	(Bloomberg) -- Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners said it would acquire Astound, the sixth-largest U.S. cable and broadband provider, from private equity firm TPG for $8.1 billion including debt.TPG is selling the company, which serves over a million customers under the brands RCN, Grande, Wave and enTouch, after it built it up through a series of acquisitions starting in 2016.“We are very eager and excited to partner with a premier investor such as Stonepeak to further accelerate our growth and take our companies to new levels of customer satisfaction and performance,” Astound Chief Executive Officer Jim Holanda said in a statement that confirmed an earlier Bloomberg News report.Holanda and the rest of his management team at Patriot Media will keep running Princeton, New Jersey-based Astound after the second quarter, when the deal is expected to close.Though U.S. consumers are shedding pay-TV bundles, high-speed internet service is more prized than ever. That’s led cable companies to increasingly focus on that side of the business -- especially during the pandemic.That strategy has paid off during the Covid-19 pandemic this year as internet subscriber growth has soared among the big cable operators, thanks partly to many people needing high-speed connections to work and learn from home.Comcast Corp., the market leader, added 633,000 internet subscribers last quarter, a 67% jump. Charter Communications Inc., the second-largest cable company, had 537,000 new customers during the period, a gain of 41%.The industry has been consolidating over the decades, leaving just a few cable giants — Comcast, Charter, Cox and Altice USA — to compete with telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon. Astound is a rival to these larger players in cities such as Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Washington.An $8 billion deal would value Astound at almost $8,000 per broadband subscriber, Bloomberg Intelligence estimated in September. That would put it in the same range as Charter.Stonepeak swoops inStonepeak preempted a competitive auction that was supposed to conclude later this month, according to people familiar with the matter. It beat out a consortium of I Squared Capital and Blackstone Group, the people added. Blackstone declined to comment, while I Squared’s representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Stonepeak, which specializes in infrastructure investments, is partway through raising a $10 billion fourth fund, and had amassed $6.2 billion for a first close in June, Bloomberg reported at the time. Trent Vichie, a co-founder of Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, is exiting the firm, Bloomberg News reported last month.Vichie and Mike Dorrell founded Stonepeak in 2011 after previously heading Blackstone Group Inc.’s infrastructure business and working together at Macquarie Group Ltd.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley advised Astound while Bank of America Corp. and Lazard Ltd. advised Stonepeak.(Updates 10th paragraph to say Blackstone declined to comment.

2020-09-02	2020-09-02 22:12:02	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Cogeco’s Majority Investor Spurns Altice’s $7.8 Billion Bid	(Bloomberg) -- Cogeco Inc.’s controlling family spurned a plan by Altice USA to acquire the business for $7.8 billion -- a deal that would let it obtain the Canadian cable company’s U.S. assets and sell the rest to Rogers Communications Inc.Gestion Audem, the Audet family’s holding company, doesn’t intend to sell its shares and rejects the proposal, Cogeco said on Wednesday. Independent board members also shot down the unsolicited offer. Altice USA had said earlier in the day that it would pay $3.6 billion for the U.S. assets, which consist of Atlantic Broadband, the ninth-largest U.S. cable operator.The response deals a setback to a potential deal, though perhaps not a death blow. Investors and analysts seem confident that a transaction could go through -- if the terms are right -- and shares of Cogeco maintained much of their gains on Wednesday. The Audet family holds 69% of voting rights at the Montreal-based company.“The family takes pride in its stewardship role,” Louis Audet, president of Gestion Audem, said in a statement turning down the proposal.Altice’s offer is “fair as a first bid,” Desjardins analyst Maher Yaghi said in a report. But there is meaningful risk that the Audet family won’t go along with any deal. The Quebec government also may push back, especially since the province is resistant to having one of its companies fall into outside ownership.Cogeco shares had their biggest intraday gain ever on news of the takeover bid, soaring as much as 34% to C$106 in Toronto trading. Later in the day -- after the Audets voiced their opposition -- the shares were still up 17%. Altice USA rose as much as 5.9% to $29.30 in New York.Altice’s offer includes $612 million to the Audet family for their ownership interest.By offering to buy Atlantic Broadband, Altice USA has gone after one of the few remaining cable companies with any scale in a heavily consolidated U.S. market. Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc., the two largest U.S. cable companies, are much larger than Altice. The third-biggest, Cox Communications Inc., is controlled by the Cox family, complicating any potential acquisitions.The potential Cogeco deal would give Altice 1.1 million new customers in 11 states.“If they can get it for anything like their offer price, it would be a great addition,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC. “It would help diversify away from the low-growth New York area Optimum business, and would give them a longer runway for broadband growth and consolidated margin expansion.”Dealmaking ReturnThe Cogeco offer represents a return to dealmaking for Altice, controlled by billionaire Patrick Drahi. He swooped into the market with the acquisitions of Suddenlink in 2015 and Cablevision in 2016 with a plan to create another cable giant in the U.S. but had gone quiet after his European business struggled.Debts of more than $30 billion built up in the French-Israeli businessman’s global M&A push have become less of a concern to investors since a phone-industry price war eased in France and the business stopped losing customers to rivals.Drahi’s confidence was on display more than ever last year when he shook up the art world by acquiring iconic auction house Sotheby’s. His European media business has been hit hard by an ad-revenue slump during the coronavirus lockdowns, though recent investments in top-flight soccer are helping to keep subscribers loyal.Altice USA, meanwhile, has seen its internet subscribers continue to grow, especially this year as Americans work and learn online during the pandemic. That growth has helped offset the loss of video subscribers as consumers drop traditional TV for newer streaming services. Like its peers, Altice USA has also begun selling mobile-phone service.Family BusinessAt Cogeco, Louis Audet served as chief executive officer of the family business for 25 years before becoming chairman in 2018. His late father, Henri, founded the company in 1957 with one television station in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec. The company went public in 1993 and bought Cabovisao-Televisao Por Cabo SA in Portugal in 2006. After six years of struggling to turn a consistent profit in Europe, Cogeco sold Cabovisao to Luxembourg-based Altice.Cogeco has looked to the U.S. market for growth in recent years, acquiring Quincy, Massachusetts-based Atlantic Broadband, which operates cable systems in Pennsylvania, Florida, Maryland, Delaware and South Carolina, in 2012. It announced a $1.4 billion deal to buy Pennsylvania-based MetroCast in 2017.Beyond the Audet family’s response, a big question mark for the Rogers part of the deal will be how willing the French-speaking province of Quebec is to allow a sale of a homegrown communications company. History suggests there could be pushback. In 2000, Quebecor Inc. and pension fund Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec helped circumvent a bid by Rogers to acquire Quebec-based cable operator Groupe Videotron.If talks ultimately do move forward, other suitors might emerge, said Philip Cusick at JPMorgan Chase & Co.“This could be the beginning of a negotiation, rather than an outright no,” he said. “We would also not be surprised to see other cable companies interested in the company -- Charter and Cable One have not been shy about their desire to acquire more cable.”(Updates with comment from Louis Audet in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/altice-usa-offers-7-8-135324869.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-17	2020-08-17 13:00:01	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Covid-19 Builds Suspense for the Fall TV Lineup	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Somewhere in a desert, a group of young, swimsuit-clad singles have spent their summer trying to find love in the time of Covid — or at least score some cash and a little fame. They are the latest contestants on CBS’s “Love Island,” an American take on the saucy British reality-TV show of the same name — a name that implies anything but social distancing. They’re also a long way from any islands. Season one was filmed in the tropical oasis of Fiji, but because of the virus, this latest group has instead found itself under strict quarantine in a hotel on the Las Vegas strip. The crystal waters and soothing scent of an ocean zephyr have most likely been replaced by pool water and the unmistakable sting of fresh ethanol or bleach. Nothing takes romance out of the air quite like a nasal swab, but this is what it takes to film during a public-health crisis. The show must go on.The lengths to which ViacomCBS Inc. has gone to safely deliver new seasons of both “Love Island” and “Big Brother” to stir-crazy viewers highlight the challenges facing TV networks this year. “Love Island” premieres next week, while “Big Brother” returned to air earlier this month. “Big Brother” host Julie Chen Moonves, in a recent interview with a CBS station, described flying that show’s 16 contestants to Los Angeles so they could each isolate for weeks while being tested regularly before entering the so-called “Big Brother” house; some tested positive for Covid and were sent packing.On the spectrum of difficulty of filming during a pandemic, reality-TV shows such as these — along with animated series — have perhaps the fewest hurdles. After all, the contestants are usually sequestered anyway. “We were the original quarantine,” as Chen Moonves put it. But scripted series often require a larger, rotating cast and crew to travel and be on set without the ability to remain in constant quarantine. This is partly why studios are struggling to get back up and running as the virus continues its spread. Sports leagues are facing similar setbacks, with the Big Ten and Pac-12 college athletic conferences postponing fall sports, including football. Indeed, it would appear that the fall television season is destined to go the way of everything else in 2020.September traditionally marks the start of the most important TV season as children head back to school and families cozy up indoors in the evenings with a good show. Because so much of the industry focus up to this point this year has been on new streaming-video apps, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that traditional live TV remains the lifeblood of companies such as Comcast Corp.’s NBC, Fox Corp., Walt Disney Co. and ViacomCBS. The implications of a light or delayed programming season will be far-reaching for the industry, which is already grappling with an exodus of cable-TV subscribers, the evaporation of advertiser demand, a closed box office, a content drought for new streaming-video services and a legal quagmire created by the cacophony of safety issues surrounding TV and film productions.Each year the industry showcases its fall lineup during the spring “upfront” presentations to marketers, which then reserve their advertising slots. But the uncertainty of 2020 has kept many on the sidelines waiting to see what networks come up with this summer as filming slowly begins to resume. The November U.S. presidential election at least ensures revenue from political advertisements; however, live sports broadcasts can’t promise to be the traditional big payday.Networks are having to get creative — both in how they film and where they find content to fill any prime-time holes. The season may also have to start a bit later than usual, with new programs carefully spaced out. At Fox, the company scrapped season 17 of “So You Think You Can Dance” and made the unusual move to pad its September schedule with “L.A.’s Finest,” a detective drama that originally aired on Spectrum, a cable service owned by Charter Communications Inc. Fox also has two series that were finished before the pandemic. “Filthy Rich,” a satirical drama starring Kim Cattrall as a conservative Oprah-like figure, was supposed to arrive last fall and will now premiere Sept. 21. And “NeXt,” a psychological thriller about artificial intelligence gone rogue, headlined by John Slattery, arrives Oct. 6. Even as Fox cameras begin rolling, CEO Lachlan Murdoch recently told nonproduction employees that they’ll keep working from home for the rest of the year. Murdoch also said on an Aug. 4 earnings call that he’s confident the National Football League will come back in the fall — then again, he thought the same thing about college football. (Fox airs Thursday night and Sunday NFL games.)The explosive hit “This Is Us” is still on NBC’s fall schedule, though it hasn’t disclosed a specific premiere date. Actress Mandy Moore told “The Today Show” that they would normally begin filming right after July 4, but as of last month they hadn’t begun yet. In a virtual roundtable held by California Governor Gavin Newsom and members of the entertainment industry in May, Moore’s “This Is Us” castmate Jon Huertas described the hyper-vigilance that would be needed on set as “daunting.”“Emotionally, of course, we all want to get back to work,” he said. “But also the actor is going to be the least protected person on set. We can’t film with PPE on.” (PPE refers to personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves.) As far as NBC’s other programs, the singing competition “The Voice” reportedly won’t be ready in time and its Monday slot is being filled by “American Ninja Warrior,” according to Deadline. Murdoch said earlier this month he “remained hopeful” that Fox’s “The Masked Singer” would still air in the fall.A disappointing fall lineup and continuing recession will drive more consumers to ditch cable packages in favor of cheaper streaming substitutes. Still, they won’t find much consolation because those services are just as affected by the programming shortage. Netflix Inc.’s relatively full library has made it a notable exception because the company’s long production lead time has secured a bigger backlog. Companies such as AT&T Inc.’s WarnerMedia and Comcast’s NBC have responded by shaking up their leadership ranks and cutting staff as they redirect resources to streaming initiatives. Disney also lost its top streaming executive to TikTok.Reduce, reuse, recycle is now the theme of the content wars. “Mulan,” which was set to be one of Disney’s biggest box-office hits of the year, is instead going to debut on the Disney+ app Sept. 4 at the same time it arrives in theaters, or at least any that have reopened by then. Disney+ subscribers, who already pay $7 a month, will have to cough up an additional $30 to stream the movie. Savings bundles reminiscent of the cable-TV era are also making a comeback, with Apple Inc. introducing one for Apple TV+ and Viacom’s CBS All Access and Showtime services.For media giants, this fall TV season is about making lemonade from lemons. The takeaway for consumers: Slow down or there won’t be much left on your watchlist other than low-grade reality dating shows and cop dramas. Then again, the election promises to deliver plenty of gripping material on the nightly news. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-08-11	2020-08-11 20:56:57	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	SoftBank Is Targeting Over $10 Billion in Public Investing	(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. is targeting investments of more than $10 billion in public stocks as part of a new asset management arm, far exceeding the initial holdings that founder Masayoshi Son outlined to shareholders on Tuesday, people familiar with the initiative said.The tally could reach into the tens of billions, said one of the people, all of whom asked not to be identified because the plans are private.Son, the chief executive officer, unveiled the investment arm in a conference call to discuss earnings on Tuesday. He said the unit has about $555 million in capital. However, the amount is seen as a placeholder, people familiar with the project said; 555 is slang in Japanese gaming culture meaning “go, go, go.”The asset management team is led by Akshay Naheta, a senior vice president in Abu Dhabi, the people said. The group has been quietly amassing multibillion-dollar stakes in American Big Tech companies over the past few months, the people said.On Tuesday, Son said SoftBank had acquired holdings in some of the so-called FAANG stocks. FAANG refers to a group of five large tech companies: Facebook Inc., Amazon Inc., Apple Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google, whose parent company is Alphabet Inc.The Japanese company didn’t disclose the size of these positions. The investments were made using financing structures that can prevent SoftBank from showing up in public records as a direct shareholder, said the people familiar with the initiative.A representative for SoftBank declined to comment. “As an investment company, we need to explore various angles and scope. But our focus is still on companies driving the information revolution,” Son said during the earnings presentation. “This is the purpose of our company.”In recent years, SoftBank has painted itself as a champion of innovative startups, led by its $100 billion Vision Fund. That strategy faltered after WeWork and several other high-profile flameouts. But SoftBank’s dealings with public stocks have notched some wins over the past three years. It profited from investments Charter Communications Inc. in early 2018 and in U.S. chip designer Nvidia Corp., which was worth 398 billion yen when it was sold last year.Less successful was a complicated investment in the now-infamous German payments company Wirecard. The bet profited select SoftBank employees and sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, an investor in the Vision Fund, but the collapse of Wirecard in recent months caused analysts to question the nature of the investment.The development of a public-equities vehicle was driven partly by a long-held desire by various executives at SoftBank to pursue asset management. Following its $3.3 billion takeover of alternative-asset manager Fortress Investment Group LLC, SoftBank also considered buying a stake in Swiss Re, the world’s second-biggest reinsurer.SoftBank is in the process of offloading 4.5 trillion yen in legacy assets, including stock in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., T-Mobile US Inc. and its domestic telecom unit. Some of the capital raised will fund the asset management arm, the people said. SoftBank said it will own 67% of the asset management group, and Son will personally own the rest.The new unit reflects the revived ambitions of Son. The founder had said in May that SoftBank was unlikely to secure outside investors for a second Vision Fund after problems with the first. But in the upbeat financial results Tuesday, Son expressed readiness to accelerate a companywide shift from telecom to investing. “Our strategy hasn’t changed,” Son said. “We still plan on unicorn hunting with Vision Fund two, three and so on.”SoftBank’s investments in FAANG stocks are buoyed by a tech rally in the market. Uber Technologies Inc. rebounded 11% last quarter after tumbling in the first and is now trading at close to the $33 price SoftBank paid in early 2018. The performance gives a strong boost to the Vision Fund portfolio, which is heavily weighted toward ride-hailing companies, also including Didi Chuxing in China, Grab in Southeast Asia and Ola in India.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-targeting-over-10-billion-205657116.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-10	2020-08-10 08:00:00	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Charter Gets a Little Help From Its Friends In Bid to Raise Fees	(Bloomberg) -- Charter Communications Inc. has won support from an unlikely roster of organizations as it seeks permission to increase fees for customers that use a lot of data.The Boys & Girls Club of Harlem, for example.The New York youth organization is among scores of civic and local-business groups that have received charitable donations from the company, and have reciprocated by filing statements on Charter’s behalf with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Others include a non-profit theater in Honolulu, civil rights organizers in Los Angeles, an African America museum in South Dallas, and a car dealership in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.“They’re a supporter of us. We support them,” Dominique Jones, executive director of the Harlem youth club, said in an interview.The groups say the nation’s second-largest cable provider has won their support by being a good source of jobs and philanthropy in their communities. In its July 15 filing, the Boys & Girls club said it is “happy to support Charter” and mentioned a $35,000 grant it received to help with computer literacy.Charter’s petition to the FCC asks for freedom to charge subscribers more for high data consumption, as well as to demand fees from online video providers such as Netflix Inc. The company agreed in 2016 not to do that for at least seven years when it won the FCC’s approval for a $55 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc.The deal catapulted Stamford, Connecticut-based Charter from a regional player to a colossus with customers in New York and Los Angeles. Charter wants to be released from the conditions next May, at the five-year mark of its merger, rather than waiting until 2023.Opponents say charging extra would be doubly self-serving: deterring the streaming of video from Netflix and other companies, and shunting viewers toward Charter’s in-house offerings. Charter calls the change a housekeeping measure and says it has no plans to impose the changes on customers but wants the freedom to adjust in a market that can change rapidly.Corporate BattleThe use of community groups to burnish a campaign isn’t uncommon in Washington, where corporations wage battles for the ear -- and sympathy -- of regulators.When asked by Bloomberg News about a letter filed July 20, the Niagara Falls Boys & Girls club, which got $5,000 from Charter for a summer camp, backed away from its support for the measure Charter is seeking from the FCC.The letter the club submitted was prepared by Charter and “upon closer review, the last paragraph of the letter states that we support” Charter’s request, Rebecca Vincheski, chief executive officer of the club, said in an email. The club has “a position of neutrality on this important community issue,” Vincheski said.Enterprise Florida, the state’s main business development group, wrote to call for “full and fair consideration” of Charter’s request. In the filing, President Jamal Sowell cited 8,000 Charter workers in Florida, and grants from the company of $57,500 to groups including non-profits working on digital literacy.Florida GovernorEnterprise Florida’s chairman is Ron DeSantis, the state’s Republican governor. Charter gave his political action committee, Friends of Ron DeSantis, contributions of $25,000 on June 13, 2019, and $25,000 on Dec. 11, 2019, according to Florida state’s online records. Enterprise Florida didn’t respond to emailed questions.Competitors and consumer groups have urged the FCC to reject Charter’s request.“Promises made must be promises kept,” said Chip Pickering, chief executive officer of the Incompas trade group, whose members include Netflix, Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. “Charter has the power to slow, throttle and stifle new creative content from online and streaming choices.”An advocacy group called Stop the Cap! that focuses on broadband issues has campaigned on line against Charter’s request, and it said more than 700 people wrote the FCC insisting the company not get its way. “We are VERY disappointed in nonprofit groups receiving $ and equipment from Charter Spectrum that turn around and lobby the FCC in favor of data caps,” Stop the Cap! tweeted. Changed CircumstancesCharter’s June 17 petition seeking the changes cited changed circumstances. It pointed out a trend of recent years: appetite for online mini-series and movies is flourishing, while cable providers suffer a steady exodus of video customers. Online services are “thriving and growing at an unprecedented rate,” showing they don’t need the protections afforded by the conditions, the company said.Other TV providers have data caps and can charge for connecting to their networks, without ill effect on consumers, Charter said in its petition.“We wanted to put ourselves, from an opportunity perspective, on the same even playing field as all of our competitors,” Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge told investors on July 31. “But we don’t have any change in business strategy or marketing strategy or product strategy as a result.”There’s been another change, too: the FCC now is led by Chairman Ajit Pai -- a Republican who voted against the merger to express his distaste for the restrictions written by Democrats who were running the FCC in 2016.The agency took comments on the issue through Aug. 6. FCC spokeswoman Anne Veigle declined to comment.Charter is grateful for the comments submitted on its behalf to the FCC, Avery Boggs, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an emailed statement.“Our business is inherently local and we are committed to improving the communities we serve and impacting lives where our customers and employees live and work,” Boggs said. “These efforts include long-term relationships with local leaders and philanthropies.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charter-gets-little-help-friends-080000563.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-03	2020-08-03 13:31:06	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	A Look Into Charter Communications' Debt	Shares of Charter Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR) moved higher by 12.79% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Charter Communications has.Charter Communications's Debt According to the Charter Communications's most recent financial statement as reported on July 31, 2020, total debt is at $78.37 billion, with $77.66 billion in long-term debt and $706.00 million in current debt. Adjusting for $2.10 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $76.27 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Charter Communications's $145.14 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.54. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday  * Earnings Scheduled For July 31, 2020  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-31	2020-07-31 15:20:55	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Stocks Mixed as Energy Selloff Offsets Tech Rally: Markets Wrap	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks were mixed as losses in giant oil producers offset smashing earnings from some of the world’s biggest technology companies.Energy shares led declines in the S&P 500 as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. posted their worst losses in a generation after the outbreak and a global crude glut combined to batter almost every part of their businesses. The Nasdaq 100 outperformed as results from Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. showed the industry is thriving in a pandemic that has increased dependence on their products and services.Read: Apple Value Swells By $100 Billion as Analysts Cheer ResultsSome other corporate highlights:Caterpillar Inc.’s cost cuts helped it make up for slowing sales, but concern of second waves of the coronavirus weighed on the prospects for the rest of the year.Gilead Sciences Inc.’s “remdesivir guidance is hard to believe,” a Raymond James analyst said after the biotech company raised its forecast.Pinterest Inc. said revenue in July jumped as advertisers and users returned to the social-sharing service.Under Armour Inc. reported revenue that beat the highest analyst estimate.Charter Communications Inc. posted a surprising gain in TV and internet customers despite the ongoing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.The S&P 500 headed toward a fourth month of gains, with tech shares continuing to lead the advance in 2020. Their results are a validation for bulls who have bet the industry would emerge from the pandemic stronger than the rest of the market. Since the bottom in March, the Nasdaq 100 has added about $4 trillion in market value. It’s poised to beat the benchmark gauge for a 10th straight month -- the longest winning streak in 20 years, thanks to solid balance sheets and products that cater to social distancing.On the economic front, U.S. consumer sentiment extended its slide in late July as the resurgent coronavirus led to renewed business closings and layoffs, adding to signs the economic recovery is stalling. Besides the climb in virus cases, the decline in optimism highlights the precarious state of consumer finances, with lawmakers failing to reach agreement on extending the $600 in extra federal jobless benefits that have propped up incomes and spending.“With the impact of past stimulus measures fading and given some evidence that the global recovery has already stalled, it remains to be seen what will help keep global stock markets elevated in the coming months, especially U.S. stocks,” said Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at ThinkMarkets. “There is a risk we may see a correction in August, although it doesn’t have to be as severe as the one we saw in March, for things have since improved and monetary conditions are even more accommodative.”Shares of Apple jumped to a record high on Friday after the iPhone maker reported better-than-expected results for the fiscal third quarter and analysts raised their price targets. The momentum pushed the stock through the upper limit of its trading envelope -- a technical measure built around moving price averages -- signaling a pullback may be due, which has been the case with recent breaches.However, those shifts occurred with the stock trading “overbought” and with sell signals generated by its GTI Global Strength Indicator -- a measure of upward and downward movements of successive closing prices.These are some of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 rose 0.1% as of 11:20 a.m. New York time.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index decreased 0.3%.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dipped 1.4%.CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index increased 0.1%.The euro fell 0.1% to $1.1834.The Japanese yen depreciated 0.9% to 105.70 per dollar.BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was unchanged at 0.55%.Germany’s 10-year yield rose one basis point to -0.53%.Britain’s 10-year yield gained one basis point to 0.099%.CommoditiesThe Bloomberg Commodity Index increased 0.5%.West Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.1% to $39.97 a barrel.Gold strengthened 0.5% to $1,966.80 an ounce.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asia-stocks-open-mixed-tech-214604117.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-31	2020-07-31 15:02:28	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	How Earnings Amplify the Bull Case for Comcast Stock	I've been recommending Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) for this entire year. After Thursday morning's earnings report, I like CMCSA stock even more.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com The market, however, saw it differently. Comcast's stock actually declined 0.5% in trading Thursday.It may have been that a rally into the release preempted some of the potential optimism. Comcast stock had bounced about 16% from late June lows. That rally came despite a rising number of cases of the novel coronavirus, a spike which, in theory, should add further pressure to the company's theme parks business.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut from here, earnings were strong enough to suggest that CMCSA stock is just taking a breather. The report was easily good enough to move the stock higher. Just because the move didn't happen on Thursday doesn't mean it won't happen soon. A Winner or a Loser?The simple bull case for Comcast stock is that it's a pandemic winner, not a loser. That case seems somewhat counterintuitive.After all, we've seen plenty of evidence that &quot;stay at home&quot; orders accelerated cord-cutting and adoption of streaming services. For instance, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), posted blowout subscriber numbers in both the first and second quarters.That in turn would seem to be a significant negative for Comcast's video business. The company closed 2019 with over 20 million video subscribers, according to the company's Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It lost more than 2% of those subscribers in the first quarter alone.  * 7 Big Data Stocks to Watch for the Cloud Era Meanwhile, Comcast's Universal theme parks have taken a hit. So, too, has its Filmed Entertainment business, as theaters remain closed worldwide. And cord-cutting is pressuring the NBCUniversal unit.But the good news here outweighs the bad. Yes, Comcast is losing video subscribers -- but those subscribers are not all that profitable. As I've noted before, thanks in part to onerous rights fees for live sports, rivals Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and Cable One (NYSE:CABO) have given up chasing those subscribers at all.Worth noting: both of those stocks are up in 2020, with CHTR gaining 16% and CABO 19%.Those companies admittedly don't have film or theme park businesses. But those two segments in 2019 combined for less than 10% of total profit.Meanwhile, the pandemic has accelerated several trends that make Comcast's broadband business even more valuable. Video streaming? It requires broadband. Videoconferencing via Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM)? The same. And with the Peacock streaming service offsetting pressure on NBCUniversal, Comcast seems exceedingly well-positioned for the &quot;new normal.&quot; Earnings Support the Bull CaseFrom here, Comcast's second quarter seems to support that bull case. It's not just that consolidated results topped expectations, though they did. Despite the pandemic and investments behind Peacock, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) declined just 9% year-over-year.Meanwhile, Comcast actually added 217,000 total subscribers. The high-speed internet business had its best second quarter subscriber figure in 13 years. There's proof of the value of Comcast's core franchise.In Cable Communications as a whole (which includes both video and Internet customers), adjusted EBITDA actually increased 5.5% year-over-year despite a decline in revenue. That's proof that a) Comcast can manage video declines and b) that its pricing power is likely going to grow.Elsewhere, profits actually increased in the Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and even the Filmed Entertainment units.And Peacock got out of the gate strong, with 10 million subscribers. Chief executive officer Brian Roberts said the early results were ahead of his company's expectations, and they were likely ahead of the market's as well.This was a good quarter for Comcast. And it's a quarter that shows that the quickly changing world is a positive for Comcast, not a negative as investors feared. Long-Term Upside in CMCSA StockBut even with the recent rally, Comcast's stock isn't treated that way. Shares are down almost 3% so far this year, and sit 8.5% off January highs.I see little reason why Comcast can't reach new all-time highs. In fact, I would argue it should get there quickly. That in turn suggests at least 10% appreciation -- with a 2%-plus dividend yield on top.That kind of upside might not seem Earth-shattering. But for a defensive name in a market near all-time highs, it's certainly attractive. And over the long haul, as data-consuming trends accelerate, so too will Comcast's pricing power and profits.Again, Q2 strongly supports that long-term case. That's what mattered on Thursday, not just a bit of variance relative to Wall Street expectations. I expect investors soon will figure that out -- and CMCSA stock will resume its recent rally.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-07-31	2020-07-31 14:38:56	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Charter Soars After Surprising Growth in TV Subscribers	(Bloomberg) -- Charter Communications Inc. shares hit a record after the cable company posted a surprising gain in TV and internet subscribers due in part to Covid-19 service offers and cheaper video packages.The second-largest U.S. cable operator swung to a gain of 102,000 residential video subscribers and added 842,000 residential internet customers in the second quarter. Analysts had expected it to lose 129,000 video customers while adding 439,530 new broadband subscribers.Charter shares rose as much as 5.5% to $594.31 in New York trading Friday. The stock is up more than 16% this year through Thursday.The gains are a rare bright spot in the pay-TV industry, which has seen steep subscriber declines in recent years as customers turned to popular streaming services like Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co.’s Hulu.About 90% of the customers Charter added through Covid-19 relief programs have “remained as either paying customers or are still on the free offer,” Chief Financial Officer Chris Winfrey said on a call with analysts. “The vast majority of them are paying, and 50% of them altogether had actually taken additional products.”Charter’s growth is particularly notable at a time when the competition for viewers has gotten even more heated. Millions of customers have signed up for new offerings, including Disney+, AT&T Inc.’s HBO Max and Comcast Corp.’s Peacock, which made its national debut July 15 and has collected more than 10 million sign-ups since its limited launch in April.“Though we see risk in 3Q as pledges come off, we believe Charter remains well positioned for continued growth,” Mike McCormack, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, wrote in a note.Outpacing PeersCharter’s subscriber gains also outpaced those of its pay-TV peers. AT&T, which operates DirecTV, said last week it lost 886,000 subscribers in the second quarter. On Thursday, Comcast reported shedding 477,000 TV customers in the period.Charter, which sells internet, phone and TV service under the Spectrum brand exceeded profit estimates with earnings of $3.63 a share on $11.7 billion in revenue. Analysts expected earnings of $2.46 and $11.6 billion in sales.The company is still hurting from Covid-19, due to closed businesses and canceled sporting events. The disruption erased about $82 million from Charter’s bottom line and cut about $282 million off total sales, according to the company’s earnings presentation.Charter boosted spending in the second quarter a bit more than expected. Total capital spending was $1.88 billion, compared with analysts’ prediction of $1.62 billion. The cable shop has spent $3.34 billion on capital investment in the first half of the year and is on pace to finish below the $7.2 billion total last year. Capital spending was $9.1 billion in 2018.(Updates with CFO comment in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charter-soars-surprising-growth-tv-130220007.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-20	2020-07-20 08:00:00	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Giant Wireless Sale Offers 5G Spectrum Sliced Into 22,631 Pieces	(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. is moving into the new era of fast 5G wireless internet and the Muscatine Power & Water utility in Iowa wants to join the ride. So does the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative Inc. that serves Kaktovik and Atqasuk in remote northern Alaska.They are among more than 200 companies registered to bid in an unusual government auction set to begin July 23. At stake is potentially $10 billion worth of lucrative spectrum that can be used for wireless internet and is assigned by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission through competitive bidding.The number of registered bidders makes it one of the biggest auctions of its type in history. Combined with another sale scheduled for December, it represents a giant leap toward a future of super fast internet and connected cars, appliances and mobile devices.Past sales offered licenses covering entire metropolitan areas at prices that only wealthy corporations such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. could afford. This one offers smaller licenses -- seven in each county in the country for a total of 22,631.That means companies with modest finances -- such as Muscatine Power and the Alaskan co-op -- can get rights to spectrum in just their area. The FCC designed it that way to assure the next generation of wireless service isn’t limited to a handful of telecom behemoths, and to give companies with new uses for the technology a shot.“It’s really a game-changer for all of these non-traditional users,” said Kurt Schaubach, chief technology officer with Federated Wireless, a company based in Arlington, Virginia, that helps coordinate use of the airwaves being auctioned.It is the first offering by the FCC in recent years of airwaves suitable for the advanced 5G systems. Proceeds will go to the U.S. Treasury and estimates range to as much as $10 billion by Raymond James.“We’ve never had an auction of this size,” said Michael O’Rielly, an FCC commissioner who guided the auction’s design. In an interview he ticked off participants -- the big national wireless providers, cable companies “of all shapes and sizes,” electric utilities and companies beaming broadband over the air.The frequencies are in the so-called midband range of airwaves, where signals travel well and also can carry abundant data. Both features suit the 5G networks that will link billions of devices in automated factories, homes and elsewhere. Auction winners can only buy four of the seven licenses available in each county, ensuring that no single user can snap up all of an area’s airwaves. Each of the seven licenses provides rights to use the airwaves across an entire county.The Muscatine municipal utility, which offers internet service and runs an electrical grid and water system, could buy airwaves covering just Muscatine County, where there are fewer than 17,000 households.Utilities and electricity distributors could use their winnings to expand wireless broadband networks, manage electricity distribution, and install remote meter-reading.Tractor maker Deere & Co. is poised to take part. Its products include tractors and combines that link with mobile internet service.The airwaves can be used for more rural broadband coverage, enhancing what farmers can do in the field, and supporting manufacturing operations, said Jennifer Hartmann, a spokeswoman for Deere, which is based in Moline, Illinois.A cohort of petroleum companies and utilities have registered to bid.“Utilities for decades have struggled to acquire the amount of spectrum they need” because they lack the capital available to big telecom providers, said Rob Thormeyer, spokesman for the Utilities Technology Council that advocates for utilities’ communications systems.National mobile carriers enrolled in the sale including AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile US Inc. may be most interested in airwaves to supplement urban coverage.Largest U.S. cable providers Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. are also registered to bid. Each has seen a swell of subscribers who buy wireless service that rides on Verizon’s airwaves. If the cable providers can buy airwaves and set up nodes for their customers’ use, they could pay Verizon less.It’s the first big sally into airwaves auctions by cable companies in over a decade.“This is the only good 5G spectrum they could get their hands on for awhile,” said Gregory Williams, an analyst with Cowen & Co.The airwaves to be sold are in the so-called CBRS band. The acronym stands for Citizens Broadband Radio Service. It’s located in the 3.5 gigahertz band. The auction runs as long as bidders are competing, a process that typically takes weeks to unfold.An auction in December is expected to produce even higher bids for spectrum in the so-called C-Band. It will offer swathes of airwaves congenial to mobile broadband, and to allow higher power transmissions that can send signals farther.The FCC bars participants from publicly signaling bidding strategies, and many declined to discuss the sale. Verizon, Comcast, Charter, AT&T, the Muscatine utility and the Arctic Slope cooperative all declined to comment or didn’t respond to queries.A robust sale with high total bids would bode well for 5G auctions to follow, including the C-band sale on Dec. 8 of airwaves to be surrendered by satellite providers, said Harold Feld, senior vice president for the Washington-based policy group Public Knowledge.“We’re going to see how much are companies willing to pay for this kind of 5G spectrum,” Feld said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/giant-wireless-sale-offers-5g-080000875.html?.tsrc=rss

As we noted in yesterday's Big Stock Charts, there was a technical argument that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had done so yesterday. The case is easier to make after the Dow rallied another 6.4% on Thursday.Source: Shutterstock As Barron's noted, the term &quot;bull market&quot; isn't set in stone. But the Dow, incredibly, has rallied 21.3% in just three sessions, satisfying one common definition. Add in a late-day rally Monday and the bounce nears 24%.A snapback rally in Boeing (NYSE:BA) has been a key contributor. But the S&P 500 itself has gained 18% in three days. The rally has been broad as well as steep.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem As U.S. stocks look to close what could be the best week of trading since the 1930s, optimism seems to have returned. Friday's big stock charts look to tap into that optimism. Like the market, all three stocks found support. And all three could see more upside ahead. JD.com (JD)Source: Provided by Finviz To look at the first of Friday's big stock charts, one might not even know a sell-off had occurred. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has mostly rallied through broad market declines, and there's a case that the rally should continue:  * For the most part, this simply looks like a solid chart. A broadening ascending wedge that's held since August suggests new highs are on the way. Excluding a short-lived dip, JD stock mostly has held the 50-day moving average, which can provide support going forward as well. An investor might worry about short-term resistance as a few rallies have reversed this year, but that aside it seems like JD stock should head higher.  * Fundamentally, there's a strong case. Just last week I highlighted JD stock as one of seven stocks that had survived the market carnage and could keep rallying. Shares aren't all that expensive relative to trailing earnings. China is getting back to normal. Its e-commerce market is big enough for both JD and larger rival Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).  * That said, JD probably needs this rally to hold, or at least not reverse. Trading earlier this month shows that broad market weakness can bring JD.com down with it. In-country risk remains elevated. As with the market as a whole, investors can be hopeful but they still need to mind the downside. Charter Communications (CHTR)When we highlighted Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) in Big Stock Charts almost two months ago, the chart looked fantastic while the fundamentals were questionable. Even with CHTR stock 15% cheaper, this edition of Big Stock Charts sounds much the same:  * CHTR stock managed to bounce nicely off support that held in August. Thursday's rally retook the 200-day moving average. There seems to be a path to at least the 50DMA, which suggests roughly 8% further upside.  * But the fundamentals still look questionable at this price. Charter still has to deal with the effects of cord-cutting going forward. A valuation of 23x forward earnings hardly seems cheap in that context.  * Charter has been a wonderfully-managed company as it's built out its business through acquisitions. As a result, it was one of the best stocks of the bull market: at February highs, CHTR had rallied almost 1,500% from financial crisis-era lows. After this bounce Charter stock is basically back where it was in mid-December -- and 'only' up about 1,200% from the 2009 nadir.  * For investors who believe the bounce of the last three days has gone too far, this chart can serve as Exhibit A. As steep as the decline seemed to be, there are a significant number of large-cap stocks like CHTR who now trade back where they did just months ago. Fundamentally, CHTR shows that the buying opportunity in the market as a whole might not be quite what a 30%-plus decline in major indices would suggest. Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)Source: Provided by Finviz Market bulls might see it differently, however. Those that do should take a look at the third of Friday's big stock charts, which suggests that Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) has a rally ahead:  * As with CHTR, TMO stock has seen support hold, save for a brief decline during the worst of the market panic. But it hasn't received quite the same bounce: shares are up 'just' 13% from their low (and even less looking to closing prices). There's whitespace toward moving averages which can be reached if market stability holds.  * Meanwhile, Thermo Fisher shouldn't have much, if any, real impact from pandemic fears. The life sciences supplier serves customers that have little or no macroeconomic exposure. The scramble to treat the coronavirus may cause some short-term supply chain issues, but hardly enough to drive a 17% decline from February highs.  * Again, market bulls should consider TMO here just above support. But skeptics might respond that the decline here makes more sense than it seems. Many believe that market valuations simply had run too far in February. From that perspective, the fall in TMO stock isn't an unjustified sell-off. It's a correction. And the same trend explains at least a portion of the big fall elsewhere in U.S. stocks.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-03-26	2020-03-26 20:30:54	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Broadband Seen as Haven as Investors Seek Stability	(Bloomberg) -- The broadband sector could become a safe haven for investors looking to store cash in the event of a financial crisis.Demand for internet access will be recession-proof, if history is an indicator. A Bureau of Labor Statistics analysis from 2009 to 2010 showed total household spending declined year-over-year while computer information and cable services spending increased. That may be even more the case now amid the coronavirus outbreak, as many Americans are working remotely from home and relying on streaming services like Netflix Inc. for entertainment.“The criticality of broadband has increased since the global financial crisis,” Gregory Williams, an analyst covering cable and satellite services at Cowen, said in a note to clients. It’s “now considered a fairly price inelastic utility-like necessity.”AT&T Inc., Charter Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Altice USA Inc. are among the long list of potential benefactors providing internet-based services across the U.S. Pure-play businesses like Charter are seen best positioned for upside. Shares of the Stamford, Connecticut-based company have fallen just 8% since the beginning of the year, compared to a 20% decline in the S&P 500 Index.Michael McKenzie, managing director of private investment firm Grain Management, said that broadband connections grew 15% from 2008 to 2009. While there’s no guarantee that will happen this time, the sector is likely to fare better than cable or entertainment peers as consumers look to cut discretionary spending.“I think it’s highly unlikely that [broadband connectivity] declines in a recession,” McKenzie said in an interview. It “should be a safe bet” given its historic stability, he said.McKenzie said there may be some “depressed” spending in certain sectors like hospitality. But in general, stocks linked to mobile network operators and tower owners will “tend to benefit from what we see coming out of this crisis.”(Corrects broadband connection growth in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadband-return-haven-investors-seeking-171302513.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-23	2020-03-23 10:00:16	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Bond ETFs Will Never Be the Same After Coronavirus	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Fixed-income exchange-traded funds have always been, and will continue to be, a contentious subject. Just the idea of a liquidity mismatch between the products and the underlying securities raises tough questions. Which is the more accurate reflection of a market: the benchmark index full of bonds that don’t trade or the ETF that does?As with most things, the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. But for now, bond ETFs across the world are trading at staggering discounts to their net asset values in what some have dubbed an “illiquidity doom loop.” More recently, that spiral has ensnared even funds that invest in some of the most stable fixed-income securities in the world. It’s one thing if the largest high-yield municipal-bond fund is going berserk — as I wrote last week, that could be chalked up in part to steeply repricing a few securities tied to senior-living facilities. It’s quite another for supposedly safe assets to get hammered. For better or worse, fixed-income ETFs can never be looked at quite the same way going forward.A Bloomberg News article on Friday spotlighted the $6.2 billion iShares Short Maturity Bond ETF (ticker: NEAR). As the name suggests, it holds very short-term corporate debt, with an average duration of less than a year. Some of its biggest holdings include debt from Charter Communications Inc., Ford Motor Co., General Electric Co. and CVS Health Corp., all of which matures within the next eight months. Some of these businesses have had their struggles, yes, but they’re not going belly-up imminently, even with the coronavirus outbreak.Heading into this month, NEAR never swung more than 0.25% in either direction at any point in the previous year. It traded in a 35-cent range over 12 months. Most days, it would barely move at all. Then, something snapped. On March 18, the fund dropped 1.4% in its sharpest decline since inception in 2013. On March 19 it collapsed, tumbling as much as 8.9% because of rumors that BlackRock Inc. was restricting cash redemptions for traders looking to redeem more than one unit. It closed down $3, equivalent to roughly 30 months of dividend payments. The Bloomberg Barclays Short-Term Government/Corporate Total Return Index, meanwhile, was little changed.“Equity-like risk with T-bill upside,” David Schawel, chief investment officer at Family Management Corp., quipped on Twitter. A BlackRock Inc. spokesman told Bloomberg News that the ETF paid out about $150 million in redemptions Thursday, all in cash.NEAR was hardly the only supposedly stable ETF that was slammed. Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Enhanced Short Maturity Active Exchange-Traded Fund (ticker: MINT) dropped 1.35% in the biggest one-day decline since 2009. The Fidelity Low Duration Bond Factor ETF (ticker: FLDR) crumbled 8.35% on March 12, then staged a big rebound of 7.1% on March 13 before losing 8.7% last week.My colleague Eric Balchunas at Bloomberg Intelligence refers to ETFs as a “release valve” for investors to find liquidity when it’s vanishing across bond markets and investors aren’t confident they can sell the underlying securities. It supports the argument that the funds are a better indication of where the market is clearing than the bonds themselves. Or, at the very least, ETFs get out ahead of the ups and downs to come. He said that a vast majority of purportedly bad optics aren’t really that bad at all.What happened to NEAR was different. On Twitter, Balchunas called the huge price drop “unacceptable.” It was a “bad move” by BlackRock, he said. The money manager realized its mistake and reversed course, he added, “but damage was done.”  While it’s possible that NEAR and the other ETFs will recover soon from their violent drops and company missteps, this feels like a moment of truth for the fixed-income ETF industry. If investors are simply turning to them for instant price discovery and liquidity, then the funds have certainly held up their end of the bargain. If, however, institutions expected the ETFs to minimize tracking error to a benchmark index, they’ve been let down amid this market turmoil. Heading into Friday, roughly 70 fixed-income ETFs were trading with at least a 5% discount to their net asset value, and 16 traded at a discount of 10% or greater.Again, there could be a snapback. In fact, evidence of one began emerging on Friday across a range of fixed-income ETFs. After reaching a stunning 28% discount on March 18, the VanEck Vectors High Yield Municipal Index ETF (ticker: HYD) staged its biggest two-day advance since inception in 2009. Its short-term cousin, SHYD, surged 9.4% on Friday alone. It’s not clear whether that’s because the underlying securities have stopped selling off or just because the fund became so heavily discounted. If it’s the latter, then the open-end ETF has taken on similar characteristics as closed-end funds, with enterprising investors closing the NAV gap.None of this means the ETF industry is in jeopardy. It just means investors need to realize they won’t function as steady, index-based products during crisis-like periods. Investors were pulling cash from bond funds of all types at a record pace in the week through March 18, which is often the impetus for a vicious cycle. Combine that with a lack of liquidity as banks step back as market-makers, and it’s no wonder that ETFs spiraled. I have little doubt that fixed-income ETFs will get through this rough stretch. But the experience will forever change the conversation about how they’ll perform in a worst-case scenario.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2020-03-10	2020-03-10 14:19:51	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Billionaire Crispin Odey Loaded up on These 3 Stocks	It’s cliché in the West that the Chinese written pictogram for ‘crisis’ can also be read as ‘opportunity’ or ‘danger,’ but like many clichés, it comes from a seed of truth. Any crisis, be it political or medical or economic – or some combination of them all, as in the COVID-19 epidemic – brings with it heightened risks and rewards. British hedge fund manager Crispin Odey gave us a lesson that just recently, when his fund posted a 5% gain in the wake of coronavirus’s hit on the world’s stock exchanges.Odey saw those gains, in his European fund, after making moves against electric car maker Tesla and against US shale oil stocks. Both have dropped on fears of coronavirus impact, but while Tesla shares are likely to stabilize and move back up, oil companies will continue to feel the hurt. Crude prices are down sharply, as the viral impact is disrupting travel plans and trade patterns – and demand for fuel.Speaking of his quick move to short what had seemed to be strong positions, Odey said, “We went into coronavirus with the market incredibly bullish, everyone was long. I’m more cautious than most people.”Odey’s caution has served him well in his career. In 2016, he was a well-known supporter of the ‘Leave’ vote in the initial Brexit debates – but when it came time to put up, he made a profit of 220 million pounds predicting that markets would collapse in the event that ‘Leave’ won the vote. Odey has long been known as a bearish investor, a reputation that peaked, perhaps, in 2008, when his short position on major banking institutions saw him profit handsomely despite that year’s financial crisis.So, when a hedge fund manager as famously cautious as Odey started snapping up shares, it’s time to take notice. His fund, Odey Asset Management, listed three notable moves in the fourth-quarter. We’ve used the TipRanks Stock Screener tool to sort out some commonalities among them: all three are mid- to large-cap stocks, with ‘Buy’ ratings from Wall Street and at least 10% upside potential – in one case, nearly 120%! Of the three, only one pays a dividend, but that one yields a strong 6.6%. Let’s investigate the details, and find out what else drew Odey to these calls.Euronav NV (EURN)The first company on our list is a shipping company. Antwerp-based Euronav is the world’s largest crude oil tanker platform, whose operations include both ocean-going tanker transport and FSO (floating, storage and offloading) services.Odey's firm has increased its holding of Euronav by 305% in the past quarter, picking up over 2.6 million shares. Odey Management holds 3.552 million shares in the company, worth more than $30 million.Euronav’s Q4 2019 earnings report showed clear gains, both for the quarter and the full year. For the quarter, revenue reached $355 million, with a profit of $160 million. This was a 50% revenue gain year-over-year, and nearly unchartable gain from Q4 2018’s profit of just $279,000. The Q4 numbers changed a full-year net loss into a net gain, and Euronav posted FY19 revenues of $932.3 million with a net profit of $118.8 million. The full-year profit is complete turnaround from FY18’s net loss of $110 million.Evercore analyst Jonathan Chappell writes of Euronav’s current position, “…although fear is at a fever pitch presently, as it relates to slumping oil demand associated with the onset of coronavirus, the tanker supply and demand outlook remains robust, and as the owner of an industry-leading fleet and a fortress balance sheet, EURN is poised to continue to provide enhanced EPS … growth over the coming quarters…”Chappell puts a $21 price target on the stock to support his Buy rating, indicating his confidence with a 130% upside potential. (To watch Chappell’s track record, click here)Randy Giveans, with Jefferies, is also bullish, and gives this stock a Buy rating with a $14 price target. Supporting his stance, Giveans writes, “Following the short-term oil demand shock due to coronavirus, we believe the tanker market will strengthen during 2020, while fleet growth continues to slow in the coming quarters.” His price target implies an upside of 67%. (To watch Giveans’ track record, click here)Euronav holds a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on 4 Buy and 1 Hold ratings. The stock is selling for a discounted $9.12, and the average price target of $16.82 suggests a whopping 84% upside growth potential over the coming year. (See Euronav stock analysis on TipRanks)UBS Group AG (UBS)Next up is a staple of the international banking scene, Swiss-based UBS. This multi-billion dollar banking firm is the largest of the famous Swiss banks, and holds an important position in the global financial scene. UBS has over 3.34 trillion Swiss franc (CHF) in assets under management, equivalent to $3.61 trillion in US currency.UBS is a new position for Odey, whose firm bought 1.447 million shares. The holding is worth $15.145 million at current share prices – or 14.056 million CHF.Of the stocks in this list, USB is the only one that pays out a high dividend – and at 6.6%, it is well over 6x the average of S&P-listed companies. The payout, 69 cents per share, is distributed annually and has been raised modestly over the last four years.Last month, UBS announced that, as of November 1 this year, ING head Ralph Hamers will take over as CEO. The move is seen as bold – Hamers oversaw ING’s strong shift to digital innovation, and banking sector analysts are keen to see what he will bring to UBS.Kian Abouhossein, 4-star analyst with JPMorgan, is upbeat about UBS’ current situation, writing, “Ralph Hamers is amongst the more highly regarded CEOs in European Banking... In our view, UBS has an excellent franchise and mix of businesses with 60% of Net Profit coming from Wealth Management; it is all about creating positive operating leverage in the group which has been lacking in the last few years and a fresh pair of eyes would help in this regard.”Abouhossein gives this stock a CHF$15.00 price target ($16.14), implying a robust 62% upside, to support his Buy rating. (To watch Abouhossein’s track record, click here)Berenberg analyst Eoin Mullany is also bullish on UBS, as indicated by his CHF$15.00 price target ($16.14) and Buy rating.Commenting on UBS, Mullany says, “Having reset its profitability and capital return targets, it is time for UBS to deliver. With consensus already at the bottom end of its new profitability targets, expectations are low, but with 2020 having started well, we are confident that UBS can beat consensus expectations.” His target indicates that he expects a 54% upside here. (To watch Mullany’s track record, click here)All in all, UBS holds a Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating, based on a mix of reviews: 4 Buys, 2 Holds, and 2 Sells. The stock is selling for $9.27 (8.61 CHF), and the average price target of $13.56 (12.60 CHF) suggests an upside potential of 46%. (See UBS stock analysis on TipRanks)Charter Communications (CHTR)Last up is Charter Communications, a $100 billion player in the US telecom sector. Using the brand name Spectrum, Charter offers cable services to more than 26 million customers in 41 states. After industry leader Comcast, Charter is the second-largest cable provider in the US. Charter also offers telephone services, and is the fifth-largest landline provider.Clearly, Odey is impressed by Charter’s sustained upward path; he bought 26,706 shares of the company in the past quarter. This brought his full holding of CHTR to 51,008 shares, which are currently worth an impressive $25.336 million. Odey Management has held a position in CHTR since the third quarter of 2016.The company’s Q4 2019 numbers tell the story, as far as numbers can. Quarterly earnings came in at $3.37 per share, beating the forecast by 34% and growing an impressive 161% year-over-year. Quarterly revenues, at $11.76 billion, showed smaller gains.Evercore ISI’s 4-star analyst Vijay Jayant puts a bullish $600 price target on CHTR shares. This implies an upside of 16%, and supports his Buy rating.In his recent research note, Jayant wrote, “Charter’s 4Q19 results and management’s 2020 commentary support our bullish thesis as we move into 2020. With tailwinds from continued strong broadband subscriber performance, the full year impact of the 4Q19 price increase, political advertising, and continued operating leverage, we expect 8-9% EBITDA growth in 2020E. Flattish capex and improved working capital translates this into 15% OpFCF growth, and the company’s aggressive capital returns turn that into 21% expected FCF/share growth..” (To watch Jayant’s track record, click here)Overall, Charter Communications gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on a near-even split of 9 Buys, 8 Holds, and a single Sell. The stock sells for $470.28, while the average price target of $549.06 indicates a general confidence in 10% upside growth in the next 12 months.

This partly makes sense to Moffett because there have been concerns about Comcast's legacy media businesses, while Charter is a pure play on cable. &quot;But at Comcast's current valuation, either NBCU, or Sky, is arguably being priced at less than zero,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Even with a conglomerate discount, Comcast is too cheap on any reasonable sum-of-the-parts valuation.&quot; Moffett continues to have doubts about the prospects for Comcast's cable networks and the Sky business, but he said &quot;the suggestion that NBCU and Sky are worth more than zero seems unlikely to draw much argument.&quot; Comcast's stock has lost 4.7% over the past three months, as the S&P 500  has added 5.9%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/c1890a45-9418-309c-924c-8682534e7048/comcast-stock-heads-higher.html?.tsrc=rss

Earnings per share came in significantly above the FactSet consensus, which called for $2.52.

2020-01-09	2020-01-09 16:59:26	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Verizon, Breaker of the Cable Bundle? Not Really	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The good news is, some day soon “triple play” will mean something only to baseball fans. These days, though, cable-TV customers probably still know it better as the industry’s torture device.Triple-play bundles refer to long-term contracts with a company such as Comcast Corp. or Charter Communications Inc. that provide internet, television and landline-phone service for one “discounted” rate. These packages force you to have an old-school home-phone number, seemingly just for telemarketers to utilize, and dozens of TV channels you’ll never watch but will nevertheless subsidize. Meanwhile, all you really want is a fast internet connection to binge on Netflix and gain access to a handful of your favorite network shows. But rejoice — there’s a movement afoot that may send triple-play bundles the way of the rotary telephone. Verizon Communications Inc. announced on Thursday that its Fios division is ending these aggressive you’ll-take-it-all-and-you’ll-like-it bundles, allowing subscribers to better customize their plans with what it’s calling Fios Mix & Match. Users can choose among three different internet-speed options that range from $40 to $80 a month and several TV packages that run anywhere from $50 to $90 a month. No annual contracts, it says, and no surprise fees — well, sort of! After all, this wouldn’t be the cable and phone industry if there weren’t some doozies contained in the fine print: Some of the options do have an additional fee for a set-top box or router. A home phone line is a separate $20, to which you can kindly say, “no thank you.”Verizon won’t be the last to give in and smash the bundle, at least for now. They’ve been in decline as an increasing number of customers switch to broadband-only service. There may be more than 50 million broadband-only U.S. homes by 2023, which would make up about half of all pay-TV households, according to research by Geetha Ranganathan and Amine Bensaid, analysts for Bloomberg Intelligence. To stem the drop in revenue, the cable giants have been pushing video add-ons, the analysts said. Charter, which acquired Time Warner Cable in 2016 to strengthen its business against cord-cutting, began offering a $15-a-month skinny video bundle called TV Essentials last year. Here’s how the trend has played out at Charter:Lest you, dear cable customer, believe that this is a sign the industry is finally listening, remember that we’re still nowhere near a true a la carte service. Verizon’s new Your Fios TV package for $50 a month allows subscribers to pick five channels, while Verizon arranges the other 120 channels. How many customers wish they could just take the five and call it a day? Moreover, streaming-video apps won’t necessarily lead to lower monthly bills either: Verizon’s mid-rate internet option (with router), plus Disney+, Netflix and HBO Max would cost a combined $110 a month (although Verizon is currently offering internet users a year of Disney+ free, and Verizon wireless customers can get other savings). My point is, the ideal video-app configuration may not be any cheaper than going for a triple play.That’s why bundles will live on, even if the traditional triple play won’t. If anything, bundles will likely be back en vogue later this year. In November, I called for The Great Rebundling, predicting that the cable giants — which have been benefiting from a surge in broadband signups — will next look to leverage their content distribution relationships by offering bundles for streaming apps and internet service at one rate. Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. may seize similar content-bundling opportunities, which would at least help solve the consumer frustration of paying for apps individually in various places.This is why, even as millions of customers have permanently abandoned cable-TV, sending media networks into a tizzy, the cable companies haven’t even broken a sweat. Shares of Comcast rose 32% in 2019, and analysts see them climbing 13% in 2020. Charter’s gain last year of 70% made it the leading media stock in the S&P 500 Index. Triple play will be reincarnated with a new cute name, and prices will eventually go up, and everyone will complain, and the cable industry will be as good as new.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2019-12-18	2019-12-18 12:34:56	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Cowen’s 3 Stock Choices for 2020	2019 has delivered such plentiful returns, that heading into the new year, investors might be met with a sense of trepidation as to what lies ahead. Can the market extend the rally? Which stocks can continue handing out ample rewards through 2020 and beyond?In such instances it is worth turning to the pros to get the lowdown. Multinational investment bank and financial services provider, Cowen, has a history of successfully picking up disruptive companies and emerging markets early on, Amazon being a case in point. The company was also the first Wall Street firm to exhibit serious interest in the fledgling cannabis industry.With the help of TipRanks’ Stock Screener, we were able to get the full scoop on the company’s 3 favorite stocks for the new year. All 3 have had a strong 2019, yet Cowen thinks their growth is set to continue in the year ahead. Let’s take a look.Charter Communications (CHTR)2019 continued to hear talk of the ‘cord-cutting’ trend whereby old, traditional cable companies are about to become obsolete due to pay-tv customers moving over to newer, more flexible streaming services. Telecommunications giant, Charter, has stayed ahead of the curve by leveraging losses of cable customers by picking up more subscribers for its broadband service. As broadband becomes a must-have service for every household, and most areas only provide two options for broadband services, companies like Charter almost become recession proof.Apart from success in the broadband sector, Charter’s entrance into the wireless phone market is also bearing fruit. Its mobile business has seen solid growth, adding 276,000 new lines in the last quarter alone.Additionally, it has kept buying back company shares, always a promising sign for investors. In Q3, the company spent $3.1 billion on stock buybacks.This cable giant has easily outperformed the market in 2019, delivering a year-to-date gain of 65%, but has the leading broadband provider climbed too high?Not according to 5-star Cowen analyst Colby Synesael, who noted, “All said, despite the stock rally and premium valuation, we still see Charter as the ideal scaled pure-play Cable provider and best stock to play the Broadband story with underlying catalysts including the FCF story (24% CAGR), buybacks, attractive network assets ideal for the 5G topology, and strategic optionality. Longer-term, the company is well positioned to measurably build a DIY wireless network (trialing CBRS) and aggressively buy back shares, to be eventually taken out by a wireless carrier (because wireless carriers may have no choice).”To this end, Synesael reiterated an Outperform rating on Charter along with a price target of $537, indicating gains of 14% could be in place. (To watch Synesael’s track record, click here)What does the Street make of the communication giant’s prospects? A breakdown of 14 Buys, 7 Holds, and a solitary Sell, provide Charter with a Moderate Buy rating. The average price target stands at $503.16, which implies 7% upside potential. (See Charter Communications stock analysis on TipRanks) Equinix (EQIX)Another high-flyer in 2019 is internet connection and data center provider, Equinix. Year-to-date, EQIX is up 58%, leaving the S&P 500 in the dust despite its stellar year.The company is unusual given the fact that it is a REIT (real estate investment trust) but operates like a growth stock. Equinix provides the buildings and infrastructure for companies to house their servers in. Most companies use Equinix’s IBX (international business exchange), as along with a lack of alternatives, it is too expensive to build their own. Therefore, like REITS, the company has a recurring income stream.The company reported good 3Q19 results with it breaking records for 3Q bookings, cross connect adds and bookings through its channel, which came in at 30%, indicating a loyal customer base is in place.Synesael noted, “We continue to have a positive LT view of Equinix as the company is able to demonstrate stable/durable growth that coupled with its highly attractive returns we believe should continue to drive multiple expansion and further separate it from comps. We do not however expect upcoming 2020 guidance to alone act as a catalyst, and instead expect the stock to continue to grind higher over the NTM.”All this has prompted the 5-star analyst to reiterate an Outperform rating on Equinix. A price target of $628 provides potential upside of 13%.The Street is equally effusive about Equinix’s 12-month prospects. The data center provider has a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, with the breakdown formed of 12 Buys and 1 Hold. The average price target is $615.25, providing 10% upside potential. (See EQIX stock analysis on TipRanks) GDS Holdings (GDS)Staying in the data field, we move on to Chinese high-performance data center provider, GDS Holdings.Even with Cowen’s previous picks exhibiting fantastic growth in 2019, they are both dwarfed by GDS, which has seen its share price more than double in 2019, growing by 118%. Accordingly, the company ranks as Cowen’s no.1 choice for 2020.A solid 3Q report reflected a strong year. The company leased 21,600 sqm compared to the trailing 12 months average of 19,400, thereby achieving the company’s 2019 leasing goal of 80,000 sqm. Management reiterated that it expects to equal this performance in 2020, and raised 2019 EBITDA guidance thanks to stronger than expected margins year-to-date.Adding to the good news, GDS announced it had reached an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in target companies which own a data center campus in the Shunyi district of Beijing. The campus comprises three data centers with an area of 19,700 sqm. The acquisition is set to close in the first half of 2020.Synesael notes that while GDS is likely to experience trade driven volatility - the combination of strong secular demand, further margin expansion, and industry leading growth ‘should drive continued stock appreciation.’  The analyst concluded, “We believe GDS continues to be well positioned in what remains a strong demand environment and is taking the right steps to secure more supply in its major markets as it prepares for even stronger demand in 2020.”Synesael reiterated an Outperform rating on GDS, along with a price target of $65. Should the target be achieved, a handsome increase of over 29% could be in the cards.The Street is relatively quiet when it comes to GDS right now. Over the last 3 months, the data center provider has had 3 analysts rating its prospects. All, though, conclude GDS is a Buy, therefore designating it with Strong Buy status. The average price target of $60, could provide investors with 19% upside.

2019-12-11	2019-12-11 12:00:02	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Our Huge Wireless Merger Won't Cost You. We Promise.	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. are in court dueling with a group of state attorneys general over whether their merger will be harmful to consumers, even though it shouldn’t even be a debate. In what possible scenario would removing a low-cost rival from an already highly concentrated industry not have a negative effect on competition?The wireless carriers are contorting themselves into a pretzel trying to make the illogical argument that their merger will instead benefit customers — and somehow it’s working. Antitrust authorities appointed by President Donald Trump accepted this rationale with a straight face: The U.S. Federal Communications Commission, led by Ajit Pai, and the antitrust division of the Department of Justice, led by Makan Delrahim, each gave its blessing to the deal in recent months on the condition that the two companies make some painless concessions. Now, in a last line of legal defense and an unusual turn for such transactions, the matter is being tried in a case brought by plaintiffs Letitia James of New York and 13 other attorneys general. They are arguing that the remedies don’t go far enough to address the antitrust violations. They don’t, and yet there’s no telling which way this trial will go. Competition between T-Mobile and Sprint during the last few years resulted in lower plan prices for wireless customers, even putting pressure on industry leaders Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. It’s how unlimited data offerings came about. Without Sprint in the mix, this healthy competitive spirit is diminished. No acrobatics of economic modeling can camouflage this fact, and still the facts are in dispute. How very 2019.Text messages from 2017 between Roger Sole, Sprint’s head of marketing, and its then-CEO Marcelo Claure (who is now executive chairman) were revealed on Monday, the first day of the trial. As the two companies were negotiating the deal, Sole wrote to Claure that the combined entity could generate $5 more from each subscriber per month, and that the consolidation would even provide a boon to AT&T and Verizon. Sole may have been just spit-balling, and the state attorneys have a stronger case than to put too much stock in some gotcha private texts. Still, the conversation strongly suggests that greater pricing power was absolutely a motivation for the transaction, and it’s naive of anyone to think otherwise. T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed not to raise prices for three years, which is the blink of an eye in the business world and further demonstrates that the company’s goal is to eventually do so. Three years also conveniently brings the company to the point at which there may be little room left for cost-cutting, and so it will need to look to other ways to boost growth and margins. That’s if there aren’t loopholes in the agreement that it can exploit sooner. As well-liked as the gregarious T-Mobile CEO John Legere is — and as admirable as his track record is in fostering industry innovation — his personal promise that the company won’t take advantage of newfound pricing power should carry little weight. He won’t even be there to see it through. There are other business benefits beyond the ability to raise prices. For one, Sprint is a financially challenged company with a tarnished brand that is struggling to compete against its larger rivals. Selling to T-Mobile, which is on far healthier footing, would be good news for frustrated shareholders, such as Masayoshi Son of SoftBank Group Corp., the Japanese conglomerate that controls Sprint. The companies would also get to combine their spectrum assets and join forces on building a nationwide 5G wireless network.The U.S. needs to be competitive in 5G, but waving the American flag and trying to put the fear of China into regulators isn’t a legitimate defense against antitrust enforcement. Plus, it’s hard to see how blocking the merger would set the nation back — both companies are investing in 5G regardless. As for the notion that T-Mobile is preserving competition by rescuing Sprint before it potentially goes belly-up, it just doesn’t hold water because other bidders are probably out there. While companies like Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. may be seen as the Big Bad Cable Guys, either one owning Sprint would still maintain a four-carrier market, whereas T-Mobile’s deal wouldn’t.One of the remedies sought by the DOJ was to allow satellite-TV provider Dish Network Corp. access to the T-Mobile network while Dish builds its own. But Dish is a long, long ways from ever replacing Sprint. The DOJ’s lax stance on this deal would also seem to contradict the concerns it recently raised about anti-competitive business practices in the tech world, where immense market power is wielded by so few players.In the book “The Myth of Capitalism: Monopolies and the Death of Competition,” Jonathan Tepper and Denise Hearn make the case that the U.S. has an oligopoly problem — that is, industries have become too concentrated to the detriment of consumers and workers, in large thanks to anti-competitive mergers. My colleague John Authers, who runs the Bloomberg book club, and I will be discussing this with the authors in a live chat on Wednesday at 11 a.m. New York time. It’s a timely conversation as the T-Mobile-Sprint situation plays out. Terminal subscribers can join us at TLIV and send comments or questions to authersnotes@bloomberg.net.There’s more to come in the trials and tribulations of Sprint’s unending quest to merge with T-Mobile. But whatever headlines emerge from the courtroom, this fact won’t change: A merger means market power will be concentrated in fewer hands.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

Elizabeth Warren Wants to Spoil the Megamerger Party	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The merger floodgates broke open five years ago, and now U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to close the hatch. Her proposed bill to substantially restrict big corporate tie-ups is more a presidential campaign statement than viable legislation — and it certainly won’t score her any more points with the Wall Street crowd — but she is calling attention to the maniacal pace of dealmaking in corporate America and the need to modernize antitrust laws that have permitted some recent problematic transactions.More than $7 trillion of takeovers of U.S. companies have been announced since this day in 2014 — 52,694 companies to be exact.(1) That compares with just $4.4 trillion of deals in the previous five-year period. The transactions grew over time as balance sheets flush with cash and income statements desperate for growth created a perfect storm, which more often than not was stoked by pliable regulators. The Walt Disney Co. acquired 21st Century Fox Inc.; Charter Communications Inc. bought Time Warner Cable Inc.; CVS Health Corp. took over Aetna Inc.; Marriott International Inc. merged with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc.; and T-Mobile US Inc. is trying to buy Sprint Corp. Those are just some of the more recognizable names. Warren, one of the top-polling candidates heading into the Democratic primaries, wants to ban deals in which one company has annual revenue of more than $40 billion, or both businesses generate more than $15 billion in sales, according to a draft of the bill reviewed by Bloomberg News. (A notable exception would be companies facing insolvency.) That could effectively prevent every top airline, insurer, manufacturer, oil producer, retailer, technology platform and other conglomerates — perhaps even Warren Buffett’s M&A vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. — from making any acquisitions. It would sound the M&A death knell. The idea, however, is unlikely to gain broad support among lawmakers.Even so, it’s hard not to notice the rising drumbeat of politicians concerned about overreach by corporate giants, particularly those in the tech field. Senator Amy Klobuchar, another Democratic presidential candidate, plans to introduce separate antitrust legislation soon, Bloomberg News reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. (Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Opinion, is also campaigning for president.)For the Trump administration’s part, the U.S. Justice Department is already investigating whether tech giants — namely Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google — are using their unchecked power to engage in harmful business practices. But as I wrote in July, if regulators are so concerned about protecting consumers from tech overreach, their glowing endorsement of T-Mobile’s takeover of Sprint is a funny way of showing it; it will shrink the U.S. wireless market from four to three major carriers and remove a company that’s helped to keep customer prices in check.Antitrust regulation under President Donald Trump has at times created questionable optics. Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department’s top antitrust enforcer, seemed to switch his stance on AT&T Inc.’s takeover of Time Warner Inc. as Trump railed against the deal. Time Warner was the parent of CNN, which Trump views as his personal nemesis. (I’ve argued that whatever the case, scrutiny of the megamerger was warranted considering the broad market power it gave to AT&T as media companies without such scale struggle to compete.) By comparison, Disney and Fox, which was controlled by Trump pal Rupert Murdoch, closed their megadeal with few regulatory hiccups. Warren has criticized other giant deals, such as the merger of SunTrust Banks Inc. and BB&T Corp. and the combination of seed makers Bayer AG and Monsanto Co. Given that they aren’t household names, though, most Americans are unfazed by or unaware of such deals, even though they may feel the effects later. Her bill would direct the government to take into account not just whether a merger will lead to higher prices but also what the impact might be on workers, privacy and industry innovation. To justify the cost of buying another large company, dealmakers tend to come up with ambitious estimates of synergies, a euphemism for layoffs. It’s clear that the meaning of “harm” needs to be expanded in the antitrust sense, and laws need to take a more holistic view of the potential consequences of M&A as the lines between industries continue to blur. The Big Tech factor also needs to be weighed, as some deals are being done in part to respond to companies like Amazon that are spreading their tentacles into new areas. On Wednesday, TV-network operators CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. completed their own merger, a bid to cut costs and create more scale to compete against a new roster of even more powerful media giants: Amazon, Apple, AT&T and Disney. Even then, ViacomCBS Inc., as the merged entity is now called, may not be big enough, and so it may be only a matter of time before it gets swallowed. Warren’s overly broad proposal likely isn’t the answer. But Democrats do seem ready to at least try to rein in a market that’s gotten out of hand. For dealmakers, this may be last call at the M&A party.(1) Data compiled by Bloomberg as of Thursday morning.

2019-12-02	2019-12-02 12:14:04	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	The Hedge Fund Industry Gets Its Own Greta Thunberg	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The financial community has spent most of the past decade or so coping with the aftershocks of the global economic crisis. In the coming years, it’s likely to find most of its attention consumed by the need to tackle a far more serious threat — the climate emergency posing a clear and present danger that imperils more than just money.As envoys from almost 200 nations corralled by the United Nations meet in Madrid to discuss the climate crisis, a billionaire hedge fund activist has weighed in on the need for companies to come clean about their contributions to global warming, and for investors to use their financial firepower to demand action to combat the climate crisis.QuicktakeWhy Climate Terms MatterChristopher Hohn accused his fellow asset managers of having an “appalling” voting record on resolutions that challenge companies to do better environmentally. “Major asset managers such as BlackRock have been shown to be full of greenwash,” Hohn said, according to the Financial Times.Hohn runs TCI Fund Management Ltd., which manages more than $30 billion. The London-based firm wrote to companies including Airbus SE, Charter Communications Inc. and Moody’s Corp., threatening to divest its holdings if they don’t improve their greenhouse gas emissions reporting.Hohn has already put his money where his mouth is now going. His personal charity, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, donates about $150 million a year to organizations involved in the climate crisis, according to the FT. In October, he gave 50,000 pounds ($64,525) to Extinction Rebellion, the group’s biggest ever individual contribution. “I made the donation because humanity is aggressively destroying the world through climate change and there is an urgent need for us all to wake up to this fact,” the FT reported him as saying.One issue facing investors trying to align their portfolios with more principled strategies is the sheer proliferation of firms claiming to be able to rank companies based on their environment, social and governance performances. Sustainable Market Strategies reckons there are more than 100 data providers competing to compile and sell ESG data. (Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, provides ESG data, analytics and indexes.)“The multiplication of ESG data providers and scoring methodologies is making it more difficult for ESG-minded investors to actually find value in ESG ratings,” the research firm said in a report published last week. “ESG is still a jungle, and ESG scores — with all their biases — still lack price prediction power.”The report cites research by MIT Sloan School of Management that found ESG scores from different providers have a correlation of just 61%, compared with the 99% tracking found across credit ratings. “The ambiguity around ESG ratings is an impediment to prudent decision-making that would contribute to an environmentally sustainable and socially just economy,” the researchers said.Central banks are debating whether to add climate risk to their roster of responsibilities. Christine Lagarde, who recently became president of the European Central Bank, has said central banks should prioritize their role in mitigating the effects of global warming. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, one of the most vocal central bankers on the financial risks posed by the climate crisis, will become a special envoy for climate action and finances for the United Nations, the bank just announced.And in Norway, the opposition Labor Party has called for the nation’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s biggest with more than $1 trillion of assets, to take on a more political role. “Climate change will frame all politics,” party leader Jonas Gahr Store said last month.Climate activism is set to become more common in asset management in the coming years. Hohn’s intervention is a timely reminder that shareholders of all shapes and sizes need to engage with the companies they invest in, using their financial clout to compel executives to improve their environmental performance — for all of our sakes.To contact the author of this story: Mark Gilbert at magilbert@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Mark Gilbert is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering asset management.

2019-11-20	2019-11-20 17:38:00	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Automakers Stand to Lose Airwaves Rights as FCC Drops a Promise	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai proposed reassigning airwaves long promised to automakers and instead allow other wireless uses on the frequencies.Pai set a Dec. 12 vote by the commission on the proposal to modify the grant of airwaves the agency made 20 years ago.The FCC vote would request comments on letting Wi-Fi gadgets occupy part of the airwaves while letting automakers utilize the remainder of the swath. So far automakers have had exclusive rights to the entire frequency band for a technology they’ve barely used.“We want to move on from something we’ve tried for a long time that wasn’t working, and open the door to new and exciting opportunities,” Pai said in a speech at a Washington event. “After 20 years of seeing these prime airwaves go largely unused, the time has come for the FCC to take a fresh look.”The change wouldn’t be final until another vote by the FCC, which under Pai has worked to free airwaves bands for new uses. Because Pai leads a Republican majority, his proposals usually pass.Cable providers who offer Wi-Fi for customers’ wireless use are hungry for spectrum as digital technology transforms everything from cars to video feeds and household appliances.More airwaves are needed to help “deliver a future of ubiquitous connectivity,” Charter Communications Inc. said in a Nov. 12 filing. Charter’s network supports more than 300 million devices, the Stamford, Connecticut-based company said.The airwaves could be used for fast communications including machine-to-machine links, and smart city applications such as smart cameras, traffic monitoring and security sensors, NCTA-The Internet & Television Association, a trade group for companies including Comcast Corp. and Charter, told the FCC in a Sept. 25 filing.Auto industry companies including General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Denso Corp. spent more than a decade developing a communications system that would use the airwaves. The technology called vehicle-to-vehicle, or “V2V,” links cars, roadside beacons and traffic lights into a seamless wireless web to avoid collisions and heed speed limits. Yet deployments have been few, and no major automakers produce cars using the technology in the U.S.The auto industry has broadly shifted to favor a newer technology based on cellular systems. Ford Motor Co., for instance, announced earlier this year that it will outfit all its new U.S. models starting in 2022 with cellular vehicle-to-everything technology. The system would enable Ford’s cars to communicate with one another about road hazards, send signals to stop lights to smooth traffic flow and pay fast-food bills automatically while picking up meals.Automakers and their allies last year asked the FCC to let them use part of the band for cellular-based technology -- rather than the Wi-Fi format the agency mandated in 1999 -- while preserving all of the airwaves for transportation safety. In a petition the companies said the newer, cellular technology is more reliable, with greater range.Pai’s proposal would let the newer, cellular technology use some of the airwaves in question.The Transportation Department in a statement Wednesday said it hadn’t changed its position that the entire airwaves swath needs to be retained for auto safety.“We’re hoping to preserve that 75 megahertz because it is now time, the technology is now there, that we can start deploying this potentially life-saving technology,” James Owens, acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said in a Senate hearing.ITS America, a trade group that includes Ford and GM, said in a statement, “In a country that reels from nearly 36,000 roadway deaths every year, it is unfathomable that the United States would literally give away our top safety tool -- and with it, our best chance to save tens of thousands of lives.”&#92;--With assistance from Keith Naughton.To contact the reporters on this story: Todd Shields in Washington at tshields3@bloomberg.net;Ryan Beene in Washington at rbeene@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth WassermanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/automakers-poised-lose-airwaves-rights-163141773.html?.tsrc=rss

Carmakers say they’re poised to finally use the airwaves to connect vehicles and infrastructure to prevent collisions.The FCC sent the proposal to the Transportation Department in recent days, said two people who asked not to be identified discussing the private deliberations. If DOT agrees, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai could set a Dec. 12 vote on the proposal to modify the grant of airwaves it made 20 years ago.The Transportation Department has long resisted the idea and remains concerned and will likely oppose the FCC’s latest plan, one of the people said.Representatives for both agencies declined to comment.Cable providers who offer Wi-Fi for customers’ wireless use are hungry for spectrum as digital technology transforms everything from cars to video feeds and household appliances.More airwaves are needed to help “deliver a future of ubiquitous connectivity,” Charter Communications Inc. said in a Nov. 12 filing.

Here’s How KKR Might Just Pull Off the Biggest LBO in History	(Bloomberg) -- One of the private equity industry’s titans called it a “stretch,” and it’s been dismissed as a pipe dream by a bevy of analysts.Yet interviews in recent days with debt-market specialists suggest that KKR & Co. could find a narrow path to finance what would be the biggest leveraged buyout in history: a potential take-private deal for pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. that analysts have estimated would need to be funded with at least $50 billion of debt.The challenge for any Walgreens suitor will be raising the necessary money via the markets of choice for private equity firms -- junk-rated loans and bonds -- which have become fragile after an unprecedented borrowing binge left investors with a hangover. Debt funds that financed more than $3.5 trillion of leveraged buyouts in the past decade have become pickier, leaving banks stuck holding more than $2 billion of unsold loans on their balance sheets as recently as last month.But a road map may be hidden in two other recent debt-fueled takeovers: Dell Technologies Inc.’s $67 billion takeover of EMC Corp. in 2016 and Charter Communications Inc.’s $78.7 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc. that same year.Representatives for KKR and Walgreens declined to comment.Buyout BlueprintJunk-rated Dell and Charter both borrowed heavily in the investment-grade bond market by issuing secured debt. T-Mobile US Inc. is going down a similar route to help pay for its purchase of Sprint Corp.In Charter’s case, it pledged security to new and existing bonds issued by higher-rated Time Warner to ensure the debt remained investment-grade. Dell used a similar strategy when it bought investment-grade rated EMC. Walgreens’s debt could be segregated into two borrowing structures at a holding company level and an operating company portion, with investment-grade debt placed on the latter.In doing so, Dell and Charter won access to the most stable part of the corporate debt market, where investors are still buying heavily as an alternative to low or negative-yielding assets elsewhere. At the same time, they limited their reliance on leveraged finance markets, where sentiment can shift quickly and prove costly.Both companies did tap those markets, but with more manageable offerings. Bankers who asked not to be identified estimated that Walgreens would be able to raise between $10 billion and $20 billion of junk-rated debt to fund a buyout.Other market participants, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly, said KKR still might need to find a deep-pocketed third-party investor to help put more equity into the deal.Or it may seek to spin off a portion of Walgreens to lessen its financing needs. The company’s European operations could potentially bring in $18 billion to $20 billion, CreditSights analyst James Goldstein said in a phone interview.&#92;--With assistance from Nabila Ahmed and Robert Langreth.To contact the reporters on this story: Natalie Harrison in New York at nharrison73@bloomberg.net;Lisa Lee in New York at llee299@bloomberg.net;Davide Scigliuzzo in New York at dscigliuzzo2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Shannon D.

2019-11-13	2019-11-13 12:00:07	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	For Streamers, the Great Unbundling Was Too Good to Be True	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Netflix Inc. broke the cable-TV bundle. Now it’s time to put it back together again, and cable giants like Comcast Corp. look eager to help.It’s true that streaming has created more choices for consumers. You don’t necessarily need to subscribe to a $100-a-month cable package just to access kid-friendly Disney programs or re-runs of “The Big Bang Theory” (or pay extra for the ability to DVR the episodes you’ll miss). There are on-demand apps for both of those now — Disney+, which launched on Tuesday, and HBO Max, which becomes available in May. At the same time, one major consequence of the streaming wars is that they’ve caused a new kind of consumer frustration. It feels like everything is becoming segregated across various services with their own individual paywalls. That requires knowing which TV programs and movies reside where, having to toggle among those different apps — which isn’t as smooth as simply channel-surfing — and managing multiple monthly subscriptions. Sign up for enough of them, and it can easily add up to the cost of good old cable, especially given that a strong internet connection is a necessary component. It’s a situation that’s unsustainable, and already the media and cable giants seem to be eyeing the reintroduction of bundles to make things easier on consumers (and to make their subscriptions stickier).As Comcast’s Matthew Strauss put it, &quot;The great un-bundling could give birth to the great re-bundling.” He should know. Strauss is the former executive vice president of Comcast's Xfinity Services; he was recently put in charge of Peacock, the company’s own streaming product set to launch in April with content provided by its NBCUniversal sports and entertainment division. It will join Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max and many more in the new streaming marketplace.&quot;How could someone possibly navigate all these apps? That's not how you watch TV,” Strauss said in a phone interview in September. “My prediction is that we're going to come full circle.&quot;Strauss and I were on the topic because Comcast had just made something called Xfinity Flex free to customers who subscribe to the company’s internet services but not its cable-TV packages. Flex is essentially a dashboard where users can access streaming subscriptions. It’s a lot like the home screen shown when powering up a Roku, Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV Stick — a display of tiles teasing different programs or services. The Xfinity X1 cable service is still front and center for Comcast, but Flex is a sign that the company is at least exploring how to cater to what may some day be a mostly internet-only customer base. While it may not be a bundle, it’s not hard to make the leap and envision a day when Comcast tries to offer bundles of streaming apps to its internet subscribers, serving as the go-between for programmers and customers just like it does in the cable world. Walt Disney Co. is already providing some evidence that it’s thinking the same way. As I noted in my column Tuesday, the entertainment giant recognizes that many viewers want more than a single app dedicated to superhero flicks and G-rated content. That’s why, alongside the launch of Disney+, it also began offering a $13-a-month bundle that tacks on Hulu and ESPN+. While Apple Inc.’s own original works such as “The Morning Show” can be watched with an Apple TV+ subscription, the company also has separately taken to aggregating rival apps in Apple TV Channels, where users can sign up on an a-la-carte basis. Similarly, Amazon.com Inc. has Prime Video and Amazon Channels. These aggregation efforts could all be precursors to bundling.Charter Communications Inc. CEO Tom Rutledge, during a September investor conference, discussed the challenges for so-called direct-to-consumer businesses — such as Disney+, CBS All Access, and so on — that traditionally haven’t had to deal directly with subscribers because the cable giants had typically maintained those relationships. Suddenly, programmers are having to handle billing and service issues and come up with customer-retention strategies. (Disney got a taste of this Tuesday, when its brand-new app was hit by technological glitches.) “All of those activities we do on behalf of traditional pay-TV vendors,” Rutledge said. It’s very hard to get “economies of scale in the direct-to-consumer marketplace like we’ve gotten out of the historic business.” That certainly sounds like someone who’s ready to negotiate some new distribution partnerships. Direct-to-consumer is industry jargon referring to how a streaming app bypasses the traditional distributors — flying directly past Charter and Comcast to the end user. So wouldn’t it be something if the winners of the streaming wars turned out to be none other than the cable companies? At the very least, remnants of their bundling model are sure to live on in streaming.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2019-09-25	2019-09-25 11:21:54	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	WeWork Gets Two New CEOs: “This Is Artie. He’s the Adult in the Room”	(Bloomberg) -- Years before he stepped down as chief executive officer of WeWork amid the wreckage of an over-hyped public offering, Adam Neumann was hosting an industry leader for an early lunch at the company's headquarters. It was the summer of 2017, and he brought the person over to the office of one of his deputies, Artie Minson. “This is Artie,” Neumann said. “He’s the adult in the room.”On Tuesday, Neumann resigned as CEO of We Co., WeWork’s parent company, and took the role of non-executive chairman, succumbing to mounting pressure from his board to relinquish power. The campaign to get Neumann to step aside came on the heels of reports of self-dealing and other governance issues that caused public investors to spurn the company, sending its expected valuation tumbling by billions of dollars.  Neumann has been replaced by Minson and another WeWork executive, Sebastian Gunningham, who are now co-CEOs of the troubled co-working giant. The two men, both with years of public company experience in various roles—but scant background in real estate—will seek to bring order to the chaos that has surrounded WeWork’s botched IPO.Insiders describe Minson, an accountant by training who is said to have a dry sense of humor, as the opposite of the extroverted Neumann, who is a natural showman with a propensity for lofty rhetoric. But Minson has a history with the company, having worked closely with Neumann for four years, most recently as the company’s chief financial officer. Gunningham, WeWork’s vice chairman, spent years at Amazon.com Inc. and Oracle Corp. before joining the startup.Now, the pair will be tasked with rallying WeWork’s employees, all of whom are accustomed to stagecraft from a charismatic founder with a penchant for hiring famous musicians to perform at company functions. And they must also soothe anxious investors, leery of the company’s huge expenses, its history of unconventional governance structures and persistent inability to turn a profit.“It is an incredible honor to lead WeWork during this important moment in the company’s history,” the two men said in a joint statement. “Our core business is strong, and we will be taking clear actions to balance WeWork’s high growth, profitability and unique member experience while also evaluating the optimal timing for an IPO.”On that summer morning in 2017, after he introduced Minson as the resident adult, Neumann and the visiting executive went back to Neumann’s office, where the CEO went on to say he himself had matured, according to a person familiar with the conversation who asked not to be identified discussing a private meeting. “You might have heard I like a shot of tequila in meetings,” Neumann said. “But I like to think I’ve grown up.”Instead of tequila, Neumann produced two bottles of single-malt scotch whiskey and meted out small shots. It was before noon.The AccountantArtie Minson, according to a person familiar with the company, is a polished executive who represents a “sober choice” for WeWork. Minson studied accounting at Georgetown University and earned his master’s in business administration from Columbia Business School. As an accountant, he worked at Ernst & Young before starting work in the media industry.Minson did a tour of New York media companies. That included work at Time Warner Inc. and at Rainbow Media Holdings Inc., where he was the senior vice president for finance. Later, as the CFO of AOL Inc., he oversaw that company's successful spinoff from Time Warner in 2009, following their 2000 merger. His last job before WeWork was as CFO of Time Warner Cable, which he left shortly after Charter Communications Inc. agreed to buy the company for $56 billion under his watch.Minson arrived at WeWork in 2015, starting out as the company’s president and chief operating officer, later becoming its CFO. He has acted as a close aide to Neumann, alongside Jen Berrent, WeWork’s chief operating officer.Despite Minson’s numbers-heavy background, he still has “the salesman capability,” said one person who knows Minson but who asked not to be identified speaking about private interactions. Minson would often crack jokes when talking with the investors and analysts at Time Warner Cable, the person said, and was more personable than a typical CFO.He’s “gregarious,” the person said, while remaining “very numbers- and operations-oriented,” making him a “solid person” to counterbalance Neumann’s ephemeral persona.A Tech VeteranAmazon veteran Gunningham represents the technical chops of the new executive team. He arrived at WeWork last year, after spending more than a decade at the retail giant, where he held a senior vice president role in which he reported directly to Jeff Bezos.  Gunningham grew up in Argentina and speaks fluent Spanish. He earned an undergraduate degree in math from Stanford University in 1985 and in 1989, he joined Oracle. Gunningham rose through the company’s ranks to run its Latin American division, based in Miami, before leaving to join Apple Inc. There, he helped the company break into corporate computing.It wasn’t all tech giants for Gunningham, though. He also ran a company called Peace Software that specialized in managing billing for utilities, and sold it to First Data Corp. in 2006. He joined Amazon the following year, back when the company still had a relatively flat structure. There, he built a sprawling organization to manage Amazon’s fast-growing third-party marketplace business. Later, he was responsible for implementing automation that made much of that operation obsolete.James Thomson, a partner at Buy Box Experts, who previously worked for Gunningham at Amazon, said his first reaction on hearing his old boss would be running WeWork was, &quot;Oh, finally there's an adult at the company.&quot; At Amazon, he recalls Gunningham as a formidable executive who typically seemed to know more about each manager's business group than the manager did—and asked sharp questions at meetings.In one meeting, Gunningham asked Thomson, who was behind on his goals for recruiting third-party sellers, if he had looked into using different types of search ads; Thomson hadn't. In another meeting two weeks later, Gunningham brought up the idea again, and Thomson said hadn’t had time to check. Gunningham said that he’d done his own research and came with thoughts on which types of ads to pursue and how.&quot;Everyone in the room is like, 'Damn, you got called out,'&quot; Thomson said. But Gunningham typically delivered the feedback in a calm, factual way, and wasn’t usually admonishing, Thomson said, making him well-liked among the rank and file.Despite his enormous personal wealth, Gunningham dressed casually. &quot;It was the same clothes as us, just really nice versions,&quot; Thomson recalled, noting the executive's premium jeans.Gunningham is said to have adopted some of the leadership tactics of Jeff Bezos, who famously asks employees to silently read “narratively structured six-page memos” at the beginning of meetings. Gunningham would ask for business proposals presented as written narratives, and could drill into the details. By the time he left Amazon, was in the top rung of management under, and was a key Bezos lieutenant.  In a letter to employees on Tuesday, Gunningham and Minson laid out how they would divide the roles of the chief executive. Minson will oversee finance, legal, human resources, real estate and communications functions, as well as corporate development, partnerships and ventures. Gunningham will focus on areas including WeWork’s product, technology, design and marketing. As the pair work to prepare WeWork for another run at the public markets, they vowed to “closely review all aspects of our company” and said they anticipated “difficult decisions ahead.” In the letter the co-CEOs implored employees to keep their focus on on WeWork’s customers and on their “day-to-day work,” adding “it’s more important now than ever.”(Adds detail on Gunningham’s management style)&#92;--With assistance from Spencer Soper and Ellen Huet.To contact the authors of this story: Sarah McBride in San Francisco at smcbride24@bloomberg.netGillian Tan in New York at gtan129@bloomberg.netMatt Day in Seattle at mday63@bloomberg.netMichelle Davis in New York at mdavis194@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Tom GilesFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wework-gets-two-ceos-artie-033648495.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-05	2019-09-05 12:33:09	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Hold Your Tears at T-Mobile’s Sprint Pity Party	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- T-Mobile US Inc. is trying to make the case that Sprint Corp. is on its deathbed, and that T-Mobile alone can save it. That’s rich coming from the company that happily helped put Sprint there. It’s also a misleading prognosis for Sprint. A Sprint pity party is one way T-Mobile is defending against a multi-state lawsuit that seeks to prevent the wireless carrier from taking over its weaker rival, and it used that reasoning in a court filing last week. Even though the deal already has the backing of the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission, 17 state attorneys general – who represent more than half the U.S. population – are challenging the transaction because of concerns that it will lead to higher prices, discourage innovation and hurt workers. Illinois, Oregon and Texas were the latest to join the now-bipartisan suit, whose trial date is set for Dec. 9. State officials are right to be concerned. T-Mobile and Sprint are the third- and fourth-biggest carriers, respectively, in a mainly four-carrier market. Lower prices and new features from them in recent years did a lot of good for customers, forcing industry leaders Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. to offer more competitive data plans. But without Sprint, there isn’t as much incentive for T-Mobile to keep prices down. In fact, for T-Mobile to close its profit-margin gap with the larger carriers, it more likely would need to do just the opposite. The DOJ is looking to wireless market newbie Dish Network Corp. to help preserve some equilibrium, putting Dish on the receiving end of the concessions that T-Mobile and Sprint are required to make. However, Dish is still years and multiple billions of dollars away from becoming a formidable competitor to fill the hole Sprint will leave behind. As such, the DOJ and the FCC may not be fulfilling their duties to promote competition and ensure that corporate tie-ups serve the public interest. T-Mobile’s argument is that if its deal gets blocked, Sprint is going to go away anyway. That’s a half-truth. I’ve written time and again about Sprint’s financial troubles and strategic missteps, including this series of charts showing just how ugly Sprint looks as a stand-alone. The data are almost sympathetic to T-Mobile’s case. But a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint doesn’t save Sprint. It does rescue an investment turned sour for many shareholders, especially a billionaire named Masayoshi Son. He’s the leader of SoftBank Group Corp., Sprint’s Japanese controlling shareholder, and he wants to remove any trace of his misguided optimism about Sprint from SoftBank’s balance sheet, equity valuation and image. SoftBank is retaining a 27% economic interest in the new T-Mobile, a superior operator on healthier footing.T-Mobile is casting itself as Sprint's savior, but T-Mobile CEO John Legere has been dancing on Sprint’s grave for years. Legere, a shameless yet successful self-promoter, often crossed the line in these instances beyond healthy competition, tweeting mean-spirited jokes about his rival going out of business. There were times he called Sprint “a melting ice cube,” said the company may have to resort to raising money on Kickstarter, and asked for “any guesses on what Sprint will fruckup today” (a swipe at Sprint’s “framily plan” promotion for friends and family). He used the hashtag SprintLikeHell. I’m not pointing this out for the sake of it or to say Legere is a big ole meanie. It’s more about this: While Legere was dissing Sprint, he continued to boast to investors that T-Mobile was actually posing serious competition for Verizon and AT&T – something he promises a combined T-Mobile-Sprint will also do. Except the data paint a slightly different picture. For years, T-Mobile regularly disclosed so-called porting ratios, which tell how many customers T-Mobile lost to another carrier and vice versa. For example, starting in 2013, its porting ratio with Sprint mostly held above 2 and at times went above 4 and higher, meaning that for every subscriber T-Mobile lost to Sprint, it gained four Sprint customers. T-Mobile will say that the overwhelming majority of its “porting” has come from Verizon and AT&T, but that’s explained by the fact that those companies have larger subscriber bases than Sprint does. The reality is that T-Mobile inflicted far more damage on Sprint than to what it calls “the duopoly,” as this chart shows:To be fair, T-Mobile isn’t the predominant reason Sprint is in such a desperate state now. Its problems date back to Sprint’s ill-advised merger 14 years ago with Nextel, a network that became a money pit for the company. And Sprint was never able to dig its way out from a mountain of debt, largely deal-related. Meanwhile, in 2011, regulators stopped AT&T from buying T-Mobile, a move that set T-Mobile up for a turnaround and to become the fastest-growing member of the industry. Had that deal gone through, consumers’ bills may have looked very different in the subsequent years.Going forward, if Sprint were to get any cheaper, other deep-pocketed buyers outside of the industry would likely surface, such as Charter Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and others. The idea of a cable giant owning Sprint might not seem like a better outcome, but it preserves a competitor in the wireless market and many more jobs. As the industry gears up for ultra-fast 5G wireless networks, there’s simply no way T-Mobile is the sole company interested in Sprint’s spectrum assets and subscriber base, even if its brand is beyond repair. So when T-Mobile tells a courtroom that Sprint needs it, you have to laugh.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2019-08-27	2019-08-27 13:34:17	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	OId Worries Are Dragging Down Disney Stock	The 2019 rally in Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock was long-awaited. Before bouncing about 35% in a little over four months, DIS stock had traded sideways for almost four years.Source: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.com What drove this year's gains was optimism surrounding the company's streaming offering, details of which were released in April. What kept a lid on DIS stock before that was fears about the company's media business, primarily cable network ESPN.Ahead of the company's disappointing, if not disastrous, fiscal third-quarter report this month, the market largely had forgotten about that worry. With streaming still years away from being a profit center, the recent reminder could lead Disney stock back to its rangebound ways.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips ESPN Still a Problem for Disney StockOver the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, Disney's Media Networks segment has contributed nearly half of the company's earnings. And that continues to be a risk to DIS stock.ESPN, in particular, has benefited from receiving over $9 per month per cable subscriber for its package of networks just in affiliate fees. Those fees are over half the segment's revenue -- and are still rising for now. In fact, they increased 20% year-over-year in the third quarter, per the company's Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow But that's not necessarily good news. Sixteen points of the increase came from the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox. Eight points came from rates, with a 2.5% decline in subscribers and a roughly one point loss from accounting changes.ESPN is raising affiliate fees because its rates are higher. But those higher rates are coming from contracts renegotiated years ago. That's going to change. The likes of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR), facing &quot;cord-cutting&quot; worries of their own, are not going to force subscribers who don't even watch sports to pay $10 a month for ESPN channels. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) already came close to an ESPN blackout at the end of last year.Advertising saw a similar trend in the quarter. Revenue rose 12% year-over-year. Growth to the tune of 24% in Cable Networks came from the addition of Fox, higher rates and higher impressions due to &quot;more units delivered.&quot; In other words, Disney networks simply ran more ads.  That's hardly a viable long-term strategy amid a proliferation of ad-free options. Viewership declined, and the numbers came despite two additional (and profitable) NBA Finals games in the quarter.At ABC, profits declined on the back of a whopping 11% decline in advertising revenue. Licensing sales fell as well. Other Risks to DIS StockThe story across the segment is similar. Outside of Fox, the media businesses are showing minimal growth at best -- which is driven by strategies not viable over the long term. Affiliate rate increases are going to slow, if not reverse. Subscriber declines will continue. Ad pricing can't rise in perpetuity. Disney cannot keep taking pricing enough to offset that pressure.That's hardly the only concerning aspect of the quarter. Weak visitation to new &quot;Star Wars&quot; properties led to disappointing numbers in the Parks business. Profits still rose 4%, but that was much lower than analysts and management expected.On the Q3 call, management tried to explain the lower-than-expected visitation. Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger posited that concerns about huge crowding may have dampened visitation. Increased hotel rates in the Anaheim area didn't help. Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy supported that contention by noting that paid attendance rose. It was season passholders to Disneyland who didn't show up -- likely because they figured the park would be packed to, or beyond, capacity.Those explanations may be correct. But there are still broader concerns about the business. Namely, can Disney keep raising ticket prices as it has for years now? And will a potential recession hit sales and profits in that segment?Fox, as even management admitted, had an underwhelming quarter. Disney had to raise its offer for Fox amid a bidding war with Comcast. The business's first full quarter under Disney's ownership was disappointing. That's a bad sign given the $71 billion price tag and the fact that Fox actually adds to the company's exposure to worrisome cord-cutting trends. Disney+ and the Bull CaseThe bullish retort to these concerns likely boils down to, &quot;So what? Disney+ is on the way.&quot; After the pullback in DIS stock, the company has a market cap of just under $245 billion. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) still has an equity value of $130 billion. It doesn't seem to take a lot of success in streaming for Disney+ to add material value to the Disney stock price.I get that argument to some extent. As I wrote earlier this year, even a detailed valuation of DIS stock shows that it probably comes down to streaming success.But I also argued that even an aggressive valuation suggested DIS was worth about $140 per share at most. Both streaming and the Fox deal have to add value. Fox's slow start raises risk on that front.And in terms of streaming, there are two concerns. The first is that, as Iger has pointed out repeatedly, it's going to take time for streaming profits to actually arrive. Disney is losing high-margin licensing revenue in the interim as it pulls back content from services like Netflix and funds losses in recently consolidated Hulu. It will take some time for the subscriber base to build to the point where those revenues are replaced.The second, related, issue is that it's not if Disney wasn't already monetizing its library through Home Entertainment (still a billion-dollar business) and content licensing. Disney+ is not purely incremental to existing profits. Rather, it's cannibalizing some of those profits.The direct-to-consumer offering may be more profitable, to be sure. (In fact, it likely will be more profitable.) But it will also lead to declines elsewhere in the business. The Bottom Line on Disney StockAnd so the risk to DIS stock is that the old worries and the new business combined can cause some hesitation on the part of investors. Media Networks profits are going to start declining. Parks earnings better not have peaked. Streaming will take years to prove itself.It's possible at the least that investors, as they did from 2015-2018, will lose patience. It's also possible, in a worst-case scenario, that Disney's consolidated earnings are going to head south. The third-quarter report raises the risk on both those fronts -- and suggests that patience might be advised.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-08-22	2019-08-22 18:55:27	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Phone Companies Strike Deal With States to Fight Robocalls	(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and 10 other large phone companies have struck an agreement with 51 attorneys general to enact technology to block robocalls before they reach consumers.The deal, announced Thursday, will help protect consumers from receiving illegal robocalls, and assist law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting bad actors, said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, who is leading the effort that includes all 50 states and the District of Columbia.Under the deal, the companies will launch the call-blocking technology at no cost to consumers, and make other free anti-robocall devices and apps available to subscribers. “By signing on to these principles, industry leaders are taking new steps to keep your phone from ringing with an unwanted call,” Stein said in a statement.The companies are under pressure to protect consumers against the unwanted calls, which are a top source of complaints with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Across the U.S. there were 48 billion robocalls last year, up from 31 billion in 2017, according to a tally by YouMail Inc., a developer of software that blocks the calls.In July, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile US Inc. said they were making progress toward installing technology to authenticate calls so consumers would know if the call is coming from the person supposedly making it. The FCC has demanded the technology be in place by the end of the year.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the agreements with the states “align with the FCC’s own anti-robocalling and spoofing efforts,” including the agency’s caller authentication standards.“Few things can bring together policy leaders across the political spectrum like the fight against unwanted robocalls,” Pai said in a statement. “The FCC is committed to working together with Congress, state leaders, and our federal partners to put an end to unwanted robocalls.”Consumers are often duped into answering phone calls because they appear to be from a local number or business.“The bad actors running these deceptive operations will soon have one call left to make: to their lawyers,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in the statement.Companies InvolvedThe other companies signing the agreement are T-Mobile, CenturyLink Inc., Comcast Corp., Sprint Corp., Bandwidth Inc., Charter Communications Inc., Consolidated Communications Holdings Inc., Frontier Communications Corp., U.S. Cellular Corp. and Windstream Holdings Inc.The FCC has demanded that carriers adopt the system to digitally validate phone calls passing through the complex web of networks. The agency also has said that providers may block calls, and cast a preliminary vote to require the digital authentication if carriers fail to install it by year’s end.Several of the top U.S. carriers issued statements in concert with the state attorneys general announcement. While the group on a whole backed the effort, there were few if any new, specific anti-spam call actions or timelines mentioned.“It’s imperative that we stand together on a common set of goals that include stopping callers from hiding their identities, working with other carriers on efforts to trace back illegal calls to the source, and keeping the originators from sending robocalls in the first place,&quot; Verizon said in a statement.“The fight against the scourge of illegal robocalls requires all hands on deck, and we welcome and appreciate the support of the state attorneys general,” AT&T said in a statement.(Updates with carriers and FCC comment beginning in seventh paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Erik Larson and Scott Moritz.To contact the reporters on this story: Jonathan Reid in Washington at jreid98@bloomberg.net;Susan Decker in Washington at sdecker1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, ;Keith Perine at kperine2@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth WassermanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phone-companies-strike-deal-states-185527845.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-08-22	2019-08-22 15:28:11	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	The Concerning Combination Pressuring Netflix Stock	Since its disappointing earnings report last month, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock has declined 17%. And the pressure hasn't let up of late: Netflix stock has reached its lowest levels since last December.Source: Flickr via Mike K.It's not difficult to see why. Netflix stock is a story based on subscriber growth, as I wrote after NFLX reported disappointing user metrics in last year's second quarter. And its numbers on that front were terrible in its recent Q2 report.With Netflix stock now back below $300, some investors might see a &quot;buy the dip&quot; opportunity at this point. The growth of streaming is going to continue, and NFLX remains the leader of that market. Indeed, I've recommended buying NFLX stock on weakness in the past;  in November, I called the stock the best contrarian bet in tech.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut this is a different situation. The selloff late last year was driven by external factors - most notably, a plunging stock market that dragged down many, if not most, highly-valued growth stocks with it. NFLX itself was performing reasonably well. And in fact, there was (and is) an argument that Netflix stock would benefit from a recession, which might accelerate cord-cutting as consumers look to save money.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More The recent selloff of Netflix stock is based on the company's performance, however. And as weak as that performance looked in Q2, when combined with what's going on elsewhere in the U.S. content sector, it's something close to disastrous. As a result, it can get worse before it gets better for Netflix, and for Netflix stock. Q2 Subscriber Numbers Hammer NFLX StockNetflix's headline numbers actually looked solid. GAAP EPS of 60 cents beat consensus expectations by 4 cents. Revenue of $4.92 billion rose 33% and was in-line with analysts' average estimates.But the subscriber figures were the big issue for Netflix stock, and led to a 10.3% decline by NFLX stock. Net paid subscriber additions of 2.7 million badly missed the company's guidance of 5 million. As a helpful chart in the Q2 shareholder letter showed, that was the biggest miss relative to guidance since at least the beginning of 2016.And it was the U.S. market that caused the miss. Netflix's  U.S. paid subscriber count actually declined in the quarter for the first time since 2011.That alone likely drove investors to flee Netflix stock. But NFLX has continued to fall, dropping another 8% from its immediate post-earnings levels. That continued decline may come from a growing realization that the quarter was even worse than investors initially realized. The Content Question for NFLX StockOne of the reasons that Netflix stock has been so divisive is that the company continues to burn cash. Its content spending is expected to come in above $15 billion this year.That spending makes some sense. Instead of licensing content - and paying for it annually - NFLX essentially is buying its content upfront. Free cash flow now might be negative, but if that content drives subscriptions down the line,  its free cash flow several years from now  will be higher, making the near-term investments worthwhile.But that strategy only works if subscribers will stay with NFLX for a long time, allowing that content to be monetized in future years. That alone makes the Q2 subscriber decline concerning. So does a widely-cited passage from the company's shareholder letter: &quot;We think Q2's content slate drove less growth in paid net adds than we anticipated.&quot;If that's the case, NFLX has a problem. It means the company can only keep adding subscribers if it continues to spend a great deal on content  That sounds an awful lot like the old joke about selling at a loss, and making it up on volume. If Netflix's  content budgets can't come down, free cash flow will stay negative or at best modestly positive. And that does not support the market capitalization of NFLX stock, which still sits at $130 billion. Where Are the Cord-Cutters Going?There's another major concern about Netflix's Q2 results. Specifically, Netflix's weak performance came at the same time that cord-cutting appears to have accelerated.Indeed, legacy cable companies had a horrible quarter. AT&T (NYSE:T) lost almost 1 million video subscribers. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) lost a combined total of nearly 400,000 viewers.Industry analyst MoffettNathanson called the quarter &quot;freaking ugly&quot; for cable companies and projected an unprecedented 5.5% cord-cutting rate in the quarter.So the question relative to Netflix numbers is: where are these subscribers going? One answer might be Hulu, now majority-owned by Disney (NYSE:DIS). At the Disney Investor Day in April, the company said Hulu had more than 25 million paid subscribers. Earlier this month, the company said the figure was &quot;approximately 28 million.&quot;Whatever the case, Netflix should have been set up to have a blowout Q2 on the subscriber front in the U.S. Instead, it posted a stunning decline. In that context, its performance looks even weaker, and more concerning, than a simple guidance miss. The Competitive Concern for Netflix StockI wrote ahead of NFLX's Q2 results that the earnings report was critical for Netflix stock. And a key reason is that new competition is on the way from Disney, AT&T, and Comcast.Netflix, in its shareholder letter, wrote that it didn't think competition was a key factor in the disappointing subscriber numbers. That may well be true. But competition will be a factor in 2020, when those streaming services - with a great deal of  content, backed by high marketing budgets - come online.And so investors can rightly wonder: if Netflix's U.S. subscriber growth is stalling out already, what happens when its competition increases next year? Real ConcernsNetflix stock bulls might respond that the U.S. isn't Netflix's only market. That's true: the company now has more subscribers overseas than in the U.S. More of its revenue comes from overseas as well.But about two-thirds of its profits still come from the U.S.. America is still the company's key market. And with NFLX stock trading at 53 times analysts' average  2020 EPS estimate,  a stumble in the U.S. is likely to prove damaging for Netflix stock.On the other hand, the company's Q3 guidance was strong, and it's possible NFLX can bounce back. But its Q2 performance raises real questions  and suggests more downside for Netflix stock could be ahead. It's the type of quarter that raises concerns about the company's overall strategy and market positioning, as well as the valuation of NFLX stock.And that's why it's been the type of quarter that leads not only to a big post-earnings decline, but more selling in the following weeks. Investors who buy the dip of Netflix stock do so at their peril.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-08-16	2019-08-16 20:17:03	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying or Selling	Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B, $198.31) Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett hasn't found much to his liking in 2019.The Oracle of Omaha bought and sold left and right at the end of 2018. He used the fourth quarter's near-bear market to snap up bargains and exit a few underperforming investments, amassing a total of 17 common-stock trades. But thanks to significantly higher prices across 2019, Buffett has dialed things down, making 10 such moves in Q1 and just six in the three months ended June 30.Nonetheless, we can gleam a few things from what Buffett is doing, so today we will take a look at the most recent changes to Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's own rules require Buffett to open up about these moves. All investment managers with more than $100 million in assets must file a Form 13F every quarter to disclose every change in stock ownership. That's an important level of transparency for anyone well-funded enough to significantly impact a stock with their investment. And in this case, it helps people who appreciate Buffett's insights track what he's doing - some investors view a Berkshire buy as an important seal of approval. (Just remember: A few of Berkshire's holdings are influenced or even outright decided by lieutenants Ted Weschler and Todd Combs.)Here's what Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was buying and selling during the second quarter of 2019, based on the most recent 13F that was filed on Aug. 14. The list includes six changes to the equity portfolio, and a notable seventh investment.

2019-08-01	2019-08-01 18:09:45	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Free Cable for Firehouses Put at Risk by FCC Vote	(Bloomberg) -- Cable systems around the U.S. provide towns and cities with public-access channels showing school board and city council meetings, as well as networks like one that keeps New York City’s firefighters connected to the internet.The services are provided for free, but that may be about to change. The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday decided that cable providers such as Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. should assign a value to the channels and data networks, and then reduce fees owed to localities by that amount. The proposal from FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who leads a Republican majority, succeeded on a 3-2 vote with both agency Democrats dissenting. Pai said cutting fees would leave more money for cable companies to invest in new services. “We will reduce costs for consumers and expedite the deployment of next-generation services,” Pai said.Mayors anticipate a squeeze to their budgets and expressed alarm at a change to arrangements negotiated in many cases long ago. “Local governments around the country would be forced to make difficult decisions,” cities including Atlanta, Boston, Dallas and Rye, New York said in a filing at the FCC.The decision “risks grave harms” to communities, said Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat.Thursday’s vote is another example of the FCC under Pai trimming local efforts to regulate phone and cable companies. Last year the agency limited localities’ power over cell tower sites, citing the need to spur growth of fast communications networks -- a priority backed by President Donald Trump.At issue are in-kind services that towns, counties and cities receive in addition to fees, which are capped at 5% of revenue. Examples of the services include discounts for seniors, channels for community use, and information networks that link government buildings.The FCC decided to classify in-kind offerings as fees, subject to the 5% limit.Cable providers back the move. The FCC’s anticipated action will “help rein in abusive practices and overreaching” by localities, NCTA – The Internet & Television Association, a trade group with members including Comcast and Charter, said in a filing. It cited what it called abuses that included a requirement in Minnesota to deliver cable service to municipal liquor stores and golf courses, maintaining fiber connections with local colleges in a Maryland county, and demands to extend service with 550 miles of new lines in Vermont.Cable operator Altice USA in a filing said because it needs permits to lay lines, it’s difficult to resist requests from municipalities. “The result is that the company is confronted with demands for payments or grant concessions above the cap” and “consumers bear the added cost,” Altice said.$3B in FeesThe cable industry pays about $3 billion annually in fees, the NCTA trade group said in a filing. The industry’s revenue was about $132 billion in 2018, according to statistics compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.Cities feel burned. Existing law lets cities impose both fees and obligations, and the FCC is muddling the two, the cities including Atlanta and Boston said in their filing. The U.S. Conference of Mayors on July 1 passed a resolution saying the FCC’s proposals “undermine local authority, turn public property over to private interests and remove longstanding community benefits.”The cities offered Dallas as an example, saying values placed by cable providers on community channels could be high enough to slash about $10 million from annual fees of around $12 million -- or even eliminate fees entirely.New York City will absorb “adverse and significant impact” from the change, Michael Pastor, general counsel for the city’s Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications, told the FCC in a July 25 filing. He didn’t provide an estimate of the potential cost to the city.As an example, the city’s information network feeds cable TV and internet service into every fire house in all five boroughs, and also carries public-safety messages, Pastor wrote.‘Very Concerning’There are no alternatives aside from building a parallel network that would take years “and cost a massive amount,” Pastor wrote. “The stark reality is that the cities will be forced to pay extortionate fees” because the alternative would be to disrupt municipal services, Pastor wrote.Democratic members of Congress had asked the FCC not to move forward.The change is “very concerning,” Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer, both Democrats, said in a July 25 letter to Pai.Local governments use 70 community channels across New York to show government proceedings and high school events, and the FCC rule “would undermine their ability to provide critical services to their communities by putting funding for these services at risk,” Gillibrand and Schumer said.Fifteen U.S. senators, including 14 Democrats and independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont, in a July 29 letter to Pai said the change puts localities in a no-win situation, needing to choose between requiring support for the community channels, or free cable service to schools and libraries.(Updates in second paragraph with vote.

2019-07-23	2019-07-23 10:53:42	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	AT&T Stock Won’t Be Saved by Friends, Time Warner Channels	With AT&T (NYSE:T) set to report its earnings on Wednesday morning, the results are very unlikely to boost AT&T stock. Nor, for that matter, should anyone expect the shares to jump meaningfully before mid-2020, at the earliest, Until that time, with AT&T stock facing multiple problems and lacking any significant, positive catalysts, investors should sell T stock.Source: Shutterstock For one, a dividend cut is certainly possible. With T stock's dividend yield topping 6% and AT&T owing a staggering total of nearly $196.5 billion as of the end of the first quarter, no one should be surprised if the company cuts its payout. Those who are bullish on T stock may note that the company's trailing-12-month operating cash flow was nearly $46 billion, but the company only had $6.6 billion of cash at the end of Q1, making its overall debt load rather heavy. The report that AT&T is looking to sell its Puerto Rico business indicates that it knows it badly needs cash.While cutting the dividend would provide the company with a meaningful amount of cash, it would also cause T stock to sink because the dividend haircut would make the shares less lucrative and greatly undermine confidence in AT&T stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Streaming Won't Rescue AT&T StockAT&T's upcoming streaming service -- HBO Max -- will feature programming from Warner Media (primarily TBS, TNT, HBO, and CNN) and movies, along with some original content. The online video service, slated to launch sometime next year, is expected to cost a lot more than the $13 per month that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) charges for its most popular plan.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Judging by the recent financial performance of its two main components -- HBO and the Turner legacy channels -- the appeal of HBO Max's primary content is declining. Mott Capital Management, writing on Seeking Alpha, noted HBO's Q1 top line dropped to $1.51 billion versus $1.62 billion in the year-earlier period, while Turner's revenue inched down to $3.44 billion from $3.45 billion. Ominously for AT&T stock, HBO's operating revenue reached its lowest level since Q2 of 2017.And from a common sense standpoint, it's hard to see how consumers will be convinced to pay more than Netflix is charging for Turner's reruns of worn-out sitcoms like Big Bang Theory, and American Dad, along with HBO, whose popularity is slipping, and CNN, by far the least-popular cable news channel. I know that Friends is the most popular show on Netflix, but I don't think many consumers are going to pay $15+ per month to watch the 20+-year-old Ross-Rachel saga. Only if HBO Max manages to develop a few new hit shows does the channel have any chance of moving the needle in a positive direction for AT&T stock by 2025, And, with all the competition out there, I wouldn't bet on that. Content Spending and Premium TV Results Are Worth WatchingOriginal content is not cheap, and the AT&T's investments in that area could spook investors, causing T stock to sink in the wake of the company's Q1 results. Another trend that may scare the market is continued, steep declines in the company's premium TV subscriber base. Premium video connections -i.e., consumers who are paying it for satellite and cable connections -- sank nearly 6.5% YoY to 22.4 million in Q1, Mott Capital's Michael Kramer noted. If that trend accelerated in Q2, T stock could take a big hit on Wednesday, and a dividend cut could happen sooner rather than later.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money)  5G Could Rescue AT&T Stock Down the RoadAT&T could use 5G, which will enable a variety of cool location-based services, as well as much faster downloads, to attract more wireless subscribers from smaller carriers. It could also use the technology to steal broadband internet subscribers from cable companies like Comcast (NYSE:CMCSA) and Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR). Finally, if AT&T can use 5G to provide more services to its subscribers, it could potentially squeeze much more revenue from them. Taken together, all of these attributes of 5G could meaningfully boost AT&T top and bottom lines, providing a much needed positive catalyst for T stock.But the company's 5G network isn't expected to roll out nationwide until early next year, and it will likely take the company time to market any new offerings that arise from it. So, for at least a year, 5G investments will weigh on T stock without producing any meaningful revenue for the company. Bottom Line on AT&T StockAT&T stock is facing multiple, negative catalysts, including steep pay TV subscriber and revenue losses, as well as high levels of investment in its streaming channel and in 5G. Moreover, its streaming channel probably won't be successful, and there's a good chance that it will cut its dividend. Although T stock could be rescued by 5G down the road, investors should stay away form the name for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, the author did not own any of the stocks named.

As T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. continue to fight in Washington for their long-awaited merger, the wily satellite-TV billionaire is the companies’ best hope for getting the deal through. Unless, of course, he walks away.Ergen, the 66-year-old chairman and co-founder of Dish Network Corp., has a reputation for being an finicky dealmaker, with a tendency to upset merger processes and then drop out. The former professional poker player would say he’s simply not afraid to fold his cards – or alienate his peers. Case in point: A few years ago, Ergen offered to buy both Sprint and Clearwire, which then turned into a bidding war against Sprint for Clearwire, a collection of wireless-spectrum assets. Ergen ultimately gave up on both pursuits, but not before driving Sprint to pay about 70% more than it initially bid. Sprint got Ergened. Back to present day, and what do you know: Sprint’s fate pretty much rests in Ergen’s hands, as the U.S. Department of Justice determines whether to approve or reject its $59 billion takeover by T-Mobile. Makan Delrahim, the DOJ’s head of antitrust, reportedly wants the companies to divest assets that could be used to create a new viable fourth competitor as a check on the industry’s pricing power. So Ergen, who had been among the merger’s biggest opponents, is now ostensibly ready to be the deal’s savior by acquiring those assets and committing to morphing Dish into a full-fledged wireless carrier. Maybe. Over the years, Ergen had gamed the government auction system to scoop up Dish’s own valuable spectrum licenses, which have a use-it-or-lose-it provision with nearing deadlines. Taking on the scraps from the T-Mobile-Sprint deal could ease that pressure and help Ergen make good on his promises to build a network. But if unnamed sources cited by the New York Post are to be believed, Deutsche Telekom AG, T-Mobile’s parent, is insisting it will only hand those assets to Dish if it vows not to sell more than a 5% stake in itself to a third party such as Google or Amazon.com Inc., which are two giant would-be threats to the industry.It makes sense that T-Mobile’s side would be worried about Dish teaming up with one of those deeper-pocketed companies, as I wrote last month. And agreeing not to do so certainly isn’t in Dish’s best interests. Ergen has said he needs a partner for Dish’s network build-out, which presumably would entail some sort of shared ownership.For that reason, Ergen could just walk away once again. Without him, there may be no T-Mobile-Sprint merger. After all, 13 states and the District of Columbia have sued to block the deal in a trial that may start in October. No deal could also mean T-Mobile turns to Dish to fulfill its spectrum needs.“Charlie is very hard to understand and predict,” billionaire dealmaker John Malone, owner of the Liberty media assets and director emeritus at Charter Communications Inc., said of Ergen a few years ago. “He’s very creative, but he’s a poker player.” (Ironically, Fox Business Network reported that because some at T-Mobile and Sprint are skeptical of Ergen’s dealings with the DOJ, they’re “praying” Charter and Malone will bid for the divested assets.)John Legere, T-Mobile’s outspoken and genial CEO, has been an ideal pitchman for the deal, smoothly handling inquisitions by Congress over the past year and constantly using his highly followed social media channels to promote the merger. But his style may be no match for Ergen’s whimsy. At the end of Legere’s latest episode of “Slow Cooker Sunday” this week – where he demonstrated recipes for Cajun corn on the cob and lemon feta drumsticks – the magenta-apron-wearing executive took a moment to make a wish. I think I know what it was. This may be the week that finally yields a decision from the DOJ, and what that decision will be is still anyone’s guess. But what I can say for certain is something I’ve said many times before: Good luck betting against Charlie Ergen. To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., media and telecommunications.

2019-06-18	2019-06-18 17:45:39	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Dish Is Near a $6 Billion Deal for T-Mobile, Sprint Assets	(Bloomberg) -- Dish Network Corp. is in talks to pay at least $6 billion for assets that T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. are unloading to win regulatory approval for their merger, according to people familiar with the matter.Dish could announce a deal as soon as this week for assets including wireless spectrum and Sprint’s Boost Mobile brand, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. The deal hasn’t been finalized and talks could still fall through, said the people.The potential divestitures are aimed at appeasing the Justice Department, which wants T-Mobile and Sprint to sell enough assets to ensure that the U.S. maintains at least four viable wireless players.Representative for Dish and the Justice Department declined to comment. Representatives for T-Mobile and Sprint didn’t respond to requests for comment.Dish rose 1.9% to $39.74 at 1:16 p.m. in New York trading, giving the Englewood, Colorado-based company a market value of about $18.6 billion. Sprint gained about 2.3% while T-Mobile rose 1.3%.T-Mobile agreed to buy Sprint in April 2018 for $26.5 billion, betting that together the carriers can build a next-generation wireless network to better compete with industry leaders Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc.Dish, co-founded by billionaire Charlie Ergen, had been on a shortlist of bidders for T-Mobile and Sprint assets favored by the Justice Department, people familiar with the matter said this month. Charter Communications Inc. and Altice USA Inc. were also on the list.T-Mobile and Sprint have already promised to sell Boost to get approval from the Federal Communications Commission. They also have to win over the Justice Department, which is concerned about the merger reducing the number of major U.S. wireless carriers to three.The companies are negotiating with the Justice Department after nine states and the District of Columbia sued to block the deal last week on antitrust grounds.(Updates companies’ share prices in fifth paragraph; adds background in seventh.)To contact the reporters on this story: David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.net;Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.net;Nabila Ahmed in New York at nahmed54@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Elizabeth Fournier at efournier5@bloomberg.net, ;Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Matthew MonksFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dish-near-6-billion-deal-174539270.html?.tsrc=rss

Stocks with market values of at least $50 billion tend to be bigger, more stable holdings. They tend to have stronger balance sheets and often pay dividends.When it comes to finding such stocks, there's no substitute for roll-up-your-sleeves fundamental analysis. Factors such as revenue growth, earnings estimates, profit margins and debt levels are just some of a long-term investor's most important tools. Traders and tactical investors might also consider technical analysis, which attempts to divine patterns from changes in a stock's price and volume.Then there's quantitative analysis, which takes a wide swath of fundamental, technical and other data, runs it through a mathematical model and calculates a recommendation. Quantitative analysis usually is the preserve of so-called quant funds, which guard their methods jealously. But thanks to StockReports+ from Refinitiv, we know what at least one quant model has to say.StockReports+ combines a weighted quantitative analysis of six widely used tools: earnings (including estimate surprises and analyst recommendation changes, among other factors; fundamental analysis, which encompasses profitability, debt and dividends, among other considerations; relative valuation, which looks at measures such as price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios; risk, which considers magnitude of returns, volatility and other factors; price momentum, which is based on technical performance factors such as seasonality and relative strength; and insider trading, which looks at whether top corporate executives have been net buyers or sellers of their company's stock.For mega-cap stocks, or stocks with market values of at least $50 billion, StockReports+ gives greater weight to price momentum and insider trading to calculate an optimized score, since those have proven to be important predictors of future performance. A score of 8 to 10 is considered positive, 4 to 7 is neutral, and 1 to 3 is negative.It's a lot to digest. But these are the top 10 mega-cap stocks to buy right now, based off their high marks from the quantitative analysis from StockReports+.

2019-02-26	2019-02-26 18:34:22	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	5 Stocks Seeing Insider Selling Right Now	Insider transactions can provide a valuable glimpse into how corporate insiders really view a company. As the famous saying goes: Actions speak louder than words. And the advantage here is that insiders such as executives and directors may well have a greater insight into the company and its outlook than the average investor.That's why tracking insider transactions - whether it's insider buying or insider selling - can be a valuable strategy. Especially when there are multiple insiders either selling or buying stocks around the same time.Today, we're looking at the TipRanks Daily Insider Transactions tool to highlight some of the stocks that have insiders heading for the door. This could be because they believe shares are trading at an attractive price and want to take profits - potentially before prices fall.Crucially, the insider tool we used here allows you to focus on only informative transactions - and therefore excludes uninformative transactions that do not necessarily indicate insider sentiment. For instance, some insiders simply exercise stock options ahead of expiry dates, which doesn't tell us much.With that in mind, here are five stocks seeing notable insider selling right now.

Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) reported earnings per share of $1.29 for the fourth quarter of the year. This is an increase over its earnings per share of $1.14 from the same period of the year prior. However, it was well below Wall Street's earnings per share estimate of $1.43 for the quarter, but that wasn't able to keep Charter Communications stock down on Thursday.

Net income reported by Charter Communications for the fourth quarter of 2018 was sitting at $296 million. The telecommunications company reported net income of $9.55 billion during the same time last year.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Charter Communications earnings for the fourth quarter of the year also includes revenue of $11.23 billion. This is better than the company's revenue of $10.60 billion reported in the fourth quarter of 2017. It was also a major boon to CHTR stock by beating out analysts' revenue estimate of $11.14 billion for the period.

The strong revenue in the Charter Communications earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2018 is thanks to a few things. This includes residential revenue growth of 3.9%, commercial revenue growth of 4.5%, and advertising revenue growth of 34.1% during the quarter.

CHTR stock was up 14% as of Thursday afternoon.

Charter Communications shares soar after revenue beat	Charter Communications Inc.&apos;s shares  rose 7% in premarket trade Thursday, after the broadband and cable operator posted stronger-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter. The company said it had net income of $296 million, or $1.29 a share, in the quarter, down from $9.53 billion, or $34.56 a share, in the year-earlier period. The huge decline in earnings was mostly due to the absence of a GAAP tax benefit from reduction in the deferred tax liability as a result of the late 2017 tax revamp. Revenue rose 5.9% to $11.2 billion. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of $1.47 and revenue of $11.1 billion. The company added 289,000 residential Internet customers in the quarter, bringing the total to 23.6 million. It added 207,000 residential customers in the quarter. But residential video customers fell by 36,000 to 16.1 million. Residential voice customers fell by 83,000 to 10.1 million.

2019-01-23	2019-01-23 15:57:04	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Volatile Viacom Stock Can Still Win on Content Strength	"If any company could use a firm, supporting hand, it's Viacom (NASDAQ:VIA, NASDAQ:VIAB). Most businesses at some point undergo a severe competitive threat, but the owners of Viacom stock have faced an existential crisis for a long time.

Buying the shares of media entertainment companies, including Viacom stock, is fraught with risk. Levered to viewer trends and preferences, these companies' metrics can change at a moment's notice. Before content streaming dominated the industry, Viacom banked on its marquee brands such as BET, Comedy Central and MTV.

But once the cord-cutting phenomenon gained significant traction, the company and Viacom stock suddenly appeared ancient. Over the last five years, VIA stock has hemorrhaged slightly over 60% of its market value. However, management hopes that its recent announcement will substantively change the narrative.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 7 Stupidly Cheap Stocks to Buy Now 



In an all-cash deal, Viacom will acquire streaming service Pluto TV for $340 million. Pluto TV is an interesting animal. Rather than deploying a subscription model like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or acting as an add-on feature to a traditional cable service, the company instead has adopted a free, internet-based platform.

For viewers, the major caveat is advertisements. Still, that's a small price to pay.

More importantly, the deal appears to be quite positive for Viacom stock. If VIA was to continue to focus on the increasingly antiquated-cable-TV model, its consumer base would eventually erode into nothing. Through this acquisition, Viacom improves its odds of remaining relevant for a sustained period of time.

In addition, the Pluto deal could enhance Viacom's negotiating position with TV carriers. According to CNBC, Viacom will let TV carriers like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) offer Pluto to their broadband-only customers.

### Viacom Stock Is a Bet on Relevant Content

Naturally, any investment in media content carries significant risk. As I mentioned above, changing consumer habits will hurt those who fail to stay relevant. At the same time, Viacom stock enjoys some noteworthy, and in some cases underappreciated, tailwinds.

First and foremost, VIA stock and its Class-B counterpart, VIAB stock, are incredibly cheap. Currently, the shares are trading for less than eight-times the company's trailing and forward earnings. Its recent volatility enabled what turned out to be a great swing-trade. And despite the subsequent bounce-back of VIA stock, Viacom's valuation is still quite low.

Another selling point is the company's leadership team. Although it doesn't have the best cards to play, it effectively utilizes the company's assets. Last summer, Viacom entered a partnership with Netflix. Under the terms of the agreement, Viacom provided content to the disruptive streaming company.

Some analysts criticized the deal because Viacom is essentially giving up its crown jewels. However, I argued that it's better to broadcast on a trending platform than to have exclusivity on a dying one. In the end, the company's financial results will likely confirm that management made the right decision.

Meanwhile, the revenue of Viacom's media networks division is holding its own, and its marquee programs resonate across demographic groups. For example, nearly 34% of MTV viewers are between 18 and 29 years old. But astoundingly, 31.3% of its viewers hail from the 30 to 49 year-old category.

Unlike for example Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) user base, we don't see a marked drop-off from Generation Z to older millennials. VIA is keeping its audience as they age, and that's obviously beneficial for Viacom stock.

### Beware of the Industry Risks Facing VIA Stock

If the content angle doesn't convince you of the merits of Viacom stock, then a potential Viacom-CBS (NYSE:CBS) merger might. This on-again, off-again topic has emerged as a viable and realistic possibility. If so, the combined entity could give VIAB stock fresh legs.

However, I'm leery about the wave of corporate consolidation. Recent data suggests that high-profile deals in the media space haven't produced good results. Simply put, industry giants are paying big bucks for diminishing returns.

And while Viacom has proven its relevancy to many viewers, the longer-term outlook of VIA stock and VIAB stock remains questionable. We can't ignore the fact that we live in a new era of media. It's not uncommon for a content producer on a (literal) shoestring budget to rake in bigger numbers than established competitors.

### The Bottom Line on Viacom Stock

I like VIA stock as a speculative opportunity, and you should treat it as such. Going beyond that level carries risks that I'm not willing to entertain.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The deal would create one of the largest telecommunications carriers in Latin America, giving the combined company more heft to compete with some of the biggest players in the region, such as America Movil (AMXL.MX), Telefonica SA (TEF.MC) and AT&T Inc (T.N).  Liberty Latin America, which is backed by U.S. media and telecommunications mogul John Malone, has been in talks with Millicom, a cable and mobile telephone operator in Latin America and Africa, about a deal for several weeks, and there is no certainty any agreement will be reached, one of the sources added.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-liberty-latin-america-bid-164548615.html?.tsrc=rss

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Charter’s scale

As shown in the chart below, Verizon (VZ) was the largest US telecom company as of January 9, with a market capitalization of $235.7 billion. It was followed by AT&T (T) at $219.1 billion. Meanwhile, Charter Communications’ (CHTR) market capitalization was $68.1 billion.

## Charter’s valuation metrics

Valuation is represented by price- and earnings-based multiples. On January 9, Charter’s TTM ( trailing-12-month) EV1-to-EBITDA multiple was ~9.49x, while AT&T’s, Verizon’s, Sprint’s (S), and T-Mobile’s (TMUS) TTM EV-to-EBITDA multiples were ~7.41x, ~7.44x, ~4.74x, and ~7.60x, respectively.

Charter expects its EV-to-EBITDA multiple to be ~8.86x in 2019 and ~8.24x in 2020. Its PE multiple is ~52.64x, and Charter expects it to be ~39.15x in 2019 and ~22.21x in 2020.

## Short interest ratio

As of January 9, Charter stock’s short interest as a percentage of float (or short interest ratio) was ~5.8%. A stock having a short interest ratio above 40% suggests investors and traders foresee a fall in its price.

## Charter’s video subscribers in Q4 2018

In the fourth quarter, analysts expect Charter Communications (CHTR) to report a net loss of video customers, due to stiff competition from low-cost video streaming services. In the third quarter, Charter lost 66,000 net residential video customers, compared with 104,000 in the same quarter of 2017. The company’s residential video subscriber base shrank ~1.6% YoY (year-over-year) to 16.1 million. US cable operator Comcast (CMCSA) lost 95,000 net residential video subscribers in the quarter ended September 30, and Frontier Communications (FTR) lost 37,000.

## Over-the-top market

Pay-TV operators, including Charter, are losing subscribers due to cord cutting. Customers are opting for lower-cost OTT (over-the-top) offerings, which provide content to consumers over the Internet, instead of cable TV or satellite connections. 

Alphabet’s YouTube TV, Amazon’s Prime Video, and Netflix (NFLX) are leading OTT providers. In the quarter ended September 30, Netflix gained 7 million subscribers worldwide.

2019-01-10	2019-01-10 14:00:16	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	What’s Next for Discovery after Its PSG Takeover?	"How Legacy Media Players Are Surviving in a Changing Industry

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Discovery increases its stake to 71%

Discovery (DISCA) has taken control of PSG (Play Sports Group) after raising its stake in the cycling-focused digital media company to 71%. Discovery previously owned a 20% stake in PSG.

PSG describes itself as the world’s top digital sports media company focused primarily on cycling and tri-sports. It’s the name behind cycling brands such as the Global Cycling Network and the Global Mountain Bike Network. PSG operates eight cycling video channels that reach more than 45 million viewers every month and have attracted more than 3.1 million subscribers.

## Discovery seeking a larger piece of the $50 billion market

Discovery is betting that taking a controlling stake in PSG will allow it to create a global ecosystem of community, content, and events for cycling enthusiasts. At the end of the day, Discovery sees a deeper relationship with PSG allowing it to capture a bigger share of what it says is a $50 billion global cycling sports market.

The PSG team is set to join Discovery as the company sets up a new global cycling-focused division. PSG will operate as a subsidiary of Discovery.

## Revenue jumped 57%

Discovery generated $2.6 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 57% YoY (year-over-year). The Walt Disney Company (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA), and Charter Communications (CHTR) grew their revenues 12%, 5.0%, and 4.2% YoY, respectively, in the third quarter. Revenue rose 4.1% YoY at Altice in the third quarter.

2019-01-10	2019-01-10 12:30:47	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Behind Charter’s Efforts to Drive Broadband Gains	"How Legacy Media Players Are Surviving in a Changing Industry

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Broadband revenue rose 7.2%

Charter Communications (CHTR) has tapped CUJO AI as its network intelligence solutions partner. In this position, CUJO AI will enhance security and privacy for Charter’s more than 24 million broadband customers. CUJO AI says its helps Internet service providers reduce costs, save time, and deliver additional value to their customers. With this in mind, Charter can be seen betting on its relationship with CUJO AI to cut costs and improve customer retention.

With the rise of cord-cutting, cable companies such as Charter are increasingly leaning on their broadband businesses to offset pay-TV losses. Charter’s broadband revenue jumped 7.2% YoY (year-over-year) to $3.8 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Comcast (CMCSA) and Altice USA (ATUS) grew their broadband revenues 9.6% and 10.8% YoY, respectively, in the third quarter.

## Selling broadband services to cord-cutters

Charter lost 66,000 pay-TV customers in the third quarter of 2018. AT&T (T), Dish Network (DISH), and Comcast lost 346,000, 341,000, and 106,000 pay-TV customers, respectively, in the third quarter.

Many cable companies are keen on keeping cord-cutters on their broadband services, which explains why they’re investing in boosting their broadband speeds and enhancing the customer experience, like Charter is trying to do with CUJO AI.

In the pursuit of broadband revenue, cable companies are not only competing among themselves but also battling wireless providers such as Verizon (VZ) and AT&T, which are building ultrafast 5G networks to allow them to better compete in the broadband market.

2019-01-09	2019-01-09 15:25:02	CHTR	Charter Communications, Inc.	Why Comcast Dropped Fuse	Comcast (CMCSA) dropped its Fuse network at the start of 2019, ending a carriage relationship that had been more than a decade long. The decision to drop Fuse came after Comcast noted that its programming was similar to content on other networks that it also carried, Deadline reported. Dropping Fuse looked like a move by Comcast to eliminate programming duplication to allow it to deliver a better experience for its TV customers.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f4535a29-2fb8-3a8a-99a6-a6c4b5e1328f/why-comcast-dropped-fuse.html?.tsrc=rss

The 25 Biggest U.S. IPOs of All Time	"Initial public offerings (IPOs) are the process companies use to tap the public stock markets for capital. They usually involve early-stage businesses that are looking for fresh fuel for growth; many are small opportunities, but a few have mammoth potential. IPOs aren&apos;t guaranteed tickets to riches, as implosions such as Pets.com and Webvan proved. But they can produce explosive returns, and in a hurry. Through the end of September, 38 offerings had produced returns of 50% or more. One thing 2018 has lacked, however, is the mega-deal - an offering such as Facebook (FB) or Alibaba (BABA) that sets the world on fire. That should change in 2019.  Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of ride-hailing service Uber, says the company expects to execute an IPO next year. &quot;Uber is a widely known brand that connects with millions of consumers and they have also received large amounts of capital from investors over the years,&quot; says Scott Coyle, CEO of ClickIPO, an online platform that allows retail investors to purchase IPOs. No wonder then, that 
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> reported that proposals from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley valued the company at more than $120 billion. Given that IPOs often raise about 10% to 15% of their projected worth, that could be a $12 billion-$18 billion raise. Where would that rank among America&apos;s biggest IPOs? Today we&apos;ll look back on the 25 biggest deals in U.S. history, as measured by money raised.

As phone companies and cable operators continue to be under pressure from Netflix (NFLX) and the other “over-the-top” services, the really bad news for the media and telcos is a slowing of capital returns, writes Jefferies & Co.’s John Janedis, who yesterday took over coverage of AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), Comcast (CMCSA), and Charter Communications (CHTR) from his colleague Scott Goldman.  In a report, Janedis kicks off his coverage with a Hold rating on AT&T, Verizon and Charter, and a Buy rating on Comcast, though all four seem frankly at risk of slowing payouts to shareholders, in the form of dividends and buybacks that may not have much upside from current levels.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5b42ff2f-2178-3344-8bd4-30973b639f5a/will-investors-stick-around.html?.tsrc=rss
