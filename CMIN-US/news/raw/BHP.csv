2021-05-27	2021-05-27 09:54:27	BHP	BHP Group	BHP Is in Talks With Nutrien on Giant Potash Mine	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group is in talks with Nutrien Ltd. about a potential partnership in its massive Canadian potash venture as the world’s biggest mining company moves closer to a final decision on the project.The pair are discussing multiple options, including Nutrien becoming the operator and selling the potash through its existing channels, or the Canadian company taking a stake in the Jansen mine, according to people familiar with the matter. There is no guarantee the talks will lead to a deal, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private.A deal would offset BHP’s financial and operational risk, said Gavin Wendt, founding director and senior resource analyst at Mine Life Pty. “It’s a large-capex project and BHP is new to the potash space. It makes sense for it therefore to utilize Nutrien’s industry knowledge, where it is the world’s biggest fertilizer distributor.”BHP has struggled with the Jansen project for years. Despite spending about $4.5 billion and digging two 1,000-meter (3,300-feet) deep shafts, it has yet to approve construction and has faced investor opposition. The miner has said it will decide around mid-year on whether to approve a further $5.7 billion in spending to bring Jansen into production.Major potash producers could expect greater price certainty if a BHP-Nutrien deal goes ahead, “and keeps new tons marketed within the existing global structure,” said Bloomberg Intelligence industry analyst Jason Miner. “A potential Nutrien deal could lift the cloud BHP’s Jansen mine has long cast over this market,” he added.BHP has repeatedly said it’s open to bringing a partner into the project, especially one with expertise in the fertilizer market or potash. While that’s a product it currently doesn’t mine, the Melbourne-based miner sees potash as a potential cornerstone of its future business, helping to feed a growing global population as the pressure on agricultural land increases.Spokespeople for BHP and Nutrien declined to comment.“We continue to like potash. We think the long-term demand and supply fundamentals for potash are attractive,” BHP Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry said at a conference last week when asked about the project. “We’ve always said we’re open to partnering, but the project doesn’t need a partner to proceed.”Nutrien shares in Toronto rose 1.5% to C$73.90 ($61) on Wednesday. BHP shares rose as much as 3.4% in London on Thursday after gaining 1% in Sydney.Changing ToneShould an agreement be reached with BHP, it would mark a sharp reversal in Nutrien’s attitude. The company has been an outspoken critic of the project for years, saying its development would flood the market with unneeded potash. Yet Nutrien’s tone has changed since Mayo Schmidt replaced Chuck Magro as CEO earlier this year.Nutrien -- formed in 2018 from the merger of two large Canadian agriculture firms, Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan and Agrium Inc. -- said this month that the market could cope with the tons from Jansen if mined in a “disciplined” way. The price of potash tumbled to 10-year lows in April last year amid the pandemic, but has since recovered as a global rally in food prices boosted demand.BHP’s willingness to explore partnership options with an established producer such as Nutrien would indicate that it’s working to limit potential market disruption that could be caused by Jansen, RBC Capital Markets analyst Andrew Wong said in a note. That’s “incrementally positive to the longer-term potash market outlook,” he said.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-talks-nutrien-giant-potash-214304735.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-26	2021-05-26 13:18:05	BHP	BHP Group	BHP Chile Control Staff to Strike in Threat to Copper Supply	(Bloomberg) -- Workers at BHP Group’s operations center in top copper producer Chile rejected the company’s latest wage offer, paving the way for a strike to begin on Thursday. BHP may be able to continue mining and processing during a stoppage at the center, although not at full capacity, Union President Jessica Orellana said in text messages. BHP didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Copper futures were up 0.4% at 2:10 p.m. in London.The more than 200 union members provide control services to the giant Escondida and Spence copper mines from a center set up two years ago in Santiago, several hundred miles away. A sticking point in the talks is the workers’ demand to be considered part of the productive chain and therefore eligible for output bonuses.When the center was set up, staff became BHP Chile employees rather than part of the workforce of the mining units. Unions at Escondida have expressed support for the operations center staff, saying they will resist any efforts to replace them during a strike. Members voted against the proposal after a five-day government mediation period ended Tuesday. The impasse offers an indication of how talks may evolve with the main unions at the two mines. Workers at Spence will vote on a offer this week, while Escondida employees are due to begin negotiations in June.A slew of contract negotiations at Chilean mines is part of the supply risks that have helped push up copper to a record as recovering economies spur demand. Surging prices and a sharp turn away from the political establishment may further embolden unions in a country that accounts for more than a quarter of mined copper.Still, BHP reached a wage deal this week with supervisors at Cerro Colorado, the smallest of its three Chilean copper mines.(Adds union comment.

The world's biggest miner has imposed the policy across its Australian operations on health and safety grounds. The new rules that apply from July 1 for workers and contractors who live on site at remote mines also limit them to four drinks a day. However, workers say the rules are inconsistent and infringe on their rights to privacy and a social life outside working hours. Shane Roulston of the Australian Workers Union said: ""If there are issues with some staff, they need to be managed, rather than penalising all the rest of the workers.

2021-05-21	2021-05-21 00:03:49	BHP	BHP Group	Giant New Iron Ore Mine May Aid China’s Push to Cool Prices	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group’s start up of production at its $3.6 billion South Flank project in Australia -- combined with existing operations at the site -- will create the world’s biggest iron ore hub. It may also help temporarily cool a hot market.Iron ore futures are trading below $200 a ton after China’s cabinet called for tougher oversight of commodity markets and protection for consumers from soaring prices. While South Flank was a replacement mine, the announcement of a big mine coming on stream can add short-term to negative market talk, according to Peter O’Connor, mining analyst at Shaw & Partners Ltd.Commodities have tumbled as international markets are gripped by inflation fears and the authorities in Beijing continue to try to jawbone and manage prices lower. China’s cabinet expressed concerns Wednesday about the surge in prices for a second week in row, calling for more effort to curb “unreasonable” gains and prevent any impact on consumer prices. The meeting, chaired by Premier Li Keqiang, also called for a crackdown on speculation and hoarding.Against this backdrop, where steel margins were getting compressed in China and Li was trying to talk commodities down, “it weighs on that narrative as opposed to really weighing on the market,” O’Connor said. “But when you get these sort of extremes -- that subjective narrative can be a key driver.”South Flank has been built to replace the depleting Yandi mine -- and together with the existing Mining Area C -- will form a hub with annual production of 145 million tons a year. South Flank’s higher quality product will also lift the average iron ore grade across BHP’s Pilbara operations. In the short-term, there was potential for a squeeze higher in BHP’s ore exports as South Flank and Yandi operated in tandem, although the overall physical impact on the market was likely to be small, said O’Connor.The start of production of 80 million tons a year at South Flank, matching Yandi, comes at a time when top exporters Australia and Brazil have been challenged in meeting strong demand from Chinese steel mills. Pilbara shipments were down 6% in April compared to the year-ago period, while Brazil’s exports were flat, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. BHP’s current guidance is for annual production at the upper end of its range of 276-286 million tons.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/giant-iron-ore-mine-may-000349223.html?.tsrc=rss

That will eventually add 80 million tons of annual supply at what he called a “perfectly timed” moment, given prices are near record levels.The ore is holding above $200 a ton despite last week’s wild price gyrations, as investors eye the strength of China’s steel markets and a push by Beijing to cap commodity prices. Steel prices are weakening, with rebar and hot-rolled coil both resuming falls from all-time highs.Also on Wednesday, the steelmaking hub of Tangshan announced fresh curbs, including ordering sintering units to stop work from midnight to 10 a.m., May 18-20, Mysteel reported. Its the latest in a series of measures targeting the city, which last week banned mills from fabricating or spreading price-hike information after Premier Li Keqiang earlier urged China to deal with surging prices.The futures in Singapore fell 4.2% to $205.10 a ton by 3:25 p.m. local time, while futures on China’s Dalian exchange closed down 4%.Iron ore rocketed to a record this month amid the booming steel markets in China and a recovery in global steel demand. Investors are watching for any signs that high prices spur a supply response from previously unprofitable mines. China said Tuesday it would encourage more domestic output to steady the market.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iron-ore-halts-two-day-035858689.html?.tsrc=rss

Under Chilean labor rules, BHP now has the right to call for five days of government mediation that could be extended another five days if both parties agree.The workers provide control services to the Escondida and Spence copper mines from a center set up in mid-2019 in the Chilean capital several hundred miles away. While a strike may disrupt operations and stoke concerns over tight global supplies of the metal, BHP may opt to bring in replacements to keep the center running.A key sticking point in the wage talks is the workers’ demand to be considered part of the productive chain and therefore eligible for production bonuses, union President Jessica Orellana said. When the center was set up, staff members became BHP Chile employees rather than part of the workforce of the mining units.The negotiations are part of a busy season of wage talks in the Chilean copper industry, which accounts for more than a quarter of global supply. The risk of stoppages comes at a time of strong global demand as economies recover from the pandemic. Copper futures hit a record high on Monday.Without confirming that it planned to request mediation, BHP Chile said by email that it “trusts that a satisfactory agreement will be reached for both parties.”(Adds company comment in last aragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-remote-copper-operators-move-193420812.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-11	2021-03-11 05:55:09	BHP	BHP Group	Green Metals Hunt Draws World’s Biggest Miner to Frozen Tundra	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group is moving its exploration headquarters to Toronto in the latest move by the world’s top miner to focus its growth pipeline on future-facing minerals such as copper and nickel.The switch to Canada’s most populous city comes after BHP last August entered a partnership with Midland Exploration Inc. to undertake nickel exploration in the far north of Quebec province, where average winter temperatures are close to minus 30 Celsius (-22 Fahrenheit). BHP is also supporting Midland’s hunt for copper in the same region.“Nickel is fast becoming the ‘work horse’ of battery technology, playing an essential role in the world’s efforts to decarbonize,” BHP’s Chief Technical Officer Laura Tyler said in a speech to a mining conference in Toronto. She forecast a “golden age” for exploration in the years ahead, where innovation and new technology would help to unlock resources of the future.Spending on exploration in global minerals powerhouse Australia -- BHP’s home base -- rose in the December quarter to its highest in over seven years amid mounting talk that the commodities complex is entering a new supercycle. This is spurring miners to seek new deposits across the globe of the minerals that will drive the clean energy transition, including nickel and copper.“We’ve been very clear that we want to secure more options in future-facing commodities,” BHP CEO Mike Henry said on a shareholder call on Thursday. Current high asset prices were making value-adding acquisitions in those sectors unlikely, Henry said, adding that would mean even more focus on exploration to unlock new resources.Nickel production would need to increase nearly fourfold to meet forecast demand for electric and hybrid vehicles, Tyler said Wednesday. Likewise, copper output would also need to grow exponentially to meet demand from sectors including renewable power generation and fast-charging infrastructure.BHP expects to have around 50 staff in the Toronto office, including the senior exploration leadership team. The unit was previously based in Santiago, Chile, and the new location, closer to the company’s main markets, is expected to open up more opportunities in funding and recruitment.“To own the best assets in the best commodities, you have to look for them and develop them well ahead of time,” Tyler said. “To do so, we need to imagine what the world could look like in 50 or even 100 years from now.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/green-metals-hunt-draws-world-055509793.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-01	2021-03-01 12:00:00	BHP	BHP Group	Five Years Into Default, a BHP-Vale Bond Is Suddenly Soaring	(Bloomberg) -- One of the hottest trades in emerging market debt hasn’t paid a penny of interest in five years.Prices on the defaulted bonds issued by Samarco Mineracao SA, the Brazilian iron ore mining venture jointly owned by Vale SA and BHP Group Ltd., have skyrocketed to 83 cents on the dollar from just 34 cents at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, handing creditors a return of 144%.There are a handful of factors driving the rally: Iron ore prices are surging; Samarco officials have begun prepping a debt restructuring plan; and the mine is finally producing again, albeit at a fraction of the levels it was at before a 2015 dam burst that killed 19 people and wiped out much of two villages downstream.But still, even at a time of wild froth in global financial markets, the sheer scope of the gains is somewhat perplexing. The bonds had only traded a few pennies higher in the days prior to the catastrophe. The bankers advising Samarco and its shareholders have been taken by surprise. They see the 83-cent price as being markedly higher than the amount that will be offered in the restructuring, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified.The only way the current price would make sense, they said, is if Vale and BHP were to inject fresh capital into Samarco to help pay back the debt, something they insist will not happen. The company needs to shrink its $3.8 billion debt and adjust its payment schedule to reflect its new smaller size, they said.Bankers are clearly trying to temper expectations -- but investor interest in the bonds remains high. A difficult debt restructuring negotiation may be resuming soon.“Bondholders simply won’t accept a haircut because Samarco has two healthy shareholders that they believe could inject money,” said Carlos Gribel, a managing director at Andbanc Brokerage in Miami. “To compromise they could agree to a delay on payments, for instance.”BHP, Vale, Samarco and New York-based investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc., which is advising a group of bondholders, declined to comment.To put the defaulted bond rally in perspective, an average of emerging market materials bonds have returned about 33% since April 7 while Brazilian government notes have returned 11%, according to Bloomberg Barclays indices. Iron ore prices have jumped more than 10% this year alone.Some creditors aren’t willing to wait for an out-of-court restructuring and are pursuing their claims in court.A group of Samarco bondholders filed a lawsuit in New York in October asking the firm to fork over $2.7 billion in principal and interest on the defaulted notes. Davis Polk & Wardwell is representing the creditors in New York while Samarco is being advised by Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP.Some litigants pursuing export prepayment loans have been more successful in Brazil.Judge Jeferson Maria in Belo Horizonte ruled on Feb. 8 that Samarco needs to pay a promissory note of $125 million which matured on Dec. 3 to York Global Finance BDH, LLC. The notes were used as collateral in a loan from Mizuho Bank Ltd. in 2013 that was sold to York in June 21 2018, according to court documents. The company can still file a motion to stay the enforcement proceeding.Padis Mattar Advogados and Ferro, Castro Neves, Daltro & Gomide Advogados are representing York in Brazil, while Cescon, Barrieu, Flesch & Barreto Advogados is representing Samarco.Some creditors of another $1.6 billion of export prepayment loans and other obligations are planning to go to court in Brazil after the success on the first lawsuit, one person said. They are mostly investment funds, after banks sold most of their holdings.Ahead of a new round of restructuring talks expected on the $2.2 billion of bonds maturing in 2022 and 2024, a group of creditors is being advised by Houlihan Lokey. Samarco is getting advice from JPMorgan Chase & Co., Vale is working with Moelis & Co. and BHP with Rothschild & Co.Depending on how the lawsuits play out, Samarco may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection against creditors in Brazil, three of the people said, while adding that this isn’t the most probable outcome for now. Samarco is prepared to go to court if its cash gets seized by creditors or if operations are harmed in any way by lawsuits, the people said.On Feb. 4, Vale announced a 37.7 billion reais ($7.03 billion) settlement agreement with Brazilian authorities for a separate dam collapse that killed 270 people in 2019.“The timing for Samarco to restructure all its liabilities is very good right now, since the company is back producing, the real is weak and prices of iron ore and pellets had an amazing rally,” said Rafael Fritsch, chief investment officer for distressed-asset funds at Sao Paulo-based Canvas Capital SA, which holds Samarco debt.“The firm’s two shareholders have resolved some of their legal issues and have clear business plans, and that adds to the optimism,” Fritsch said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/five-years-default-bhp-vale-120000969.html?.tsrc=rss

Not Exactly	(Bloomberg) -- A surge in commodity prices has Wall Street banks gearing up for the arrival of a new supercycle, but underlying dynamics suggest it isn’t going to be a repeat of the epic China-led boom at the start of this century.Copper heading for new all-time highs, surging agricultural markets and oil prices back at pre-Covid levels are driving excited talk as economies, juiced by massive stimulus, rev up after Covid-19 lockdowns. The theory is that this could be just the start of a years-long rally in demand for raw materials across the board.But there are conundrums at the center of longer-term term forecasts. For example, the energy transition that heralds a bright new age for green metals like copper would be built on the decline of a key commodity: oil.And as investors flock back to markets like copper in anticipation of a growth-led bounce in inflation, policymakers and economists alike are increasingly alert to the consequences of higher food and fuel prices.While definitions vary, a supercycle is generally viewed as a sustained spell of abnormally strong demand growth that producers struggle to match, sparking a rally in prices that can last years or in some cases a decade or more.For some analysts, the current broad rally is rekindling memories of the supercycle seen during China’s rise in the early 2000s. But on closer scrutiny, the outlooks for individual commodities are diverging. While it could take copper miners a decade to tap new deposits to meet demand, oil producers from the Permian to the Persian Gulf may prove more nimble, imperiling long-running price gains.The differing fortunes for oil and metals are already evident in equity markets, with BHP Group Plc, the world’s largest miner, overtaking Royal Dutch Shell Plc as London’s biggest listed company.“Copper is a proper growth market, hands down; oil is not,” said Michael Widmer, head of metals research at Bank of America in London. “It doesn’t necessarily have to be bearish for oil, but it’s a very different dynamic.”Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America see copper moving back toward all-time highs above $10,000 a ton, and many of the hard yards have already been done. It’s doubled from lows in March to above $9,000, fueled by bets that demand will spike as the world recovers from the pandemic and governments plough cash into electric-vehicle infrastructure and renewables.Oil’s rallied too -- to above $60 a barrel -- as collapsed demand comes back quicker than a deeper and more enduring supply shortfall. Goldman sees it hitting $75 within months, but long-term gains hinge largely on supply continuing to shrink faster than demand as the energy shift gathers pace.Rallying oil prices are hard for producers to resist. OPEC and its allies had about 9 million barrels a day of spare capacity offline last month. That’s 10% of current global supply. If prices keep rising, there’s little incentive for the group -- or its rivals in countries like the U.S. -- to keep barrels on the sidelines.And then there are agricultural commodities that are ruled by their own dynamics. Soybeans and corn have rallied to multi-year highs, driven by relentless buying by China as it rebuilds its hog herd following a devastating pig disease. But much depends on when purchases from China will slow.Just like in oil, the supply response has become quicker. Seed development means farmers are getting better yields, and crops aren’t as vulnerable to the weather as they used to be.The U.S. Department of Agriculture is already expecting record combined plantings of corn and soybeans this year, and executives from some of the world’s top agricultural commodities traders expect gains to last another year or two.That’s left many advocates for a new commodities bull run honing in on metals, where rallying prices have led to supercharged profits and record returns for miners.BHP and Rio Tinto Plc handed out $14 billion in dividends last week, but those profits are being generated mainly by iron ore, rather than the more forward-looking commodities such as copper or nickel that some on Wall Street see driving the next supercycle.And while both have big growth plans in copper, they’re much more cautious on the outlook for other parts of their portfolio. BHP expects steel demand to grow at a similar rate to the global population. It’s a similar story for coal and oil, with the biggest companies in both looking to curtail, not grow, production.That’s a stark contrast to the start of the last supercycle, when iron ore, coal and oil were the chief beneficiaries of China’s industrial expansion. Those markets dwarf copper in scale, while key battery materials such as lithium that are driving much of the latest hype are smaller still.The narrower commodity effect from a new green boom is reflected in the heavy caveats offered by analysts. Citigroup sees a supercycle in copper and aluminum, but more fleeting returns elsewhere. Others including BMO Capital Markets say that while demand could outpace supply for some time, the mismatch won’t last long enough to justify predicting a supercycle.And even those who are universally bullish on commodities could end up being right for now, even if it doesn’t turn out to be a supercycle. Ultimately, for investors, the long-term discussion may be academic as they pursue the opportunities that exist in the here and now.“Sometimes the world is just simple,” said Luke Sadrian, a fund manager at Commodities World Capital, who’s been involved in metals markets since 1991. “I’m having the best month of my entire career this month, stuff is moving around that much.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/supercharged-commodity-boom-definitely-supercycle-050000390.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-16	2021-02-16 08:05:29	BHP	BHP Group	BHP Lifts Outlook, Pays Record Dividend During Supercycle Talk	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group boosted its outlook for the global economy as the Covid-19 vaccine rollout gathers pace, backing its optimism by rewarding investors with a record $5.1 billion first-half dividend.The world’s biggest miner reported a 16% increase in first-half profit, and said it will pay a record interim dividend of $1.01, up from 65 cents last year.“The deployment of vaccines in key economies, albeit with some uncertainty as to timing and efficacy, removes a material amount of downside risk to the short term demand and price outlook for our portfolio commodities,” the company said Tuesday.The biggest miner’s comments come as talk of a burgeoning commodities’ boom gathers pace with JPMorgan Chase & Co saying a new supercycle may have begun. On the broader stage, global equities are on course to rise for 11 straight sessions -- the longest stretch since 2009 -- as investors take comfort in progress on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout.“The mega-trends that we see playing out around global population growth, the electrification thematic and the energy transition, all of these bode well for commodity demand over the medium-to-long term,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “And of course, in the near term, as the world recovers from Covid, we’ll see some pretty strong fundamentals as well.”Read: Commodity Supercycle Talk Is About to Be Put to the TestIron ore futures surged 70% last year, boosted by China’s stimulus-driven recovery and supply disruptions in Brazil. BHP analysis indicates that before prices can correct meaningfully from their current high levels, one or both of the Chinese demand and Brazilian supply factors will need to change materially, the miner said.“Buoyant iron ore prices underpin strong upgrade momentum for BHP,” analysts at Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a report, while noting that the underlying profit result was below the bank’s forecast. The steel-making ingredient accounted for about 70% of earnings in the first half.Still, BHP said China’s demand for iron ore was likely to be lower in the second half of 2021 as crude steel production plateaus and scrap-to-steel ratios rise. China’s ore stockpiles hit their highest since November heading into the lunar new year holiday, while Beijing has also pledged to rein in steel output this year.BHP also expects a “constructive” short-term demand outlook for copper, which is seen benefiting from the shift to cleaner energy. The metal climbed to its highest level since 2012 on Monday. There was also potential for supply disruptions in key producer Chile, due to an escalation of Covid cases there.BHP shares rose 2.7% in Sydney on Tuesday, while its main rival Rio Tinto Group added about 3%.(Adds details in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-lifts-outlook-pays-record-053901083.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-15	2021-02-15 21:44:00	BHP	BHP Group	BHP First-Half Profit Swells on Surging Iron Ore Prices	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group, the world’s top miner, reported a 16% rise in its first-half profit as record production from its iron ore operations in Western Australia helped it cash in on sharp price gains.Underlying profit was $6 billion in the six months to Dec. 31, the Melbourne-based company said Tuesday in a statement, up from $5.2 billion in the prior corresponding period. That compares with a median estimate of $6.4 billion (7 analysts).The company will pay a record interim dividend of $1.01, up from $0.65 last year.Key InsightsIron ore is by far the biggest contributor to BHP’s earnings and the group reported last month a 33% jump in its realized ore price for the December half compared to the year ago period.“Our outlook for global economic growth and commodity demand remains positive, with policymakers in key economies signaling a durable commitment to growth and signaling ambitions to tackle climate change,” said Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry.Ore futures in Singapore surged about 70% last year as China boosted stimulus spending to help accelerate the economic recovery from the pandemic. That led to the country’s steel mills ramping up activity in the second half of the year.BHP’s first-half attributable profit of $3.9 billion included an exceptional loss of $2.2 billion, largely related to previously-flagged impairments at its New South Wales Energy Coal business. The group is progressing a divestment process of its coal assets and said that due diligence was being undertaken to assess both demerger and trade sale opportunities.Annual capital expenditure is expected to be $7.3 billion in fiscal 2021, revised slightly higher from its August estimate due to a stronger Australian dollar.Market ReactionBHP shares rose over 18% in the six months to Dec. 31, outpacing a 16% gain for its rival Rio Tinto Group.

Like its rivals Anglo American, Rio Tinto and Vale, it has benefited from surging prices for iron ore, the main ingredient needed to make steel.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f0bbce4f-8193-37e0-8b74-a6fd20df5766/bhp-announces-record-%245.1bn.html?.tsrc=rss

The judge's decision is likely to escalate the clash between members of Arizona's San Carlos Apache Tribe, who consider the land home to deities, and Rio and minority partner BHP Group Plc, who have spent more than $1 billion on the project without producing any copper, the red metal used to make electric vehicles and other electronics devices.  The ruling means the land transfer can now take place by mid-March under a timeline approved by Congress and then-President Barack Obama in 2014.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-judge-not-stop-land-230857167.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-09	2021-02-09 10:45:36	BHP	BHP Group	Temasek’s New Chief Is Upbeat on Long-Term Chinese Investments	(Bloomberg) -- Temasek Holdings Pte.’s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara said Singapore’s state-owned investment firm is committed to China despite recent developments such as the cancellation of Ant Financial Group’s public listing.“We’re still very positive on the long-term trajectory of China from what we can see,” Pillay said, when asked about China Tuesday by reporters after he was named to replace Ho Ching, who will step down in October after 17 years as head of the $230 billion firm.Pillay, currently head of Temasek’s international unit, will need to steer one of the world’s biggest institutional investors through markets buffeted by the coronavirus pandemic and rising political tensions between the U.S. and China.Temasek is a leading investor in China with deals running the gamut from fast-growing startups and technology giants to banking institutions. In September it said holdings in China had surpassed those its home market for the first time, hitting 29% of total portfolio value as it added to assets despite the increased geopolitical tensions. Temasek was also an early investor in fintech giant Ant, whose record initial public offering was scrapped by regulators on the eve of the November listing.“China has always had that long-term potential for us, going back to even before I joined Temasek to the decade where I have been very much involved in our strategy,” he said, highlighting its biotech, consumer and enterprise sectors as emerging areas of interest.The change in leadership comes at a critical time for Temasek, which owns investments throughout the world from Chinese technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to asset manager BlackRock Inc. Its net portfolio value fell for the first time in four years to S$306 billion ($230 billion) last fiscal year, after financial markets crashed during the early phase of the pandemic in March.Pillay spent much of the briefing discussing Temasek’s commitment to sustainability and adapting to the impact of climate change on its businesses.Ho, 67, who is married to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, will stay in her role until October, with Pillay keeping his position as CEO of the Temasek International Pte unit after the changes take effect.Ho’s resignation was long-expected and attempted once before in 2009 when former BHP Billiton Ltd. CEO Chip Goodyear was announced as her successor. Temasek abandoned that plan just four months into the transition, citing “differences regarding certain strategic issues that could not be resolved” while Singapore’s then-finance minister said the role would “ideally” go to a Singaporean.Pillay, a 57-year-old Cambridge-educated lawyer, was widely regarded as a candidate to succeed Ho when he was promoted to his current role almost two years ago. The Singaporean joined Temasek in 2010, holding various leadership roles including heading the investment and portfolio management groups and overseeing the U.S. and Americas market teams. He also initiated and led the Enterprise Development Group, helping to build new longer-term growth engines for the firm.“I don’t see the impending changes at Temasek as having any significant near-term impact on the way Temasek Holdings is run or the way it manages its portfolio,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking in Singapore. “Singapore Inc. is always about continuity, but yet always on the lookout for emerging themes that can reinforce Singapore as a key hub for businesses.”Different KindAndrew Delios, a professor at NUS Business School, said Temasek had performed well as a steward of Singapore’s finances over the long term. Its 20-year compounded and annualized return stood at 6% as of March 2020, and has returned 14% a year since inception in 1974.“Temasek is a much different kind of company where stability, predictability and consistency are important,” he said, while adding the views were his own. “I don’t think we’ll see any change of substance for the next two years.”Temasek massively stepped up investing abroad under Ho. Foreign investments made up 76% of its portfolio as of March, up from 48% in 2004.But the firm faces tremendous challenges in the years ahead. Some of its biggest assets were inherited from the state and are being pummeled by markets damped by the spread of Covid-19. Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Singapore Telecommunications Ltd., have dropped more than 25% over the past 12 months.Some of the fund’s foreign holdings have fared better, with BlackRock up 31% in the period, and PayPal Holdings Inc. more than doubling. However, many of these are now potentially susceptible to the rift between the U.S. and China.Ho joined Temasek in May 2002 as executive director, and was appointed CEO two years later. She started her career as an engineer and worked at the country’s Ministry of Defence, later becoming the president and CEO of Singapore Technologies Group prior to joining Temasek.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/temasek-ceo-ho-ching-retire-022546796.html?.tsrc=rss

Africa Stocks Slip From Record as Miners Fall Most in a Month	(Bloomberg) -- South African stocks retreated from a record as shares in miners tumbled the most in a month, with metals prices falling amid doubts regarding the approval of a U.S. stimulus package.The benchmark FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index dropped 0.5% from Thursday’s all-time high. The gauge still narrowly eked out a third consecutive weekly gain for the first time since August after closing at record peaks on five days this month.Anglo American Plc led declines, sliding 3.4%, while global diversified mining peer BHP Group Plc dropped 2.1%. African Rainbow Minerals Ltd. was the worst performer in the local index of mining stocks, falling 5.2%. The sector gauge lost 1.5% in its sharpest descent since Dec. 18, tracking declines in European peers, which headed for their worst session since October.Some metals have been trading at multi year highs and the mining index had risen 12% in January as of Thursday’s close, boosted by investor optimism that President-elect Joe Biden’s long-awaited relief package will help economies rebound. But the focus on Friday turned to how much of the proposals, unveiled overnight, will ultimately be approved by lawmakers in Washington.Locally, traders were also digesting the latest developments in South Africa’s coronavirus response, with the government announcing that the reopening of schools will be delayed by two weeks. The country is also in the second of four days of rolling power cuts after the state-owned utility reported a malfunction at a newly built plant and other operational issues.Declining stocks outnumbered gainers by 79 to 58 in Friday’s session.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/africa-stocks-stay-near-record-080844902.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-11	2021-01-11 14:20:34	BHP	BHP Group	BHP Invests in Startup Seeking to Make Emissions-Free Steel	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group, the world’s biggest mining company, has invested in a startup company seeking to develop less-polluting ways of making steel.While many in the mining industry have outlined how they plan to curb their own direct pollution, those emissions are a fraction of ones produced by customers, with steelmaking one of the biggest global emitters. Rather than set hard targets to reduce so-called Scope 3 emissions, companies like Rio Tinto Group and BHP have committed to working with the steel sector to help develop new technologies instead.BHP has previously pledged $400 million in research funding to tackle carbon emissions caused by its buyers. The company has also said it will tie a portion of bonus payments for key leaders to progress on lowering greenhouse gas emissions at both its own operations and those of its customers.BHP was among investors backing a $50 million fundraising round for Boston Metal, the startup said Monday. The company, which already counts Bill Gates-founded Breakthrough Energy Ventures among its investors, is developing a method to replace coking coal in the steelmaking process with electricity, reducing emissions.The statement did not say how much BHP had invested in the funding round. Piva Capital and Devonshire Investors also participated.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-invests-startup-seeking-emissions-142034066.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-16	2020-12-16 13:29:51	BHP	BHP Group	Copper Miner SolGold Faces Rebellion From Top Shareholders	(Bloomberg) -- SolGold Plc faces a possible shareholder revolt as the mining heavyweights that backed the company and its huge Ecuadorian copper deposit grow increasingly frustrated by the management’s decisions.BHP Group is SolGold’s biggest shareholder and Australian gold major Newcrest Mining Ltd. is No. 2, having both positioned themselves for a seat at the table when it’s time to finance and build the project. Neither was pleased with SolGold’s decision earlier this year to sell a royalty stream -- while the deal provided funding, it meant giving up a piece of future profits. The company has also faced setbacks in its mine-planning process.SolGold’s annual shareholder meeting Thursday offers a chance for investors to have their say. The company has recently made changes to its board, including adding independent directors.Amid concerns about corporate governance, major investors BHP and Cornerstone Capital Resources Inc. were considering whether to vote against re-electing certain board members, including SolGold Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Nick Mather, according to people familiar with the matter. The people asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations before votes were submitted ahead of the meeting.It’s not clear what Newcrest was planning, but it has been a vocal critic of SolGold’s decisions, particularly the $150 million royalty deal. Cornerstone has clashed repeatedly with SolGold and fought off a hostile takeover approach from the company earlier this year. Together, BHP, Newcrest and Cornerstone own about 35% of SolGold.“We have to look after the interests of all shareholders,” said Ingo Hofmaier, SolGold’s acting chief financial officer. “The royalty was at a valuation that exceeded the market value at the time and was the superior offer at the time.”While it’s still years -- and billions of dollars -- away from producing any metal, SolGold has drawn attention from across the mining industry because of the size of its Cascabel copper project. The deposit is one of the largest undeveloped mines in the world for a crucial metal that’s forecast to be in tight supply for years to come. The company also has licenses to explore large swathes of Ecuador for copper.The investments by BHP and Newcrest prompted speculation that SolGold could be a takeover target, especially after BHP increased its stake last year to become the biggest shareholder. Both companies had said they’d rather SolGold sell shares to raise money, with BHP making the comments before the royalty deal was announced, and Newcrest afterward.After criticizing the financing plan, Newcrest withdrew its representative, Craig Jones, from the SolGold board, and declined to participate in a smaller equity raising at that time.BHP and Newcrest both declined to comment.Investors have also been concerned by SolGold’s progress on the project. Earlier this month, the company said it will have to redesign parts of its planned underground mine and that a study on its development would be delayed, which analysts said would likely increase the cost.SolGold, meanwhile, has made sweeping changes to its corporate governance this year, while facing public criticism from Cornerstone. Brian Moller stepped down as chairman and the company appointed a raft of new independent directors, including Kevin O’Kane, a former BHP veteran. It also reconstituted its board committees.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/copper-miner-solgold-faces-rebellion-132951456.html?.tsrc=rss

Cash costs fell from $1.45 per pound in the first six months of 2019 to $1.21 per pound of copper produced during the same period in 2020, the ministry said in a statement.  A strengthening dollar against the peso, as well as falling prices of key ingredients in the processing of copper, including sulfuric acid and diesel, contributed to the drop in costs, a report from Chilean copper agency Cochilco, cited by the ministry, said.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chile-copper-output-costs-plunged-140904466.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-28	2020-10-28 15:35:50	BHP	BHP Group	South African Stocks Slip to Four-Week Low Before Budget Statement	(Bloomberg) -- South Africa’s main stock index plunged the most in seven months Wednesday after Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s budget update and as negative sentiment prompted by rising coronavirus infections and tougher lockdowns engulfed global equity markets.Johannesburg’s benchmark index sank 3.3%, the most since March 27, with just nine out of 141 stocks managing gains as the market closed at a four-month low. Major diversified miners Anglo American Plc, down 5.1%, and BHP Group Plc, down 3.2%, were the heaviest drags on the market, reflecting investor concerns about the outlook for the global economy. “Equity markets and the rand had moved stronger over the past few weeks, but it looks like the realization that both the domestic and external environments remain quite challenging have resulted in most of those gains being given back today,” said Peter Takaendesa, head of equities at Mergence Investment Managers in Cape Town.The rand dropped as much as 1.8% against the dollar, also the most since Sept. 21, as emerging-market currencies weakened.“With a stronger dollar and negative sentiment around the South African budget, the rand was due to be on the backfoot,” said Matete Thulare, a Johannesburg-based analyst at Rand Merchant Bank.The falling rand dragged the index of bank stocks down 4.5%, the worst day for the sector since August.FirstRand Ltd. -4.2%, Standard Bank Group Ltd. -5.1%, Absa Group Ltd. -5.7%, Capitec Bank Holdings Ltd. -2.5%, Nedbank Group Ltd. -6.8%, Investec Plc -4.4%The mining index fell 4.6%, the most in more than five months.NOTE: Faced with Surging Debt, South Africa Sticks to Borrowing PlansNOTE: South Africa Risks Labor Union Ire With Budget Plan to Tame DebtNOTE: S&P 500 Tumbles, Europe Sinks to Five-Month Low: Markets WrapHere is how some investors reacted to the budget speech:Sandy McGregor: Allan GrayThe mid-term budget is essentially unchanged from the revised budget tabled in July.Key feature is limiting the growth of the public sector wage bill to 1.8% in 2020/21 and 0.8% in 2021/22.It is accepted that there is limited scope to increase taxes, with a relatively modest 5 billion rand of tax increases projected for 2021/22.The government remains committed to the fiscal strategy announced in July.Takaendesa: Mergence Investment ManagersThe medium-term buget was always going to be a tough act given country-specific headwinds, as well as a tough external environment constraining the growth of the economy.Government spending cuts are a must given the tough economic environment and unsustainable public debt levels, but they carry very high execution risks given legacy social challenges and political landscape.Success with execution on some of the key government consumption expenditure cuts and recovery in the global economy will be key to watch for investors who are rightly concerned by the country entering a debt trap.Casparus Treurnicht: Gryphon Asset ManagementIt’s really hard to be optimistic about South Africa listening to the speech. There was nothing good in it really.People want to see action.

2020-10-26	2020-10-26 21:12:52	BHP	BHP Group	Zeta Becomes a Hurricane Menacing Mexico and U.S. Gulf Coast	(Bloomberg) -- Zeta strengthened to a hurricane as it bore down on the Mexican cities of Cozumel and Cancun, where it was forecast to dump heavy rain before turning north to threaten the U.S. Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Mississippi with another direct hit.The storm’s winds reached 80 miles (129 kilometers) per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center, making it a Category 1 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. Zeta will come ashore Tuesday in the Yucatan Peninsula, a region that suffered widespread flooding from Hurricane Delta only weeks ago. As much as 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain could fall across the Yucatan, parts of Cuba and even Florida as Zeta moves north.“It will likely cross the Yucatan as a hurricane,” said Dan Pydynowski, a forecaster with AccuWeather, Inc. Zeta will then hit Louisiana “as a hurricane or a very strong tropical storm.” Zeta is the 27th named storm in a supercharged Atlantic hurricane season, just one short of the record reached in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. So many storms have formed this year that the hurricane center has run out of official names and is using Greek letters to designate systems.The threat to the Gulf Coast has triggered a storm surge, as well as a hurricane watch to be posted. Surge, which happens when a system pushes the ocean higher as it comes ashore, could wash over coastal areas from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. Hurricane-strength winds may affect a smaller area from Morgan City, Louisiana, to the Alabama-Mississippi state line, the center said.In addition, Zeta is expected to bring heavy rain from the northern Gulf Coast into the Appalachian Mountains and mid-Atlantic states through Thursday.The U.S. has been particularly hard hit, with Hurricanes Isaias, Laura, Hanna, Sally and Delta all hammering the coastline, causing billions of dollars in damage. A handful of tropical storms have struck the U.S. as well. Zeta would be the record 11th storm to come ashore in the contiguous U.S. this year, and if it makes landfall in Louisiana, it will be the fifth time that state has been hit this season.Chevron Corp. and BHP Group Ltd. have already begun pulling non-essential personnel off oil and gas platforms in the Gulf. Noble Corp. moved its Globetrotter II rig out of the way, while Equinor ASA plans to shut production at its Titan platform.Nearly 16% of oil production and 6% of natural gas has been shut in across the Gulf, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.The disruptions will likely be short lived because Zeta is moving quickly, said Matt Rogers, president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.Closer to the U.S. coast, Zeta will encounter cooler water and wind shear that will tear at its structure, likely keeping it from strengthening and perhaps even weakening it, said Elizabeth Palumbi, a meteorologist with commercial forecaster Maxar.While some storms, including Isaias and Fay, hit the East Coast, the majority of this season’s systems struck the Gulf Coast between Texas and Florida. That includes Laura and Delta, which both came ashore near Cameron, Louisiana, providing a double-dose of misery for residents in the western part of the state.A typical Atlantic hurricane season only spins up 12 storms. The six-month season theoretically ends on Nov. 30, but a number of storms formed before its official start date of June 1 this year, and some meteorologists think they could keep coming into December.Environmental indications point to the potential for a few more storms to develop in the Atlantic during November, which would push 2020 over the 2005 record, said Jim Rouiller, lead meteorologist at the Energy Weather Group.“It is not over,” Rouiller said. “Zeta is not going to be the end.”(Updates with hurricane watch in fith paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tropical-storm-zeta-south-cuba-062619014.html?.tsrc=rss

Investing in overseas stocks carries its own set of risks, including the impact of currency exchange and geopolitical turmoil. But there are also a number of positives in this segment for U.S. investors. One is a more robust selection of high-quality names. Yields also tend to be higher in overseas markets in general.

2020-10-07	2020-10-07 10:38:45	BHP	BHP Group	Tesla In Talks For Nickel-Supply Deal With BHP – Report	"Tesla is interested in clinching a nickel deal with BHP as the electric-car maker gears up for higher production and seeks to avert supply shortage, Bloomberg reported.Current talks between Tesla (TSLA) and BHP, the world’s largest miner are at the stage of pricing, but no final agreement has yet been reached, according to the report. The discussions come as Tesla is looking to raise the amount of the metal used in vehicle batteries to boost performance, and as it makes a foray into in-house cell production.Nickel is a key component for the cathodes of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has expressed concern about supply due to challenges in sustainable sourcing. Bloomberg said that a spokesperson for BHP declined to comment. Tesla didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.Demand for nickel is poised to surge in coming years as automakers from Tesla, BMW to Volkswagen plan to roll out more EV models. Musk in July promised a “giant” contract to miners that produce the metal in an “environmentally sensitive way.” Nickel can help pack more energy into batteries, and allows producers to reduce use of cobalt, which is more expensive and typically has a less transparent supply chain, according to Bloomberg.“We really need to make sure that we’re not constrained by total nickel availability -- I actually spoke with the CEOs of the biggest mining companies in the world and said please make more nickel,” Musk told investors in a presentation last month.BHP has in the past held talks with global companies in the battery sector but didn’t identify the names of the manufacturers. Brazil’s Vale, the top commercial nickel producer, has also held discussions with Tesla.“As a world leader in the production and supply of responsibly-sourced nickel, Vale has engaged in talks with stakeholders at all points along the supply chain, including Tesla, to explore the possibility of partnerships,” the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in an emailed response to Bloomberg. “This is consistent with Vale’s positioning in the market, the quality of our product and the increasing demand for nickel as a critical component of battery manufacturing for electric vehicles.”Earlier this week, Tesla announced that it delivered 139,300 units in 3Q, which came ahead of analysts’ expectations of 137,000 units. Total production increased by 81.7% to 145,036 vehicles from 79,837 units in the year-ago quarter.TSLA is up a whopping 395% so far this year, leaving analysts sidelined on the stock with a Hold consensus. The $316.69 average analyst price target now implies 24% downside potential in the shares over the coming 12 months.J.P. Morgan Ryan Brinkman this week raised the stock’s price target to $75 (82% downside potential) from $65, while reiterating a Sell rating, saying that he raised his estimates to account for Tesla's Q3 deliveries.For 2022, Brinkman expects earnings per share of $3.35 versus $2.50 in 2021 and $1.85 in 2020. The analyst maintained a Sell rating on the shares as he still sees a ""lofty valuation coupled with high investor expectations and high execution risk”.

Tesla will need a lot more nickel if the company's plan for the new 4680 battery is to come to market and be mass produced. Tesla will be using nickel in high performance and long-lasting batteries for electric vehicles.Now, a report from Bloomberg reveals Tesla is in talks with BHP Group Ltd (NYSE: BHP) on a nickel deal to secure the supply needed for future plans. According to Bloomberg sources, the talks are currently stalled on pricing, with no clear end in sight.While nickel is a small portion of BHP's mining operations, these talks could signal BHP is looking to expand its nickel mining capabilities.Benzinga's Take: Tesla recently revealed the company will be mining and processing its own lithium. Now it looks like Tesla is close to securing a miner for the nickel that seems to be in short supply.If Tesla can ramp battery production, with high yields, it will allow the company to release the Cybertruck, Plaid Model S, and Tesla Semi, which will all use high purity nickel batteries.Photo from Tesla Battery and Investor DaySee more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * PG&E Installs Its First Tesla Megapacks  * Tesla Could Soon Start Model Y Deliveries From Giga Shanghai(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The discussions come as Tesla works to raise the amount of the metal used in vehicle batteries to improve performance, and as it makes a push into in-house cell production.Nickel is a key component for the cathodes of EV batteries, and Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has expressed concern about supply due to challenges in sustainable sourcing. A deal with Tesla may come as a surprise to some BHP investors since nickel makes up a small part of BHP’s business. It would signal real progress in the company’s efforts to expand in the space and retool the nickel division to serve battery makers.A spokesperson for BHP declined to comment. Tesla didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.Demand for nickel is forecast to surge in coming years as Tesla expands and companies from BMW AG to Volkswagen AG add to their lineups of electric models. Musk in July promised a “giant” contract to miners that produce the metal in an “environmentally sensitive way.” Nickel can help pack more energy into batteries, and allows producers to reduce use of cobalt, which is more expensive and typically has a less transparent supply chain.Musk indicated last month his firm had been in contact with several nickel producers, without identifying the companies.“We really need to make sure that we’re not constrained by total nickel availability -- I actually spoke with the CEOs of the biggest mining companies in the world and said please make more nickel,” Musk told investors in a presentation last month.The market for battery-grade nickel should be in a tight balance in the next two to three years as demand from lithium-ion battery producers picks up, BloombergNEF analyst Allan Ray Restauro said by email. There may be a significant deficit as early as 2023, when nickel prices start to recover, he said.“Nickel demand will grow significantly off the back of batteries and the EV thematic, and that will pull nickel prices up,” BHP CEO Mike Henry said in an interview last month.BHP is focused on expanding its Nickel West unit after abandoning earlier plans to sell the assets and as it shifts away from traditional customers in the stainless-steel industry. The miner’s nickel division now sells more than 75% of output to the battery-supply chain in Japan, South Korea and China, up from less than 5% in 2016, the unit’s asset president Eduard Haegel said last year.The producer agreed in June to buy an Australian project that holds one of the country’s biggest untapped reserves of nickel from MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC, and is partnering with a smaller company on exploration in Quebec.BHP has held extensive talks with companies in the battery sector, Henry said, declining to specify if those discussions included recent conversations with Tesla. “We’ve been pro-actively pursuing and talking to a lot of manufacturers globally for a while now,” he said.Tesla agreed to a deal in June to buy cobalt from Glencore Plc, and in recent weeks struck a five-year raw-materials pact with Piedmont Lithium Ltd., developing a lithium project in North Carolina.Brazil’s Vale SA, the top commercial nickel producer, has also talked with Tesla.“As a world leader in the production and supply of responsibly-sourced nickel, Vale has engaged in talks with stakeholders at all points along the supply chain, including Tesla, to explore the possibility of partnerships,” the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in an emailed response. “This is consistent with Vale’s positioning in the market, the quality of our product and the increasing demand for nickel as a critical component of battery manufacturing for electric vehicles.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-talks-top-miner-bhp-172836572.html?.tsrc=rss

The remaining 28% interest in Shenzi is owned by Spain’s Repsol S.A. For BHP, the acquisition adds 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production. The company expects the transaction to close by December 2020.“This transaction aligns with our plans to enhance our petroleum portfolio by targeted acquisitions in high quality producing deepwater assets and the continued de-risking of our growth options.” said BHP’s President of Petroleum Operations Geraldine Slattery. (See BHP stock analysis on TipRanks)In a separate statement, Hess (HES) stated it was selling its interest in Shenzi to “preserve cash and preserve the long term value of our assets in the current low oil price environment.” Hess said that it will use the sale proceeds to fund its investment in Guyana. The company’s shares closed 4.4% higher on Monday.On Sept. 30, Credit Suisse analyst Carsten Riek upgraded BHP Group to Buy from Hold and raised the price target to A$39 from A$37. The analyst believes that BHP is a better pick than rival Rio Tinto, citing upside to iron ore, a more attractive risk profile and a more diversified portfolio that provides optionality when iron ore prices fall back to double-digit territory.The Street has a Moderate Buy consensus for BHP based on 3 Buys versus 4 Holds and no Sells. The average analyst price target of $41.15 implies downside potential of about 21% in the coming months.

2020-09-16	2020-09-16 09:39:26	BHP	BHP Group	BHP Sees Profit in a World Speeding Up Climate Action	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group, a major industrial polluter, says it will benefit most from a global shift toward faster and more dramatic measures to address climate change, and aims to profit from doing so itself.The top miner, which plans to reduce emissions attached to its own operations, will drive the innovation needed to do so by expecting investments in climate change action to be profitable, said Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry. Moreover, an aggressive global shift to renewable energy and electric vehicles will boost demand for materials that the company produces, he said.BHP is “not easing up on the pressure to both achieve our emissions reductions ambitions and to generate value,” Henry, who was promoted to the post in January, said in an interview.The firm, which has a higher annual carbon footprint than its home nation Australia, has said that it will lower greenhouse gas emissions from its own operations -- a small fraction of the total -- by almost a third by 2030 and to zero by 2050. It’s also promised to help customers curb pollution caused by the use of its products like coal and iron ore, but has faced criticism for not setting targets for absolute cuts to emissions in its supply chain.Ambitious plans to limit temperatures rising 1.5 degrees Celsius would significantly boost demand for copper and nickel, needed for renewable energy and electric vehicles, and potash, a crop nutrient -- three prospective growth areas for the miner. The scenario would also support requirements for higher-quality raw materials for steel-making, according to BHP’s analysis.“In many ways, it challenges the orthodoxy of a lot of companies: that a slow and gradual, drawn-out transition is better,” said Emma Herd, CEO of the Investor Group on Climate Change, which includes institutions controlling about A$2 trillion ($1.5 trillion) in investments. “They’ve actually found that a rapid decarbonization delivers more shareholder value.”Investors have a clear incentive to keep pressuring the giant miner to not only accelerate its own efforts to curb emissions, but to use its influence to advocate for government policies that would help support a better climate outcome, she said.Key polluters, including miners and oil producers, are under increasing pressure from major investors to take more ambitious measures to curb emissions, while also continuing to generate profits. Climate Action 100+, a group of investment firms that manage over $47 trillion in assets, said Monday it would push 161 companies -- including BHP -- to commit to net zero strategies by 2050.BHP, with mines in places from Australia’s Outback to Chile’s Atacama desert, will potentially spend between $2 billion and $4 billion over the next decade to support its climate initiatives, including on projects to replace diesel-fueled trucks, to switch operations to renewable energy, and to accelerate development of carbon capture and storage technology.Setting an expectation that the bulk of those investments should be profitable “increases the likelihood that we’ll be able to create value more often than not, and will actually give rise to an acceleration of some of the technical solutions,” Henry said.The miner’s plans have been questioned for focusing too much on the development and deployment of new technology, particularly carbon capture, which has struggled to be economical because the price of carbon in most countries is too low.BHP has also faced criticism for not setting targets for specific, absolute reductions in Scope 3 emissions -- mainly those generated by a customer’s use of a company’s products. They account for about 97% of BHP’s total carbon output, according to Market Forces, an environmental campaign group.“Attention should be going into where BHP’s climate risk is largest,” the campaign group’s executive director Julien Vincent said. “It has to be tackled head on.”The firm’s approach contrasts with Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which has indicated it could restrict sales to some customers unable to reduce their emissions, and to BP Plc which will cut oil production by 40% by 2030. Glencore Plc has forecast a 30% decrease in its Scope 3 total over the next 15 years as coal output falls from depleting mines in Colombia and South Africa.BHP’s shares rose 1.8% by 10:35 a.m. in London, and are little changed this year.Scope 3 Approach“Trying to do it through force, either by us reducing production, or us saying we won’t sell to certain customers, I don’t believe will have any impact on global emissions,” BHP’s Henry said in the Friday interview. “The way to have impact is through collaboration with customers and solving the technical solutions.”Past examples in the maritime sector, including the development of Wozmax vessels -- tailored specifically for the size of Western Australia’s ports -- and the RightShip standards initiative to improve safety and sustainability with Rio Tinto Group and Cargill Inc., show BHP can corral customers, competitors and suppliers into collective action, Henry said.To encourage steelmakers who use its iron ore and coking coal to lower emissions intensity by 30% by 2030, BHP will help to devise alternative production methods. It’ll also seek to stimulate development of lower-emission bulk vessels to aid the shipping industry to achieve a similar 40% reduction.Henry also said:Major disruption of steel-making by replacing coking coal with hydrogen and clean energy won’t arrive quickly, and it’ll likely be 10 to 15 years before lower costs make the idea economic.While oil will be an attractive business for at least the next decade, BHP needs to have options for a future exit. “How we go about creating value is exercising good judgment around when that right point is,” he said.A potential spinoff of some coal mines will have investor appeal. “With the right balance sheet, the right assets, the right commercial approach, there’ll be very good returns to be made for shareholders,” Henry said.(Add shares in 15th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-miner-bhp-sees-profit-190000273.html?.tsrc=rss

BHP today laid out goals to help its clients cut emissions intensity by 30% by 2030, but stopped short of setting hard targets.The company’s approach to Scope 3 emissions will attract the greatest scrutiny from investors and climate scientists. As with oil majors, supply-chain emissions typically account for more than 90% of BHP’s total, and the responsibility miners take for them is disputed. While the miner won plaudits for its targets to lower its own emissions, its plans for Scope 3 were less well received.“On Scope 3 emissions, BHP has been generous with hope, but stingy with delivery,” said Julien Vincent, executive director of Australian environmental campaign group Market Forces. “These targets need to be set as a minimum standard, and backed with the sort of investment you’d expect from a company trying to preserve its customer base.”BHP will also seek to help the maritime industry reduce emissions intensity by 40% by 2030, the Melbourne-based company said Thursday in a statement. However, it stopped short of setting hard targets. Rivals such as Rio Tinto Group have argued that any targets on Scope 3 emissions would be impossible to meet because it has no control over how steelmakers use iron ore.Setting GoalsSome analysts argue that setting intensity goals is less valuable than more precise targets for absolute reductions in emission volumes. Major polluters including miners and oil producers are also facing more scrutiny over the immediate steps they are taking toward emissions reduction targets that are typically decades away.Henry, promoted in January, and other executives will have 10% of short-term incentive payments tied to measures to curb emissions across BHP’s supply chain. That includes the use of its iron ore and coking coal in a steel-making sector that accounts for about 7% of all global emissions.“We expect our actions to catalyze broader emissions reductions throughout the steel and maritime sectors,” Henry said in notes of a speech to investors. “We are also making a direct connection between these measures and executive remuneration.”BHP’s plan to cut its own operational emissions over the next decade is seen by the company as a way-marker on a longer-term path to have net-zero emissions at its sites by the middle of the century.“Too few investors have made commitments on executive pay in this regard, and BHP’s announcement linking a portion of leaders’ compensation to progress in cutting greenhouse gas emissions is an important step for the company,” Fiona Reynolds, CEO of Principles for Responsible Investment, the world’s biggest industry body for social investing, said in a statement.The miner’s plans compare with rival Rio’s intention to cut absolute emissions at its operations by 15% by 2030 from 2018 levels. London-based Rio argues it has less scope than competitors to make additional large reductions, and also is opposed to setting targets for reducing carbon emissions generated by its customers. Oil and gas producer BP Plc is targeting a 20% cut in emissions from its operations by 2025.BHP offered little new detail on its plans to help customers curb their emissions, though reiterated it would invest in the development of new technologies, including carbon capture and storage projects. The company also acknowledged it faces a complex task to decarbonize its vast truck fleet.“BHP continues to rely on unproven and horribly expensive carbon capture and storage to decarbonise its Scope 3 emissions, rather than simply leaving fossil fuels in the ground,” the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said.The producer, which last month confirmed plans to sell some coal mines, sees itself as well positioned to continue to generate profits in a world seeking to limit the impact of climate change to a temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.“The greater the global efforts to decarbonize, the stronger the impact on demand for copper, nickel and potash,” Chief Development Officer Johan van Jaarsveld said in the speech notes. It will also increase the “need for more steel to build wind farms, pumped hydro and other decarbonization-enabling infrastructure,” he said.BHP shares fell 0.6% in London.(Adds description of PRI in 10th paragraph and shares in last.

2020-08-18	2020-08-18 11:27:37	BHP	BHP Group	The World’s Top Miner Broadens Plans to Exit Coal Operations	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group says it’s getting rid of thermal coal mines to help prepare for a lower-emissions future, yet the company’s still counting on fossil fuels to drive its business for another decade.The world’s biggest miner is accelerating the sale or spinoff of interests in mines in Australia and Colombia, and it’s planning to shed two coking coal operations and a share in an Exxon Mobil Corp.-controlled oil and gas business. The announcements came Tuesday as the company reported steady full-year profit.Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry is starting a long-term transition of BHP’s portfolio to benefit from rising demand for renewable energy, food and electric vehicles through growth in copper, nickel and potash. At the same time, BHP wants to profit from a shift to higher-quality raw materials in China’s steel sector and an oil market that Henry said has passed though the worst virus-related risks.“There’s going to be more demand and more upside for higher quality, hard coking coal, so we remain committed to that core of our portfolio,” Henry said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “There’s great value and returns to be generated in oil for the foreseeable future, certainly the next decade and likely beyond that.”BHP will keep churning out the iron ore that accounts for the bulk of its profits, and it expects to increase output even as prices ease from close to a one-year high, Henry said. A price surge that has seen benchmark iron ore jump by about a third this year helped cushion annual earnings from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.BHP shares fell as much as 3% in London and were trading down 1.7% at 12:25 p.m. local time. Rival Rio Tinto Group rose 1% in London. Investors may be disappointed with a final dividend -- of 55 cents a share -- that was below analysts’ forecasts, reflecting a conservative approach amid a weak global economy, RBC Capital Markets analyst Tyler Broda said in a note.The producer has been considering plans to offload its Mt Arthur thermal coal mine in Australia and a one-third stake in the Cerrejon operation in Colombia for more than a year, and it rejected some early offers, people familiar with the matter said last month. Processes to exit those mines, as well as a coking coal venture with Mitsui & Co., through trade sales or a demerger into a separate listed entity, will now advance.“We’ll land the right solution in the next year or two,” Henry said in the interview.BHP and rivals, such as Anglo American Plc, want to exit thermal coal as investors get increasingly uncomfortable with blue-chip investment names mining the dirtiest fuel. Norway’s $1 trillion wealth fund said it would stop investing in companies that mine more than 20 million tons of thermal coal a year, and BlackRock Inc. also said it will reduce exposure to the fuel.Lower thermal coal prices mean around two-thirds of the world’s seaborne supply is losing money, and there’s uncertainty over China’s policy on energy coal imports.BHP said it planned to sell its 50% stake in the Bass Strait oil-and-gas joint venture with Exxon in southeastern Australia. Exxon said in September it wants to exit. “We will seek to divest oil and gas assets that are mature or which are likely to realize greater value under different ownership,” Henry said in the earnings statement.The company next month may detail more ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.A decision on adding potash production through the initial development of the Jansen project in Canada -- seen as a way of diversifying BHP’s earnings beyond industrial raw materials -- is delayed until mid-2021, BHP said. The project, which may cost as much as $5.7 billion, could benefit from improving supply and demand dynamics from the late 2020s or early 2030s, the company said.In a series of executive changes, Henry promoted Johan van Jaarsveld to chief development officer and confirmed the departure of Danny Malchuk, the head of mines in the Americas and previously a rival contender for the CEO post.(Updates with shares price move in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-top-miner-broadens-plans-010404407.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-02	2020-08-02 01:37:03	BHP	BHP Group	Top Copper Nation Gets Tough on Water With BHP in Crosshairs	(Bloomberg) -- Authorities in Chile are cracking down on water use by mines in the driest desert on earth, threatening future supply in the top copper-producing nation.On Friday, Chile’s environmental agency SMA charged BHP Group’s Escondida for allegedly drawing more water than allowed for almost 15 years in a move that could result in the loss of its permit, closure or a fine. Just to the south, state-owned Codelco has suspended a planned expansion of its Salvador mine until it can resolve a suit filed by the State Defense Council against the project’s proposed use of water.Mines that dot the parched Atacama desert are coming under increasing scrutiny for their use of water, with lithium giant Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA facing a Supreme Court ruling after community complaints. Even in central Chile, scare water supplies have restricted output at Anglo American Plc’s Los Bronces mine and Codelco’s El Teniente.At Escondida, the regulator accuses the world’s biggest copper mine of a serious decline in the water table, alleging the operation failed to lower extraction at four control points since 2005 and reached triple the acceptable threshold in 2019. BHP has 10 days to present a compliance program in response to the charge.Escondida rejected the allegations, saying in an emailed statement that it ceased extraction from aquifers at the end of 2019 and now runs exclusively with desalinated water.“Escondida has never exceeded the restriction of 25 centimeters established as maximum acceptable decrease of the aquifer level in the monitoring area of the wetlands of Tilopozo,” it said.The suit against Salvador’s expansion threatens future supply given the project is needed to replenish falling ore grades at Codelco’s smallest and least profitable operation.(Updates with comment from Escondida)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-copper-nation-gets-tougher-110000447.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-31	2020-07-31 09:30:00	BHP	BHP Group	Australian miners Rio Tinto and Fortescue post record iron ore shipments as China industrial recovery continues	Australian mining giants Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group have joined BHP Group in reporting record shipments of iron ore, the bulk of it to China, as an infrastructure and property construction boom in the world's second largest economy drives a rebound in steel production.The companies have reported record earnings on the back of the iron ore shipments, even though exports of other minerals like aluminium and copper remain in the doldrums as the coronavirus pandemic saps global demand.Australia's record iron ore exports to China, combined with a surge in shipments of coking and thermal coal, indicate trade in the key industrial ingredients has not suffered because of a diplomatic spat between the two countries.Rio Tinto reported on Thursday its iron ore shipments to China in the first half of the year rose 3 per cent compared to the same period a year-earlier.This pushed earnings up 2 per cent and allowed the Anglo-Australian miner to promise a US$2.5 billion dividend payout for shareholders.Announcing its fourth quarter fiscal results, Fortescue projected that iron ore shipments to China would rise 6 per cent to 178 million tonnes for the full financial year ended in June, exceeding its target of 177 million tonnes. Full-year results will be announced in a few weeks.The miner said exports were buoyed by strong Chinese steel production of 499 million tonnes in the first six months of the year, 1.4 per cent higher than the same period last year.Rio Tinto chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said China had effectively absorbed the additional iron ore diverted from weaker steel markets in Europe and Asia.&quot;The main market for our high-quality iron ore is China, which compared to the broader global economy has recovered exceedingly well,&quot; Jacques said while announcing company results on Wednesday.&quot;China's steel production and demand for iron ore in 2019 was strong and this has continued despite disruptions in the first quarter.&quot;In 2020, [China's] crude steel production has again exceeded the 1 billion tonne annualised run rate and June production was a new all-time high record.&quot;Steel markets in Europe, the United States, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan were still weak, Rio Tinto said.BHP also said last week it had met production targets for iron ore, thanks to China's economic recovery.&quot;In China, blast furnace utilisation rates have increased from around 80 per cent earlier in February 2020 to above 90 per cent in June 2020,&quot; BHP said in its financial year review.&quot;We continue to believe that if China can avoid a second wave of Covid-19, steel and pig iron production can both rise in the 2020 calendar year versus the prior year.&quot;Rio Tinto said Australia's contract-based iron ore shipments were strong, despite impacts from the coronavirus outbreak, allowing it to outperform other major miners such as Vale in Brazil, which has suffered from production restrictions and delays.But Vale, which has recently suffered setbacks including the Brumadinho dam collapse at its Corrego do Feijao mine, also saw profit recover in the second quarter thanks to higher iron ore prices. It said on Wednesday it would pay dividends that have been suspended since the dam accident last January.The continued demand for iron ore in China means Rio Tinto is committed to developing new iron ore projects at Simandou blocks 3 and 4 in Guinea, along with Chinese partner Chinalco Mining and the country's government.The diversified miner said it had drawn up plans to commission China-based design institutes to update and re-engineer the infrastructure of the project, which was approved in 2010.&quot;The Chinese are pretty active and they want to see a pathway to develop the two blocks,&quot; Jacques said.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The facility was run by a company jointly owned by a BHP unit and Vale SA.At an eight-day hearing starting Wednesday in Manchester, U.K., judges will rule on whether British courts have jurisdiction over the case. If it goes ahead, it would be the biggest class action in U.K. history with the local groups seeking a total of 5 billion pounds ($6.33 billion).This is the latest in a series of group claims brought in the U.K. against British companies for the actions of their foreign units in developing countries. Melbourne-based BHP’s shares are listed in both the U.K. and Australia.In a landmark ruling last year, the U.K. Supreme Court allowed Zambian villagers to sue mining company Vedanta Resources Plc in Britiain over pollution caused by a mine, opening the door to similar claims. Last month, thousands of Nigerians sought permission to sue Royal Dutch Shell Plc in London over damage caused by oil spills in the Niger Delta.“Until there is a change in corporate behavior, I think this type of litigation is likely to increase,” said Tom Goodhead, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs at law firm PGMBM.But BHP said that the Manchester case duplicates legal proceedings in Brazil and shouldn’t be allowed to go ahead.“BHP’s overarching position remains that the proceedings do not belong in the U.K.,” BHP said in a statement.Safety warningsThe Fundão Dam was used to store iron ore tailings, a toxic waste produced during the processing of mined mineral. Its collapse destroyed entire villages, polluted rivers and devastated natural habitats.The joint venture, Samarco, allegedly ignored safety warnings as it increased iron ore production and tailings storage at the dam, PGMBM said in court filings ahead of the hearing. BHP representatives had been informed of serious structural failings in a report two years earlier, the claimants said.BHP said it is committed to supporting ongoing remediation and compensation through the Renova Foundation, an out-of-court compensation scheme, to which the company made a provision of $1.7 billion.The Renova Foundation had announced it was suspending payments to thousands of victims it alleged had provided false information, but a Brazilian judge ordered the Foundation to resume aid last week.Thousands of individual claims against Samarco are ongoing in Brazil.An appeal is currently pending against the dismissal of a class action filed in New York on behalf of Samarco bondholders, while a separate class action by BHP investors has been filed in Australia, according to company filings. Brazilian prosecutors are also continuing to challenge the dismissal of some criminal charges in the case, BHP said in a February statement.Other cases linked to large-scale environmental damage have taken decades to be processed in the Brazilian courts, and the claimants are hoping to obtain quicker results in the U.K. The current proceedings in the British courts don’t target Vale.Work to reopen the joint venture in Brazil has been slowed, in part because of measures to respond to Covid-19, BHP said in a separate statement this week.(Updated with additional information about the Renova Foundation in 12th paragraph and details of other legal proceedings in 14th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-faces-biggest-u-k-040000139.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-18	2020-07-18 04:00:00	BHP	BHP Group	Stuck With Coal Pits the World Needs, But Few Want	(Bloomberg) -- The Mt Arthur coal mine in Australia is one of the world’s best. It’s got plenty of reserves and the low-cost supplies produced there are easily shipped to Southeast Asia, where there’s insatiable appetite for the fuel.Yet owner BHP Group has a problem: It’s struggling to find a buyer willing to pay the right price.The world’s biggest mining company’s unsuccessful effort over the past year to offload the asset highlights the predicament producers are in. To bow to mounting investor pressure to exit the most polluting fuel, BHP may need to sell a profitable mine for much less than it believes it’s worth.Activists have for years said that miners could face a cliff-edge moment by holding onto assets for too long -- and that now seems to be happening in thermal coal. While the mines generate plenty of cash and will have customers for years to come, investors increasingly don’t want to hold shares in companies digging the fuel, which accounts for about 30% of carbon emissions.What’s happening in coal may be a warning to other mining and oil and gas companies about how quickly assets can drop in value as investors rally behind the Paris climate accord. It also presents a risk for resource companies that invest in projects based on the coming decades, rather than years.Coal-asset values have collapsed quickly. Rio Tinto Group sold its last coal mines for almost $4 billion just two years ago amid strong interest from big miners and private equity groups. Now rivals BHP and Anglo American Plc risk paying the price of waiting too long.“We could have exited a few years back, and we probably would have got a better price, but we’ve also made good cash flows from what are good assets,” Anglo American Chief Executive Officer Mark Cutifani said. “How we exit is more important to me, in terms of stakeholders and reputation, than getting an absolute number on the bottom line.”Burning coal is the top contributor to carbon dioxide emissions, causing tens of thousands of deaths a year. While Europe is rapidly turning its back on the fuel, Asian countries like India and China are building hundreds of new power plants and global demand is expected to hold up over the next two decades.But major miners realize their earnings from coal will ultimately be outweighed by the risk of too many investors dumping their stock. Even Glencore Plc, one of the staunchest defenders of the fuel, agreed to cap output and plans to separate the business should it spook too many shareholders.There are signs the pool of potential buyers of thermal coal mines is shrinking. BHP rejected early offers from parties including Yancoal Australia Ltd. and Adani Group’s local unit for Mt Arthur that missed its own valuation, Bloomberg reported this week. Anglo American has decided it would be better to spin off its South African coal business rather than finding a buyer with enough cash.“Who else is going to buy a massive thermal coal mine at this point in time? Is any other mining house going to come in, I doubt it,” said Tim Buckley, a Sydney-based director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “Private equity is unfortunately the only answer.”Writing DownColombia’s giant Cerrejon mine shows how tough it may be to offload assets. Owned by Glencore, Anglo and BHP, it mainly ships coal to Europe, where the market has been hit by cheap gas prices. Glencore has already written down the asset by $435 million and there are few obvious buyers for such a mine.With thermal-coal asset values dropping so heavily in recent years, there’s potentially not much more room for prices to drop, said Nick Stansbury, head of commodity research at Legal & General Investment Management, which manages more than 1.2 trillion pounds ($1.5 trillion) of assets. Still, it might make more sense to sell them for less than they’re worth, rather than face investor backlash for holding onto them.More shareholders “are adopting policies that say ‘I don’t want to own companies that produce thermal coal, it is so unaligned with Paris, it is so inconsistent with my investment values,’” Stansbury said. “Companies that aren’t Paris aligned are going to be increasingly bad investments, not because the cash flows are at risk, but because the cost of capital is going up.”For some diversified miners, the fuel represents little more than a rounding error on overall earnings. Thermal coal accounts for a small fraction of BHP’s and Anglo American’s profits. It’s much more important for Glencore -- the biggest thermal coal shipper gets about one-third of its mining profit from the commodity and has been the most resistant to investor pressure.Glencore billionaire CEO Ivan Glasenberg agreed to cap production to “still have investors.” The company’s management is also prepared to spin off its coal unit should it start to detract from the value placed on its other mines, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private.That would allow it to focus on mining copper, cobalt and nickel, which are seen essential to green technologies.“Unlike oil and gas, Big Mining does not require complete reinvention,” Deutsche Bank AG said in a note. “In-house energy transition opportunities are available, but M&A would help to improve the opportunity set for some of the companies.”Still, investor attitudes can change quickly. Two years ago, Anglo American said investors supported the view that the company was best positioned to keep running coal mines the world needs, with local communities set to benefit from better access to health care, water and non-mining related jobs. Now, investors increasingly disagree.“For us, our thermal coal assets are high quality and well located, but they are our shortest life assets on average, so it’s a rational economic decision and our likely exit is via a demerger,” Anglo’s Cutifani said. “But simply selling assets is not necessarily the best decision for the planet. That’s the reality.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stuck-coal-pits-world-needs-040000545.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-16	2020-07-16 07:11:18	BHP	BHP Group	BHP Is Said to Rebuff Early Bids Under Plan to Quit Thermal Coal	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group has rejected early offers for its Australian thermal coal business that missed the miner’s own valuation as the year-long hunt for a buyer continues, according to people familiar with the matter.Yancoal Australia Ltd. and Adani Group’s Australian unit are among those to have had approaches for the Mt Arthur mine rebuffed, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. BHP may step up its search for a buyer in the coming months, according to some of the people.While there’s strong interest in thermal coal assets from private equity, there’s much less appetite among major miners to add production of the fuel. BHP itself is looking to exit the business as growing climate change concerns have weakened its long-term demand outlook and ratcheted up pressure from investors to ditch the dirtiest fossil fuel.BHP last year tapped Macquarie Group Ltd. to work on the potential sale of the wholly owned Mt Arthur asset and also tasked JPMorgan Chase & Co. with finding a buyer for its one-third stake in the Cerrejon thermal coal operation in Colombia, people familiar with the matter said in August.“Yancoal considers acquisitive growth opportunities as they arise, such as BHP’s thermal coal assets, and is committed to only acquiring appropriately priced assets of genuine future value,” a spokesperson for the Sydney-based company said in a statement.Adani’s Australian unit and BHP, which generates about 3% of its revenues from Mt Arthur and Cerrejon, both declined to comment.BHP will remain a major exporter of metallurgical coal for steel-making, with nine Australian mines.Mt Arthur, among Australia’s largest coal operations, may be worth about $1 billion, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a note last week.Thermal coal is “a small part of the portfolio,” BHP Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry said on an earnings call in February. “We see the downside scenarios as being greater than the upside, so if somebody presented an offer for us to exit for value, we’d consider that.”Executives, including Henry, have also said BHP would be happy to retain the asset rather than sell at a low price.Mt Arthur is forecast to have had production in the 12 months ended on June 30 of between 15 million and 17 million tons. BHP is scheduled to report output data next week.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-said-rebuff-early-bids-071118633.html?.tsrc=rss

An initial, eight-day hearing will establish whether the case can be heard in Britain, although the judge is expected to reserve judgment until later in the year.

Fatalities rose by 1.8% to 2,525. Texas Issues Mask Order (4:30 p.m. NY)Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered residents to wear face coverings amid a spike in cases in the second-most populous U.S. state.In a reversal of his months-long opposition to such a mandate, Abbott on Thursday said the order applies to all counties with 20 or more virus cases. He also barred people from gathering in groups larger than 10.The Republican governor has been under growing pressure from Democratic mayors and county leaders to crack down or at least grant them authority to mandate masks and other restrictions.U.S. Cases Rise the Most Since May 9 (4 p.m. NY)Coronavirus cases in the U.S. rose by 56,800 from a day earlier to 2.72 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. The 2.1% increase was higher than the average daily increase of 1.7% over the past week and the biggest jump since May 9.

NY)The novel coronavirus is showing some signs of mutating in a way that may make it easier to spread, according to Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Research currently underway suggests a single mutation is emerging that lets the virus replicate better and create a higher viral load, measures that could make it easier to transmit, Fauci said at an online event Thursday hosted by the Journal of the American Medical Association.There is some dispute about the findings and it’s not clear whether people who become infected with a newer variation of the pathogen fare worse than those with the original strain, he said. “It just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible,” he said. “This is still at the stage of trying to confirm that.”Moderna Sets Human Trial for Vaccine (1:40 p.m. NY)Drug-maker Moderna Inc. said a 30,000-patient trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate will start late this month, although a Stats News article earlier Thursday said the work had been expected to begin next week.

Vice President Mike Pence visited Arizona the same day but didn’t mention the record figures. He said he was optimistic as the number of “fatalities are declining across the country.”NYC Schools Plan September Reopening (11:15 a.m. NY)New York City plans to reopen the nation’s largest public school system in September with social-distancing guidelines and the maximum number of students at the start, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday.De Blasio said he anticipates some schools will have enough space for all their students, even with new guidelines. Those schools that can’t accommodate all students will operate on a staggered schedule, which will be announced “well in advance,” he said.Everyone will be required to wear face masks and facilities will undergo a deep cleaning each day.Houston Hospitals Tested (11:05 a.m. NY)In Houston and the nine counties surrounding it, virus patients in regular hospital beds outnumber intensive-care cases by almost 3-to-1, according to data from the SouthEast Texas Regional Advisory Council. The figures underscore the pressure on medical staff to care for patients not sick enough to require the most-invasive measures.There were 691 Covid-19 patients in ICU wards Wednesday night in the region including Houston, one of the hardest-hit cities in the U.S. Sunbelt’s accelerating outbreak, according to Setrac data Thursday. That population was dwarfed by the 1,948 virus cases in regular hospital care.Covid-19 patients of all types accounted for 26% of hospitalizations in the region, up from 7.6% at the end of May.

Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, SkyWest and Spirit Airlines also reached deals to borrow from the Treasury.Mnuchin Hints at School Aid in Stimulus (10:20 a.m. NY)Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump administration is in contact with schools and universities on reopening, and officials are considering help in the next round of economic stimulus to “properly equip” schools for social distancing and to make other adjustments. “In most cases, schools will be able to open safely,” Mnuchin said at the White House.As Cases Surge, South Africa Hub Adds Beds (9:26 a.m. NY)South Africa’s Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria, will add more than 2,000 hospital beds this month and is considering localized lockdowns and curbs on alcohol as the number of cases surges.The country’s commercial hub has recorded about 3,000 infections a day in the past two weeks, the most nationwide, and hospitalizations and the mortality rate have increased “dramatically,” David Makhura, the province’s premier, said Thursday. Currently 144 patients require ventilators in the region, up from just four a month ago.England’s Infection Rate Has Leveled Off: ONS (9:20 a.m. NY)An average of 0.04% of the community population, the equivalent of 25,000 people, had Covid-19 between June 14 and June 27, the Office for National Statistics estimated. The figure was 0.06% in the previous two-week period and more than 0.3% when the survey started in April. Estimates are based on tests performed on a sampling of people outside of hospitals, care homes and other institutional settings.U.S. June Jobs Rise Above-Forecast 4.8 Million (8:30 a.m. NY)The rebound in the U.S. labor market accelerated in June as broader reopenings spurred more hiring, though filings for unemployment benefits remained elevated last week as coronavirus cases picked up.

2020-06-24	2020-06-24 16:20:52	BHP	BHP Group	Chevron Clinches Australia Gas Deal With BHP Nickel West	U.S. energy giant Chevron Corp. (CVX) said it clinched a deal in Australia with BHP’s (BHP) Nickel West unit for the delivery of natural gas.Starting in July, Chevron will supply BHP Nickel West with a total of 22 petajoules of equity domestic gas from its Wheatstone facility over a 3.5 year term. Financial terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed.Chevron Australia Managing Director Al Williams said the agreement highlighted the important role of natural gas in powering critical industries, such as mining, across the state.“Chevron is committed to delivering natural gas supplies to Western Australian homes and businesses, helping to power local jobs, industry and communities,” Williams said. “As a reliable and cost-effective way to generate electricity, natural gas is a vital energy source for current and future energy needs of Western Australian industry.”At full capacity, the Chevron-operated Gorgon and Wheatstone natural gas facilities will produce 500 terajoules per day of domestic gas for the Western Australian market – enough to generate electricity for 4.3 million households.Chevron has been present in Australia for more than 60 years and operates the country’s largest onshore oilfield on Barrow Island and is a significant investor in exploration.Chevron stock, which fell sharply with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, has gained back part of its losses over the past three months. However, shares are still down 27% for the year. They fell 4% to $87.77 in midday trading on Wednesday.Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott this month reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $103 price target, citing the macro backdrop improvement, sustained higher prices needed to increase capex, and the focus on lower emissions and breakthrough technologies.&quot;CVX remains our preferred US integrated oil stock, offering peer-leading cash flow anchored by low-risk investments, a differentiated value proposition in the sector – particularly in the current uncertain macro backdrop,” McDermott wrote in a note to investors. “The strategy supports its ~6% dividend yield, all with a low corporate breakeven and strong balance sheet that make the strategy resilient through the cycle, while retaining attractive leverage to any potential oil price recovery.&quot;Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic on the stock. The Moderate Buy consensus breaks down into 9 Buy analyst ratings versus 5 Hold ratings and 1 Sell rating. The $101.15 average analyst price target indicates 15% upside potential from current levels over the next 12 months.

Danone withdrew its guidance as the pandemic takes a toll on bottled-water sales, though it did benefit from consumers stockpiling.On the brighter side, Dutch payments firm Adyen NV reported a bounce in revenue, two medical-equipment firms saw demand grow and exchange-traded products company Flow Traders NV earned more in the first three months of the year than it did in the entire 2019.Key Developments:European stocks fell with the Stoxx 600 benchmark down 2%, dragged lower by declines in oil and basic resources shares.BHP Sees Lower Capex Amid Caution Over Virus Second WaveDanone Withdraws 2020 Forecast Amid Coronavirus UncertaintyFor more on dividends, click here.

It’s facing challenges in adapting to rapidly-changing consumer demand and seeing higher costs in its supply chain. The shares fell 3%.Associated British Foods Plc said it’s too early to provide earnings guidance for this year and said the timing to reopen Primark budget fashion retail stores is uncertain. Primark has no online business, so the hit it has taken from stores being closed has been more severe than for rivals. Shares in the group fell as much as 6.5%.Chief Executive George Weston said the group is working on plans to ensure social-distancing in Primark stores and would not be drawn on whether the pandemic will prompt Primark to launch an online business.Basic ResourcesBHP reported a rise in iron ore output as the steel industry in China recovers from the pandemic, though it warned that a second wave of infections could threaten the rebound. The shares fell as much as 5.9% in London. The world’s biggest miner is reviewing its annual copper and energy coal guidance after cutting its expectations for nickel production and forecasting lower capex in fiscal 2021. The Covid-19 impact for the group is minor, with both iron ore production and shipments topping expectations, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts said.The Stoxx 600 Basic Resources sector dropped after BHP’s caution on the virus risks, with diversified miners and steel stocks slumping.Gold miner Centamin Plc kept its full-year production forecast at 510,000 to 540,000 ounces, as well as cash cost guidance at $630 to $680. CFO Ross Jerrard said the miner had a strong start of the year, with operational and financial performance delivered ahead of plan. The company will pay a first interim dividend of 6 cents. The shares rose by as much as 5% before dropping 1.3%.AutosPSA Group said sales dropped by 16% in the first three months and it expects the European car market will shrink by a quarter in 2020. The owner of the Peugeot and Citroen brands, which is planning to merge with Fiat Chrystler Automobiles NV, said it has secured liquidity and has cut costs as it prepares for a rebound in what is a chaotic economic environment. The stock fell as much as 2.6% before rebounding as much 0.9%. Goldman Sachs said the results were solid but said the downturn in the car market will result in a “notable step-up” in inventories which will put pressure on the carmaker’s balance sheet and liquidity.Bloomberg Intelligence’s Michael Dean said the prediction of a 25% drop in European car sales in 2020 is “scary but realistic.”FinancialsIt’s not all doom and gloom out there: Some companies actually benefit from the volatility in the financial markets. Flow Traders, the Amsterdam-based market maker for exchange-traded funds, said first-quarter net trading income surged to 495 million euros. The number exceeded the level achieved in all of 2019. The shares jumped as much as 7.5% but later reversed to fall as much as 3.5%, with analysts at KBC saying further upside is limited as they cut their rating on the stock.London Stock Exchange Group Plc still expects to complete its $27 billion takeover of data company Refinitiv in the second half of the year even as the European Union asked companies to put on hold formal submission of papers for regulatory review. First-quarter total income rose by 13%, driven by increased equity trading and higher clearing activity. Shares rose 0.2%. Citigroup said the equity trading and clearing results were notably strong.PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s biggest lender, said its first-quarter profit was hit by the virus and said it will set aside a “conservative” provision to cover deteriorating loan risks. The shares fell 3.3% in Warsaw.IndustrialsRoyal Vopak NV, the world’s largest independent oil storage company, said that space for traders to store crude and refined fuels has all but run out as a result of the fast-expanding glut caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The shares fell as much as 1.8% after the company posted first-quarter results on Tuesday, with ING saying the results were disappointing.Construction materials manufacturer Sika AG said its first-quarter sales grew and confirmed its medium-term targets, but said it can’t provide an outlook for 2020. CEO Paul Schuler said Chinese construction is bouncing back from the downturn. Jefferies said the results were a “slight beat” and the impact the virus has had so far has been more limited than anticipated. Sika shares were up 4.9%.Finnish forestry and packaging firm Stora Enso Oyj said it was discontinuing its quarterly guidance and annual outlook and said the decline in demand for European paper has accelerated. Handelsbanken said the firm’s packaging materials, forest and wood-products units all beat expectations. Shares in Stora Enso slipped 0.5%.Swiss pump maker Sulzer AG said its five factories in China have reopened and it is seeing a pick up in activity in the country. But the group plans to cut jobs this year as oil companies delay projects.TMTGermany’s SAP SE said software license revenue dropped 31% to 451 million euros in the first quarter while cloud revenue jumped 27% to more than 2 billion euros. The company, which also announced late Monday that co-CEO Jennifer Morgan was stepping down, which Citigroup analysts said overshadowed the results, which had been pre-announced. The shares fell 2.4%.Adyen said revenue grew by more than a third in the first quarter despite fees from the travel and accommodation sector taking a hit. It said it processed 67 billion euros of payments in the first three months, a 38% increase, though warned that a deep recession could hurt its earnings. Adyen shares bounced as much as 7.8%, the most since January 2019.Just Eat, which is being acquired by Takeaway.com, said online food delivery orders rose 6% in the quarter to 65 million compared with the same period last year. Morgan Stanley said the order growth in the U.K. may disappoint.Swedish telecoms firm Tele2 AB said underlying earnings declined in the first quarter owing to lower equipment margins, higher bad-debt provisions and a reduction in international roaming due to the pandemic. The shares fell as much as 10%.Health CareLaboratory equipment maker Sartorius AG reported growth in first-quarter earnings and said the pandemic has had a neutral impact on the group overall but very different effects on its divisions. It said demand for lab instruments was noticeably hit in January and February, but demand for consumables for producing medicine and vaccines and for diagnostic kits has been higher. The shares bounced as much as 11% to a record high. Warburg analysts said the company is “working like clockwork.”Sartorius Stedim Biotech, the company’s French business, raised its full-year sales forecast after reporting a strong start to the year. The virus has boosted demand for its single-use technology franchise as labs increase efforts to prevent cross-contamination. Shares surged as much as 14% to a record in Paris.Spanish plasma protein maker Grifols SA said it has the resources and liquidity to fulfill its short- and medium-term obligations. The company announced the development of an anti-Covid-19 blood plasma product, which may be available in mid-July, and is also spearheading trials in agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to determine the efficacy of such therapies. The shares rose 1.2%.Travel & LeisureFrench state-controlled lottery and gaming group FDJ said that stakes over the first quarter dropped 5% to 4.1 billion euros, as a positive trend from the start of the year was cut short in its tracks in March 16, when France imposed a lockdown to fight the Covid-19 outbreak. The halt of most sports competitions meant the end of nearly 95% of sports betting, it says. The group outlined a cost-savings plan and cut its dividend by 30%. Shares rose 1.6%.EnergySpanish natural gas firm Enagas SA said its dividend policy is unaffected by the pandemic, it has a solid liquidity position and that earnings grew in the first quarter. It said industrial gas demand in Spain has dropped since mid-March when restrictions to slow the virus outbreak were put in place. The shares rose 1.4%.Market StrategyThe relative performance of momentum shares indicates that the crisis period for stocks is not yet over, according to UBS strategists. High-momentum shares have typically outperformed their low-momentum peers in previous sell-offs before this trend reversed as the market recovers. This has not happened yet, the strategists said.The distress gripping crude oil markets may be a bullish signal for stocks, BTIG strategists said. Large historic dislocations between front and second-month oil futures have traditionally been a positive omen for markets, they said.Listed companies have an advantage over private entities in the pandemic turmoil as their accounts are scrutinized more closely and balance sheets are better positioned, Peel Hunt LLP says in a note.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/psa-sees-car-sales-slump-073202082.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-21	2020-04-21 03:23:56	BHP	BHP Group	BHP Maintains Iron Ore Output Outlook Despite Shaken Economy	BHP Group (NYSE: BHP) late Monday maintained its iron ore outlook.Production and OutlookBHP iron ore production for the third quarter increased 7% year-over-year to 60.03 kt with record production levels at Western Australian Iron Ore, the company said in a press release. BHP maintains the iron ore production guidance for 2020 financial year between 242 and 253 Mt.With petroleum production recording a 13% dip in the third quarter, 2020 guidance is expected to be at the bottom range of 110 to 116 MMboe.Energy coal production was down 18% and guidance for the same is currently under review as Cerrejon coal mine in Columbia is on brief care and maintenance to contain the COVID-19 epidemic.Steel production, excluding China, is seen to narrow by a double digit percentage in 2020 as steel makers from across Europe, the Americas, India and Japan are under shutdowns or curbed productions for the June quarter.CEO commentsBHP CEO Mike Henry said that while Chinese demand has built up in the recent weeks, the June quarter would experience narrowing demand from the U.S., Europe and India. Also, capital and exploration guidance for the 2021 financial year is expected to be lower than the current guidance of around $8 billion.BHP's stock closed Monday 3.2% lower at $38.77 per share and ticked lower another 2.2% in after-hours trading.See more from Benzinga  * Wynn Resorts CEO Says Casino Prepared To Reopen In May With Thermal Cameras, Social Distancing  * United Strikes Sale-Leaseback Deal On 22 Planes As Pandemic Shrinks Flights By 90%  * Elliott Management's 'Gut Tells' Them Global Stocks Might Lose 50% In Value From February Levels(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-04-21	2020-04-21 02:44:23	BHP	BHP Group	BHP holds iron ore output outlook despite virus risks	BHP Group on Tuesday reported a 6.3% rise in third-quarter iron ore production that slightly missed analyst estimates, and maintained its iron ore forecast despite global economic disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  The world's largest listed miner warned, however, that global steel production excluding China could drop sharply this year in light of the pandemic, and that capital spending in 2021 would be lower than its current outlook of $8 billion.  The company kept its annual outlook for iron ore production unchanged at 273-286 million tonnes but said petroleum output would likely hit the bottom end of previous guidance of 110-116 million barrels of oil equivalent.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-holds-iron-ore-output-024423033.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-20	2020-04-20 16:31:01	BHP	BHP Group	What to Watch in Commodities: Virus, WTI, Alcoa, BHP, Chevron	(Bloomberg) -- Commodity markets are in line for a deluge of corporate information this week as earnings season hits high gear. Investors will pick over figures from a virus-roiled first quarter, while executives get a platform to lay out plans for the rest of the year, against a backdrop of debates over whether the pandemic is receding and how lockdowns may be eased.With West Texas Intermediate plunging to the lowest since futures began trading in New York in 1983 on concern key storage will get maxed out, those reporting include pipeline player Kinder Morgan Inc. and oilfield-services behemoth Baker Hughes Co. There are also earnings from aluminum giant Alcoa Corp. and coal-to-copper producer Teck Resources Ltd., as well as output data from BHP Group and Anglo American Plc.Beyond the corporate reporting calendar, oil major Chevron Corp. will learn whether it’ll be able to continue operating in oil-rich-but-impoverished Venezuela amid signals that President Donald Trump’s administration may not extend its sanction waiver this time around. And gold remains in the spotlight as the pivot toward plans for restarting economies acts as a headwind.Pushing Cushing’s LimitsEnergy markets will be dominated this week by escalating concern that storage facilities -- including the vital hub at Cushing, Oklahoma -- will soon fill to capacity as the pandemic crushes demand faster than supplies are cut back. With West Texas Intermediate dropping below $10 a barrel on Monday, there’ll be even more focus than usual on critical industry prints, including the estimate from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday and the American Petroleum Institute’s numbers issued the day before.The vast pool of oil at Cushing, the delivery point for the U.S. futures contract, has surged to 55 million barrels, the highest since late 2017, according to the latest EIA release. Working capacity at the site was 76.1 million barrels as of September 2019, according to the most recent government data. Among those who foresee tank tops being hit is Trafigura Group: “Cushing will be full in early May,” Saad Rahim, chief economist at trading house, has said.Writedowns Writ LargeBaker Hughes will round out first-quarter earnings from the three biggest oilfield-service companies on Wednesday. This month, the company wrote down $15 billion in value from two of its biggest units as the pandemic guts crude demand. The hired hands of the oil patch have been hammered as explorers retrench amid the worst rout in decades, with Schlumberger Ltd. cutting salaries and firing workers and Halliburton Co. furloughing thousands.Pipeline giant Kinder Morgan releases first-quarter earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, with a call to immediately follow. Investors and traders will be looking for commentary on how the company expects oil and gas flows on its pipeline system to be affected by the collapse in prices. Listeners will also be looking for an update on Kinder Morgan’s Permian Highway natural gas pipeline, which has run into landowner opposition in the Texas Hill Country.Time’s Up?Chevron and four oilfield-service providers will discover in the coming days whether they may continue operating in Venezuela as a 90-day sanctions waiver comes up for renewal. After four extensions since late 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department’s decision has become a fraught quarterly ritual for the companies, which also include Baker Hughes, Halliburton, Schlumberger and Weatherford International Ltd. The current waiver expires April 22.With oil prices now laid low by the pandemic, the Treasury’s assessment comes at a time of extreme stress both for Venezuela and the companies involved. The U.S. administration is seeking to replace President Nicolas Maduro’s regime in the country that’s home to the world’s largest crude reserves.Feeling the PainAluminum has been among the hardest-hit commodities as coronavirus shutdowns hammer demand. So the 2020 outlook expected on Wednesday from Alcoa, the biggest U.S. producer, is likely to get more attention than usual from investors trying to gauge how deep and long-lasting the damage will be for the lightweight metal used in products from jets to iPhones.In January, the Pittsburgh-based company reported a wider-than-expected loss and said that it saw global output outstripping demand this year. Since then, things have only gotten far, far worse, with prices in March posting the biggest monthly drop since 2011. Chief Executive Officer Roy Harvey may also offer his perspective on plans to restart the battered U.S. economy.Juggling ActTeck Resources CEO Don Lindsay has been quick to blame many of the diversified miner’s recent problems on the coronavirus. Investors and analysts will be looking for clarity on how bad things really are, and how the Vancouver-based company plans to juggle its multitude of challenges. Teck has promised to release an updated capital budget and schedule for its flagship Phase 2 Quebrada Blanca project in Chile with quarterly earnings on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Teck has suspended operations at the Antamina mine in Peru, a joint venture with BHP, Glencore Plc and Mitsubishi Corp., and is considering a full shutdown of Fort Hills, its Canada oil sands joint venture. Even before the coronavirus became a full-fledged pandemic, the miner had trouble getting some products to market, warning sales of steelmaking coal would be hurt by bad weather and rail blockades earlier this year. Teck’s annual general meeting is later the same day. The stock has lost half its value this year.Digging InTwo of the world’s biggest miners report first-quarter production numbers this week, providing more insight on the coronavirus impact and guidance on output goals. While Anglo American has been able to keep most of its South African assets running, it’s been forced to reduce the number of workers at those operations. Investors will be looking for updates on when the company’s De Beers diamond unit will resume sales, and what level of demand exists in an industry that’s been hit hard by the pandemic. The release comes Thursday.BHP, which issues its statement on Tuesday, has been relatively unaffected by the virus so far, with iron ore and coal mines in Australia continuing. Still, investors will be seeking clarity on supply from copper mines in Chile and how Chinese demand is holding up. Leading up to the releases, Vale SA cut its forecast iron ore output for 2020, and Rio Tinto Group said there’s an uncertain outlook for most raw materials demand outside China.Out of Puff?Top gold miner Newmont Corp. reckons the precious metal may have the scope to hit a record $2,000 an ounce as governments and central banks pump up stimulus to rescue the global economy from the pandemic. But investors will be on alert this week to see whether prices can hold onto recent gains as talk about easing lockdowns and restarting activity this quarter gathers pace.So far in 2020, bullion has been one of the beneficiaries of the outbreak as risk assets took a beating and evidence accumulated of the economic fallout. Should the overall tone of the markets now shift toward recovery, that may hurt prices and reverse the build-up of holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded funds.For the DiaryClick here for oil marketsClick here for gas marketsClick here for metals marketsClick here for agriculture marketsClick here for the latest DaybreakAnd for the global stage, click hereFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/watch-commodities-virus-wti-alcoa-103350718.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-03	2020-04-03 02:21:56	BHP	BHP Group	Virus Curbs Force Oil, Mine Workers to Move Across a Continent	(Bloomberg) -- Some of the biggest mining and energy companies are scrambling to respond to tightening controls on movement inside Australia -- the biggest exporter of iron ore and liquefied natural gas -- by temporarily rehousing employees and their families thousands of miles from home.About 800 so-called fly-in fly-out, or FIFO, mining workers have been relocated to Western Australia for potentially the next three months, and around 300 to Queensland, along with scores of people staffing offshore oil and gas operations, according to the Australian Workers’ Union.BHP Group, the world’s biggest miner, has relocated about 300 workers to Western Australia, including train drivers and tug boat pilots -- some from as far away as the island state of Tasmania, about an eight-hour flight away.It’s part of the multi-industry effort to ensure the nation’s giant iron ore mines, oil platforms and LNG projects have sufficient employees available to maintain output even as the country’s states enforce stricter controls over regional borders. It’ll also be crucial for China, as the top raw materials buyer powers up its economy, with manufacturing activity rebounding strongly in March.Western Australia, a resources powerhouse that generates more than A$150 billion ($90 billion) a year in export earnings from metals and petroleum, plans to close its border by Monday, with only limited exemptions.“We will be turning Western Australia into an island within an island,” Mark McGowan, the state’s premier, said Thursday. “Our isolation is now our best defense”While FIFO workers and their families will be allowed entry, they’ll need to isolate for 14 days each time, meaning companies are acting to temporarily relocate their staff and minimize disruption over coming months.Read more: Western Australia to Close Border Sunday to Stop Virus SpreadWoodside Petroleum Ltd. will use “now-vacant hotels, motels and short-stay accommodation” for staff and their families from other states, the company said in a statement. Rio Tinto Group and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., are also adjusting working patterns and asking staff to spend longer stretches at a time on site.BHP said it will stop FIFO workers from entering townships close to mine sites, to help prevent the spread of the virus, and use only dedicated charter flights to transport staff into Queensland.“The mining sector is a critical part of the state and national economy and we are committed to working with government and playing our part to help keep our industry operating safely,” Tim Day, BHP’s acting asset president for Western Australian Iron Ore, said in a Friday statement.There’s a more difficult task for smaller companies to move workers around the country, while they’re also more exposed to the impact of workers falling ill with the virus, Warren Pearce, chief executive officer of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, said by phone. The combination of those factors could hamper some operations and “impede our ability to keep them at full production levels,” he said.Travel restrictions in Western Australia will cause disruption to output and lift operating costs, iron ore producer Mount Gibson Iron Ltd. said in a March 30 filing.Union leaders have struck agreements over additional allowances and pay rates for quarantine periods with energy operators including Modec Inc. and Inpex Corp, said Daniel Walton, national secretary of the Australian Workers’ Union. Inpex last month reported a worker tested positive for Covid-19 on a drilling rig off the Western Australia coast.There are job security worries for other energy workers and as many as 2,000 mining FIFO workers who haven’t been able to relocate on family or personal grounds. “They are being paid right now, but we do have concerns about what will happen in the future,” Walton said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virus-curbs-force-oil-mine-022156540.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-03-27	2020-03-27 10:00:00	BHP	BHP Group	Deep Underground and Sleeping at Work: How to Dodge Covid-19	(Bloomberg) -- There’s room for about 2,500 people, a golf simulator and a three-storey cafe at BHP Group’s Mulla Mulla mining camp, deep in Australia’s remote Pilbara region, one of the world’s most important iron ore hubs.The site and dozens more like it would be a perfect breeding ground for COVID-19. But sending employees to work from home isn’t an option. For much of the year, it is their home; where they eat, sleep and work in close proximity for weeks at a time.It’s a potentially devastating risk that the biggest resources companies are juggling the world over, from oil rigs in the North Sea to copper mines in the Chilean desert. With much of the world’s raw materials extracted in remote and inhospitable locations, they’re scrambling to protect the well-being of their vast residential workforces while keeping the world supplied with critical commodities.“We are not a business that can do all of our work remotely,” said Mike Henry, chief executive officer of BHP, the world’s top miner and a company that employs about 72,000 staff or contractors, “We are fully focused on action to reduce the risk of transmission.”BHP isn’t alone. Mines in Chile to oil fields on Alaska’s North Slope are limiting access, splitting crews into rotating teams and checking temperatures of employees as they step aboard helicopters or pass through access gates at sites.Isolation zones have been set up at accommodation villages, hot buffets scrapped at canteens, and extra cleaners hired. In Australia, the Royal Flying Doctor Service is on alert to airlift patients from far-flung operations, while at Rio Tinto Group’s Kitimat aluminum smelter in Canada, emergency plans for virus cases are pinned up alongside warnings about the location of grizzly bears.Producers are also attempting to keep pace with rapidly tightening controls on the movement of people and goods, and preparing for the potential impact of multiple positive cases. “Everyone’s got a bunch of scenarios that they’re planning for,” said Paul Everingham, chief executive officer of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia.Read more: World’s Miners Slowly Grind to a Halt on Virus RestrictionsSome cracks are appearing, though largely because the drastic government measures around the world to contain the virus are making it unfeasible to keep operating, as opposed to the virus actually taking down the workforce. Platinum powerhouse South Africa this week said it was shutting its mines for three weeks amid a nationwide lockdown, while operations in copper giants Chile and Peru have been curtailed.A widespread shutdown of global resources production would just deepen the havoc the virus is already wreaking on the commodities industry. While demand is being devastated as swathes of the world go into lockdown, China’s gradually returning to work and is going to start needing more raw materials as its factories fire up again.The challenge is particularly acute in commodity powerhouses like Australia, Russia and Canada where staff often need to be transported in and housed because production sites are so remote.About 20% of Australia’s mining workforce of around 218,000 are fly-in staff that typically stay at sites for between one and four weeks at a time. The U.S. oil and gas sector alone employs about 157,000 people, including on offshore rigs.Canada’s oil sands industry has already had suspected cases and has taken action at camps to reduce the prospects of virus transmission. Producer Suncor Energy Inc. is taking steps including spacing employees out on buses so nobody is sitting next to anyone else.And in Russia, which churns out everything from crude to nickel in some of the most remote locations on the planet, oil producer Gazprom Neft PJSC has increased the length of shifts at its camps. Crude-pipeline operator Transneft PJSC has done the same.“We have remote work sites and a relatively tight density of people,” ConocoPhillips Chief Operating Officer Matt Fox said last week on an investor call. The producer has limited the number of workers at its assets in Alaska, freeing up bed spaces to serve as a potential quarantine, and is reviewing options at other sites, including in Norway and China. “If necessary, we can have quarantine available in these locations,” he said.BP Plc has divided workers at major operational sites into separate shifts, and is restricting contact between the two teams. Other energy producers including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Inpex Corp. have already had staff test positive for COVID-19 in recent days. South African utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. is housing power station workers in lodges away from their families.Read more: Oil-Sands Workers Brace for ‘Hellish’ Outbreak in Remote CampsAt BHP’s Whaleback operation, opened in 1967 and the oldest mine in Australia’s Pilbara, yellow tape marks out social spacing distances on the floor of a cafeteria and solo workers sit at opposite ends of communal tables usually crowded with staff.Employees at other BHP sites are holding meetings in outdoor picnic areas, or using grids laid out on floors to make sure they don’t stray too close when gathered indoors. A small group of tug boat operators who usually commute from Tasmania to Western Australia -- typically a nine-hour journey on multiple flights -- have been temporarily relocated, along with their families.Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. both confirmed Friday they’ll change shift patterns to reduce movement in and out of Australian mines, asking workers to carry out longer stints at a time.It’s inevitable there will be some impact on output as producers implement virus-protection measures, said Paul Mitchell, Sydney-based global mining and metals leader at EY, which is working with clients on handling the pandemic.“Even if you keep running, there will be some disruption, because running at 100% is going to put pressure on a workforce,” he said. Some companies are examining options to add flexibility by housing additional workers closer to their mines in unused tourist accommodation or construction camps. BHP is seeking to hire 1,500 staff in temporary roles to help operations through the crisis.There’s a recognition that busy mining camps hold risks of multiple infections once any cases arise, according to Mitchell. “They’re set up to minimize space,” he said. “They’re not set up for isolation because of their very nature.”Even for miners who return home after their shifts, rather than living in camps, the safest place to be right now may be underground, according to Bob Timbs, a district official for the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union, which represents about 20,000 mining and energy workers in Australia.Members include workers at South32 Ltd.’s Illawarra Metallurgical Coal operation southwest of Sydney, where shift times have been staggered and less than half the usual number of miners are packing in to cages that ferry them on a journey underground that can take as long as 10 minutes.“Once they’re underground and in their development teams, they might only have contact with seven or eight people during the whole day, that’s a lot less than in an office environment,” said Timbs, a third-generation coal miner. “I’ve got more concerns for the guys when they are on the surface.”(Adds details in 18th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/miles-underground-sleeping-dodge-virus-220000953.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-18	2020-03-18 14:26:21	BHP	BHP Group	JPMorgan: 2 Dividend Stocks to Buy (And 1 to Avoid)	We’re in a bear market now, as economies everywhere have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic and the quarantines and restrictions imposed to combat it. But there’s a saying on Wall Street: Bulls and bears make money, while the pigs get slaughtered. Yes, the markets are falling, but a savvy investor can still find profitable plays – just don’t get greedy, and you can turn a profit no matter what the market conditions.Since the virus scare began, and during the economy’s swing from bull to bear, investment bank JPMorgan has kept its finger on the pulse of the stock market. The firm’s analysts are seeking out the stock moves that offer potential profits – or pitfalls. With institutional wisdom stretching back over 200 years, JPM brings a long-term perspective to the markets.We’ve looked into JPMorgan's recent calls, and using the TipRanks database, we’ve chosen three stocks with particularly high yield dividends and substantial upside potential – over 50% for the coming months. One of them, though, demands more caution from investors. Let’s take a closer look.Nutrien, Ltd. (NTR)We’ll start Down Under, with an agricultural company. Nutrien started doing business under its current name in January 2018, after the PotashCorp and Agrium merged. Now based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Nutrien is the world’s largest producer of potash and nitrogen fertilizers, essential in modern agriculture and big-business farming. Even after the current market drops, the company still has a total market cap of $15 billion.Finishing up 2019, NTR reported Q4 earnings of 9 cents, far below the forecast 29 cents. Revenue was also well below estimates, at $3.44 billion. Looking ahead, the company provided FY2020 EPS guidance in the $1.90 to $2.60 range, this was below the consensus, which had expected $3.04. Despite the disappointing quarterly report, NTR shares actually rose slightly after the release – and did not drop sharply until the first week of March, when the coronavirus hit was unavoidable.Nutrien has maintained its 45-cent quarterly dividend, with the next payment scheduled for mid-April. The annualized payment is a healthy $1.80, and the yield is 6.8%. Considering that the average yield among S&P listed companies is only 2%, and that the Fed has cut its key rate to near zero, NTR shares offer a substantial return for investors.4-star analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas, in his recent comments of NTR, gave the stock an upgrade from Neutral to Buy. Along with this, his $44 price target implies an upside potential of 69%.Supporting his stance, Zekauskas says, “We think that the stability of agricultural demand and overall financial return will prove alluring to investors in an uncertain global industrial demand environment affected by COVID-19... We think that Nutrien’s large retail business is well positioned for 2020 given likely increases in planted acres in corn and soy.” (To watch Zekauskas’ track record, click here)Overall, Nutrien has received 9 Buy ratings and 4 Holds in recent weeks, giving the stock a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus view. NTR shares are selling for a discounted price, $26.63, and the average price target, $51.85, suggests a premium of 92% over the coming months. (See Nutrien stock analysis on TipRanks)BHP Group, Plc. (BHP)Next up is an Aussie mining conglomerate BHP. The company has major mining operations in Australia, North American, and South America, as well as oil and gas extraction operations in the US, UK, Algeria, and the Caribbean. Mining ops, making up the bulk of the company’s efforts, focus on coal, copper, and iron ore. BHP saw revenues in excess of US$44 billion in 2019.BHP reported positive results just as the corona virus epidemic began to spread. Company management has stated that they do not expect COVID-19 to put a strong impact on current operations, but could do so if the disease outbreak extends beyond March. China, the coronavirus epicenter, is a major buyer of BHP’s Australian iron ore.That said, in 2H19, BHP reported solid results, with a half-year profit of US$4.9 billion and free cash flow of US$3.7 billion. The gain in free cash flow was attributed to higher prices for iron ore. The solid fiscal performance underlay the company’s 65-cent dividend announcement. BHP pays out dividends semi-annually, and adjusts the payment to ensure sustainability. The current annualized dividend is $1.30, giving a strong yield of 8.24%. The firm financial footing puts BHP in a sound position to weather the current market storm.JPM analyst Lyndon Fagan, in a recent report, upgraded his rating on BHP, moving from Neutral to Buy. His price target, AUD$42, suggests an upside to the stock of 55%.In his comments, Fagan wrote, “While the COVID-19 crisis is yet to peak, and bond markets are pricing in a global recession, BHP's key customer is China, where the situation is improving. We see significant upside in the share price for investors willing to look through the crisis.” To watch Fagan’s track record, click here)Fagan’s review offers the most recent upside for BHP stock. The shares hold a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 2 Buy-side reviews and 1 Hold. (See BHP’s stock analysis at TipRanks)Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Last on our list is JPM’s bear case, Occidental Petroleum. OXY is a major hydrocarbon exploration company, with operations in the US, Colombia, and the Middle East, and petrochemical manufacturing facilities in the US, Canada, and Chile. The company is a major player in the Texas oil industry, which in recent years has made the US the world’s largest producer of crude oil – and more recently, a net exporter of petroleum products.Despite its status as a large oil and gas producer, and despite growing revenues, OXY missed on earnings in Q4 2019. The company saw total revenues for the quarter of $6.8 billion, beating the estimate by 3.6% and growing 41% year-over-year. EPS, however, missed badly, showing a net loss of 30 cents per share compared to the expected loss of 9 cents.OXY management maintained its 79-cent quarterly dividend, and set a payment date of April 15, even though earnings are insufficient to sustain it. The annualized dividend payment is $3.16, which is high in and of itself – but after the share price depreciated in the recent market falls, that annualized payment gives a stunning yield of 27.8%. In today’s climate of low oil prices and falling markets, OXY presents real risks for investors – but that dividend yield may make it worthwhile, especially considering the company’s 14-year history of keeping the dividend payments reliable.JPM’s 5-star analyst Phil Gresh sees it otherwise, however. He writes of OXY, “OXY had become far more levered to the downside oil price case and in need of the trifecta of high oil prices, perfect synergy execution and significant asset sales to bridge the gap. [...] Our Underweight rating is based on our view that OXY’s valuation is not compelling enough to compensate investors for its elevated dividend burden and financial leverage [...] Bottom line, we believe there is “no easy way out” of this financial predicament, absent a higher oil price case or a dividend cut.” (To watch Gresh’s track record, click here)OXY’s analyst consensus rating is a Hold, based on 15 recent reviews. These include 8 Holds and 5 Sells, as well as 2 Buys. The stock’s price has been pushed down to just $11.34, but there is play here for investors willing to shoulder some risk: the average price target of $25.55 suggests an upside potential of 125%.

2020-02-18	2020-02-18 06:32:32	BHP	BHP Group	The Top Miner’s Vision of The Future Looks A Lot Like The Past	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group’s new top executive has a plan to prosper in a world that’s accelerating efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions -- double down on the raw materials that’ve been key through its near 170-year history.The world’s top miner, with roots in a 19th Century tin discovery, plans to add more copper and nickel to meet rising demand from renewable energy and electric vehicles, and sees a continuing role for key coal mines and oil wells, according to Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry, who signaled his tenure won’t begin with any radical overhaul.“We already produce some of the products that will be essential as the world transitions to a lower carbon economy and which will continue to prosper in a decarbonized world,” Henry, who took his post last month, told reporters Tuesday. “We do still need to create more options in future-facing commodities.”Alongside copper and nickel, potash is regarded by BHP as another key future material and the producer is on track to seek board approval next year to spend as much as $5.7 billion on the first stage of its Jansen mine project in Canada, Henry said.Demand in the battery sector alone for nickel will rise 16-fold and for copper by about 10-fold by 2030, according to BloombergNEF, while base metals are also key for wind turbines and solar power. Potash, a crop nutrient, is seen as poised for gains as nations seek to feed rising populations from a shrinking area of agricultural land.BHP also intends to accelerate efforts to curb its carbon emissions, Henry said in a Bloomberg TV interview, and will set out new targets later this year. “We’ll be doing more on that front,” including setting goals for tackling customers’ emissions, he said.Like rivals Glencore Plc and Rio Tinto Group -- both of which have touted the role of their existing commodities in meeting future demand trends -- BHP hopes to convince investors it can adapt to the world’s shifting raw materials needs without any sweeping changes to its portfolio, or any need for costly and risky deal-making.“My first preference is to be securing these options through exploration and early stage entry,” Henry said in the interview. “We’ll be looking to create the portfolio that fits the future.”BHP has also considered metals including cobalt and lithium, but sees the markets as currently lacking sufficient scale, Henry told analysts.Henry continues to see long-term value in oil and coking coal production, sectors that are increasingly under scrutiny from investors focused on climate concerns. Declining rates of global oil output and a demand outlook that’s seen peaking only in the mid-2030s mean BHP’s petroleum unit remains attractive, while the producer sees no current substitute to replace metallurgical coal in the steel-making process.BHP remains open to exiting from thermal coal assets in Australia and Colombia, Henry said, though is seen by analysts as facing a tough task to extract sufficient value from a shrinking pool of buyers.Despite the focus on potential future sources of demand growth, iron ore continues to be the engine of current profits, accounting for about 47% of revenue in final six months of 2019, up from about 36% in the same period a year earlier.&#92;--With assistance from Haidi Lun and Shery Ahn.To contact the reporter on this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Keith Gosman, Phoebe SedgmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-miner-vision-future-looks-063232626.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-02-18	2020-02-18 01:36:35	BHP	BHP Group	BHP Sees Next Six Weeks as Key For Virus Hit to Commodities	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group warned raw materials demand and prices will take a hit on lower growth in China if the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak extends beyond the end of next month.The world’s biggest miner flagged China’s construction and manufacturing sectors need to return to regular operations in April to ensure that existing disruption can be made up for before the end of year.If the impact of the outbreak can’t be contained this quarter, annual growth forecasts will need to be revised down, Huw McKay, BHP’s vice president of market analysis and economics, said Tuesday in a blog post. “This would then flow directly through to lower commodity demand and price expectations.”BHP forecasts China’s growth to slow to about 6% this year and as low as 5.75% in 2021 based on a swift recovery from the virus outbreak. In a worst-case scenario that combined a lingering impact from the virus and a re-escalation of trade war tensions, the nation’s economic expansion this year could slip to 5.5%, the miner said.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Macquarie Group Ltd. are among banks who’ve cut China growth forecasts for both the first quarter and the full year as a result of the outbreak. China’s gross domestic product will grow 4% in the first quarter, according to the median of 18 forecasts since Jan. 31, which would be the lowest level since 1990.While BHP’s new Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry told reporters the producer hasn’t experienced any major impact to demand from China so far, caution over the virus outlook led the company to take a more conservative approach on its first-half dividend payment. Potential negative impacts for commodities markets have “barely been priced in,” according to Citigroup Inc.A decision to pay out a lower proportion of earnings compared to a year earlier reflected “caution due to near term market volatility driven by the 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak, trade policy and geopolitics,” BHP said in a separate statement, as it posted first-half earnings that jumped 29%.The miner said it expects annual crude oil demand to decline by about 200,000 barrels a day as a result of disruption so far, a figure that may rise further.If virus impacts are contained by the end of March, consumers of materials such as steel and copper should fully recover from the second quarter -- and potentially operate at higher than usual rates -- meaning that overall materials demand in 2020 will be unaffected, according to BHP’s McKay.About 90% of China’s steel production, more than 80% of auto production and floor space under construction and 80% of infrastructure investments are located in provinces with announced restart dates before the end of February, he said.To contact the reporter on this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Keith Gosman, Phoebe SedgmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-sees-next-six-weeks-013635028.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-02-17	2020-02-17 22:06:11	BHP	BHP Group	BHP Warns Over Virus Impact as Iron Ore Profits Boost New CEO	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group’s first-half earnings surged 29% on higher iron ore prices, allowing the company’s new top executive to extend a run of bumper returns to investors, even as the impact of the coronavirus outbreak stokes short-term uncertainty.The world’s top miner boosted its interim dividend payment 18%, though acknowledged that move reflected “caution due to near term market volatility driven by the 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak, trade policy and geopolitics.” BHP said Tuesday it will revise down expectations for economic and commodity demand growth, if the virus isn’t “demonstrably well contained” this quarter.Key InsightsNew Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry, a company veteran promoted to the role last month, set out some tentative details of his plans for the company, saying he wants BHP to be “safer, lower cost, more reliable and more productive -- with our portfolio and capabilities fit for the future.”Investors will be looking for more specifics as Henry hosts teleconferences Tuesday, and holds meetings over the coming weeks.The first-half earnings show just how dependent BHP remains on iron ore as an engine of profits. Sales of the steelmaking ingredient accounted for about 47% of revenue in the first half, up from about 36% a year ago.Underlying earnings at BHP’s continuing operations jumped to $5.2 billion from $4.03 billion a year earlier, BHP said. That was in line with a $5.1 billion median estimate among five analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.BHP is progressing work to set new goals for scope 3 carbon dioxide emissions -- those generated by customers using the company’s products -- and will outline new climate change plans later in 2020. Henry is facing more intense scrutiny over emissions and on preparations for longer-term shifts in demand for fossil fuels.The producer flagged petroleum output is now seen at the bottom of a forecast range of 110-116 MMboe as a result of Tropical Cyclone Damien off the coast of Western Australia. Iron ore and coal operations remain on track, it said.Market ReactionBHP’s Sydney-traded shares have advanced about 4% in the past year, lagging rivals including Rio Tinto Group and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd.Get MoreFor more details on the earnings data, click here.Read the statement here.To contact the reporter on this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Keith Gosman, Rob VerdonckFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-warns-over-virus-impact-220611302.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-14	2020-02-14 12:40:37	BHP	BHP Group	The Interview That Should Terrify Owners of Freeport-McMoRan Stock	On paper, there's an intriguing bull case for miner Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX). Freeport-McMoRan stock looks cheap. Copper prices have dipped of late, but have at least one important long-term tailwind. And Freeport has steadily improved its balance sheet in recent years, cutting net debt by over $12 billion between the end of 2015 and the end of 2019.Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.com But the key phrase is &quot;on paper.&quot; In practice, there's a huge stumbling block to the bull case for FCX stock. Even if Freeport-McMoRan can drive higher free cash flow, as bulls and the company itself project, there's a long-running concern as to where that cash flow is going to go.The answer, according to a recent interview with Freeport-McMoRan's chief executive officer, is not to shareholders. Given the history not just of Freeport but the entire mining industry, that's a significant problem.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Case for Freeport-McMoRan StockFCX stock already has been a solid investment in the last few years. Shares bottomed in January 2016 below $4, as pressure on the company's since-divested oil and gas assets weighed on the stock. From that bottom, Freeport-McMoRan stock has more than tripled -- and there's a case for more upside ahead.  * 20 Stocks to Buy From the Law of Accelerating Returns After all, production should increase nicely in the next two years. After its fourth-quarter report last month, Freeport guided for copper sales to reach 3.5 billion pounds in 2020, up from 3.3 billion in 2019. In 2021, however, the figure should spike to 4.3 billion, as the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, of which FCX owns 49%, returns to normalized output after a shift to underground mining.From there, copper prices need to cooperate, and that's always a risk. Copper prices are notoriously sensitive to the global economy; the commodity has been nicknamed &quot;Dr. Copper&quot; for its ability to provide a leading indicator of macroeconomic strength. A poorly-timed recession -- or even continued softness in key markets in Asia -- could pressure prices and thus Freeport's earnings and cash flow.But there's one potential long-term driver for copper demand: electric vehicles. EVs are &quot;copper hogs,&quot; meaning growth from the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) can boost copper prices. and those prices drop almost straight to Freeport's bottom line. It's not as if shares are expensive even in the current moderate-price environment; should copper spike higher from here, Freeport stock likely does the same. Balance Sheet and Cash FlowFinally, Freeport's balance sheet is in much better shape. As noted, debt has come down dramatically in a matter of years. The company has over $5 billion in liquidity, and a higher stock price if it wants to make an acquisition. If Freeport doesn't make a deal, free cash flow should impress -- particularly if copper prices rise.Indeed, with its fourth-quarter presentation, Freeport-McMoRan modeled solid free cash flow in a higher-price environment. At $3 per pound, up from a current ~$2.60, operating cash flow in 2021-2022 would be in the range of $5 billion.Capital expenditures currently estimated at $2.4 billion for 2021 suggest free cash flow around $2.6 billion. Put even a 10x multiple on that figure and FCX gains over 50%; increase the multiple, and the upside could be even higher. Where Does the Cash Go?To be sure, that paper case does require some help from copper prices. Models for 2021-2022 at $2.75 a pound suggest free cash flow under $2 billion. A market capitalization currently near $19 billion thus likely doesn't see that much upside without pricing help. But investors in mining stocks are looking for leveraged returns on gains the underlying commodity -- and on paper FCX stock is set up to provide precisely those returns if copper gains.But that gets to the practical problem, and the interview CEO Richard Adkerson gave to Reuters at the end of last month. Adkerson noted the potential for higher cash flow and a higher stock price which would allow the company to make acquisitions.&quot;I'm looking forward to having a new experience in my career toward accessing alternatives and deciding which way we go…We don't have a clear directive now on what that direction could be, but we will be attractively situated and will have an opportunity to add value through investments,&quot; he told Reuters.Those investments could include not just acquisitions but the construction of new mines.In other words, the incremental free cash flow Freeport-McMoRan hopes to drive isn't going back to shareholders. It's going back into the business under Adkerson's direction. And that should worry, if not terrify, FCX shareholders. Adkerson's HistoryAdkerson was named CEO on Dec. 10, 2003. Under his watch, Freeport-McMoRan stock has declined by 42%.There isn't an external reason for the pressure. Copper prices, according to data from YCharts, have increased 174% over that span. Meanwhile, diversified miner BHP Group (NYSE:BHP), which has significant copper holdings, has seen its stock more than triple. Including dividends, BHP has posted a total return of more than 450%. For Freeport-McMoRan stock, total returns remain modestly negative.One big reason for the decline was the aforementioned move into oil and gas, spearheaded by Adkerson. Freeport-McMoRan spent $20 billion on two acquisitions in 2012 at the height of the oil boom. The moves were instantly criticized by Wall Street and by investors; Freeport stock dropped 16% in a single day on the announcement. Allegations of self-dealing soon followed.Less than four years later, Freeport managed to get less than $4 billion for its assets at the nadir of the oil bust. Over $16 billion in shareholder value was destroyed.An investor might believe -- or want to believe -- that Adkerson and the Freeport board have learned their lesson from the disastrous acquisitions. There's no evidence they have.The Freeport-McMoRan dividend was slashed in 2014; the board hasn't hiked the payout since despite a paltry 1.6% yield and the expected growth in free cash flow. Adkerson, at least per his interview, is looking to spend more shareholder money after the company spent the last four years recovering from its foray into oil and gas.There are thus two scenarios here. Copper prices fall or stay roughly flat, and Freeport-McMoRan stock likely does the same. Or copper prices rise, giving Adkerson free reign to go and spend billions of dollars more of shareholder funds. Neither sounds particularly attractive. The Mining ProblemTo be somewhat fair, this is not a Freeport-only problem. As I detailed back in 2018, gold miners like Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) have done a disastrous job of fulfilling their mission of providing leverage to the gold price. Barrick, Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) and AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE:AU) all saw their shares fall by over 60% even in a rising-price environment.Recent performance for mining stocks has been better, but it's still not as good as it should be in theory. Even the gains in Freeport stock over the last few years are more a case of the stock rallying sharply from 2016 lows than any real improvement on the ground. FCX stock actually is down 20% over the past three years despite basically flat copper prices. The Bottom Line on Freeport-McMoRan StockWhat makes a stock like FCX particularly problematic is that the exchange-traded fund revolution has created far better alternatives. An investor who is bullish on copper can simply buy copper through an ETF. She can lever up that bet through the use of margin or a 2x or 3x ETF. Those trades have risk if copper prices decline of course; so does FCX.But if copper prices rise, that investor doesn't have to let Adkerson determine what to do with her gains. ETFs do have fees, but they're generally minimal; meanwhile, Adkerson's pay packages from 2016 to 2018 alone totaled over $50 million, according to Freeport's most recent proxy statement.If Freeport-McMoRan and Adkerson truly had learned their lesson and were looking to use potentially higher cash flow for increased shareholder returns, that would be one thing. Clearly, they're not. History, and the -42% returns under Adkerson's 16-year tenure, both suggest that it is a real problem for Freeport-McMoRan stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2020-02-10	2020-02-10 15:44:35	BHP	BHP Group	BHP in Talks to Delay Copper Shipments to China Due to Virus	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group Ltd., the world’s top miner, is in talks with Chinese customers to delay shipments of copper concentrates as the nation extended plant shutdowns to combat the spread of the coronavirus, according to people familiar with the matter.Suppliers are considering giving buyers in China flexibility on deliveries to discourage them from declaring force majeure, offering them a way out of contractual obligations, said the people, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public.On Monday, copper for three-month delivery slipped 0.3% to $5,647.50 at 3:42 p.m. on the London Metal Exchange, extending Friday’s slump.BHP’s move offers more evidence of the far-reaching impact of the deadly coronavirus on commodity trade. The company operates Escondida, the world’s biggest copper mine, located in Chile. Producers in the South American nation, the globe’s largest exporter of the metal, are already in talks with clients on the deferment of cargoes due to port shutdowns in China as the government fights the outbreak.“We are working closely with our copper customers as they return from Chinese new year,” a BHP spokesman said in an email. The company was unable to comment on commercial arrangements with individual customers.Copper prices had slid for a record 14 straight days in London amid mounting concerns the coronavirus will aggravate the slowdown in global economic growth, crimping demand for the metal used in cars, electronic gadgets and construction. Prices rebounded briefly last week but resumed their slide Friday as automakers extended their shutdowns.(Adds copper price in the third paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from James Thornhill.To contact the reporters on this story: Yvonne Yue Li in New York at yli1490@bloomberg.net;David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Pratish NarayananFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-talks-delay-copper-shipments-215348436.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-29	2020-01-29 07:00:16	BHP	BHP Group	The Big Dirty Secret of the World's Biggest Companies	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Lots of companies talk a good game about cutting planet-heating greenhouse emissions but their disclosures and targets have tended to focus on the emissions over which they have direct control and which are easiest to measure. That’s fine in an industry such as cement, where the bulk of carbon pollution occurs during the production process. From an environmental perspective these direct, or “Scope 1,” emissions are the main problem caused by these particular companies.But the approach falls down in companies working in oil, mining, carmaking, finance, and even fashion, because oftentimes most of their carbon footprint is contained in the products they sell or help finance — not their own operations.An oil giant can boast all it likes about how it’s reduced gas flaring; if car drivers are still filling up with its gasoline, the planet will keep getting hotter. The same goes for an iron ore producer that touts how its mining trucks are incredibly fuel efficient but whose main product is the basis for steel production. Luxury goods suppliers may run the greenest workshops imaginable, but use fabrics and materials that are deeply damaging to the planet.In the past, so-called “Scope 3” emissions — the pollution contained in products sold to customers or in goods and services purchased from suppliers — either weren’t calculated or were seen as someone else’s problem. Thanks to pressure from institutional investors and activists, plus leadership from a few enlightened chief executives, corporate attitudes about this subject are evolving fast. “Scope 3 is the elephant in the room,” Mark van Baal of investor advocacy group Follow This told the Norwegian oil major Equinor ASA’s annual meeting last year.The new impetus is welcome because unless companies try to reduce the environmental damage of their products and purchasing decisions, efforts to limit catastrophic climate change will fail. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last week the bosses of some of the world’s biggest oil producers debated setting targets for Scope 3 emissions, which typically make up about 90% of their carbon footprint. BP Plc’s new boss Bernard Looney is poised to abandon his predecessor Bob Dudley’s opposition to targeting customer emissions, according to Reuters. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Repsol SA and Total SA have already set Scope 3 targets.In mining, Rio Tinto Plc argued it had “very limited control” over customer emissions but later bowed to pressure by promising to work with its customer (and China’s top steel producer) Baowu Steel Group on lowering the steel sector’s emissions. BHP Group Ltd. and Vale SA have gone further by promising to set goals for Scope 3 emissions. In BHP’s cases these are almost 40 times greater than its direct pollution.The European Union’s new guidelines on climate reporting also recommend that large companies disclose customer and supplier emissions. Banks and insurers, whose direct emissions are typically pretty negligible, should focus on their counterparties’ emissions, the guidelines say. Unfortunately, this is not yet legally binding.Reluctance to target this stuff is hardly surprising because the numbers can be huge. Volkswagen AG acknowledged last year that its vehicles are responsible for about 2% of all the CO2 produced by humans.(3)Among the largest Scope 3 polluters are companies that the public probably don’t immediately think of as big climate sinners. It’s no surprise that Shell and Petrobras make the list, but I hadn’t thought about Cummins Inc., which sells truck engines and industrial power generators, Nexans SA, whose cables transport electricity and data, and Daikin Industries Ltd, which builds air-conditioning units.I’m not knocking these companies; at least they’re disclosing these emissions and some are setting targets to reduce them. Cummins plans to reduce absolute lifetime emissions from newly sold products by 25% by 2030, for example.Calculating the emissions from sold products is a pretty complicated exercise too. ThyssenKrupp AG’s massive Scope 3 emissions include those contained in the steel in the cars we drive around, the cement plants its factory construction unit helped build and the elevators in office buildings. Daikin has to consider the probable lifespan of its air conditioners, their energy consumption and what kind of electricity they’re powered by, plus probable leakage rates of planet-heating refrigerants.Fortunately there’s no shortage of organizations and methodologies to help compile these data. (Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg News and its parent Bloomberg LP, chairs the FSB Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures).Regrettably, not all large manufacturers have seen the light through the smoke. The copious sustainability reports of some companies still don’t spell out the total emissions of the products they sell. Volvo AB told me there’s no globally harmonized standard on how to calculate and disclose Co2 from heavy duty trucks, but that it’s evaluating opportunities to report on this in future. Daimler AG, which wants a completely CO2 neutral truck fleet in key markets by 2039, plans to start disclosing Scope 3 emissions for trucks in its next sustainability report.(1) You know something’s up when it takes a hedge fund to tell a company to clean up its act. The shortcomings in aircraft maker Airbus SE’s Scope 3 emissions reporting were highlighted in a critical letter late last year from Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management, the world’s most profitable activist fund. Airbus and rival Boeing have committed to halving the aviation industry’s net emissions by 2050. It would help focus minds on that urgent task if they fully accounted for their own role in flight pollution.(2) If Shell can do it, why not them?(1) Like other truck manufacturers, VW doesn't report Scope 3 emissions for heavy trucks but made the estimate based on its market share andthe truck sector's contribution to global emissions (plus its carbon footprint from cars)(2) It already does so for cars.(3) Boeing's environment reportonly counts Scope 3 emissions from business travel. Airbus has urged the aviation sector to develop a common methodology for Scope 3 emissions to aid consistency in reporting.To contact the author of this story: Chris Bryant at cbryant32@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.

2020-01-14	2020-01-14 11:50:31	BHP	BHP Group	Big Coal Escapes BlackRock’s New Climate Plan	(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. will cut exposure to thermal coal as the world’s largest asset manager moves to address climate change, but that doesn’t mean it’s selling out of the biggest producers -- including top shipper Glencore Plc.Producers of the dirtiest fuel are coming under increasing pressure from money managers to either abandon the business or show plans for an eventual exit. What investors don’t agree on, is how to measure progress and whether companies are complying.BlackRock’s discretionary active investment portfolios will sell out of all companies that get more than 25% of sales from thermal coal, Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink wrote in a letter to clients that outlined a plan to put climate considerations at the center of its strategy. There isn’t a long-term economic or investment rationale for continuing to invest in the fuel, he said.Read more: BlackRock Puts Climate at Center of $7 Trillion StrategyHowever, the revenue threshold means that large, diversified miners -- which also rank among the largest coal producers -- won’t be affected. Glencore, of which BlackRock owns 6%, is the single biggest coal shipper, mining about 130 million tons last year. Yet its thermal coal revenues accounted for less than 10% of the total, thanks to the contribution from its giant trading operations.Major coal producers Anglo American Plc and BHP Group also comfortably escape the cap.Blackrock’s approach contrasts with Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, which said last year it would stop investing in companies that mine more than 20 million tons a year of thermal coal. Glencore, Anglo and BHP all fall foul of that requirement.The pressure on mining companies is showing results. BHP is looking at options to exit its remaining coal mines in Colombia and Australia, while Anglo is also looking to retreat. Even Glencore, an ardent defender of the fuel, has said it will limit its output after pressure from Climate Action 100+, a group BlackRock has now joined.Still, many argue that targeting coal suppliers will have limited effect because western companies will simply sell their mines to others who will continue to operate them for years as long as demand holds up.Last year, Glencore’s billionaire CEO, Ivan Glasenberg, said coal had an essential role in providing affordable and reliable power in developing countries. If environmentalists keep pressuring companies to stop producing coal, there won’t be enough for the economies that need it, he saidTo contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Liezel Hill, Dylan GriffithsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-coal-escapes-blackrock-climate-115031574.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-06	2020-01-06 23:00:00	BHP	BHP Group	Samarco Rebuffs Creditors on Resumption of Debt Talks	(Bloomberg) -- Samarco Mineracao SA has rejected creditors’ formal request to resume talks to restructure its defaulted debt, signaling heightened risks for bond holders, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation.The Brazilian iron ore venture between BHP Group and Vale SA said it has yet to firm up its business plan. And without that, the company argues that it will be at a disadvantage if it were to resume talks that have been put on hold for almost a year on its $2.9 billion in defaulted debt, the people said.Samarco has said it will restart iron ore mining in the second half of this year after securing all the permits required by authorities. Operations have been halted since a waste dam collapse in 2015 that killed 19 people, curtailing the company’s ability to meet its obligations to creditors.The continued delay in talks to restructure the debt may antagonize Samarco’s creditors, the people said. That’s bad news for holders of the company’s $2.2 billion in bonds maturing 2022 and 2024 that have fallen to 66 to 69 cents. The company has been in default on these obligations for almost four years.Samarco estimates production to hit as high as 8 million metric tons per year in 2020 and reach full capacity of about 24 million tons of pellets by around 2030.Negotiations for the restructuring of the defaulted debt were put on hold at the end of January 2019, when Vale, which owns half of the venture, suffered an even worse disaster at a mine in Brumadinho, also in the state of Minas Gerais. That spurred heightened scrutiny of applications for environmental permits by regulators.BHP, Vale and Samarco declined to comment.To contact the reporter on this story: Pablo Gonzalez in Sao Paulo at pgonzalez49@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Luzi Ann Javier, Christopher DeRezaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samarco-rebuffs-creditors-resumption-debt-230000917.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-04	2019-12-04 21:00:00	BHP	BHP Group	Buying Iron Ore Is Getting More Like Shopping on Amazon	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest iron ore miners are looking for novel ways of satisfying their customers and protecting market share in the $150 billion global industry.From selling through a mobile app to portside sales, the likes of BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group and Vale SA are looking for an edge with buyers of the steelmaking raw material in China, the top customer. The need to retain their business is becoming ever more critical amid forecasts that the market is around its peak.“For miners, Chinese import volumes are basically not going to grow the way they used to,” said Tomas Gutierrez, analyst at Kallanish Commodities Ltd. “Any increase in value for iron ore will come from either adding service to mills or from cutting out the traders.”Rio and rivals -- who have spent more than a decade pumping billions into expansions to keep pace with China’s fast-rising appetite for iron ore -- are now preparing for an era of slower growth and an eventual high point in the nation’s steel output.They are introducing a range of initiatives to retain existing sales and add new customers -- from Rio’s development of a mobile app, to portside sales, and selling directly from China’s ports in yuan instead of shipping cargoes from Australia or Brazil that are sold in dollars.New Strategies“Our China portside customers will be able to order via a mobile app,” Rio’s Chief Commercial Officer Simon Trott told an investor seminar in October. “You can order a few tons of ore, in the same way you’d place an order on Amazon.”Rio has started portside sales, while BHP also has been testing “spot sales during transport to China as well as sales in smaller quantities with shorter lead times from bonded stockpiles in China,” Rod Dukino, vice president for sales and marketing iron ore, said at a conference in September.Selling at ports allows miners to blend different types of ore, and means “more money in the miners’ pockets,” according to UBS Group AG managing director and global head of mining, Glyn Lawcock. “We have seen over the last few years increasing sales to traders and now the miners are clawing back some of that lost margin essentially.”In particular, the use of the Chinese yuan is a breakthrough for an industry dominated by the dollar. For mills, this eliminates currency risks. For miners, this broadens their customer base and again cuts out the traders, said Lawcock.In June, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. set up a sales office in China, offering direct supply of smaller volumes in the yuan. “This represents a new sales channel for Fortescue to complement our existing seaborne trade,” Chief Executive Elizabeth Gaines said in an email.BHP sees “huge potential in the digitization of our post-trade processes across our portfolio, both for customers and suppliers alike, through increased visibility and traceability of goods” Dukino said in an email.Large and medium-sized steel mills in China generally support the miners’ new sales strategies, according to a survey by Bloomberg of five executives at mills and industry groups.“As producers get closer to a diverse range of end customers, they understand their needs more, to facilitate an evolution in interaction and even digitalization,” according to Andrew Glass, founder of Avatar Commodities Pte and formerly head of iron ore financial trading at Anglo American Plc.Still, launching new sales channels also has its risks, and companies need to be mitigating them at the same time as extending their supply chain, Glass warned.Tight RaceThe initiatives follow similar strategies adopted by Vale since 2015. The Brazilian miner, which is still grappling with the effects of a fatal dam disaster earlier this year, blends and sells from 16 ports in China. It also has a center in Malaysia, where ore can be stored and blended.In the first for a foreign miner, Vale signed a deal with a Chinese steel mill based on prices of iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.While Vale has had a headstart in sales efforts, Rio is catching up, according to Kallanish’s Gutierrez. “Now that the port stock market is more developed, and the sales mechanisms are developed, then all the miners will need to compete in this area.”“The enhancement of having things like port stocks and port trade allows flexibility, and allows smaller parcel deliveries to customers,” Rio’s iron ore Chief Executive Officer Chris Salisbury said in a interview last week.&#92;--With assistance from David Stringer, Winnie Zhu and Alfred Cang.To contact the reporter on this story: Krystal Chia in Singapore at kchia48@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Phoebe Sedgman at psedgman2@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buying-iron-ore-getting-more-210000086.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-25	2019-11-25 10:28:31	BHP	BHP Group	BHP Plans to Increase Its Stake in Ecuador-Focused SolGold	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group increased its stake in Ecuadorian copper miner SolGold Plc, another sign that the biggest miners are increasing exposure to copper in the hope that the electrification of cities and cars will boost demand.SolGold shares surged the most since June after Bloomberg earlier reported the companies were in talks. Melbourne-based BHP paid 17.1 million pounds ($22 million) to raise its holding in the company to 14.7%, almost drawing level with top investor Newcrest Mining Ltd. Brisbane-based SolGold’s interests in Ecuador include the flagship Alpala copper-gold project, which the company estimates has a potential 55-year life and is among the world’s best undeveloped deposits. The company is also studying 13 other priority targets in the nation, according to a presentation this month.BHP paid 22.15 pence a share, a 9.3% premium to SolGold’s 20-day volume-weighted average, according to a statement on Monday. The deal also gives BHP options to purchase another 19.25 million shares by 2024. It had built its stake last year through two transactions and agreed it wouldn’t acquire further shares for two years without SolGold’s consent.SolGold shares earlier jumped as much as 20%, and were up 7.3% by 10:25 a.m. in London.In October, the shares fell to a three-year low amid growing concerns about SolGold’s funding as it burned through cash. Its cash position was just $16.5 million at the end of September and the company has since slowed spending to make that cash stretch until February, Liberum Capital Markets said.BHP, preparing to install Mike Henry as its new chief executive officer from January, is prioritizing future growth in copper and oil, and sees Ecuador as a key focus for new mining projects. Dwindling supply from aging copper mines and rising demand from renewable energy and the electric vehicle sector will combine to boost the metal’s outlook, the miner said in August.The company is also partnering with Luminex Resources Corp. on a project in southeastern Ecuador and carrying out its own work in the country.Exploration will be “the most cost effective way” of adding to the company’s growth pipeline, outgoing CEO Andrew Mackenzie said last month in a webcast. “We have positions in some very prospective parts of the world where we think we can add significantly to our resource base.”(Updates with company confirmation)&#92;--With assistance from Harry Brumpton.To contact the reporters on this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.net;David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Nicholas Larkin, Lynn ThomassonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-plans-increase-stake-ecuador-015827863.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-14	2019-11-14 12:46:32	BHP	BHP Group	The World’s Top Miner Appoints Its Next CEO	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group named Mike Henry, the head of its Australian operations, as chief executive officer to steer the world’s top miner through looming challenges from slower growth in China and investor pressure over climate change.Henry, 53, a Canadian-born executive who joined BHP in 2003 from Mitsubishi Corp., previously led the company’s marketing division and coal operations. He will take up his new position on Jan. 1, the company said in a statement Thursday.He replaces 62-year-old Andrew Mackenzie as growth in China, source of more than half of BHP’s revenue, slumped in the third-quarter to the slowest pace since the early 1990s. Against this backdrop and broader trade concerns, BHP is seeking to bolster output in copper and oil as long-term demand weakens for iron ore, its top earner.Henry will take over as the company debates its exposure to China, “the growth path there and how they can diversify away from that,” said Camille Simeon, a Sydney-based investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, which holds BHP shares and manages about $670 billion in global assets.“Climate change and the energy transition the world is going though are going to also be a key consideration, along with the maintenance of their strong asset base,” she said.BHP shares traded 0.3% lower in London after advancing 0.1% in Sydney trading.Henry had long been among the leading contenders for the job -- a group that included other executives, such as Chief Financial Officer Peter Beaven and Danny Malchuk, head of operations in the Americas. A few months ago, BHP approached external candidates including Anglo American Plc boss Mark Cutifani about the position, according to people familiar with the matter.Regarded by investors and staff as thoughtful and diplomatic, Henry built a public profile at BHP by leading the company’s opposition to proposals for a new tax on iron ore production in Australia. More recently, his division has encountered operational missteps including fires and a train derailment that left railcars loaded with iron ore strewn across Australia’s Outback.Henry, who will earn a base salary of $1.7 million, will tour BHP’s operations for the rest of the year before making any decision on potential changes to the executive leadership team. He plans to update investors at February’s half-year earnings on initial plans for reforms, he told reporters in Melbourne.“I am all about performance and improvement,” Henry said. “We have a great strategy and I see it as my job as the next CEO to build upon that foundation we’ve created to accelerate performance.” BHP will seek to better utilize data and technology to improve operations, and will maintain its focus on limiting the company’s impact on the environment, he said.Underlying profit is forecast to rise about 12% to $10.2 billion in fiscal 2020, before declining in each of the following two years, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.“His biggest challenge will be to keep the return on assets going -- they’ve had the advantage of growing iron ore over the last 4-5 years, but that’s tapered off,” said David Lennox, a Sydney-based resources analyst at Fat Prophets. “They’ve really now got to look at what’s going to be the next item to grow them.”BHP’s new leader takes over a business that’s been stripped down and simplified under Mackenzie, in the post since 2013. This included the $9 billion spinoff of unwanted assets into South32 Ltd. in 2015 and a near $11 billion exit from U.S. shale operations last year. The producer had cut its number of operations by more than half, and is now considering potential new growth options.A pipeline of more than $8 billion worth of projects to expand petroleum output are being considered alongside other already sanctioned investments, the company said Monday.The producer will decide in early 2021 whether to press ahead with spending as much as $5.7 billion to bring the Jansen potash project in Canada into production, adding the fertilizer to its roster. The crop nutrient would add a material with a demand outlook that’s tied to population growth, rather than metals-intensive urbanization in China, according to BHP. Some investors oppose the plan, arguing potash prices are likely to remain weak and projected returns are too low.What Bloomberg Intelligence says:Significant experience in various commercial roles in both minerals and petroleum, as well as a stint as chief marketing officer, sets him up to lead the company as it embarks on a number of projects in several business lines.&#92;-- Andrew Cosgrove, senior analystTop miners are preparing for a shifting outlook as China’s pace of growth cools, and amid prospects for steel output to plateau. Urbanization and industrialization in Africa and other parts of Asia, along with the need to supply metals to a rapidly expanding electric vehicle sector, will offer potential new sources of demand Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive officer of miner-to-trader Glencore Plc, said in a May presentation in Barcelona.Henry will also continue to grapple with costs and ramifications tied to the fatal 2015 waste dam spill at BHP’s Samarco iron ore joint venture in Brazil that’s overshadowed Mackenzie’s tenure. The disaster killed 19 people and is the subject of ongoing civil claims and investigations. Samarco is on track to resume some operations in the second half of 2020.Mackenzie will step down from his post at the end of this year, and retire from BHP at the end of June.(Updates shares in sixth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from James Thornhill and Thomas Biesheuvel.To contact the reporter on this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Keith Gosman, Jake Lloyd-SmithFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-top-miner-appoints-next-220916202.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-11-14	2019-11-14 07:37:29	BHP	BHP Group	BHP’s New CEO Has Lessons From Japan To Beat China Slowdown	(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.Mike Henry, the incoming CEO of BHP Group, could take a lesson straight out of Japan’s corporate playbook when he faces the challenge of slower growth in the top commodities consumer China.The 53-year-old led a group of BHP executives last year on a tour of U.S. manufacturing plants that have implemented principles of kaizen -- the philosophy of continual improvement famously championed in Japan by Toyota Motor Corp.Henry, who previously worked at Mitsubishi Corp., has been an advocate within BHP for standardizing procedures and encouraging front-line workers to devise better methods of improving their own work.After being named on Thursday to replace Andrew Mackenzie as head of the world’s biggest miner from the start of 2020, he made it clear productivity would be a major plank of his leadership.“I am all about performance and improvement,” Henry told reporters Thursday at the miner’s Melbourne headquarters. “That discipline, that performance, is what will insulate us and allow us to navigate an uncertain world in the right way, where we can continue to grow value.”Uncertain OutlookWith a darkening long-term demand outlook for key commodities such as iron ore, and the need to balance spending on new projects against continued returns to investors, Henry will look to new productivity gains as a tool to help defend margins.“As a concept, this is what shareholders want -- efficiencies and improvements,” said Craig Evans, a Sydney-based portfolio manager at Tribeca Investments Partners Pty. “It’s going to be a big focus for everybody, and it would be good to see how he thinks that can be implemented.”Winning new gains from better performance may not be an easy task. Even as BHP cut costs at its Australian iron ore mines in the last fiscal year, some coal assets failed to meet company cost guidance. There have also been operational missteps at BHP sites since late 2018, including the dramatic derailment of an iron ore train in Australia’s vast Outback.BHP and its rivals are also facing the slowest pace of growth in China since the early 1990s, a factor that threatens to propel the industry into its most challenging decade in generations, according to RBC Capital Markets.Henry, a guitar-player with two adult daughters, joined BHP from Mitsubishi in 2003 and had earlier been seconded to a coal joint venture between the two companies. Known by investors and staff as polite, forensic and a key champion of gender equality, the Canadian national previously carried out an audit to make sure mines and offices had enough sanitary bins for female staff.The new leader will tour BHP’s global operations for the rest of the year before setting out proposals for strategy shifts, or changes to the miner’s team of top executives, he told reporters.To contact the reporter on this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Keith GosmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-ceo-lessons-japan-beat-073729087.html?.tsrc=rss

A Canadian with 30 years experience in mining, including 16 at BHP and the past three at the helm of BHP's Australian business, Henry was named on Thursday as the successor to Andrew MacKenzie.

2019-11-14	2019-11-14 04:44:17	BHP	BHP Group	BHP’s New Boss Shows Mining Is Still Nervous	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When times are good, focus on the top line and the bottom line will look after itself. When times are bad, you should do the reverse.That looks a lot like the strategy the world’s biggest miner, BHP Group, has followed over the years in appointing its chief executive officers. The question the resources sector should ask in looking at Thursday’s appointment of Mike Henry to succeed Andrew Mackenzie is whether his focus is the top line, or the bottom.Henry has spent the last three years as the operations chief for BHP’s Australian assets, where he’s focused on improving efficiency and bringing down costs — resolutely bottom-line work. The bulk of his experience, however, is in the top-line marketing side of the business — finding ways to get the best possible prices for the minerals BHP digs and pumps. That resume harks back to Mackenzie’s predecessor.With an upswing in prices for its key commodities of iron ore, coal and oil under way in 2007, BHP appointed Marius Kloppers, a South African veteran of its manganese business, to the chief executive role. Kloppers pushed hard to shift the pricing of first manganese, and then iron ore and coal, toward spot markets that more closely track supply and demand.That helped BHP and its competitors extract additional revenues from their customers as spot prices surged in the years before and after the 2008 financial crisis — but when the market started to turn six years later, the emphasis started to look misplaced. After the demand growth that had supported the capital spending boom of the Kloppers era started to ebb, BHP's operations looked bloated and wasteful.Mackenzie, with a background running petrochemicals for BP Plc and mines for Rio Tinto Group and BHP, was brought in as an operational wizard to fix the rot. He slimmed down the business, spun off the less attractive assets as South32 Ltd., and reduced expenditure to a level that could survive in the new, leaner environment.At first blush, Henry looks like a swing of the pendulum from Mackenzie’s operations focus back to Kloppers’ marketing background.He sold first coal, then energy and freight and petroleum for BHP before being appointed as Kloppers’ marketing president and then chief marketing officer in 2010. Only after Mackenzie took over the top job and Henry was entering the frame as a potential eventual successor was he shifted over to round out his experience on the operations side.There’s reason to think that a more bullish focus is finally due. The resources sector has never really climbed out of the slump it entered around 2014, but the S&P 500 breaks new records on a daily basis. Forecasters could be underestimating the potential of a strong economic rebound in 2020, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Bloomberg’s indexes of energy and industrial metals are still at subdued levels, but the run-up in iron ore prices this year put Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.’s index of bulk materials such as iron and coal at its highest level since 2013. That should be good news for BHP, since its share price tends to track that benchmark closely.At the same time, it seems to have been as much Henry’s recent experience managing mines that’s recommended him for the top job. He’s been responsible for rolling out autonomous trucks at the Jimblebar iron ore mine in northwest Australia and for setting up operations centers in Perth and Brisbane to run the company’s iron and coal mines remotely. Costs of late have been sharply lower in both divisions, although those for Queensland coal are creeping back up.If anything, it’s a sign of how things have changed for the mining industry that even scions of the marketing business like Henry have turned into born-again operations experts. BHP still has Elliott Management Corp. hanging around as a major shareholder. While its activist campaign will have been quiet for almost two years by the time Henry assumes the top job in January, it remains a constraint on any chief executive in a bullish mood.More to the point, a stronger outlook for the U.S. economy isn’t the medicine that can revive BHP’s boom years. China still consumes about half of almost every major mined commodity and accounted for about 55% of BHP’s revenue last year — and all the evidence is that the economy there is slowing. BHP’s key commodities could be heading for an even rougher patch if China’s car market continues to crater and its still-buoyant conditions in real estate fall to more normal levels.Should that be the case, the pendulum won’t be swinging back from the bean-counters to the marketers. If anything, it will have further to go in the other direction.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-11-07	2019-11-07 05:09:11	BHP	BHP Group	Top Miner BHP Sees Initial U.S.-China Trade Deal Boosting Copper	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group, the world’s biggest miner, sees moves to resolve trade tensions between China and the U.S. as likely to stimulate global growth and help spur demand for raw materials, including copper.“A roll back of some of the tariffs, and a sense that some progress is being made is going to calm markets, stimulate some form of growth and you might expect commodities like copper” to recover, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie told reporters Thursday in Sydney.The U.S. and China have been trying to negotiate a limited trade deal that would entail the U.S. dropping some tariffs on Chinese imports in exchange for Beijing resuming purchases of American farm goods and other products.The tentative signals that an initial agreement is closer are “a step in a bullish direction” for metals markets, and there are already signs that overall macroeconomic sentiment is improving, Citigroup Inc. analysts said in a Tuesday note.“A degree of thawing, and a willingness to talk these problems through and not always rush to the tariff barrier, will be a positive development for the world economy, and for us,” Mackenzie said. BHP wins about 55% of its revenue from China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Moves to decarbonize transport and other sectors through electrification should add to copper demand in the next decade, just as supply is pressured by falling grades at aging mines, according to Mackenzie. “The 2020s should create better times for copper, but when exactly -- we can’t predict that.”Copper has declined about 10% since April amid worries over weaker demand as the world’s economic expansion cools. It fell for a second day Thursday amid an apparent lack of fresh progress in the trade talks.To contact the reporter on this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Keith Gosman, Phoebe SedgmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-miner-bhp-sees-initial-050911227.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-25	2019-09-25 10:48:39	BHP	BHP Group	BHP Approached Anglo American Chief Mark Cutifani for CEO Role	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group has talked to Anglo American Plc Chief Executive Officer Mark Cutifani about running for the top job at the company, according to people familiar with the matter.BHP made the approaches earlier this year and again more recently, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the process is confidential. Cutifani rebuffed the company’s advances so far, they said. BHP favors an internal hire, but also wants to speak with external candidates, the people said.Spokesmen for Anglo and BHP declined to comment.Cutifani has said in previous interviews he planned to stay until Anglo finished its $5 billion Peruvian copper project Quellaveco, which may start production in 2022, by which time he will be in his mid-60s.There has been speculation for years about who might take the reins of BHP, the world’s biggest mining company, once Andrew Mackenzie steps down. Analysts have expected that Mackenzie, 62, could make an exit in 2020, by which time he would have held the job for seven years.BHP Chairman Ken MacKenzie, no relation to the CEO, has favored the idea of promoting an executive to the top job, which he views as less risky, according to the people. Current front-runners are Peter Beaven, the chief financial officer, Mike Henry, head of Australian operations and Daniel Malchuk, who runs the Americas business.Melbourne-based BHP is the biggest company in Australia and has long been seen as a national champion, but it hasn’t had an Australian-born boss since merging with Billiton Plc in 2001.Cutifani, who hails from Australia and has a background in mining engineering, has overseen one of the industry’s most successful turnaround stories in the past five years.He took the helm of Anglo in 2013 after the company lost billions in stock-market value from a disastrous foray into Brazilian iron ore. In 2015, Anglo faced down possible bankruptcy because of plunging metal prices and a heavy debt load.Cutifani steered the recovery by reducing Anglo’s debt burden, as well as cutting back on costs and employees. At one point, the company planned to sell half its assets, but later canceled the sales as prices for iron ore and copper started to roar back.Since the start of 2016, Anglo shares have risen sixfold, far outpacing other blue-chip mining shares. As profits recovered, Anglo has invested heavily in new projects, such as Quellaveco, while other mining companies have put a greater focus on returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.BHP CEO Mackenzie, also appointed to his role in 2013, has worked to slash the size of BHP. He led the company through a $9 billion spin off of South32 in 2015 and a $10.5 billion exit from U.S. shale operations last year.To contact the reporters on this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.net;David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Nicholas LarkinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-approached-anglo-american-chief-104839847.html?.tsrc=rss

The resolution was filed on Tuesday by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) ahead of BHP's annual general meetings (AGM) in London and Sydney, the ACCR said in a statement.  Co-filers included the Church of England Pensions Board and Grok Ventures, the private investment vehicle of Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, as well as institutional investors that combined hold A$140 billion( $94.6 billion) under management.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-investors-file-resolution-cut-035828035.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-09-03	2019-09-03 21:42:04	BHP	BHP Group	Tech Billionaire Backs New Demand on BHP Over Climate Action	(Bloomberg) -- Australian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes’ private investment vehicle is among backers of a new demand on BHP Group to suspend ties with industry groups that are seen as hindering efforts to meet global climate change goals.Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures, Denmark’s MP Pension and the Church of England Pensions Board are among investors holding assets worth about A$140 billion ($95 billion) who’ve backed a shareholder resolution filed by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility ahead of BHP’s forthcoming annual meetings, the signatories said in a statement Wednesday.Melbourne-based BHP should suspend membership of industry associations that carry out lobbying or other work that’s at odds with the Paris climate accord, the ACCR said, citing activities by groups including the Minerals Council of Australia and the Business Council of Australia.“Until BHP stops funding for coal lobbyists, we’re extremely skeptical of their environmental or green credentials,” Cannon-Brookes said in the statement.BHP, scheduled to hold an annual meeting in the U.K. in October and in Australia in November, declined to comment. A resolution on industry group links filed by the ACCR to BHP’s annual meetings in 2017 won about 9% of votes cast and was rejected.The producer, which supports the Paris goals and says it has taken action on global warming for two decades, has targets to curb its own carbon dioxide emissions and plans to support customers’ efforts to take similar steps with a $400 million investment program. “Global warming is indisputable,” Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said in a London speech in July. “The planet will survive. Many species may not.”BHP last year quit the World Coal Association and said in 2017 it would monitor advocacy by other groups, including the Minerals Council of Australia, following a review of its involvement in 21 associations.Efforts to constrain activities of some groups have been ineffective, according to the ACCR. The organization has also called on other companies, including Rio Tinto Group, to review its ties to industry associations.“Suspension of memberships where advocacy is inconsistent with Paris is the only sensible way forward,” the group’s executive director Brynn O’Brien said in the statement.(Updates with comment from BHP in fifth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Steven Frank.To contact the reporter on this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Alpana Sarma, Jason RogersFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-billionaire-backs-demand-bhp-214204922.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 07:00:10	BHP	BHP Group	BP's Alaska Exit Is a Sign of Oil's Times	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There goes the other pipeline. Back in the day, BP Plc was sometimes dismissed as a “two-pipelines company.” This referred to two of its biggest positions: The Forties field and pipeline system in the North Sea and the Trans Alaska Pipeline bringing oil south from the Prudhoe Bay wells in Alaska. Forties was sold off in 2003 (the field) and 2017 (the pipes). Now, BP is leaving Alaska.In some respects, the $5.6 billion sale of the company’s Alaska portfolio is par for the course. BP has been selling assets for much of this decade in order to fund compensation and reshape the business after 2010’s Macondo blowout. More generally, selling mature oil and gas fields to smaller, independent companies planning to squeeze out more is a standard part of the development cycle. In 2003, Apache Corp. took Forties; the Alaska sale is to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co. To be an oil major is to be constantly ranking projects in terms of potential and deciding if you’re better off keeping them or flogging them.Yet the symbolism is inescapable. Alaska is embedded deeply in BP’s history and identity. Former CEO Lord John Browne, who led the late 20th-century mega-mergers that transformed BP from a two-pipeline company, kicked off his career there in 1969, just after BP struck oil. One of those big deals he ended up doing, the $33 billion acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co. in 2000, was predicated in part on consolidating BP’s position in Alaska – only for antitrust regulators to force the sale of those particular assets to Phillips Petroleum Co. (now ConocoPhillips).Back then, BP was on the hunt for “elephants,” or giant oil and gas fields that typically took many years – and country-sized balance sheets – to develop. Hence Browne’s acquisition spree.The world has moved on. While producers still relish big discoveries, the intervening boom and bust in oil prices has made investors leery of big-ticket investments and more demanding in terms of payouts. Apart from, by and large, holding capex budgets in check, oil majors have been retreating from traditional strongholds, with Royal Dutch Shell Plc virtually leaving the Canadian oil sands, Chevron Corp. recently exiting the U.K. North Sea and Exxon Mobil Corp. putting its Norwegian assets up for sale. BP put its own Norwegian business into a joint venture in 2016.Meanwhile, they have been diverting cash to dividends and buybacks in order to keep investors onside – BP’s stock yields almost 7% – as well as directing more of their capex to shorter-cycle shale development.BP paid BHP Group Plc $10.5 billion in cash for its shale assets last year. Besides reducing BP’s leverage at a dicey time for oil prices, the Alaska deal can be seen as swapping out of an old, conventional position to help fund expansion in unconventional oil and gas. In that sense, selling Alaska throws the spotlight on these new assets where, like several of its peers, BP is trying to prove that the majors’ scale – which worked in such places as Alaska – can also be an advantage in shale.Alaska is viewed by some as a growth area, particularly – with grim irony – as climate change and the energy-dominance aspirations of the current U.S. administration open up more of it for potential development. However, as a sensitive, remote and challenging environment, it carries extra risks and costs for producers, including the potential for future administrations to restrict activity there again. The state’s oil boom truly began when the panic of the 1973 oil shock swept aside opposition to the construction of the Trans Alaska Pipeline. Its future from here will be shaped at least in part by the challenges of excess oil and associated emissions.Faced with this much change and the need to adapt, there really can be no sacred cash cows.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2019-08-02	2019-08-02 08:52:28	BHP	BHP Group	Commodities Roiled as Trump Pours Gasoline on Trade War Inferno	(Bloomberg) -- Raw materials are reeling after President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on Chinese goods, dashing hopes that the two sides might soon negotiate an end to the trade war that’s sapping global growth and demand for commodities.The Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index fell 2.5% Thursday, the biggest one-day drop in more than a year, before most markets began to stabilize Friday. Thursday’s fall was led by oil’s biggest sell-off in four years. Hog and soybean futures also fell as Trump questioned Chinese promises to purchase more U.S. farm goods. Among metals, copper in London extended losses into Friday, while mining equities including Glencore Plc and BHP Group Plc slumped.Commodities have been held hostage to trade-war fluctuations over the past year as the two top economies slug it out. Trump escalated his fight with Beijing Thursday, saying 10% levies will now be imposed Sept. 1 on $300 billion of Chinese goods after a round of talks Wednesday ended without a breakthrough. The sell-off in energy and building goods indicates investors see an end to the truce Trump struck with President Xi Jinping in June.“We’ve been bearish on the expectation that the situation would continue to deteriorate,” Vivienne Lloyd, an industrial metals analyst at Macquarie, said by phone from London. “It’s become clear that there are structural difficulties in achieving a deal, because some of the American demands just run counter to the spirit of China.”Some of the Trump-inspired swings began to reverse themselves by Friday. Gold, which had risen to a six-year high on a renewed for havens, began to retreat, with spot prices losing as much as 1%. Brent crude bounced back, while still heading for a 2.4% weekly loss.As hopes for a deal fade, investors are left focusing on a contraction in manufacturing and heavy industry across many major economies. Copper -- with its close links to shifts in economic growth -- could have a few hundred dollars left to fall if it breaks below resistance levels at around $5,800 a ton that have held throughout the trade war, Lloyd said. It traded at $5,810 a ton in London on Friday.“In terms of the impact on metals, we see it as a spectrum, with copper at the worst end of it, given its sensitivity to macro conditions,” Lloyd said. “At the other end would be the bulk commodities, which are typically traded by people who are much closer to the underlying physical markets. The distinction between the two is going to be key.&quot;To contact the reporters on this story: Dan Murtaugh in Singapore at dmurtaugh@bloomberg.net;Mark Burton in London at mburton51@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Dylan GriffithsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commodities-roiled-trump-pours-gasoline-085228967.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-30	2019-07-30 05:09:37	BHP	BHP Group	Australia’s $240 Billion Stock Rally Blasts Past Record High	(Bloomberg) -- One of this year’s best-performing stock markets has just hit a fresh record.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index reached its highest level, having added about $240 billion in value this year as investors cheered a dovish central bank, a surprise federal election victory by the incumbent center-right government and skyrocketing iron ore prices.The gauge rose as much as 0.7% to 6,875.5 in early trading on Tuesday, pushing past its all-time high from November 2007.Anticipation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this week, renewed U.S.-China trade talks and “reasonable” U.S. corporate earnings results added to momentum that’s been building in the benchmark over the last month, said Eleanor Creagh, a Sydney-based strategist at Saxo Capital Markets.“The ASX has really looked determined to breach and set fresh record highs,” she said.Up and OverThe decision by central banks around the world to pull back on interest rate hikes sparked a global equities rally amid bets that accommodative policies could bolster earnings. The Reserve Bank of Australia came out with back-to-back interest rate reductions in June and July, the first changes in policy since September 2016.The coalition’s shock election win in May triggered a relief rally with the finance sector rising 12% as investors rejoiced that the opposition Labor Party wouldn’t be able to curtail tax breaks for property and stock-market investors. Health-care stocks advanced as the outcome thwarted plans to cap the amount they can raise premiums.Skyrocketing iron ore prices also propelled the index higher. Benchmark prices for the steelmaking ingredient hit their highest in over five years, boosting miners including Rio Tinto Group, BHP Group Ltd. and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. But the good times might be over for the material -- analysts expect prices to ease after this year’s enormous gains.Best and WorstCommunications services has been the best-performing sector this year. Technology was the next best, with the WAAAX stocks surging as investors seek exposure to the global rally that has sent U.S. tech equities soaring since 2017, followed by the miner-heavy materials.The energy sector, which has advanced 14% this year, was the worst performer on the ASX 200, followed by utilities.Magellan Financial Group Ltd. has been the top individual performer on the index, more than doubling in value amid a sustained surge in inflows. Produce company Costa Group Holdings Ltd. was the worst performer after cutting its guidance twice so far this year.Where to Now?Analysts disagree on where Aussie stocks will go after this year’s jump, with Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley Wealth Management cheering the surge, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. downgrading the market to underweight.Investors are piling into equities, and paying higher prices for them, at a time when cash is set to yield very little and interest rates are likely to remain low for quite some time, Creagh said.“It’s not something that’s going to be sustainable as a longer-term picture,” she said. “Deteriorating growth and the lackluster corporate earnings outlook is ignored at current equity prices.”High valuations going into the August earnings season have the potential to stymie the rally, said Karl Goody, a private wealth adviser at Shaw and Partners Ltd. in Sydney.“I’m really struggling with earnings season at the moment because I don’t think we’re getting the news which is needed to support the current multiples,” he said. “But, in saying that, every day the market just goes higher.”(Updates with comments throughout.)&#92;--With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi.To contact the reporter on this story: Jackie Edwards in Sydney at jedwards160@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lianting Tu at ltu4@bloomberg.net, Tim SmithFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/australias-240-billion-stock-rally-005928592.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-07-26	2019-07-26 16:00:09	BHP	BHP Group	Today's Auto Market, Fact Versus Science Fiction	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In 1986, Arthur C. Clarke’s “July 20, 2019: Life in the 21st Century” was published. Now, exactly half a century since man first landed on the moon, Clarke’s book has turned out to be fairly prescient. For the moon landing’s 50th anniversary, Rebecca Jones of Car and Driver magazine published a thoughtful examination of Clarke’s many transport-related predictions, one of which was far off the mark. “For 2019’s low, low prices of $70,000, with easy credit terms, a new car will offer a lot,” Clarke predicted. Today, according to Edmunds, the average transaction price for a new car in the U.S. is actually about half what Clarke expected: $37,342. So how did Clarke, a noted futurist and scientific visionary, manage to be so wrong? There are two ways, via inflation figures, to look at Clarke’s assumed “low, low price of $70,000” for a new car in 2019. The first is to use the actual inflation rate when Clarke was writing(2), apply it to every year since, and see what a new car would cost in 2019 by that calculation. According to the Houston Chronicle, the average new car cost $11,838 in 1985. Applying 1985’s actual inflation rate of 3.8% per year until 2019 gives a car cost of $42,071, 14% above 2019’s actual cost of $37,028. The second is to determine what inflation rate would be necessary to turn the $11,838 cost of a car in 1985 dollars into a $70,000 car in 2019 dollars. That inflation rate is 5.9% per year — higher than the actual rate in 1985. That 1985 rate of 5.9% is high by today’s standards, but it probably was not outside expectations in the early 1980s. Annual inflation peaked at 13.3% in 1979, and even as that rate plunged to 3.9% by 1984, we can forgive an author — even of science fiction — for thinking that serious inflation might return. In 1986, the trailing 10-year average inflation rate was 6.4%; the trailing five-year inflation rate was 3.3%. The inflation rate needed to arrive at an average price of $70,000 in 2019 was less than what the country had experienced, on average, in the 10 years prior to Clarke’s writing. It’s not just that inflation faded significantly as Clarke was writing. Cars themselves became a different element of the U.S. consumption basket. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has helpfully created an entire consumer price index for new cars. Compare it to the overall urban consumers’ CPI, and we see something significant. For decades, cars were above the CPI trend line relative to its 1982-1984 baseline; since 1987, cars have been below the general trend line and have hardly moved at all since the mid-1990s. At the same time that cars have decoupled from the rest of the urban consumer price index, their quality has also improved significantly. It’s something I wrote about last year, in comparing two small coupes with dedicated fan bases, one from the early 1980s and one from today. Today’s car is more powerful, faster, more comfortable, has a better entertainment system and is much safer — for relatively less money — than it was in Clarke’s time. Clarke makes one final supposition about a 2019 car: that it’ll be purchased “with easy credit terms.” On that, he was not wrong. U.S. Federal Reserve data on new car loans show that rates peaked at more than 17% in 1982. Rates are currently 5.35%, after bottoming out in November 2015 at 4%. As Liz McCormick wrote this week in Bloomberg Businessweek, a decade of low interest rates is changing everything.

The move highlights nascent investor pressure on the world's biggest miner to consider drastic changes in management to tackle challenges such as cutting costs, an eventual return to lower iron ore prices, and rebuilding its reputation after a Brazil dam disaster.  ""We are quite firmly of the view that it needs to be an external candidate ... We just don't see anybody internally that could make a material improvement to the status quo,"" one of the three institutional investor sources said."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-australian-bhp-investors-push-040857668.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-07-18	2019-07-18 23:00:00	BHP	BHP Group	Mining Newcomer Bets on $1 Billion Copper Project for Growth	(Bloomberg) -- Ecuador’s ambition to become a mining superpower is being tested as the South American nation’s first large-scale copper mine starts operations.The $1 billion Mirador project in Zamora-Chinchipe province started ramping up production Thursday, Ecuador’s vice-ministry of mines said. The open-pit copper, gold and silver mine, owned by a Chinese consortium, has faced delays amid opposition by environmental groups and local communities.The mine is key to Ecuador’s goal to boost mining exports to $1.89 billion by 2021, from $270 million last year, and to quadruple its share of the country’s gross domestic product to as much as 4%. It’s a first step toward mirroring the growth story of Chile, which exported $40 billion in mining products in 2018. But the path isn’t free of challenges.“It’s the start of a new era in the economy of the country,” if it’s responsibly managed, said Fernando Benalcazar, Ecuador’s deputy mining minister, by telephone. “Symbolically, it’s the equivalent of when, in 1972, the president received the first barrel of oil.”The mine is owned by EcuaCorriente SA, a joint venture of Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co. and China Railway Construction Corp. It will process 10,000 tons of minerals per day in the short term, which will rise to 60,000 within months, Resources Minister Carlos Perez said during the inauguration of the mine on site. Over its lifetime, it will pay royalties and taxes amounting to $7.6 billion, he added.The project could help alleviate tightness in a copper market that’s expected to post a 189,000-ton deficit by the end of this year with few new projects coming on line and existing mines facing production disruptions, according to the International Copper Study Group.Accelerate Investment“Success in this operation could accelerate investment by this and other companies into other large mining projects,” said Erik Heimlich, a CRU Group analyst in Santiago, Chile. “Maintaining environmental standards and good community relations will be key to the success of mining in Ecuador.”Mirador was initially set to start producing in 2016, but construction was suspended after environmental and indigenous organizations alleged the Chinese-owned consortium had committed human-rights abuses. Construction resumed in March, but the victory of opponents to industrial mining in local elections later that month raised alarm bells again.“Let’s not forget that there is a proceeding before the Inter-American Human Rights Commission for the reparation of environmental rights of local communities that should be a worry for the state,” said lawyer Mario Melo, who has represented indigenous communities in high-profile environmental cases. ”There are worries regarding aspects like the tailings dam and the infrastructure construction that have already caused a worsening of environmental conditions in the region, and of living conditions.”The mine sits in a remote, mountainous jungle area on the Condor mountain range, close to the border with Peru. While gold and silver can be shipped by plane, trucks transporting copper concentrate will face a 220-mile journey through narrow, meandering roads across the country’s southern provinces.Next on Ecuador’s pipeline of big projects is Lundin Gold Inc.’s Fruta del Norte, which is set to start producing during the fourth quarter. Most of the world’s top mining companies are exploring for gold and copper in the country, including BHP Group Ltd., Hancock Prospecting Pty., Fortescue Metals Group and Newcrest Mining Ltd.Source: Ecuador Vice-Ministry of MinesTo contact the reporters on this story: Laura Millan Lombrana in Santiago at lmillan4@bloomberg.net;Stephan Kueffner in Quito at skueffner1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Reg Gale, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-large-scale-mine-test-163055481.html?.tsrc=rss

The Brazilian behemoth suffered not one but two dam bursts near its mines in recent years, with the most recent one unfolding in January of this year. The latter one claimed a few dozen lives, and forced a shutdown of a major mining operation that has affected the global supply iron ore pellets.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Are Worth Your Money To what degree it's impacted that supply isn't clear. All producers like Vale and Cleveland Cliffs throttle their output to adjust for price fluctuations, but with Vale subdued, rivals like Vale and smaller Ferrexpo may have offered lower prices to secure new customers.Cleveland-Cliffs' Q1 results, however, don't quite jibe with the market price of iron ore and the apparent demand for it.As one would expect with Vale's partial absence, iron ore priced advanced from $76 per tonne before Vale's January accident to $93 per tonne now. The advance only extends price growth that started to take shape in 2016 though, and if demand was the driver, one couldn't tell it from last quarter's numbers from Clevaland Cliffs. Total volumes of ore pellets sold fell from 1.61 million tonnes for the comparable quarter a year earlier to only 1.55 million tonnes for the three-month stretch ending in March.Cleveland Cliffs didn't enjoy much of iron's price growth either. While volume was down, revenue was as well, falling nearly 13% from $180 million to $157 million.The Q1 numbers weren't the problem, though. It was the comparison figures from a year earlier that were unfairly high. Iron Ore Market to Remain RobustWhile consumption of ore pellets isn't terribly seasonal, the industry's capacity to ship it is. This is particularly true of Cleveland Cliffs, which relies heavily on access to access to locks and causeways that facilitate deliveries to its customers in the lower Great Lakes. An abnormally cold and lengthy winter season this year shut down water-based shipping in that region for longer than it may normally have been halted.Cleveland Cliffs was also a victim of unfortunate timing.CFO Keith Koci explained during the first-quarter conference call: &quot;During last year's first quarter, because the AMM hot-rolled coil price rose from $653 to $860 per short ton from the beginning to the end of the quarter. We had an enormous favorable revaluation adjustment. With HRC prices remaining relatively flat during this year's first quarter, we had no such adjustment at this time, explaining the year-over-year decline in revenue rate.&quot;AK Steel (NYSE:AKS) confirmed the stagnation of hot rolled coiled steel prices with its recently quarterly report, but dialed back its profit outlook on the likelihood that HRC prices will remain suppressed through the end of the year.Bank of America recently downgraded U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) on a similar concern.There's a disconnect between finished steel and iron ore right now. The supply of iron feeding steel mills remains tight enough to lay the groundwork for more strength ahead.The evidence in plentiful. Case(s) in point: China's demand for iron ore grew for a fifth straight month in April. A recent World Bank report suggested iron ore prices would rise another 11% this year, fueled by disruptions not just with Vale's mines, but with mines operated in Australia by BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO). And Ferrexpo recently predicted the seaborne ore pellet market would be short of demand this year between five million and ten million tonnes. Looking Ahead for CLF StockIt's this backdrop that quelled the knee-jerk selling to Cleveland Cliffs' first-quarter report. And, it's this undertow that's kept CLF stock on the cusp of a rally that's been brewing -- but on hold -- for months. Few traders are willing to the ones to stick their neck out first, but there are plenty of traders willing to follow someone else's lead.Bolstering the bullish case is a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 7.1 -- a valuation that suggests investors have priced in a worst-case scenario, and then some. An ongoing tariff battle is at least partially to blame for the pessimism.  * 7 Stocks That Are Soaring This Earnings Season Even if those tariffs remain in place in perpetuity, though, there's room and reason for gains. The trick is just getting enough traders to give Cleveland Cliffs stock the right nudge. Breaking above the upper boundary of the channel that's been in place 2016 is the key, though there's room for a decent gain between here and there.

Trading volume in Cleveland-Cliffs' stock was 6.4 million share within 20 minutes after the open, compared with the full-day average of about 7.9 million shares. Vale disclosed Wednesday that it plans to decommission all dams built by the upstream method over the next 3 years, at the cost of the equivalent of about $1.35 billion, and temporarily halt production where the dams are located. Vale said it expects the impact of the production stoppage to be about 40 million tons of iron ore per year. Among other iron ore miners, the U.S. shares of Rio Tinto PLC  climbed 2.1% and BHP Group Ltd.  rallied 2.1%. Vale shares hiked up 9.6%. In comparison, the S&P 500  edged up 0.5% in morning trade.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a6217031-919c-38f7-bf03-b187edfdf4fe/cleveland-cliffs%26%2339%3B-stock.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-01-09	2019-01-09 14:51:46	BHP	BHP Group	Why BP Will Never Learn and Never Change	"Almost nine years after tearing itself and the Gulf of Mexico apart with the Deepwater Horizon explosion, BP (NYSE:BP) is ready to go again.

The company claimed breathlessly this week it has found &quot;a billion barrels of oil&quot; in a previously explored region 150 miles south of New Orleans, and plans to spend $1.3 billion pumping as much as 38,000 barrels per day from it next year. The field is called Thunder Horse.

The usual suspects insist this makes BP stock a &quot;buy.&quot; 

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But is this a good place to invest your money? BP stock is dirt cheap, with a market cap of $134 billion on what could be $300 billion of 2018 revenue, while Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is worth $305 billion with almost the same revenue.

Bargain, right? Not necessarily.

### BP's Condition Today

BP's books show $55 billion in long-term debt, against just $19 billion for Exxon Mobil. CEO Bob Dudley, who was managing director at the time of the 2010 disaster, is crediting &quot;advanced seismic technology&quot; for the new find, but BHP (NYSE:BHP), the minority partner in what's called the Atlantis rig, has yet to make a final decision on new investment.

  * 10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market) 



The Atlantis rig has a lot in common with the one that failed. It operates in over 7,000 feet of water and can produce 200,000 barrels of oil and gas per day from a platform the size of two soccer fields. Dudley insists the production will be wildly profitable, even though there are many other producers there and a 14-year old spill nearby is still leaking. 

In fact, big oil finds are becoming routine. Exxon itself recently began drilling what it calls a 5 billion barrel field off Guyana.  Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A, NYSE:RDS.B) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) also announced major finds in the Gulf of Mexico last year.

New plays in West Texas and New Mexico have added a potential 46.3 billion barrels to the Permian field bonanza, which analysts are calling bad news for OPEC and other exporters.

New technology means oil may not be nearly as rare as people have been suggesting. America's known oil reserves have doubled and the potential global supply could also double.

### The Demand Side

At the same time, demand for oil is peaking. Electric cars are replacing traditional gasoline engines faster than previously estimated. The International Energy Agency, whose 2015 analysis was wildly optimistic on the demand side, now insists planes and ships will keep demand rising into the 2040's, but admits demand from cars should peak in the middle of the 2020's. Italy's gasoline demand has been cut in half over the last decade.

Supplies of renewable energy, mainly solar and wind, should total nearly 16 million megawatts this year, and while incentives to install renewables are going away, costs are falling below those of fossil fuels. The cost of utility-scale solar energy is now down to 3.5 cents per watt and continues to go down.

### The Bottom Line on BP Stock

BP may be partying like it's 1999, but the energy world has changed.

New technology is finding more oil and renewable energy prices are continuing to decline. Yet BP faces the same risks and costs in exploiting its new Gulf of Mexico find as it faced 20 years ago.

  * 7 5G Stocks to Buy as the Race for Spectrum Tightens 



The BP stock price is down 17% over the last five years, while the average stock in the S&P 500 is up 40%. The price of the shares is little changed from where they were in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.

The company's annual dividend of $2.46 per share currently yields 6.45%, and that's good. But that's the only reason you should own BP stock. Despite the hype, talk of oil riches is very 20th century.

2019-01-09	2019-01-09 14:41:13	BHP	BHP Group	Why Goldman Sachs Expects Iron Ore Prices to Drop to $60	"Why Goldman Sachs Expects Iron Ore Prices to Drop to $60

## Resilient iron ore prices

As we noted in Is the Party Over for Commodities as China Steel Feels the Heat? in November, iron ore prices started collapsing after Chinese steel mills’ margins gave way.

In iron ore’s typical price pattern, prices once again started rising and increased ~11% in December. Prices have rallied back to over $70 per ton.

## Goldman Sachs says prices could drop to $60

According to Bloomberg, in a note released today, Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts, including Hui Shan, stated that while the industry’s fundamentals have improved, more supply is on the way, which should restrict the rise in prices.

The bank expects iron ore prices to fall to $60 per ton in the next six months. Goldman’s analysts argue that $75 per ton for iron ore is not sustainable for two reasons: “First, part of the rally was fueled by mills restocking ahead of the Chinese New Year. Second, supply is set to increase in 2019.”

## Downside ahead for iron ore?

Morgan Stanley (MS) also expects to see losses in the commodity (XME). On January 7, it said, “We’re iron ore bears from here, though, expecting falling crude steel output and growing seaborne supply to ultimately bring price back to the mid-low-$60s/ton.”

Moreover, big miners such as Vale (VALE), BHP (BHP), and Rio Tinto (RIO) have been enjoying higher premiums on higher-grade ore due to China’s switch in a bid to control pollution. This switch was supported by higher margins. As margins have waned, it seems like the party might be over for iron ore miners, at least in the short term. The producers of metals such as copper (FCX) and aluminum (AA) have also been under pressure due to China’s muted demand outlook.

2018-12-28	2018-12-28 15:30:34	BHP	BHP Group	Why Are Analysts Turning Around on Vale?	Among the three major seaborne iron ore miners we’re discussing in this series, Vale (VALE) stock has the highest percentage of “buy” ratings from 78% of the analysts covering it.  At the end of April, 56.0% of analysts had “buy” ratings on the stock.  Approximately 18.0% of analysts have given it “holds,” and 4.0% have given it “sells.” Vale’s target price suggests a potential 32% upside based on its current market price.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a6da30fe-0c3a-3002-b7c7-be98c4dc521e/why-are-analysts-turning.html?.tsrc=rss
2018-12-28	2018-12-28 14:00:41	BHP	BHP Group	Factors Driving Rio Tinto’s Earnings Estimates in 2019 and Beyond	Rio Tinto (RIO) (TRQ) stock has returned -9.8% YTD (year-to-date) as of December 21. Similar to BHP Billiton (BHP) stock, it fell 2.6% in the first quarter, but as commodity prices firmed up, miners’ stocks picked up in April.  Rio Tinto’s stock price has lagged those of its peers, including BHP Billiton and Vale, primarily due to its lack of catalysts.  In 2018, analysts expect Rio Tinto’s revenue to show flat growth over 2017, coming in at $40 billion.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9a70025f-f0af-3142-a06c-7e2beebd882e/factors-driving-rio-tinto%E2%80%99s.html?.tsrc=rss

Of the analysts covering BHP Billiton (BHP) and Vale (VALE) stocks, 39.0% and 78.0% have given them “buys,” respectively.  Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF), which is mainly exposed to the US domestic market, has “buy” recommendations from 64.0% of the analysts covering its stock. Analysts generally expect its premium to come down compared to those of its peers due to the lack of any significant catalysts.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0d41d279-5e0b-305d-8435-b37c64779ad4/analysts%E2%80%99-latest-upgrades-and.html?.tsrc=rss

Last month BHP Billiton acquired a 6.1 per cent holding in SolGold, a London-listed explorer that analysts say has discovered one of the largest and highest grade copper deposits in the world in Ecuador.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/924edb3e-94b8-3e40-a3c5-df5dea59c84a/%5B%24%24%5D-competitive-bid.html?.tsrc=rss

Copper miner Antofagasta Plc saw unit costs rise more than 20 percent in the first half as reduced volumes pushed operations closer to their fixed-cost base.  Across its four major commodities – iron ore, coking coal, petroleum and copper – costs were only in decline at the iron ore unit, and even there they faced a headwind from the strength of the U.S. dollar, which raises the costs of dollar-denominated equipment and fuel.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d595ee16-1e9c-31ec-8a17-2e54c87d3fdb/bhp%E2%80%99s-costs-crash-diet-is.html?.tsrc=rss

BHP (BHP.AX)(BLT.L), which told Reuters earlier on Wednesday that it would not comment on the vote overnight, is expected to request government mediation to attempt a resolution, which could delay any strike action for as many as 10 days.  A looming strike at Escondida comes a little more than a year after a 44-day walk-off at the mine jolted global copper markets and docked economic growth in the South American country, which is the world's top copper producer.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chilean-workers-vote-strike-worlds-050402814.html?.tsrc=rss
