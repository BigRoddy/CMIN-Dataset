2021-04-15	2021-04-15 15:52:31	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Thermo Fisher CEO Sees PPD Buy as ‘All About Speed’ in New Drugs	(Bloomberg) -- Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.’s $17.4 billion acquisition of PPD Inc., a provider of clinical and research services to the pharma and biotech industries, is “all about speed” in getting medicines to market.That’s the message from Thermo Fisher Chief Executive Officer Marc Casper in outlining the company’s goals for the deal. Thermo Fisher will pay $47.50 a share for PPD, according to a statement Thursday, and will assume about $3.5 billion of net debt. The price represents a premium of about 24% to PPD’s closing price Tuesday, before reports of a possible deal.Companies like PPD that offer clinical research services help run the crucial studies that get experimental drugs to market. Thermo Fisher has become a major player in the pandemic as a producer of diagnostic test kits for Covid-19 as well as laboratory equipment and supplies. The PPD deal allows the company to expand its suite of services to customers.“It is a very natural extension for Thermo Fisher,” Casper said in an interview.While Thermo Fisher is best known for its laboratory instruments and tests, it acquired Patheon NV in 2017 in an effort to expand its drug manufacturing capabilities. The PPD deal, Casper said, will allow the company to partner with drugmakers from the earliest stages of laboratory research into new drugs through clinical trials and drug manufacturing.In the short term, Casper said the move would help the company gain market share and accelerate growth. Longer term, the merger could help shorten the development time of new drugs by streamlining the process, he said.“There are a lot of handoffs in the current process,” he said. “There are opportunities to optimize the handoffs.”If Thermo Fisher is handling both the late-stage clinical trial for a new drug and its production, it could more quickly ready factories to scale up as soon as there’s a sense of a medicine’s effectiveness. “It’s all about speed to market,” Casper said. “I think we could really accelerate the timeline.”Shares of Thermo Fisher gained 3.6% to $495.43 at 11:28 a.m. in New York trading, while PPD rose 6.9% to $46.98.Hotbed of ActivityThe drug-testing field has become a hotbed of activity as companies worldwide seek to roll out new Covid-19 drugs and vaccines, even as they continue to develop new cancer therapies and other treatments. With Covid-19 case numbers remaining high worldwide, and rising concern about future pandemics, the value of CROs is growing.PPD has worked with Gilead Sciences Inc. on studies of the Covid drug remdesivir and on research involving Roche Holding AG’s Actemra as an arthritis treatment, according to its website. PPD also offers laboratory services.What Bloomberg Intelligence says:“PPD is one of the largest contract research organizations, with scale in clinical, preclinical and central lab end-markets. The marriage of PPD with Thermo’s Patheon manufacturing unit would create a compelling end-to-end offering for biopharma customers, with compelling financial metrics.”-- Jonathan Palmer, health-care analystClick here to read the researchMeanwhile, health-care deal making overall has been on a tear, with companies announcing more than $160 billion of transactions this year, almost three times the volume in the same period of 2020. In February, Icon Plc agreed to acquire PRA Health Sciences Inc. in a contract-research deal valued at about $12 billion.PPD was taken public by investors Carlyle Group Inc. and Hellman & Friedman in February 2020. The two private equity firms are still its largest shareholders, holding 38% and 16% of the stock respectively, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley served as financial advisers to Thermo Fisher. JPMorgan Securities is the exclusive financial adviser for PPD, and Simpson Thacher is its legal adviser.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-buy-ppd-17-4-112910772.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-24	2021-03-24 13:20:31	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	What Does Thermo Fisher Scientific's Debt Look Like?	Over the past three months, shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) fell by 1.22%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Thermo Fisher Scientific has. Thermo Fisher Scientific's Debt According to the Thermo Fisher Scientific's most recent financial statement as reported on February 25, 2021, total debt is at $21.73 billion, with $19.11 billion in long-term debt and $2.63 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $10.32 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $11.41 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Thermo Fisher Scientific has $69.05 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.31. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Why Investors Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

2021-03-12	2021-03-12 16:43:05	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	7 Healthcare Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term	The healthcare sector is a critical part of global gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Estimates suggest that global healthcare spending, as a percentage of GDP, is likely to remain around 10.3% through fiscal year 2023. Healthcare spending is also expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% over the next few years. Given the importance of the industry, it’s a good idea to buy and hold some quality healthcare stocks. It’s also important to note that healthcare is relatively immune to economic shocks. In general, companies in the sector are low beta stocks. These are important reasons to buy and hold a few stocks from the sector. If we look at the growth outlook for the next decade, the healthcare sector will continue to swell in size. A key reason is significantly low healthcare spending in emerging economies. As an example, healthcare spending per capita is likely to be $12,703 in the United States by FY2024. For the same year, the per capita healthcare spending in Pakistan is estimated at $37. Therefore, healthcare companies will have significant global opportunities in the coming decade.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 OTC Stocks That Could Still Run with the Big Boys Let’s talk about seven healthcare stocks to buy and hold: Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) COMPASS Pathways (NASDAQ:CMPS) Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) ResMed Inc. (NYSE:RMD) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) Healthcare Stocks: Teladoc Health (TDOC) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com After surging to an all-time high of $308, Teladoc Health stock has corrected sharply and currently trades at about $191. A key reason for the rapid sell-off is softer-than-anticipated guidance for the year. However, the long-term outlook is robust for the business. I see the correction as an opportunity to gradually accumulate TDOC stock. For fiscal year 2020, Teladoc Health reported revenue of $1.1 billion, which was higher by 98% on a year-over-year basis. For the current year, the company is expecting revenue between $1.95 billion and $2 billion. Revenue growth is therefore likely to decelerate to approximately 80%. However, even this growth indicates strong industry tailwinds. Further, for FY2020, the company reported adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $126.8 million. For the year, adjusted EBITDA is likely to increase to $255 to $275 million. It’s worth noting that paid members in the U.S. were 51.8 million as of December 2020. For the current year, paid membership is likely in the range of 52 to 54 million. As paid members increase, the EBITDA margin is likely to see strong growth in the coming years. Overall, Teladoc has a big addressable market and the pandemic has accelerated growth in virtual healthcare. With strong growth and industry tailwinds, TDOC stock is one of the healthcare stocks to buy and hold for the long term. COMPASS Pathways (CMPS) Source: Iryna Imago / Shutterstock.com Mental health is likely to be an increasingly important part of the overall healthcare system. It’s estimated that 264 million people globally are affected by depression. This makes CMPS stock worth considering for the long term. COMPASS Pathways is a mental healthcare company that’s working toward evidence-based innovation. The company is currently developing a COMP360 psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The Phase I trials have already been completed. Currently, Phase IIb is underway with 216 patients expected to have completed trials by the end of this year. I must add that the long-term follow-up study of participants from Phase IIb will be completed only in FY2022. Therefore, the company is still a few years away from generating revenue. However, 100 million patients suffer from TRD globally. This is a big addressable market, and if trials deliver positive results, the stock is likely to surge. 7 Stocks to Buy That Are Cheering for March Madness In terms of liquidity, the company raised $146.6 million from its September 2020 initial public offering (IPO). This provides the company with ample liquidity for funding the clinical trials. Long-term investors can buy and hold CMPS stock at current levels of $41. Positive news from clinical trials will be key upside triggers in absence of any revenue in the medium term. Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com TMO stock is another attractive play in the healthcare sector. The stock currently trades around $450 and at an attractive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.05. Considering the company’s growth, the stock is one to buy and hold for the next few years. Thermo Fisher conducts business through various segments that include life-sciences solutions, analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics and laboratory products. For FY2020, the company reported revenue of $32.2 billion, with YoY growth of 26%. Earnings per share (EPS) growth for the same period was 58%. Considering the earnings growth, a P/E of 21.05 implies that the stock is undervalued. It’s worth noting that the company generated more than $6 billion in Covid-19 response revenue last year. This segment will continue to drive growth in the coming quarters. Additionally, the company has high investments in research and development. There are several new product launches lined up for the year, which will continue to boost growth. Thermo Fisher has continued to deliver strong free cash flows. With high financial flexibility, the company is pursuing inorganic growth. In February 2021, the company completed the acquisition of Mesa Biotech, a “point-of-care molecular diagnostic company.” In the same month, the company also acquired “cell sorting technology assets from Propel Labs.” Thermo Fisher also increased quarterly dividends by 18% to 26 cents per share. Within an industry that’s immune to economic shocks, the company is well positioned to deliver strong cash flows and higher dividends in the coming years. Pfizer (PFE) Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com Among pharmaceutical stocks, PFE stock is worth buying at current levels. The stock trades at a P/E of 10.78 and has an attractive dividend yield of 4.5%. After trading flat for almost a year, I would not be surprised if PFE stock outperforms in the next few quarters. Even from a long-term perspective, it’s a buy-and-hold stock for your portfolio. While the company’s stock has been depressed, the company’s financial performance remains strong. For the year, Pfizer is expecting to generate $15 billion in revenue from BNT162b2. The vaccine for Covid-19 will continue to contribute to top-line growth in the next few years. Besides the vaccine, Pfizer has an attractive pipeline of drugs. Through FY2025, the company expects top-line growth of 6% as new vaccines and drugs boost growth. To elaborate, the company currently has 24 drugs in Phase 3 and 35 in Phase 2 trials. Furthermore, there are 27 drugs in Phase 1 trials. Therefore, Pfizer growth is not limited to the vaccine against Covid-19. 7 Internet of Things Stocks to Buy for Our Interconnected World In the coming years, top-line growth will be associated with growth in cash flows. This positions the company for sustained value creation through dividends and share repurchase. In addition, the stock currently has an average analyst price target of $41.11. This would imply an upside of 18% from current levels of $34.80. ResMed Inc. (RMD) Source: PREMIO STOCK / Shutterstock.com ResMed Inc. is another name among healthcare stocks to buy and hold for the next five years. I would classify RMD stock as a hidden gem with a potential to outperform in the sector. ResMed is a provider of innovative solutions to treat people out of the hospital. The company’s cloud-connected medical device is used for conditions that include sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic diseases. A key reason to be bullish on the company’s growth is a large addressable market. As an example, ResMed estimates that more than 380 million people globally suffer from COPD. Similarly, the company estimates that sleep apnea is 80% undiagnosed. In addition, the company is also a provider of software-as-a-service, which contributed to 12% of the revenue in the last 12 months. The company’s revenue is also well diversified from a geographical perspective, with strong presence in the Americas and Europe. I also like the fact that the stock offers an annual dividend of $1.56 per share. The company’s free cash flow has been trending higher, and it’s likely that dividends will grow in the next few years. It’s also worth noting that for FY2020, the company’s research and development expense was 7% of the revenue. Investment in research is likely to ensure strong top-line and earnings growth. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com At a P/E of 16.75 and a dividend yield of 2.54%, JNJ stock is a must-have for your long-term picks of healthcare stocks. The stock has moved higher by 21% in the last one-year period, and it seems to me that a breakout on the upside is likely. The company’s vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use. The U.S. will also be investing $100 million to help the company double the vaccine output. Further, the single-dose shot vaccine has also been approved by Health Canada. The vaccine commercialization is likely to provide a top-line boost. It’s worth noting that the pharmaceutical segment is the company’s key driver for revenue growth and cash flow. For FY2020, the company reported $45.6 billion in pharmaceutical sales, which was higher by 8% on a YoY basis. Last year, the company invested $12.2 billion in research and development. With a strong product pipeline, healthy growth is likely to sustain. With the Covid-19 pandemic, the company’s medical devices sales declined last year by 11.6% to $23 billion. A gradual turnaround in this segment is likely, which will support growth and incremental cash flows. 7 of the Top Transportation Stocks to Buy Right Now Overall, the company’s business segments are a cash-flow machine. Johnson & Johnson has a broad portfolio of products that deliver recurring cash flows. Therefore, JNJ stock is worth holding for the long-term for dividends and capital gains. Illumina (ILMN) Source: Connect world / Shutterstock.com ILMN stock is another attractive name when it comes to healthcare stocks. The stock touched a high of $555 and has since corrected to about $400. At current levels, fresh exposure to the stock can be considered. The company is a provider of DNA sequencing and array-based technologies. The company’s product application is in the field of life sciences, oncology, reproductive health and agriculture, among others. It’s worth noting that Illumina already has leadership position in clinical genomics. For FY2020, the company generated $1.5 billion in clinical revenue. With a $3 billion investment in research and development in the last five years, the segment will continue to drive growth. For the current year, the company has strong top-line guidance with revenue growth between 17% to 20%. Importantly, the key segments of sequencing, sequencing instruments and sequencing consumables are likely to deliver more than 20% YoY growth. Overall, the company operates in a niche segment that has limited competition. With a robust growth outlook for sequencing and sequencing instruments, ILMN stock is a long-term buy and hold.

2021-02-02	2021-02-02 15:27:56	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	P/E Ratio Insights for Thermo Fisher Scientific	In the current session, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is trading at $521.62, after a 1.26% increase. Over the past month, the stock increased by 9.19%, and in the past year, by 56.88%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 2.06%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings. View more earnings on TMO Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 79.0 in the Life Sciences Tools & Services industry, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 32.3. Shareholders might be inclined to think that the stock might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.

2021-02-02	2021-02-02 13:35:06	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Thermo Fisher Scientific: Debt Insights	Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) fell by 1.83% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Thermo Fisher Scientific has. Thermo Fisher Scientific's Debt According to the Thermo Fisher Scientific's most recent balance sheet as reported on October 30, 2020, total debt is at $21.09 billion, with $21.09 billion in long-term debt and $2.00 million in current debt. Adjusting for $7.54 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $13.55 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Thermo Fisher Scientific has $64.06 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.33. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Investors Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

2021-01-29	2021-01-29 15:08:41	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Earnings Outlook for Thermo Fisher Scientific	"On Monday, February 01, Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) will release its latest earnings report. Benzinga's outlook for Thermo Fisher Scientific is included in the following report. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Sell-side analysts expect Thermo Fisher Scientific's EPS to be near $6.56 on sales of $9.58 billion. In the same quarter last year, Thermo Fisher Scientific reported earnings per share of $3.55 on revenue of $6.83 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin. View more earnings on TMO If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Monday, EPS would be up 84.79%. Revenue would be up 40.28% from the year-ago period. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 4.31 2.84 2.79 3.54 EPS Actual 5.63 3.89 2.94 3.55 Revenue Estimate 7.65 B 6.13 B 6.17 B 6.78 B Revenue Actual 8.52 B 6.92 B 6.23 B 6.83 B Stock Performance Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific were trading at $496.405 as of January 28. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 57.01%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably satisfied going into this earnings release.

Opportunity In Adversity:  The mRNA vaccine jointly developed by Pfizer and BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ: BNTX) requires  a storage temperature of negative 70 degrees Celsius.This poses logistics challenges, especially in poorer nations that do not have the infrastructure or cold chain in place to handle the vaccine.This hurdle is likely to turn out to be an opportunity for companies that operate along the supply chain.Freezer Box Manufacturers:  Companies such as Carrier Global Corp (NYSE: CARR) and Trane Technologies PLC (NYSE: TT) are supply chain plays that stand to benefit from vaccine approval.Trane Tech's Thermo King brand provides intelligent end-to-end temperature-controlled cold chain solution for vaccine shipments. In late September, the company launched cold storage solutions to support COVID-19 vaccine distribution.""Considering the urgent, global need for a COVID-19 vaccine, the world can't afford breaks in the cold chain,"" said Dave Regnery, COO of Trane Technologies.""Our new Cold Storage Solutions can maintain temperatures of -70 degrees Celsius for an extended period of time, can be leveraged to help reduce degradation of a vaccination, and most importantly, could prevent vaccine 'deserts' or lack of accessibility.""Related Link: Startup Democratizes Freight Broker Financing Carrier Global announced in early October a collaboration with Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS to co-develop a new Lynx digital platform.""This suite of tools will provide Carrier customers around the world with enhanced visibility, increased connectivity, and actionable intelligence across their cold chain operations to improve outcomes for temperature-sensitive cargo, including food, medicine, and vaccines,"" Carrier Global said in the release announcing the collaboration.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO) manufactures ultra-low temperature freezers that can maintain temperature of about negative 80 degree Celsius.Dry Ice Manufacturers:  Germany's Linde PLC (NYSE: LIN) and France-based L Air Liquide Ord ADR (OTC: AIQUY) are suppliers of liquid ice, which is nothing but solidified carbon dioxide.While transporting vaccines, they should be kept under dry ice in thermal containers to maintain their efficacy.Delivery Services Companies:  Pfizer is planning to distribute its COVID-19 vaccine in about 12 trucks per day that will set forth from its formulation-and-fill facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan,  Supply Chain Dive reported,  citing an email from a Pfizer spokesperson.The company reportedly plans to use FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) and DHL to distribute the vaccine throughout the U.S.Related Link:  PowerFleet Secures COVID-19 Healthcare Supplies Across Africa See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 5 Top Semiconductor Stocks As Post-Election Plays  * Nio, Li Auto Make Big Moves Following Xpeng's Q3 Results(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Thermo Fisher Scientific's Earnings: A Preview	"On Wednesday, October 21, Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) will release its latest earnings report. Check out Benzinga's preview to understand the implications.What Are Earnings, Net Income And Earnings Per Share (EPS)? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS.Earnings And Revenue Analysts covering Thermo Fisher Scientific modeled for quarterly EPS of $4.31 on revenue of $7.65 billion. In the same quarter last year, Thermo Fisher Scientific announced EPS of $2.94 on revenue of $6.27 billion.What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Many of the Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish an analyst estimate of its revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates,"" and these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance when it releases earnings. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise.""View more earnings on TMOIf the company were to report earnings in line when it publishes results Wednesday, earnings would be up 46.6%. Revenue would be up 21.97% on a year-over-year basis. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past:Quarter Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2019  EPS Estimate 2.84 2.79 3.54 2.87  EPS Actual 3.89 2.94 3.55 2.94  Revenue Estimate 6.13 B 6.17 B 6.78 B 6.18 B  Revenue Actual 6.92 B 6.23 B 6.83 B 6.27 B  Stock Performance Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific were trading at $461.28 as of October 19. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 57.43%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably content going into this earnings release.Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call.

2020-10-20	2020-10-20 12:15:00	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Rally in Covid-Testing Stocks Here to Stay in Virus Resurgence	(Bloomberg) -- Firms that provide Covid-19 testing capabilities have skyrocketed this year and there may be more room for their shares to rally.A new wave of virus cases in the U.S. and Europe signal an insatiable need for more tests to diagnose the disease that currently has no known cure and a vaccine that’s only expected to be rolled out next year at the very earliest. That means companies that make and operate kits, like Quest Diagnostics Inc. and Hologic Inc., should see steady flows of income as patients line up to get tested, money managers and Wall Street analysts say.As the industry soars near record levels -- up 68% from a March bottom -- it’s still cheaper relative to the broader S&P 500 Index than it’s been in recent years. That means a trend of promising earnings could provide a boost this year and well into 2022.“There’s a very positive trend out there for investors because Covid is going to be here for a while -- there is no quick fix,” BNP Paribas Asset Management portfolio manager Christian Fay said by telephone.The iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF, known by its ticker IHI, peeled off a record Monday as testmakers and lab companies like Abbott Laboratories and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. were hit by a broader market decline. Despite the recent surge, some on Wall Street think investors still aren’t giving these firms proper credit for the billions of dollars in expected sales.Investors are “clearly discounting the durability of the revenue stream” from Covid-19 tests, according to Needham & Co. analyst Stephen Unger. He sees the testing opportunity providing a boost into at least 2022.“Current levels don’t fully represent the recurring nature of tests,” he said in an interview. He also believes these tests will have “extraordinary” returns on investments and high margins.Earnings BoostThe upcoming earnings season could provide a further boost for the industry when Abbott, maker of seven Covid-19 tests in the U.S., and Thermo Fisher kick off quarterly results before the market opens on Oct. 21.For life sciences companies like Hologic, Quidel Corp., and Abbott, Covid-19 testing is “obviously the cherry on top” after record runs, said Fay, whose BNP Paribas Funds Health Care Innovators fund holds all three stocks. He’s optimistic on the outlook for the testing space given expectations for people to get a “flu, Covid, and RSV test on a quick turnaround will lead to more people getting tested more often.”While vaccine developers like Moderna Inc., Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE, and AstraZeneca have dominated headlines and seen the largest flows of trading over recent months, some investors are preferring to hedge vaccine bets with investments in the diagnostics sector.“I would play out both ends -- diagnostics and vaccines -- because the ability to test to help people get back to normalcy will be key between now and a rolled-out vaccine,” said Amy Kong, chief investment officer of Barrett Asset Management LLC.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rally-covid-testing-stocks-stay-121500290.html?.tsrc=rss

Afterwards,  I said that INO stock could rise to $30, which never happened.
Instead, the stock flopped, and I weighed in again, warning investors to avoid the shares.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Recently, Inovio reported a higher-than-expected quarterly loss of 83 cents, and there have been more questions than answers about its INO-4800 vaccine. Things got even worse for INO stock after the FDA halted the company’s clinical trials due to the agency’s questions about its vaccine technology.
But I believe that Inovio is a “blood-in-the-street” opportunity that’s facing a temporary hurdle. From its current price of $11.63, I believe that it could refill its gap at $16.96 in the near-term.
The FDA’s Halt Is Only Temporary
Before the halt, Inovio Pharmaceuticals had said that it intended to move its vaccine candidate into Phase 2/3 trials this month. Now that may not happen until early November, although the trials could start in late October.


					The 7 Top Robinhood Stocks for October				

Inovio intends to address the FDA’s questions later this month. The agency will then have 30 days to notify the company whether it can proceed.
While the company didn’t report what the FDA’s questions were, it did say “they included the delivery device used in administering the shot,”  The Wall Street Journal’s Jared S. Hopkins reported.

Plus, according to an Inovio press release:
“This partial clinical hold is not due to the occurrence of any adverse events related to INOVIO’s ongoing expanded Phase 1 study of INO-4800, the conduct of which may continue and is not impacted by the FDA’s notification.”
Also, Maxim Group analyst Jason McCarthy just upgraded INO stock to “buy” from “hold.” He believes that the FDA’s halt will be short-lived.
There Are 100 Million Reasons to Like INO Stock
Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) will manufacture 100 million doses of Inovio’s INO-4800 vaccine annually.
“At peak capacity, Thermo Fisher projects that it could produce at least 100 million doses of INO-4800 annually,” according to a recent press release. “Thermo Fisher Scientific will join existing partners Richter-Helm BioLogics and Ology Biosciences in INOVIO’s global manufacturing consortium. INOVIO is in active discussions with additional manufacturers to join the consortium as INOVIO seeks to complement its existing members with additional manufacturing partnerships to meet global needs.”
It makes sense for Inovio to utilize multiple manufacturers. That way, the potential vaccine can be administered to the public much more quickly.
Inovio Pharmaceuticals Isn’t a One-Trick Pony
Inovio’s VGX-3100 drug for cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) is in Phase 3 trials. Its GLS-6150 treatment for Hepatitis-C is in Phase 1 trials.  Its PENNVAX-GP drug for HIV-1 is in Phase 1/2 trials. And its INO-5151 drug for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer is now in Phase 1/2 trials.
In short, Inovio Pharmaceutical is not a one-trick pony.
The Bottom Line on INO Stock
The FDA’s halt is a temporary issue. It had nothing to do with any adverse events among those participating in Inovio’s trials. Once the company answers the FDA’s questions and gets the green light to move forward, its vaccine candidate should progress well.
Again, I now believe that INO stock is a “blood in the street” opportunity that’s facing a temporary hurdle.

This Week's Asset Class Flows: 09/22/2020	Investors often reallocate money in between asset classes, whether to manage risk or simply to rebalance. This is our weekly snapshot of where ETF investors are putting their money. This past week was solid gold for commodity ETFs as the asset class topped the flows charts for the week with $1.9 billion in new assets. The move comes mostly from inflows into the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD A-) despite negative returns of 2.6% for the week. The gold fund had the highest inflows of any fund at $1.9 billion. Volatility made its way back into investors’ good graces with flows of $147 million or almost 4% of its total assets. 81% of those inflows can be attributed to the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures (UVXY B-). While funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO A) and the Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS A) both pulled in $2.2 billion, equity funds lagged behind at only $731 million in net flows. The gains by the top two equity funds were unfortunately offset by the outflows from the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM B+) and the Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG A-), with investors pulling almost $1.2 billion from each fund.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weeks-asset-class-flows-09-151800419.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-16	2020-09-16 00:00:00	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	The Argus Dividend Growth Portfolio	Often overlooked amid the market's gyrations, dividend income is an important element of total return. Consider recent results: in 2015, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 1.4%, including dividends -- but excluding dividends, the market was down 0.7%. Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors. And dividend payments softened the blow in 2018, when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks, particularly in a slow-growth or recessionary economic environment.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ee2cb308-3324-39c8-b0ae-47798c9d8c19/the-argus-dividend-growth.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-11	2020-09-11 13:15:30	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Thermo Fisher Scientific's Debt Overview	Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) rose by 21.69% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Thermo Fisher Scientific has.Thermo Fisher Scientific's Debt Based on Thermo Fisher Scientific's financial statement as of July 31, 2020, long-term debt is at $20.64 billion and current debt is at $675.00 million, amounting to $21.31 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $5.82 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $15.49 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Thermo Fisher Scientific's $61.59 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.35. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Why Investors Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-13	2020-08-13 13:39:52	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Thermo Fisher Ditches Bid for Qiagen as Offer Falls Short	(Bloomberg) -- Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. ended its $12 billion agreement to purchase Qiagen NV after its tender offer for the Dutch maker of medical testing equipment fell short, with activist investor Davidson Kempner Capital Management leading opposition to one of the biggest deals in the health sector this year.Only about 47% of Qiagen shares were tendered, Thermo Fisher said in a statement Thursday, meaning the minimum threshold for acceptance of the proposed deal hadn’t been met. Qiagen will pay Thermo Fisher a reimbursement of $95 million, according to the statement.Davidson Kempner is “pleased that the majority of investors have rejected the wholly inadequate offer made by Thermo Fisher Scientific,” according to an emailed statement from the fund manager.Qiagen “respects the views of shareholders” and will focus on hitting its financial targets this year and through 2021, the company said in a statement. It plans to close its acquisition of NeuMoDx Inc. and expects the pandemic to continue supporting increased demand for its portfolio of molecular diagnostics products.Some shareholders had been seeking a higher price for Qiagen than the 43 euros ($49) per share Thermo Fisher had offered. Davidson Kempner had said that a price between 48 euros and 52 euros a share was more appropriate and had urged others to reject Thermo Fisher’s offer, which had been increased from an initial 39 euros.Qiagen shares traded in the Netherlands were up 0.6% following the announcement. Shares of Thermo Fisher declined 0.4% to $414.63 at 9:33 a.m. in New York.The Dutch company has ramped up production this year to supply tests and chemicals for the coronavirus. The company in July said annual sales may rise as much as 18%, fueled by the pandemic.The purchase would have ranked as one of Thermo Fisher’s largest after the company spent $13.6 billion for Life Technologies Corp. to gain DNA-testing capabilities in 2014.(Updates with Qiagen comment in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-ditches-bid-qiagen-133952364.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-10	2020-08-10 07:18:54	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	It’s Lonely Trying to Kill This Covid-19 Diagnostics Deal	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP doesn’t usually conduct activism in public by itself. Its attempt to kill the $12 billion takeover of Qiagen NV, a European company that makes instruments that detect Covid-19, was a high-profile place to start.The hedge fund says a bid from U.S. diagnostics group Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is too low given the testing business will become stronger due to the pandemic. Its campaign has helped secure a justified 10% bump on the opening bid, to 43 euros ($50.71) per share. It still wants more.Judged on near-term valuation multiples, the deal can be seen as cheap despite the sweetener. It’s worth 22 times the $2.28 earnings per share Berenberg reckons the company will make this year. (Qiagen says it will make “at least” $2 per share.) That’s substantially lower than the earnings multiples on which diagnostics peers trade. It’s also at the bottom of Qiagen’s trading range prior to a shock sales warning in October that pummeled the shares and led to the sudden replacement of its chief executive officer.On Davidson Kempner’s own forecasts, the earnings trajectory is even stronger and therefore the multiple even lower.But competitors in the industry don’t have identical businesses. Moreover, the absolute return on invested capital from this deal still looks middling for Thermo Fisher unless it can unearth greater synergies than it’s announced. What looks cheap on a relative basis, either over time or with reference to traded peers, may still be make for a pricey acquisition.Either way, no rival bidder has emerged, the offer closes today and the market isn’t pushing the shares above the revised bid. Investors are loath to believe in a possibly brighter, standalone future. No wonder. The board wasn’t able to get a new permanent CEO in place to restore confidence before Thermo Fisher’s approach. Shareholders who stayed in the company have done so hoping for a just such a takeover bid and many will have already sold to short-termist merger arbitrageurs.The question now is whether the current shareholders are willing to take a chance on the shares eventually getting to the bid price fueled by their own steam by rejecting the offer, and whether they are relaxed about how far the shares could fall in the meantime. Neglected, unloved stocks like Qiagen should make good targets for well-resourced activists. However, any campaign must push against the combined forces of bidder, target and an apathetic market if it is to prevail. When almost everyone is holding the stock for a deal, and one surfaces, breaking up the party is going to be tough — especially when the buyer ups the bid. Holders of some 17% of Qiagen stock have already accepted the offer.Big hedge funds need to be bolder and more contrarian if they are to make returns nowadays. If Davidson Kempner is being prompted to be more strident in its activism, others may follow.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

2020-07-23	2020-07-23 13:27:24	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	A Look Into Thermo Fisher Scientific's Debt	Over the past three months, shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO) rose by 24.23%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Thermo Fisher Scientific has.Thermo Fisher Scientific's Debt According to the Thermo Fisher Scientific's most recent balance sheet as reported on May 1, 2020, total debt is at $19.97 billion, with $19.23 billion in long-term debt and $738.00 million in current debt. Adjusting for $2.98 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $16.99 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Thermo Fisher Scientific's $58.69 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.34. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, whereas average for another.Why Investors Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * A Look Into Thermo Fisher Scientific's Debt  * Recap: Thermo Fisher Scientific Q2 Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-22	2020-07-22 09:30:04	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Covid-19 Testing Is Broken and There's No Plan to Fix It	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Many of the recent stories are familiar, but still distressing and perplexing.There was the gentleman in Tucson who waited 27 days to get results from a Covid-19 test, only to discover he didn’t have the virus and the two weeks he spent in quarantine had been pointless. There was the nonprofit nursing home chain in the Phoenix area that waited five days for test results, only to learn that several staff members and residents had the coronavirus; the asymptomatic staffers had roamed freely until the results arrived. And there have been many tales of Arizona residents waiting a week, on average, to get test results — and sometimes much longer — even though their state has been a coronavirus hotspot for more than a month. Texas, Florida, California and many other newly resurgent corona-states have similar stories.Test results, to be useful, should arrive in less than two days. If they take longer, opportunities to isolate infected people and trace their contacts with others wither, undermining broader containment efforts. So why can’t the wealthiest and most innovative country in the world have more rapid-fire testing during a pandemic?Several other wealthy countries already set good examples around testing that the U.S. might have emulated, measures including national testing strategies and aggressive contact tracing. The U.S. also had a lag between its first coronavirus outbreaks in the spring and the current surge, which gave private and public stakeholders in the testing community a chance to catch up. Yet even though testing has ramped up massively — to about 780,000 tests a day, from 145,000 per day in early April — some experts say that to combat the coronavirus effectively the country should be conducting at least 5 million tests a day. Federal health authorities recently said the U.S. has already reached its daily testing capacity, but by fall should have the ability to conduct about 1.3 million to 1.7 million tests a day. That would be an improvement, but clearly not enough — especially if a second coronavirus wave washes across America come October or November.Even now, the spread of the virus has outpaced testing increases. (In Arizona, in-state testing volume jumped 50% while the growth in new Covid-19 cases exceeded 100%.) More testing isn’t a solution anyhow if results aren’t prompt. And the sheer number of cases in the U.S. adds to the problem. During the spring, coronavirus cases peaked at about 36,000 a day. Last Thursday, more than 75,000 infections were reported — a new record. That same day, a bipartisan group of health care experts, scientists, former senior public officials and investors released a report warning of further economic and social devastation if Covid-19 is left unchecked.“Testing is the only way out of our present disaster, and it will remain the case until a vaccine or effective therapeutics are widely available,” noted the report, which was sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation. The authors call for $75 billion in immediate public spending to buttress the testing effort, which would be “the single best investment America could make in averting an even more tragic and pending disaster.”Even if you don’t believe the coronavirus has brought on an apocalypse, it still makes sense to fix and fortify national testing to protect public health before other disasters arrive. A civilized, equitable and well-functioning country shouldn’t be satisfied with the current testing regime. Rather, it should set to work to establish effective public-private partnerships, embrace the role of the federal and state governments as problem solvers, and hold the private sector to higher standards.While the Trump administration and the federal government have drawn ample criticism for leadership failures around testing, the private sector has also proved unequal to the epic challenges a pandemic presents.Federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state labs and hospitals all provide testing services, but commercial labs dominate the market. The clinical testing business, which generates annual revenue of about $80 billion, has a number of big players, including ARUP Laboratories, BioReference Laboratories, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, and Sonic Healthcare Ltd. But two aggressive competitors, Quest Diagnostics Inc. and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, dominate the field.Quest earned $858 million on revenue of $7.7 billion in 2019. The company says its operations “touch the lives” of 30% of the U.S. adult population and it boasts of relationships with about half of all physicians and hospitals in the country. LabCorp earned $824 million on revenue of $11.5 billion last year. It says it interacts with 3 million patients weekly, controls proprietary data derived from 35 billion lab test results (which includes about 50% of the U.S. population), and has contributed to the development of all 50 of the country’s top-selling drugs.Both companies were assembled through decades of mergers and acquisitions, diagnostic ingenuity and an unrelenting focus on expanding their market share. Quest and Labcorp are preferred or exclusive providers for many of the largest private health insurance companies in the U.S., and they process a large portion of tests covered by Medicare and Medicaid.Quest, in its securities filings, describes the testing market as “fragmented and highly competitive.” But Quest and LabCorp’s sales suggest they jointly control about a quarter of the business. Smaller competitors have complained over the years that Quest and Labcorp’s tight relationships with insurers and the federal government make it hard for them to break into health care networks to offer alternatives. Some consumers have alleged that the companies charge exorbitant prices for tests administered to uninsured patients, and both companies have drawn scrutiny for possibly overbilling Medicare and Medicaid (charges that they’ve denied).In the spring, questions about how readily insurers would cover charges from all companies for Covid-19 tests, along with many patients’ reluctance to visit doctors’ offices, brutalized the testing industry’s bottom line. Quest and LabCorp seem to have weathered this better than most; the stocks of both companies are trading around their 52-week highs. Yet even they haven’t been able to meet the testing demands imposed by Covid-19.As the virus rampaged in June and July, both companies, having rapidly upped their testing game, still lagged. A three-to-five-day turnaround time for test results they announced at the end of June gave way to a four-to-five-day delay by the first week of July. After announcing the second delay, Quest said it didn’t expect to get any faster until the coronavirus stopped spreading nationally. Don’t expect that to happen anytime soon. In an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday, a senior Quest executive said “it will be impossible” for his company “to increase coronavirus testing capacity to cope with demand during the autumn flu season.”That leaves patients, hospitals and society in a bind. Consider Arizona, which has the highest Covid-19 positivity rate of any state. The virus has spread there so quickly and deeply that a public health official in the state’s most populous county has said contact tracing may have become worthless. Sonora Quest Laboratories — a partnership between Quest and the Banner Health hospital chain — handles 80% of Covid-19 tests in Arizona, making it the largest testing network in the state. And it can take 11 days for Sonora Quest to deliver test results.Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican caught flat-footed by the outbreak, recently channeled $1 million in state funds to Sonora Quest to help buy equipment to process tests more quickly. He’s also started pushing a new testing partnership with Arizona State University, and he’s working with the federal government to set up free testing sites. Perhaps he will have better luck than Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, a Democrat, who said she requested federal testing sites in April and was rebuffed by the White House.But Ducey comes late to his testing push, having been reluctant to impose other public health measures such as stay-at-home orders, masks and lockdowns. And regardless of his new incentives, it’s not clear how quickly Sonora Quest can ramp up testing and improve turnaround times.Another governor decided to circumvent the major labs altogether. New York’s Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has advised his state’s residents to patronize local labs rather than Quest or LabCorp to get timely test results. About 70% of New York’s tests are now processed by 200 local labs that return results in one to three days, the state said.Smaller labs around the country have excess capacity they’re unable to deploy because they haven’t been able to break into the insurance networks dominated by the big guys. And labs of all sizes struggle to operate at full capacity because a balkanized supply chain forces them to compete against one another for frequently scarce resources.Those resources include reagents (the chemicals labs use to detect the presence of a virus), swabs for collecting patient samples, personal protective equipment, tubes and other media used to transport samples, and proprietary test kits that work with diagnostic machines from companies such as Hologic Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Abbott Laboratories. Those kits are a special challenge because they’re not interchangeable: Labs that use machines made by Hologic, for example, can’t use kits designed for machines made by Thermo Fisher. A dearth of testing kits was a problem in the spring. Now there’s a dearth of testing machines. All of this has become a tar pit for labs and their employees working around the clock.To top it off, the testing industry has technology and data challenges. As the New York Times recently detailed in a bit of startling reporting, some test results are still transmitted via fax machines and traditional mail, 80% of Covid-19 test results lack demographic information, and 50% have no associated addresses. Privacy requirements explain much of the problem, but it nonetheless hobbles testing during a pandemic.Will companies sort this out on their own? No, because they’re competing against one another. Can states help? No, they’re competing against one another, too. That leaves the federal government as the logical referee. It’s Washington that can define and coordinate a national testing program, provide financial incentives to companies to speed things up, help steer resources so as to rationalize supply chains, and revivify a dilapidated public health infrastructure undermined by years of staffing and budget cuts.However, the possibility of federal action collides with longstanding suspicion, and often outright hostility, in the U.S. toward centralized public health guidance and services. Countering that sentiment, and driving a national testing strategy, will require creative and purposeful leadership from Washington — and from the White House in particular.When Covid-19 first escalated in the spring, President Donald Trump briefly came to recognize there was battle to be fought. “I view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president,” he said in March. “It’s a medical war. We have to win this war. It’s very important.”But one month after setting up a coronavirus task force in the White House and putting his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of expanding testing, Trump effectively shifted primary responsibility for the battle to the states. It was as if, during World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt had told governors to devise their own military strategies and produce their own tanks, ships and planes.During the brief period the White House took the reins, some progress was made. More testing sites were opened and significant supply chain problems were tackled. An effort to offer drive-through testing services in commercial parking lots got underway. But Trump’s promise in the spring that “anybody that wants a test can get a test” wasn’t true then and it’s still not true today — largely because the president failed to forge a national consensus around testing in partnership with governors and public and private laboratories.More recently, Trump has repeatedly denounced testing. And the White House has been trying to cut billions of dollars for testing and other public health initiatives that Republicans in Congress want baked into the next round of bailout funding. At a press briefing on Tuesday, Trump declined to say whether he personally supported further funding for testing. In the midst of a national crisis, that animus toward testing is reckless and dangerous.Whoever is elected president in November may be enjoying his victory just as Covid-19 unleashes a brutal winter surge. Whether that’s Trump or Joe Biden, he will need to put the weight of the federal government behind initiatives to bolster public health services generally and break the testing logjam specifically.An obvious first step would be for the White House to help speed up the creation and distribution of simple point-of-care tests that can be used in doctors’ offices, private residences, nursing homes, schools — anywhere they’re needed outside of laboratory settings, especially in underserved, low-income communities. These tests can produce results in an hour or less, but also have significant accuracy problems. There’s already ample research underway to improve POC tests, and the federal government has approved a small number for emergency use, including devices from Abbott, Quidel Corp. and Becton, Dickinson and Company. But there’s much work to be done there.The U.S. has been playing catch-up on coronavirus testing almost from the start, ever since the faulty Covid-19 test the CDC sent to labs in early February turned out to be disastrously ineffective. Since then the government, which previously handled the development and distribution of diagnostic tests, has granted a series of emergency approvals for private companies to produce new tests. In contrast, Germany and South Korea have kept looser leashes on test development, bolstering their ability to test more broadly and effectively. The U.S. government would do well to continue loosening some of its testing regulations.On the other hand, the government could use its regulatory powers to suppress any anti-competitive practices that some of the bigger testing companies may be engaging in. A more muscular interpretation of the Defense Production Act would also enable the White House to resolve myriad supply problems, whether by ensuring the availability and compatibility of testing equipment or by smoothing access to such basics as swabs and reagents.The CDC, which Trump has undermined, could help institute a more effective testing regime by working with its traditional network of state public health agencies and private companies — if its budget was fortified and its regulatory and legal powers were enhanced. The CDC currently offers guidelines that states can take or leave. An empowered CDC should be authorized to devise enforceable rules that help rationalize how the testing industry operates.Analysts, experts and medical professionals from ideologically diverse institutions — including the American Enterprise Institute, Duke University, Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University and the Rockefeller Foundation — have recently issued detailed reports calling for bolder steps to streamline and reinvent the U.S. testing system. All of them advocate a broader role for the federal government, ranging from coordinating information and supplies and supporting POC innovations to providing financial incentives, establishing private-public mega-labs, and establishing task forces to help carry out these initiatives.The Harvard study goes so far as to call for the creation of a federal “Pandemic Testing Board” with “strong but narrow powers that has the job of securing the testing supply and the infrastructure necessary for deployment of testing.” The authors liken this to the War Production Board that the U.S. empowered for three years during World War II to supervise the production of weapons and military supplies.That makes sense to me. After all, we won World War II and we’re now at war with Covid-19. Even Trump knows that.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Timothy L.

2020-07-13	2020-07-13 12:36:23	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	When Bad News Is Good News for an M&A Deal	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The pandemic has seen plenty of bidders trying to back away from takeover deals they suddenly regretted. But the crisis has made some transactions more attractive for buyers, and less attractive for sellers. A major shareholder in a European maker of Covid-19 test equipment is understandably saying it’s time to rethink the company’s recent deal to sell out to a U.S. peer.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. agreed to buy rival diagnostics group Qiagen NV when markets were starting to worry about the novel coronavirus in early March. Back then, the situation had not yet been declared a pandemic although the signs were worrying. Qiagen had been through some turmoil, losing its chief executive officer and suffering a deep share-price fall last year. Thermo Fisher’s 39-euros-a-share ($44.20-a-share) offer was at the high the shares touched during an earlier set of bid talks in November. That seemed more than good enough at the time.Fast forward to July, and investors are more focused on Qiagen’s improved prospects amid the global surge in demand for diagnostic testing, and less on last year’s company-specific tribulations. The share price is hovering just above the bid, at roughly 40 euros. That small premium is more significant than it looks. It suggests merger arbitrageurs aren’t too worried about the prospect of losing money due to the deal going through at the agreed price.Factor in the many months it will take for the offer to trundle through regulatory approvals, and Qiagen investors appear to be demanding an even higher offer.For its part, Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP, an aggregate 3% shareholder across various funds, reckons the stock should be trading above this level even without a bid, based on the rally enjoyed by Qiagen’s peers in recent months. Its own research concludes that the company’s sales this year will be around one-third higher than analyst consensus estimates, with earnings landing about two-thirds higher (versus pre-Covid-19 forecasts).It’s hard to assess those claims. But it is likely that some of the number-crunchers covering Qiagen have turned their attention elsewhere following the bid. And even on the current consensus numbers, Qiagen’s 27-times-forward-earnings multiple is a discount to peers trading on substantially richer valuations.Due to Qiagen’s Dutch corporate structure, Thermo Fisher has the ability to squeeze out minorities even with relatively low acceptances, subject to the target’s approval. Davidson Kempner is strongly opposed to that being granted and wants Qiagen to drop its support of the takeover.The fact that other shareholders recently gave their assent to the squeeze-out mechanism is only evidence they want a deal to happen, and not necessarily a sign they are comfortable with this price. Davidson Kempner’s campaign looks like it has some legs.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

The investment manager, which owns a 3% stake in Qiagen, said Thermo Fisher's offer of 39 euros ($44.07) per share was not adequate as it failed to reflect Qiagen's fundamental standalone value and offered no premium for shareholders.  Thermo Fisher agreed in early March to buy Qiagen for $11.5 billion to bolster its health diagnostic business."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qiagen-shareholder-davidson-kempner-says-173736333.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-14	2020-04-14 12:16:54	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Ford Partners With Thermo Fisher And Other Manufacturers To Fight COVID-19	"Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) has announced it is helping Thermo Fisher to expand production of COVID-19 rapid testing collection kits.What Happened On Monday, Ford released a statement highlighting the measures it was taking along with various partners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The company said it was ""lending"" its manufacturing support to help Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO) expand COVID-19 test collection kits.Jim Baumbick, vice president Ford Enterprise Product Line Management, said, ""We knew that to play our part helping combat coronavirus, we had to go like hell and join forces with experts like 3M to expand production of urgently needed medical equipment and supplies.""Working with 3M Co. (NYSE: MMM) on design and testing, Ford has developed a new powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). The production of this respirator will start on Tuesday at Ford's Vreeland site near Flat Rock, Michigan. Ford can make 100,000 of these respirators.In collaboration with airbag manufacturer Joyson Safety Systems, a subsidiary of the Chinese firm Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp, Ford is making reusable gowns. These gowns are made with airbag material. The go-fast project is expected to reach a scale of 75,000 gowns a week by Sunday and scale up to 100,000 gowns by the week of April 19. It is expected that by July 4, 1.3 million gowns will have been cut and sewn.Additionally, Ford is making face maks for internal use globally and is striving to get these certified for medical use. Facemask production began earlier in the week. Why It Matters The involvement of Ford would allow Thermo Fisher to treble the number of COVID-19 test collection kits that they can deliver each week beginning April 20. Washable gowns made by Ford and its partner are vital because each gown can be washed up to 50 times and reused. More than 5,000 gowns have already been delivered to the Beaumont Health in Metro Detroit. Guidelines from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are pushing the sale and demand for facemasks in the country.Ford is also involved in the production of full-face shields for medical workers. As of Monday, the company had manufactured more than 3 million face shields in partnership with the Indian company Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (OTC: MAHMF) in India, as well as in Canada and Thailand.Price Action Ford shares traded 2.71% higher at $5.30 in the pre-market session on Tuesday. The shares had closed the regular session 3.91% lower at $5.16.See more from Benzinga  * Trump Cuts Fuel Efficiency Standards, Chastises 'Foolish' Auto Executives On Twitter  * Ford Collaborates With GE, Plans To Make 50,000 Ventilators In Michigan In 3 Months  * Tesla's Cybertruck Sets Internet Abuzz (Again) As Musk Reveals Features On Twitter(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Investors Clamor for Credit With New Deal Demand Off the Charts	(Bloomberg) -- Investors are meeting a flood of corporate debt issuance with even greater demand, a strong sign for risk appetite as issuers continue to bring new deals.YUM! Brands Inc., brought the first U.S. high-yield offering in nearly a month, boosted the size of its deal to $600 million from $500 million amid $3 billion of orders. Oracle Corp., which was downgraded by two credit raters after announcing a deal Monday, had amassed more than $50 billion in orders for what became a $20 billion offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Credit markets are showing signs of thawing, as strong reception of record investment-grade issuance has trickled into the high-yield market. While market access was initially limited to only top-notch firms like Exxon Mobil Corp. and PepsiCo Inc. just two weeks ago, investors have since gotten more comfortable with riskier names, and massive demand has cut down borrowing costs.Last week, U.S. companies borrowed a record $109 billion, met with $550 billion of demand, in what one dealer called a “food fight” for new bonds. It was a similar story in Europe, where investors placed more than 310 billion euros ($340 billion) of orders for about 75 billion euros of bonds. Asia’s dollar bond market, however, hasn’t had any issuance for several weeks.“As corporates should remain keen on retaining liquidity to weather the growing pain of lockdowns, we expect issuance windows to continue to attract issuers,” Commerzbank strategists said in a note to clients this morning.Investment-grade issuers marketed massive deals. Oracle was in the market for the first time since 2017 with a $20 billion six-part offering, with maturities ranging from five to 40 years. AB InBev’s 4.5 billion euro sale included bonds due in seven, 12 and 20 years.U.S.YUM! Brands sold the first junk bond sale since March 4, one of the most positive signs of the recovery in credit to date. The investment-grade market continues to be active, with 12 deals set to price a combined $37.175 billion.Sysco also sold a jumbo transaction with maturities ranging from five to 30 years. It’s a quick return for the company, which last sold bonds on Feb. 11Oracle’s bonds tightened 40 bps from initial talk to pricing as order books swelledFor deal updates, click here for the New Issue MonitorAirlines worldwide raised more than $17 billion in bank loans in March to shore up finances as the coronavirus grounds flights, with U.S. carriers like Delta the most activeEuropeSeven deals combined to price 10.8 billion euros, putting Europe’s primary market on a path to post 500 billion euros of quarterly sales for the first time.AB InBev, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Volkswagen AG led the calendar with multi-tranche offeringsGoldman Sachs says it’s too early to decisively say market’s have “turned the corner,” while JPMorgan says the worst has passedEuro IG company bond spreads at 241 basis points have eased slightly after reaching the highest since 2012, according to a Bloomberg Barclays index; current levels are about 35bps too wide as the market is “not properly discounting” ECB corporate bond purchases, according to ABN Amro strategistsCompanies are also heading to the loan market to shore up financial buffers, with Airbus and Daimler potentially closing at least 25 billion euros ($28 billion) of combined new loans within weeksAsiaThe Markit iTraxx Asia ex-Japan index of credit-default swaps increased about 8 basis points to around 142, according to traders; the gauge tumbled 49 basis points last week, its steepest fall on a percentage basis since 2009, according to CMA dataSpreads on Asia investment-grade dollar bonds were 5-10 basis points wider this morning, according to traders, putting them on track to widen for the first day in five; liquidity is very thin, according to one of the tradersGlobal credit is a “buyers’ market right now” for investors holding cash, according to portfolio manager Raymond Lee at Kapstream Capital. “Even high-quality, high-rated investment-grade names are trading very wide based on historicals and look like good investments”A global economic slowdown caused by virus containment steps “will trigger a default cycle in credit worldwide,” said Paul Lukaszewski, head of corporate debt for Asia and Australia at Aberdeen Standard Investments“The question for investors to assess is how severe this cycle will be compared to what is priced in,” he said, adding that the wide credit spread levels last week had reached the peaks of all prior downturns this century with the exception of the global financial crisisLocal currency markets in Asia have also been hit; the latest sign of that was in Korea, where yields have jumped:For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-market-thawing-first-junk-132130532.html?.tsrc=rss

As we noted in yesterday's Big Stock Charts, there was a technical argument that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had done so yesterday. The case is easier to make after the Dow rallied another 6.4% on Thursday.Source: Shutterstock As Barron's noted, the term &quot;bull market&quot; isn't set in stone. But the Dow, incredibly, has rallied 21.3% in just three sessions, satisfying one common definition. Add in a late-day rally Monday and the bounce nears 24%.A snapback rally in Boeing (NYSE:BA) has been a key contributor. But the S&P 500 itself has gained 18% in three days. The rally has been broad as well as steep.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem As U.S. stocks look to close what could be the best week of trading since the 1930s, optimism seems to have returned. Friday's big stock charts look to tap into that optimism. Like the market, all three stocks found support. And all three could see more upside ahead. JD.com (JD)Source: Provided by Finviz To look at the first of Friday's big stock charts, one might not even know a sell-off had occurred. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has mostly rallied through broad market declines, and there's a case that the rally should continue:  * For the most part, this simply looks like a solid chart. A broadening ascending wedge that's held since August suggests new highs are on the way. Excluding a short-lived dip, JD stock mostly has held the 50-day moving average, which can provide support going forward as well. An investor might worry about short-term resistance as a few rallies have reversed this year, but that aside it seems like JD stock should head higher.  * Fundamentally, there's a strong case. Just last week I highlighted JD stock as one of seven stocks that had survived the market carnage and could keep rallying. Shares aren't all that expensive relative to trailing earnings. China is getting back to normal. Its e-commerce market is big enough for both JD and larger rival Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).  * That said, JD probably needs this rally to hold, or at least not reverse. Trading earlier this month shows that broad market weakness can bring JD.com down with it. In-country risk remains elevated. As with the market as a whole, investors can be hopeful but they still need to mind the downside. Charter Communications (CHTR)When we highlighted Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) in Big Stock Charts almost two months ago, the chart looked fantastic while the fundamentals were questionable. Even with CHTR stock 15% cheaper, this edition of Big Stock Charts sounds much the same:  * CHTR stock managed to bounce nicely off support that held in August. Thursday's rally retook the 200-day moving average. There seems to be a path to at least the 50DMA, which suggests roughly 8% further upside.  * But the fundamentals still look questionable at this price. Charter still has to deal with the effects of cord-cutting going forward. A valuation of 23x forward earnings hardly seems cheap in that context.  * Charter has been a wonderfully-managed company as it's built out its business through acquisitions. As a result, it was one of the best stocks of the bull market: at February highs, CHTR had rallied almost 1,500% from financial crisis-era lows. After this bounce Charter stock is basically back where it was in mid-December -- and 'only' up about 1,200% from the 2009 nadir.  * For investors who believe the bounce of the last three days has gone too far, this chart can serve as Exhibit A. As steep as the decline seemed to be, there are a significant number of large-cap stocks like CHTR who now trade back where they did just months ago. Fundamentally, CHTR shows that the buying opportunity in the market as a whole might not be quite what a 30%-plus decline in major indices would suggest. Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)Source: Provided by Finviz Market bulls might see it differently, however. Those that do should take a look at the third of Friday's big stock charts, which suggests that Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) has a rally ahead:  * As with CHTR, TMO stock has seen support hold, save for a brief decline during the worst of the market panic. But it hasn't received quite the same bounce: shares are up 'just' 13% from their low (and even less looking to closing prices). There's whitespace toward moving averages which can be reached if market stability holds.  * Meanwhile, Thermo Fisher shouldn't have much, if any, real impact from pandemic fears. The life sciences supplier serves customers that have little or no macroeconomic exposure. The scramble to treat the coronavirus may cause some short-term supply chain issues, but hardly enough to drive a 17% decline from February highs.  * Again, market bulls should consider TMO here just above support. But skeptics might respond that the decline here makes more sense than it seems. Many believe that market valuations simply had run too far in February. From that perspective, the fall in TMO stock isn't an unjustified sell-off. It's a correction. And the same trend explains at least a portion of the big fall elsewhere in U.S. stocks.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

The company plans to ramp up production to 2 million by next week, and then 5 million by April.&quot;We have already about 1.5 million tests in stock. We began shipping them yesterday and today,&quot; Casper said in an interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer. &quot;But we're ramping up to about 2 million tests in production a week, and then over the course of April we'll be able to get that to about 5 million tests a week in terms of production.&quot;Thermo Fisher was one of the two companies to be granted an emergency use authorization or EUA for the coronavirus vaccine by the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration.The license allows the company's &quot;Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real-time PCR&quot; instrument to be used for COVID-19 diagnosis without it being FDA-approved, CNBC noted.Why It Matters There's a worldwide shortage of testing kits for the novel coronavirus, which is forcing health workers across the world to use triage tactics to determine who needs to be checked for the deadly virus, with priority being given to people with symptoms and relevant travel history.The widespread availability of the testing kits could help identify more cases of the coronavirus and curb the spread within communities, especially from asymptomatic cases.There's no vaccine available for the virus that has infected 182,407 people globally and killed 7,154, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.The National Institute of Health began clinical trials of Moderna Inc.'s (NASDAQ: MRNA) vaccine on Monday, and tests for Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s (NASDAQ: INO) vaccine are expected to begin in April.Price Action Thermo Fisher's shares traded 7.39% higher at $300 in the after-hours session on Monday. The stock closed the regular session 6.92% lower at $279.35 per share.See more from Benzinga  * In A First, Philippines Shuts Down All Financial Markets To Stop Coronavirus Spread  * Tech Giants' Stocks Lose T Market Value In A Single Day  * Peloton Shares Surge 16% Despite Massive Nasdaq Loss As Coronavirus Increases Demand For In-House Fitness(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-03-05	2020-03-05 12:29:02	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Jet-Setting Bankers Grounded With Virus Fears Hobbling M&A	(Bloomberg) -- Dealmaking across the world is being hampered by the spread of the coronavirus, grounding jet-setting investment bankers and threatening a decade-long boom in mergers and acquisitions.One adviser who usually flies 250,000 miles (400,000 kilometers) a year said he’s canceled all upcoming trips to Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Five transactions his firm was working on have been put on hold, including one where a member of the other party’s deal team tested positive for the virus.The volume of M&A announced through the end of February was down 27% to $419 billion, the slowest start to a year since 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In some cases, the market volatility is causing sellers to temper their price expectations. After months of on-and-off negotiations, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. agreed this week to buy Dutch medical testing firm Qiagen NV for about $10 billion.While Thermo Fisher’s offer of 39 euros per share was higher than previous proposals, according to people familiar with the matter, it was still well below the amount many analysts were expecting. The increased uncertainty “actually allowed us to transact at a price we both felt comfortable with,” Thermo Fisher Chief Executive Officer Marc Casper said in an interview Tuesday.Last-Minute CancellationsFears about the virus’s effect on the global economy have driven the S&P 500 lower in eight of the past 10 trading sessions, despite Tuesday’s emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The disease, first identified in China, has now spread to at least 76 countries and regions and resulted in nearly 3,300 total deaths.Seven & i Holdings Co., owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, scrapped plans to acquire Marathon Petroleum Corp.’s Speedway gas station business for $22 billion, people familiar with the matter said Thursday. That deal would have been the world’s biggest so far this year. The Japanese suitor decided not to proceed due to concerns over valuations, with the coronavirus outbreak one of the factors that impacted negotiations, one of the people said. Another management team running a multibillion-dollar auction process decided it was better to lose a potential bidder than risk meeting a team from China -- with appointments canceled while planes were already in the air. In another instance, an U.S. industrial firm looking to buy an asset in China put the $1 billion-plus deal on pause because the buyer didn’t want to proceed without a site visit and on-the-ground management meetings.Some effects have been even more extreme. One adviser found himself quarantined twice after trips to Hong Kong and then Italy, which has the most cases in Europe. Still, the forced isolation might not have made much difference to his schedule -- he said most corporate clients aren’t keen to meet anyone face-to-face, hindering their ability to pitch deals or conduct sensitive negotiations.Contingency PlanningThe coronavirus “has the possibility of creating a shock that triggers economic softness,” said Cary Kochman, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Citigroup Inc. “That could be an enormous inhibitor to deals in the short term,” he said, even though other M&A fundamentals remain unchanged.Contingency planning is also making its way into merger agreements. Sellers are now adding exclusions for the potential impact of the virus to avoid bidders citing a disease outbreak for changing the terms or bailing from an agreement, one adviser said. Morgan Stanley’s $14.5 billion acquisition of E*Trade Financial Corp. specifies that any risks related to the outbreak are already factored into the price. E*Trade shares have fallen almost 18% since the deal was announced amid the selloff.The travel restrictions are proving particularly tough for companies in the middle of an initial public offering, when executives and advisers typically hit the road to market shares to potential investors in person. Listings by Chinese companies, which raised a combined $3.6 billion on U.S. exchanges last year, are likely to tail off. Twenty-five such candidates are currently on file with U.S. exchanges, including CloundMinds Inc., an automation company backed by SoftBank Group Corp., and car-loans provider Meili Auto Holdings Ltd.Warner Music, Cole HaanWarner Music Group Corp. and retailer Cole Haan LLC have both pushed back the launch of their listings, people with knowledge of their plans said. While some advisers are telling companies with an IPO on file to wait out the turmoil, that could come with its own risks as reduced retail footfall hits earnings and share sales risk slipping closer to the U.S. election in November.“There’s a tremendous backlog of really strong businesses, but the volatility in the market makes it very difficult for investors to price it,” Kristin Declark, co-head of equity capital markets at Barclays Plc, said in a Bloomberg TV interview.“I don’t think we’ll see a return of IPOs until we start to see the VIX stabilize,” she said, referring to the Chicago Board of Options Exchange Volatility Index.One company that bucked that trend is Canadian waste management company GFL Environmental Inc., which took advantage of Monday’s temporary respite from the rout to price shares in its IPO a day early. The stock slid in its trading debut in New York Tuesday, closing at $16.80 -- 12% below its $19 IPO price.‘Move On’“Today was a good day in the market,” Raymond Svider, the chairman of GFL-backer BC Partners, said Monday after the stock priced. “It would make absolutely no sense to take another day of volatility. It’s better to price, get it done tonight and move on.”Despite the uncertainty and travel limitations, one big event on the M&A calendar is still going ahead -- at least at the moment.The Annual Tulane Corporate Law Institute, a get-together of lawyers, bankers and proxy solicitors in New Orleans, kicks off Thursday, just a week after the city’s Mardi Gras celebrations. In an official communication confirming that the conference was on, the organizers had some advice for old friends and contacts greeting each other at Wednesday night’s welcome parties.“We would not be surprised if many attendees choose not to shake hands (apparently elbow-bumps are in fashion),” they wrote.(Updates with collapse of Speedway talks in sixth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Aaron Kirchfeld, Ed Hammond, Kiel Porter, Kristen V.

2020-03-03	2020-03-03 12:39:30	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Coronavirus Tester Gets $10 Billion of Good News	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For a company that develops coronavirus tests, it can’t be much of a surprise that somebody wants to buy the entire business.  European diagnostics group Qiagen NV on Tuesday accepted a 9 billion-euro ($10 billion) takeover offer from a larger U.S. peer, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. The timing makes sense for both sides, but the seller looks to be on the better side of the deal.Qiagen extracts DNA and proteins from biological samples and makes them ready for analysis. The coronavirus, and bid speculation, has made it a favored stock lately. Last year was different. The shares plunged after an October profit warning and news that the chief executive officer was stepping down. An initial approach from Thermo Fisher sent them higher in November, but those talks failed and the stock crashed just before the end of the year.Now the pair have agreed an all-cash deal at 39 euros a share. Given the recent market turmoil, benchmarking that price is tricky. The 23% premium to Monday’s close rises to a more reasonable and fair 32% when compared to the price before the first set of talks last year. It starts to look expensive if you consider that the offer is 70% above Qiagen’s recent low. But the price is similar to where the Qiagen shares were trading after last year’s talks emerged — it’s clearly in the ballpark of what investors were seeking.Qiagen brings growth. Revenue is forecast to increase at an average annual rate of 6% over the next four years. What’s more, Thermo Fisher has identified cost savings and revenue synergies worth $200 million after the deal closes, implying total acquired operating profit would be worth about $780 million based on 2023 forecasts.In absolute terms, however, Thermo is paying up for this boost. Adjust for tax and the stream of profits from Qiagen still represents only a 5% return on the full $11.5 billion acquisition cost (which includes assumed net debt). With Qiagen’s cost of capital estimated at 7%, Thermo Fisher needs to achieve something better. Capitalized at $122 billion, it may be able afford to pay such a full price for a deal this size. Even so, it has its work cut out to generate good returns.Thermo Fisher could well accelerate Qiagen’s business much faster than its initial projections suggest. Even leaving aside the increased demand for diagnostic testing kits as a result of the coronavirus this year, the pairing offers the usual benefits of health-care mergers: eliminating duplicate research and development and using each other’s distribution networks.Qiagen has got a buyer on the hook after a difficult period with no permanent CEO and lingering investor doubts over its strategy. The deal shows that even with that backdrop, bargains in health-care M&A are hard to find.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

2020-03-03	2020-03-03 10:59:55	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Thermo to Buy Qiagen for $10 Billion in 2020’s Top Health Deal	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. laboratory equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. agreed to buy Qiagen NV, a Dutch maker of tests for diseases including cancer and the new coronavirus, for about 9 billion euros ($10 billion) in the biggest health-care acquisition so far this year.Investors will get 39 euros in cash for every Qiagen share, Thermo Fisher said Tuesday. That’s 23% higher than Monday’s closing price. Qiagen also sells products for food and forensic testing. Bloomberg earlier reported the companies were nearing a deal after reviving discussions that broke off late last year.The purchase would rank as one of Thermo Fisher’s largest after the company spent $13.6 billion for Life Technologies Corp. to gain DNA-testing capabilities in 2014. Deals have heated up in the industry after a slow start to the year, with this coming one day after Gilead Sciences Inc. agreed to buy Forty Seven Inc. for about $4.9 billion to advance into cancer treatments.Qiagen shares surged as much as 22% in Frankfurt, the biggest gain in almost two decades. Thermo Fisher said the purchase will boost its earnings per share immediately after the deal is closed, which is expected in the first half of 2021. The company expects synergies of $200 million in the third year after completion.Thermo Fisher will assume 1.26 billion euros in net debt, and it will finance the purchase through cash, bridge financing and new debt.When a new coronavirus emerged out of China in January, Qiagen got to work on a test to detect the virus in bodily fluids. The test is now being evaluated at four hospitals in China and one in France. The diagnostic gives results in about one hour.Qiagen’s stock took a hit last October as Chief Executive Officer Peer Schatz announced he would step down after 15 years at the helm and the Dutch company slashed its forecast for quarterly sales growth.The testing company started exploring options after receiving approaches from several possible buyers, then ended them in December, saying the proposals weren’t compelling enough. Qiagen said its board backs the Thermo Fisher transaction.JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are advising Thermo Fisher.

The fact that this is an election year surely sticks in traders' minds. If you remember back to the 2016 election cycle, biotech shares went into a brutal downturn after Hillary Clinton castigated the pharma industry for its pricing practices. Shares of healthcare stocks eventually recovered as it became clear that the Trump Administration had bigger fish to fry than going after drug prices.But now the cycle has begun again. Several Democratic candidates are proposing dramatic changes to the American healthcare industry to try to curb runaway drug prices. It seems likely that if re-elected, President Trump would probably need to tackle the issue again as well, as the system left in place from the Affordable Care Act needs modifications. This is a problem for investors. It's hard to forecast future profits when it's not clear what the playing field will look like within a couple years.  * 7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Set for Growth As such, it's a good time to take stock of your personal exposure to the healthcare industry before the presidential election heats up and potential market-moving headlines start pouring in. To that end, in general, companies with diversified revenue streams will fare better, while ones relying on a few high-priced drugs face more risk. Here are the outlooks for seven leading biotech, pharma and healthcare stocks in light of the potential pressures on drug prices going forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Healthcare Stocks to Watch: Amarin (AMRN)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Amarin (NASDAQ:AMRN) offers a great example of the questions around drug pricing going forward. It recently scored Food and Drug Administration approval to market its fish oil product, Vascepa, to a much wider range of adults with high triglycerides. That should be a huge win for Amarin, right? The stock initially popped to multi-year highs, but slumped back to prior levels quickly.This week, Amarin stock dropped even farther, and it's now down 25% from its recent highs. The latest catalyst is that leading health insurance firm UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) reportedly dropped Amarin's Vascepa from its preferred authorization list. UnitedHealth offers Lovaza, the fish oil product initially commercialized by GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), instead. Lovaza also aims to improve heart condition outcomes by lowering triglycerides. Unlike Vascepa, however, Lovaza doesn't have such a wide body of clinical trials supporting its efficacy.Nonetheless, insurance companies like UnitedHealth might think that one fish oil product is similar to another, and may pick the cheaper one for its customers. It shows the difficulty pharma companies are having as more attention turns to price. With increased attention to drug prices from both the private sector and the government, companies that offer a slightly better version of an existing drug should be careful.Amarin is a great example of how FDA approval doesn't necessarily translate into strong demand or profits in the current economic environment. AMRN stock still has plenty of potential upside, particularly in a buyout scenario. But it isn't the slam dunk winner it might have been five or ten years ago. Novo Nordisk (NVO)Source: joreks / Shutterstock.com Unlike the previous example, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) has a safer route to profits in this regulatory environment. That is to produce drugs that are clearly best-in-class, and sell lots of them at affordable prices. Novo Nordisk does this by selling insulin and other diabetes treatments.Given the growing diabetes epidemic around the world, Novo Nordisk is riding a huge demographic tide. And it's significantly harder for health insurers to say no to Novo Nordisk with its vitally important medications. Novo stock has traded up recently; however, it's still at a reasonable 21x forward earnings given its historic near-double digit earnings-per-share growth rate.  * 7 Low-Risk Mutual Funds to Buy Now On top of that, Novo Nordisk stock is still only trading at where it previously peaked back in 2015. While earnings and dividends have grown nicely over the past five years, the company's stock hasn't yet caught up to its recent growth. Once the stock breaks out over $60 and hits all-time highs, however, it should pick up more momentum. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com One way to lower your political risk, as it comes to drug prices is to run a supremely diversified business. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) manages to do that by having three different operations within the parent corporation. These include consumer products, medical devices and pharmaceutical drugs.Consumer products generally don't fall under the FDA's purview and aren't hurt by pressure on drug prices. Insurance efforts to crack down healthcare pricing could hurt medical device margins, but it's a bit of a different animal than drugs.J&J still has drug pricing exposure to be certain, pharmaceuticals are its large division by a wide margin when it comes to profit. But the two other embedded lines of business lower risk; meanwhile, J&J's drug portfolio is one of the most broadly diversified ones out there. JNJ stock has traded up a bit recently, but it's still selling for just 16x forward earnings. Combine that with its unparalleled record of dividend growth, and J&J is a conservative way to get your dose of healthcare exposure. AbbVie (ABBV)Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com AbbVie (NASDAQ:ABBV) is the pharma spin-off from healthcare and medical devices leader Abbott (NYSE:ABT). Abbott seems to have made a wise move in spinning off AbbVie. Since the companies parted ways, Abbott's stock has more than doubled, while AbbVie has had a more difficult road.This makes sense. AbbVie inherited a complicated situation. Its blockbuster drug, Humira, currently makes up two-thirds of its overall revenues. However, Humira is set to face generic competition shortly, with its profits likely to head off the patent cliff by 2023. It's unclear if AbbVie will be able to make up the revenue gap that it will soon face.It intends to do so via its upcoming mega-merger with Allergan (NYSE:AGN). Allergan is famous for Botox, and it has numerous other products in the aesthetics space, along with other drugs for things such as eye care and womens' health. AbbVie hopes that merging with Allergan will diversify its revenue stream enough to withstand the loss of Humira revenues. However, it is taking on a ton of debt to do this deal. And it's not clear that Allergan, which had a similar business model to the now infamous Valeant, will fare well in a world with more drug pricing pressure.  * 10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers A lot of folks own AbbVie for the generous 5.3% dividend yield. But it's far from certain whether the Allergan purchase will be enough to sustain the dividend at that elevated level. Particularly if drug pricing pressures increase, that dividend could be on the chopping block in coming years. I'm a seller of ABBV stock here. Gilead Sciences (GILD)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) could fare better than most other biotech companies in a challenging drug pricing market. There are several reasons for that. For one, GILD stock has already been one of the biggest losers of the past few years within biotech, so expectations are already low.Second, Gilead has seen its profits fall because its Hepatitis C products actually cure patients, rather than merely treat symptoms. A Bloomberg article noted the unfortunate situation, saying that Wall Street Wants The Best Patents, Not The Best Drugs. The author concluded that Gilead had a &quot;bad business model&quot; because curing diseases &quot;just doesn't pay.&quot; That is, unfortunately, a seemingly accurate assessment of the current healthcare system.With an increased focus on pricing and getting the most bang for the buck, however, companies like Gilead should be more attractive to insurers and other end payers. Folks are increasingly sick of pharma companies jacking up prices for drugs that are only fractionally better than the previous version. Gilead hasn't played the same milking their patents for the most bucks game, and instead brought revolutionary products to market. After years of sorry stock price performance, however, Gilead may finally get its chance to shine in 2020. Thermo-Fisher Scientific (TMO)Source: Shutterstock Thermo-Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) has quietly become one of the largest healthcare companies in the U.S., with its market capitalization now exceeding $125 billion. It has also been one of the strongest performers in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLV). With minimal volatility along the way, Thermo-Fisher shares have nearly tripled since early 2016.Their secret is that they are the proverbial company selling shovels to the gold miners. That's to say that Thermo Fisher sells lab equipment, pharmaceutical components, diagnostic tools and the like. Companies that want to create new pharma drugs, along with many other healthcare applications, have to buy raw materials from Thermo Fisher.  * 7 Best Vanguard ETFs for 2020 Lower drug prices might smack profits for biotech companies. But a firm like Thermo Fisher is insulated. Its components are a small portion of the overall price of healthcare products and services. Additionally, it has other customers, such as governments and academic institutions, that buy from it as well. As long as the world continues to spend more on healthcare research and diagnostics in the coming years, Thermo Fisher should be a safe bet to keep on rallying. The stock isn't dirt cheap at 24x forward earnings, but it's not a bad deal for a company that has much less regulatory/pricing risk than most biotech and pharma companies. Cardinal Health (CAH)Source: Shutterstock Finally, we have the drug distribution companies. While there are various firms in this category, let's use Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) as our representative stock, as Cardinal has been a popular dividend play and turnaround pick for 2020. And, to be sure, Cardinal has a great track record, including being a Dividend Aristocrat, which means that it has hiked its dividend more than 25 years in a row.I can't get on board with the bullish sentiment for this stock now, however. If you were looking for firms directly in the crosshairs of upcoming changes in drug prices, drug distributors would be right there. It's not clear what role, if any, these companies would even have in a Medicare For All world where the government controlled the supply chain.For the longest-time, the thesis on these companies has been that U.S. healthcare spending will inevitably rise as the population ages. That's been a good bet so far. But now U.S. spending per capita is far above levels seen in just about every other developed country. It seems healthcare and in particular drug prices are reaching a limit, and betting on middlemen like Cardinal to keep getting more profits over time might not be a wise move anymore. People have been buying the stock on expectations that the drug distributors will be able to handle their opoiod lawsuit obligations at a modest cost.

2019-12-23	2019-12-23 13:03:59	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Wait for a Pullback Before Buying Danaher Stock	Danaher (NYSE:DHR) stock is up nearly 48% in 2019. Even in a year in which just owning the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) made investors a solid gain of 28%, Danaher has vastly outperformed the market.But can Danaher continue its success in 2020? The past performance of Danaher indicates that the shares are a solid buy, but does that indicate they are a great investment today? Source: Shutterstock Danaher stock is one of Wall Street's greatest conglomerate stories. Its success is due to Danaher's management philosophy (the &quot;Danaher Business System&quot;, or DBS). Always on the prowl for &quot;bolt-on&quot; acquisitions, Danaher acquires companies in its target industries and uses DBS to make them more profitable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis playbook has paid off big time for Danaher stock. But after its recent purchase of General Electric's (NYSE:GE) Biopharma division, can Danaher repeat its magic?Despite its high valuation,  Danaher stock may be a great defensive play if the runaway bull market starts to taper off. Let's dive in and see what's in store for DHR in 2020.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2020  The Secret of DHR's SuccessDanaher stock has a strong track record. While not as well-known as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A BRK-B), Danaher has outperformed Berkshire in the past five years. Danaher's five-year cumulative return (excluding dividends) is 130%, versus 48.1% for Berkshire.In contrast to Berkshire's &quot;hands-off&quot; approach, Danaher has won big by actively improving the performance of its subsidiaries. After its success in more old-line industrial businesses, Danaher in recent years has pivoted towards high-tech industries. It is now focused on diagnostics, environmental, and life sciences companies.Furthermore, Danaher has begun making big acquisitions as opposed to smaller transactions. In recent years, DHR has acquired Beckman Coulter, Pall, and other large enterprises. The $21.4 billion purchase of GE's Biopharma unit is a continuation of that trend. Will GE's Biopharma Unit Move The Needle?As InvestorPlace columnist Josh Enomoto pointed out in his Dec. 13 article, DHR's acquisition of GE's Biopharma unit has been the key driver of Danaher stock this year. Since 2018, DHR has had so-so top-line and bottom line growth. But in the wake of this deal, Danaher could deliver stronger earnings growth in 2020.For next year, analysts, on average,  expect the company's earnings per share to climb 16.7% to $5.50.However, this growth could already be priced into Danaher stock. Danaher trades at 27 times the average 2020 earnings estimate and has an enterprise value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio of 23.7. Its peer, Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO), trades for a similar EBITDA multiple  of 22.6. But TMO's forward P/E ratio of 23.7 is cheaper than that of Danaher stock.The high valuation of Danaher stock is no accident. The company's movement towards Life Sciences has raised the multiple of Danaher stock. If DHR had stayed a purely industrial conglomerate like Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW), Danaher's shares would probably be trading closer to ITW's 16.3 times EBITDA and forward P/E ratio of 22.4.As a result of Danaher's high valuation, I don't anticipate the shares making another big move in 2020. But I do think Danaher stock will stay steady,  as long as DHR meets analysts' average expectations. But the company is also facing some risks. Danaher Stock Could Be a Defensive PlayDHR stock is just a few dollars off its all-time high of $154.98 per share. Investors remain highly confident in the stock market, and Wall Street is bullish that this decade's economic strength will spill into 2020.However, things can look rosy before they turn bad. Things can always turn on a dime. In the midst of a frothy market, paying high multiples for stocks doesn't look like a smart call.Danaher stock trades at a high multiple. But its shares are fairly priced. And the stock could continue to perform well in tough times, since Danaher primarily owns companies in defensive industries. That means those businesses could perform well  in a recession.DHR stock won't necessarily skyrocket during a recession. But during a correction, its shares should show greater stability  than more speculative high-fliers.The only wild card is the recent Biopharma acquisition. If Danaher faces headwinds applying DBS to its newest unit, expect Danaher stock to move lower as investors lose confidence in Danaher's magic. Wait for a Pullback Before Buying Danaher StockDriven by the Biopharma deal, DHR stock has been on fire in 2019. But at the shares' current valuation, the opportunity from the deal appears to be priced into the stock. Yet, thanks to the company's exposure to defensive industries, I don't expect the shares to dive during a stock-market correction.The best move may be to wait for such a correction. If DHR drops, investors can buy Danaher stock at a very affordable price. Barring material changes, DHR should rise meaningfully over the long-term. But waiting for a lower entry point could maximize investors' long-term returns.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Thermo Fisher Considers Buying $8 Billion Diagnostics Firm Qiagen	(Bloomberg) -- Qiagen NV shares jumped the most in 17 years after people with knowledge of the matter said Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is considering a takeover of the molecular testing firm.Thermo Fisher has approached the Dutch company about a potential purchase that could become one of its biggest-ever acquisitions, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Shares of Qiagen rose 13% to 33.20 euros at 1:10 p.m. in Frankfurt, giving it a market value of $8.3 billion. There’s no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, and other bidders for Qiagen could emerge, the people said. Thermo Fisher shares rose 1.4% to $300.02 at the close of New York trading on Wednesday, valuing it at more than $120 billion.The potential transaction could become one of Thermo Fisher’s largest purchases, surpassing its $5 billion takeover of drug-ingredient maker Patheon NV in 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its largest acquisition was its $15 billion purchase of Life Technologies Corp. in 2014, the data show.Deal PipelineQiagen spokesman Thomas Theuringer declined to comment, citing company policy. The company serves doctors, researchers and others with molecular-testing platforms that can extract and analyze people’s DNA and RNA. The company emerged from university research and has grown in recent years amid the boom in genetic testing.Representatives for Thermo Fisher, based in Waltham, Massachusetts, couldn’t immediately comment.U.K. scientific measurement testing company LGC Group also has attracted sale interest. The private equity firm Cinven has teamed up with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority to weigh a joint bid for the KKR & Co.-backed company, people familiar with the matter have said.Leadership ChangeThermo Fisher Chief Executive Officer Marc Casper told analysts last month he feels “great” about the company’s mergers and acquisitions pipeline, which “continues to be very active.”Qiagen CEO Peer Schatz announced last month that he will step down after 27 years at the company, saying it’s time to bring in new leadership. Senior Vice President Thierry Bernard will act as interim CEO until a permanent successor is found. The company also cut its quarterly estimate for sales growth, sending its shares plunging the most in 17 years.Top medical device makers have the capacity to take on additional debt to finance acquisitions, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Last year, Thermo Fisher rival Medtronic Plc agreed to buy the shares it doesn’t already own in Mazor Robotics Ltd. in a deal valuing the company at about $1.6 billion.(Updates share move in first two paragraphs.)&#92;--With assistance from Aaron Kirchfeld and Tim Loh.To contact the reporters on this story: Ed Hammond in New York at ehammond12@bloomberg.net;Dinesh Nair in London at dnair5@bloomberg.net;Nabila Ahmed in New York at nahmed54@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Scent at bscent@bloomberg.net, ;Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Eric PfannerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-considers-buying-8-222207193.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-01	2019-10-01 17:52:29	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Investors Binge on Record $308 Billion of Company Bond Sales	(Bloomberg) -- Companies globally sold a record amount of bonds in September as investors hungry for yield poured into debt, betting that major central banks can keep the global economy out of a recession and the worst can be avoided in the U.S.-China trade war.Firms from Apple Inc. to France’s Orange and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. sold more than $308 billion of notes, the first time ever that corporate issuance has topped the $300 billion mark in a month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales globally this year are on track to exceed the equivalent of $2 trillion at the fastest pace ever.The onslaught of investment-grade deals in the U.S. may ease to about $200 billion in the last quarter as tight spreads potentially make investors more cautious and they position for 2020, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said. Pacific Investment Management Co. said last month that it is “cautious” on corporate credit, and favors short-dated names and those that are less likely to default.“To the extent that new issuance is credit enhancing -- refinancing and or extending the maturities of its debt -- then the issuance is good for the companies as well the current bondholders,” said Todd Schubert, head of fixed-income research at Bank of Singapore Ltd. “Many of the issues that I have seen fall under this category.”‘Massive Snowball’ Effect to Spur China Bond Defaults AbroadEuropean surgeIn Europe, corporate bond sales have already set a full-year record with three months still left to go. Year-to-date investment-grade euro corporate bond issuance reached 582 billion euros ($636 billion) Tuesday, beating full-year totals dating back to at least 2014, Bloomberg data show. The tally includes 94.5 billion euros of September deals, well above a previous 90.3 billion euros record set in January.U.S. borrowers such as Medtronic Plc and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. have sold a market-leading 68 billion euros of bonds this year, partly to refinance costlier dollar debt. That tally is set to go even higher, with computer maker Dell Technologies Inc meeting investors from today for a planned debut sale of euro bonds, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified citing company policy.“Fifty billion euros-plus is easily achievable in the final quarter, even if the markets generally start to wobble in the face of macro and/or geopolitical event risk,“ said Suki Mann, founder of Creditmarketdaily.com, in a note to clients. He believes treasury desks are likely to “opportunistically pre-fund obligations which might not be maturing for another twelve months.”U.S. RecordsSeptember’s new U.S. investment-grade debt supply reached $158 billion, making it the third-largest month ever for issuance. It was a month for the record books: an unprecedented 130 issuers tapped debt capital markets after a frenzied start that made the first week the busiest market participants had seen in their careers.The market’s ability to digest the supply boom was just as notable as the sheer volume of borrowers that came to market. Global demand for higher-yielding U.S. corporate debt underpinned sales, and investment-grade spreads closed about 5 basis points tighter over the course of September, finishing at 115 basis points over Treasuries Monday.Risks have caught up with more borrowers recently, though. Corporate defaults in 2019 worldwide already match those in 2018, with 82 globally this year, S&P Global Ratings said on Sept. 26.Still, with the global economy seen growing at or just below 3%, a lack of clear direction in U.S. interest rates, and a possible pause in U.S.-China trade tensions, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects the search for yield among investors to continue. Those factors are supportive of the bank’s preference for high-yield bonds over investment grade in Asia, it said in a report Friday.(Updates with U.S. September supply details from eighth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Brian Smith, Claire Boston and Michael Gambale.To contact the reporters on this story: Finbarr Flynn in Tokyo at fflynn3@bloomberg.net;Hannah Benjamin in London at hbenjamin1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Andrew Monahan at amonahan@bloomberg.net, ;Vivianne Rodrigues at vrodrigues3@bloomberg.net, Beth ThomasFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-binge-record-308-billion-051608451.html?.tsrc=rss

Powerful microscopes allow OHSU scientists to push the bounds of biology	Now that we know what it looks like, we can build on it with a more holistic view of how it works, and that’s important in developing more effective therapeutic drugs,” said Show-Ling Shyng, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the OHSU School of Medicine.  Cryo-electron microscopy allows scientists to study cells, viruses and the structure of molecules in near-atomic detail, improving the understanding disease mechanisms and informing the rational design of new and better therapies.  OHSU acquired a top-of-the-line cryo-electron microscope in 2013, followed by a smaller model in 2017.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f438840b-c77e-39f4-a3cb-3cd1e4fbdf8e/powerful-microscopes-allow.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-06	2019-09-06 07:53:34	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	Thermo Fisher, Danaher Among Firms Eyeing KKR's LGC	(Bloomberg) -- KKR & Co.’s potential sale of British scientific measurement and testing company LGC Group has attracted initial interest from suitors including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Danaher Corp., people familiar with the matter said.Blackstone Group Inc., Carlyle Group LP, CVC Capital Partners and EQT Partners are also weighing offers for the business, the people said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are private. LGC could fetch more than $2 billion including debt in a sale, the people said.Suitors expect KKR to send out a so-called information memorandum later this month with preliminary information on the business, the people said.LGC helps test whether foods contain allergens or if racing greyhounds have been doping. The company generates annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $150 million after factoring in its recent acquisitions, the people said.Deliberations are at an early stage, and there’s no certainty the suitors will proceed with firm bids, the people said. Representatives for Blackstone, CVC, EQT, KKR and Thermo Fisher declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Carlyle said she couldn’t immediately comment, while representatives for Danaher didn’t respond to requests for comment.KKR is working with advisers as it looks for ways to exit its holding in the business, which it bought in 2016, people familiar with the process said previously. The company has made a number of acquisitions since the buyout firm’s investment.In August, LGC bought a majority stake in Toronto Research Chemicals, a firm that makes chemicals used in reference standards and research. That deal followed its September 2018 acquisition of reagents maker Berry & Associates.LGC traces its origins to 1842 to a body created in London to regulate tobacco adulteration. It still provides independent chemical and bioanalytical measurements. Previously known as Laboratory of the Government Chemist, the firm was privatized in 1996.&#92;--With assistance from Kristen V.

Finding those patients will require widespread adoption of sophisticated tests that look for multiple genetic alterations that could be driving the cancer.

2019-08-06	2019-08-06 13:32:33	TMO	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.	4 Nanotech Stocks to Watch for Explosive Innovation	[Editor's note: &quot;4 Nanotech Stocks to Watch for Explosive Innovation&quot; was previously published in August 2018. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]Within the broad and rapidly expanding technology sector, nanotechnology offers perhaps the most profound potential impact for society. On a purely scientific level, nanotech involves any innovation conducted at the nanoscale, which is between one to 100 nanometers. As this technology is perfected, it opens up the door to previously impossible mechanisms, making nanotech stocks a must-watch category.But what's behind this innovation? Physicist Richard Feynman, during a lecture in December 1959, introduced the concept that future technologies would enable scientists to &quot;manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules.&quot; Over a decade later, professor Norio Taniguchi coined the term nanotechnology. However, it took substantial advancements in microscopic platforms before scientists could begin practical experimentations.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOnce they did, the positive implications from nanotech integration became readily apparent. According to Nano.gov, 25.4 million nanometers can &quot;fit&quot; inside an inch. A single sheet from a typical newspaper is approximately 100,000 nanometers thick.This tech and its astonishing scale will clearly set the pathway towards the next generation of super-computers. But this innovation reaches much further than that. With the ability to manipulate individual atoms, healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry can finally move beyond researching diseases, and towards their complete elimination.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now Without question, nanotech stocks have the capacity to deliver enormous gains. Here are four examples to keep a close eye on. Nanotech Stocks to Watch: IBM (IBM)Source: Shutterstock I know exactly what you're thinking. With nanotech stocks representing the cutting edge in scientific innovations, why mention a legacy institution like IBM (NYSE:IBM)? It's a fair point. However, IBM is actually synonymous with this innovation. To not include IBM would be a crime against intellectual honesty.Primarily, &quot;Big Blue&quot; invented the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 that allowed researchers unprecedented access to individual atoms and molecules. As Nano.gov confirms, the invention of this highly-specialized microscope catapulted the nanotech industry. Without it, scientists could only theorize about this concept.But what I appreciate about IBM as a viable opportunity among nanotech stocks is its fundamental stability. True, shares haven't performed the way investors would have liked in recent years. But this is a company that we can trust will be around in the next 50 to 100 years.Moreover, management is shifting away from its legacy businesses towards sectors that are relevant today. Whether we're talking nanotech, artificial intelligence or the blockchain, IBM has it covered. Plus, it currently offers a dividend yield of 4.6%. Nanotech Stocks to Watch: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)Source: Shutterstock Semiconductor companies have recently struggled with the harsh realities of Moore's Law. This is &quot;a principle that states gains in CPU performance sharply declines once technology passes a critical maturation point.&quot;Obvious, semiconductors will continue to make strides. However, each dollar invested provides an increasingly smaller performance return. In prior generations, it was thought that a limit could be reached on how small a chip can get.The nanotech industry proved that we still have room to push the dimensional envelope further. As one of the top nanotech stocks within this sector, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is certainly a must-watch name.The challenge with most direct nanotech stocks is that they're incredibly speculative. TSM has a proven history of success. Of course, you pay for that privilege in its current share price, so upside potential is comparatively limited. Still, I like the idea of not getting completely wiped out.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now  Nanotech Stocks to Watch: Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)Source: Shutterstock When discussing nanotech stocks, a tendency exists to focus only on computers and electronics. Though they definitely can advantage the technology's performance and productivity output, they're not the only beneficiaries. With the ability to dive deeper into molecular structures, the biotech industry could likely generate the most meaningful impact.That's why investors should take a long look at Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO). As a medical diagnostics and research specialist, Thermo Fisher provides biotech and healthcare firms of all sizes with necessary equipment. As nanotech concepts increasingly transition from theory into reality, TMO is on the ground floor distributing these applied-science products.Better yet, TMO is an established, stable investment. On a year-to-date basis, TMO stock has gained 20%. Over the trailing five years, shares have returned over 100%. As with the other industry stalwarts, you pay for the privilege. But Thermo Fisher is unlikely to leave you hanging. Nanotech Stocks to Watch: Nanometrics (NANO)Source: Shutterstock Smaller, more powerful semiconductors and related electronic devices are only part of the nanotech story. At some point, we need companies that can drill down into the minutiae to perform assessment and quality-control operations. This is where Nanometrics (NASDAQ:NANO) comes into play.As a specialist in metrology, or the scientific study of measurements, Nanometrics develops the components used in semiconductor and solid-state device fabrication. Their platforms also dramatically improve manufacturing productivity while maintaining accuracy and precision.Sentiment has improved dramatically this year after some choppy performances in years past. NANO stock is up over 67% since January's opener.Those who are looking for a discounted opportunity may be somewhat disappointed with NANO's dramatic rise. However, the lift is fundamentally justified. Nanometrics features an exceptionally robust balance sheet, with highlights being zero debt and steadily rising cash. That gives management an extra cushion for future product investments.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now Furthermore, NANO maintains strong profitability margins and above-average revenue growth. Recent outperformance in sales suggests more upside remaining for NANO stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Thermo Fisher shares fall as Goldman downgrades to neutral; Agilent added to conviction list	Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. shares  slid 1.9% Monday, after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to neutral from buy on valuation grounds. Goldman removed Thermo Fisher from its Americas Conviction List and added Agilent Technologies Inc. , which it now deems its top pick in life science tools and diagnostics. Agilent shares rose 0.5%. &quot;We see this as an opportunistic time to make the switch to A given the set-up and valuation, with Agilent providing a rare Tools opportunity to own an accelerating growth story at a reasonable valuation with untapped capital allocation upside that could potentially be unlocked by the new CFO in our view,&quot; analysts wrote in a note. On Thermo, &quot;we believe our thesis for deal-driven accelerating growth and margin expansion has been more appropriately reflected in valuation while the company faces a difficult set of comps starting in 4Q18,&quot; they wrote. Goldman is still positive on the fundamentals of both companies, and expects beats and raises in the next few quarter. Analysts raised their stock price target for Agilent to $82 from $77, but kept its stock price target for Thermo at $250. Thermo shares have gained 29% since they were added to Goldman&apos;s Conviction List. Shares have gained 25% in 2018, while Agilent has gained 3.3%.

The finding, presented at the American Society of Clinical  Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago, followed a genetic analysis  of 15,000 tumor samples from 50 different cancer types looking  for glitches known as high microsatellite instability (MSI-H).  Patients with colorectal and endometrial cancers are  routinely tested for MSI-H to screen for Lynch syndrome, which  occurs in about 1 in 300 people in the United States or about 3  percent of all cases of colorectal cancer.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gene-sequencing-study-finds-cancers-113000743.html?.tsrc=rss

Designed as an accessory for existing Thermo Scientific Nicolet FTIR spectrometers, the new device directs an infrared beam to a mechanical arm, which can rotate from -5 degree to 95 degree angles.  The device stores the images of those samples, which are then analyzed with a Thermo Scientific software system.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/651927fb-cddb-3653-912e-b5f6801af7a4/thermo-fisher%26apos%3Bs-madison.html?.tsrc=rss
