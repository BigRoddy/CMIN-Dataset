2021-05-11	2021-05-11 22:18:03	MMM	3M Company	Palantir Rallies on Sales Forecast, Embrace of Bitcoin	(Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc. expects sales to grow 43% in the second quarter, showing new distribution deals are putting its data analysis software into the hands of more customers.Revenue will reach $360 million in the period ending in June, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Shares gained 9.4% to close at $20.21 in New York.With more cash flowing in, the Denver-based company said it’s embracing a newer form of currency: Bitcoin. Palantir accepts customer payments in Bitcoin and is debating whether to use company cash to purchase the asset, Chief Financial Officer David Glazer said on a conference call with analysts. Such a move would follow similar ones by Square Inc. and Tesla Inc., which helped drive a surge in Bitcoin prices.The results provided some signs of encouragement after a prolonged slump for the company. At the close of trading Monday, the shares had reached their lowest point in almost six months, reflecting a sharp turn away from technology stocks by investors worldwide over concerns about inflation.Co-founders Peter Thiel and Alex Karp started Palantir with a focus on providing tools and consulting to the U.S. and allied governments. Palantir has overhauled its software in recent years to court more businesses and lower prices for customers.The company has placed a great deal of emphasis on growth, which shows in the results. In the first quarter, revenue increased 49% to $341 million, beating estimates.However, Palantir said compensation costs ballooned, contributing to a loss in the first quarter that was wider than expected. The loss was 7 cents a share as stock-based compensation more than tripled in the period that ended in March.Palantir said it signed 11 new commercial customers during the quarter and invested in two customers with long term potential: Sarcos Robotics and aviation startup Lilium. Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said both companies built operations around Palantir’s Foundry software “from day zero.” “Manufacturing is a huge focus for us and one of deep strength,” he said.New customers, including Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration, drove first-quarter sales, along with expanded agreements with existing customers such as 3M Co., BP Plc and the mining company Rio Tinto Plc.Palantir expanded its small sales team during the previous quarter, bringing on 50 sales people, and struck partnerships with International Business Machines Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. to re-sell its technology and with Amazon.com Inc.’s Web Services to support it.The company maintained an earlier forecast for annual revenue growth of 30% or more through 2025. Palantir reported U.S. government revenue grew 83% in the first quarter, while sales from U.S. businesses increased 72%.

Drilling deeper, consumer spending on durable goods increased 41.4% and nondurable goods increased 14.4%. Services increased 4.6%. Spending on equipment increased at a 16.7% rate and spending on intellectual property products increased at a 10.1% rate.  Residential investment increased at a 10.8% rate. On an absolute basis and despite three quarters of recovery, current GDP is still about 1% below pre-pandemic levels.

The stock's $4.81 price decline was shaving about 32 points off the Dow's price, while the Dow was up 7 points, or less than 0.1%. Investors may be concerned about 3M's comments regarding the expected negative impact that input cost inflation will have on earnings this year. In the first quarter, Chief Financial Officer Monish Patolawala said 3M experienced increasing costs, particularly for raw materials and logistics, due primarily to the stronger demand, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and Winter Storm Uri. ""In our view, we expect global supply chain dynamics to remain fluid and for raw material and logistics headwinds to persist,"" Patolawala said, according to a FactSet transcript of the post-earnings conference call with analysts. ""Therefore, we now anticipate a full-year raw materials and logistics headwind of 30 cents-to-50 cents per share versus a prior expectation of flat to a 10-cent headwind at the start of the year."""	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/61eda9fa-6c98-34c2-a26c-897173accb68/3m-stock-drops-despite.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-23	2021-03-23 13:01:28	MMM	3M Company	Looking Into 3M's Return On Capital Employed	3M (NYSE:MMM) posted a 3.14% decrease in earnings from Q3. Sales, however, increased by 2.79% over the previous quarter to $8.58 billion. Despite the increase in sales this quarter, the decrease in earnings may suggest 3M is not utilizing their capital as effectively as possible. In Q3, 3M earned $1.91 billion and total sales reached $8.35 billion. What Is Return On Capital Employed? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q4, 3M posted an ROCE of 0.14%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. View more earnings on MMM Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. For 3M, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies. Q4 Earnings Insight 3M reported Q4 earnings per share at $2.38/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.15/share.

2021-03-23	2021-03-23 12:50:07	MMM	3M Company	What Does 3M's Debt Look Like?	Shares of 3M (NYSE:MMM) increased by 8.01% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt 3M has. 3M's Debt Based on 3M's financial statement as of February 4, 2021, long-term debt is at $17.99 billion and current debt is at $806.00 million, amounting to $18.80 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $4.63 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $14.16 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. 3M has $47.34 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.4. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

Here's a look at some key considerations that might make you believe.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/aa049e07-4db5-351e-a376-f78b92cb47f9/is-3m-a-great-dividend-stock%3F.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-03-05	2021-03-05 16:06:30	MMM	3M Company	9 Oil Stocks Betting on a Return to Travel and Normality	With so many fiscal and monetary variables at play, you can’t blame conservative investors from wanting to rotate out of risky equities into safer investments. At the same time, the variables themselves entice a contrarian position for those who can handle potential volatility. If you belong in the latter camp, wagering on oil stocks may be the ticket to success. By now, it’s been roughly a year since most of America went into lockdown, naturally brewing pent-up demand. Therefore, it’s quite possible that we could see a resurgence in travel demand, which may finally help bring oil stocks out of the doldrums. As you know, the energy sector was one of the hardest hit as people were forced to curb their movements. To be fair, the data isn’t 100% encouraging. There’s still a lot we don’t know about how the novel coronavirus pandemic will play out. However, the most important piece of information we have is that daily Covid-19 infections have fallen sharply from early January peaks. In addition, the vaccine rollout has generally been encouraging, contributing to the decline in cases.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Also, a traveler sentiment survey from CouponFollow.com indicates that demand is significant for getting out of the house. So yes, people want to travel, but they want to do so safely. Thus, whenever possible, folks are choosing to drive to their destinations, which bodes well for oil stocks. You’ve probably heard that rising bond yields have unnerved investors, creating recent volatility in the market. But the implication is that possibly – and I do want to emphasize possibly – the labor market is on the mend. 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain If that is the case, you’ll want to consider these oil stocks as people get out and about to do more traveling. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) BP (NYSE:BP) ABB (NYSE:ABB) 3M (NYSE:MMM) Sunoco (NYSE:SUN) Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR) Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) Given the uncertainty of the moment, though, I absolutely want to caution investors that oil stocks are for contrarian speculators only. Perform your due diligence and, don’t risk more than you can afford to lose. Oil Stocks: Chevron (CVX) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com If I had to build a portfolio of oil stocks with which to go against the grain, I’d choose Chevron. As one of the largest energy firms in the world, Chevron covers every aspect of the oil and natural gas business, from exploration and production to refining and transportation to power generation. Therefore, if a recovery happens, CVX stock is well suited for gains. However, if a recovery doesn’t occur, CVX stock probably won’t send you immediately to the poor house. That’s because with the current transportation complex, we’re not going to switch to clean or renewable energy overnight. As well, millions of workers have been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic. People need to gradually return to their normal lives and routines, which for the foreseeable future benefits CVX stock. BP (BP) Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com It doesn’t take a genius to understand that oil stocks don’t necessarily have the greatest reputation. In recent memory, BP represents all that’s wrong with this sector. Back in 2010, the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon oil spill led to the biggest oil spill ever in the U.S. Moreover, it was one of the worst environmental disasters in world history. Indeed, the catastrophe inspired the film “Deepwater Horizon.” When Mark Wahlberg gets involved, you know some stuff is about to go down. No, BP stock is not going to win any ESG (environmental, social, governance) accolades any time soon. However, that’s also part of its “charm,” at least on a technical sense. Over the last five-year period, BP shares are down around 13% while CVX is up almost 14%. 7 Great Dividend Stocks Outside the Energy Sector Cynically, there’s nothing better than another disaster to cover up one’s own. Therefore, BP stock might pleasantly surprise you. ABB (ABB) Source: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com On the surface, ABB may not immediately strike you as a big name among oil stocks. Rather, the Swedish-Swiss multinational firm is arguably best known for its robotics and automation technologies. However, the industrial technology company does significant business with the oil and gas industry, providing various systems and equipment for onshore and offshore oil operations. This was a relevant underlying business of ABB stock before the pandemic. However, in the post-pandemic world, it’s become even more crucial. As I mentioned earlier, oil stocks have been gutted due to the Covid-19 crisis. They’ve got many challenges ahead, and every dollar saved through enhanced efficiencies matters much more than it previously did. Further, ABB stock isn’t completely exposed to the energy market, since the issuing company offers valuable services across multiple sectors. In a variable environment, it pays to have something stable like this. 3M (MMM) Source: ©iStock.com/ndoeljindoel In the same vein as ABB, prospective buyers of oil stocks should consider 3M. True, MMM stock is mostly associated with applied sciences solutions and everyday convenient consumer products, such as the ubiquitous Post-it notes. However, some folks may be surprised to know that 3M provides economically compelling solutions for the oil industry’s three main components: upstream, midstream and downstream. Of course, as people learn to live with the pandemic and venture out, this dynamic improves the bottom line for oil firms. In turn, this should lead to residual demand for 3M’s holistic supply chain services, which could benefit MMM stock. 7 of the Best Warren Buffett Stock Picks of the Past Decade Lastly, 3M is almost the perfect contrarian play on a return to travel. Thanks to its N95 respirator masks – which by the way are slowly starting to become restocked – 3M’s relevance is dual-pronged. Sunoco (SUN) Source: Gergely Zsolnai/Shutterstock.com As I stated near the top, Americans want to travel but many are leery of doing so via public transportation. Instead, they prefer to get to their location in their personal vehicles. That suits Sunoco and SUN stock perfectly. As one of the largest companies of its sector, Sunoco “distributes fuel to over 5,000 gas station locations in more than 30 states.” While I believe in the power of pent-up demand, I also think there’s a risk in assuming that Americans are that dead set on traveling. Rather, I believe most will take gradual steps back to their normal routines – first driving in their personal vehicles, then later trusting public transportation. If so, this dynamic suits SUN stock. Plus, I like that Sunoco has a strong auto racing heritage. With the Super Bowl proving that you can host a major event during this pandemic, Sunoco’s racing-related synergies should rise this year. One last note – Sunoco is a master limited partnership and thus has tax implications you should consider before buying SUN. Phillips 66 (PSX) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Should travel make a comeback, Phillips 66 should warrant consideration in a portfolio of oil stocks. Primarily, the company has several fuel brands under its belt – its namesake Phillips 66, Conoco, 76, JET and Coop. These are “backed by a network of 11 refineries, 200 terminals and 7,000 branded sites,” according to the company’s website. Naturally, as people hit the road, PSX stock should see continued strength in its already robust momentum. Even further down the line, Phillips 66 should be a relevant name, even with the “encroachment” of electric vehicles. 7 Penny Stocks Close To Busting Through the $5 Mark True, EV battery technology is constantly improving, and even more importantly, declining in cost. However, we’re still not quite to the point where EVs are readily accessible to the everyday consumer. Until that changes – and this transition may take longer than we previously thought – PSX stock may provide more smiles to speculators. EOG Resources (EOG) Source: Shutterstock Following the initial devastation of the coronavirus, I was in no mood to entertain the idea of oil stocks. After all, the price of crude dipped to below zero at one point, an unprecedented occurrence. Therefore, I’ll hope you’ll forgive my lack of optimism for companies like EOG Resources. If demand was negative, I didn’t see how that would be net positive for EOG stock. However, the overall resilience and come-back spirit of America pleasantly surprised me – one positive takeaway from an otherwise awful year in 2020. As a result, EOG stock looks considerably more attractive than it was during the Covid lockdowns. True, EOG Resources’ core business of energy exploration doesn’t strike me as socially or politically relevant. While electric transportation is the future, when that future will arrive is anyone’s guess. For the foreseeable future, we still place tremendous value in fossil fuels for their high energy density and that ultimately benefits EOG. Nabors Industries (NBR) Source: Novikov Aleksey / Shutterstock.com Thanks to improved economic sentiment and the implications this has for a return to normal, Nabor Industries has been one of the best-performing energy stocks this year. Since the first trading session in January, NBR stock is up around 107%. While I’m not the biggest fan of buying into momentum, it’s possible that there’s more legs left on this rally. As an oil and gas drilling contractor, Nabors provides various services that keep energy exploration operations running as smoothly and efficiently as possible. Again, exploration doesn’t seem like a natural place to make money, not with the President Joe Biden administration at the helm. 7 Stocks to Sell for March However, we were all a bit surprised – well, not all of us if I may say so myself – when the U.S. Postal Service didn’t choose Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) as the winner to provide next-generation mail carriers. This indicates that the electrification of transportation still has challenges ahead of it. And like it or not, this gives NBR stock a much-needed lifeline. Marathon Oil (MRO) Source: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.com If you really want to speculate with oil stocks, you may want to consider independent energy companies like Marathon Oil. Like virtually every company in this sector, Marathon suffered severely during the lockdowns. As a result, I didn’t want to touch MRO stock with a 20-foot pole. Frankly, I’m not entirely sure how to approach Marathon and other oil stocks, because of the ambiguous nature of this economic recovery. While the labor market has improved since its valley last year, I’m concerned about the rampant speculation in equities and other investment categories. So, MRO stock is questionable. Nevertheless, if you’ve got an iron stomach for volatility, Marathon may still give your portfolio some love. As I’ve explained above, the company’s core exploration business is very much relevant – all the more so as we work our way out of this recession.

2021-02-23	2021-02-23 18:27:04	MMM	3M Company	N95 Mask Producer 3M Expands Use Of Palantir's Foundry Platform To Help With Supply Chain Demand	Palantir Technolgies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR) is quickly broadening its customer base beyond its government contracts after showcasing its Foundry platform on Demo Day last month. What Happened: Palantir announced on Tuesday an expansion of its partnership with 3M Co (NYSE: MMM). This is the latest in a series of deals with commercial customers for use of Palantir’s Foundry platform, and the multi-million-dollar deal includes increased use of the platform across all of 3M’s product lines. Why It Matters: Palantir’s Foundry platform allows customers to access information quickly to react to changes in supply chains. This should help 3M because of pressure to respond to the increased demand for its products, such as N95 masks, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 3M’s expanded use of the Foundry platform allows 3M to increase its supply chain alerting, demand forecasting and business planning to focus on customer product needs. “The success of our business depends on our ability to respond quickly to changing facts on the ground,” said Brig Knott, 3M’s Vice President, End to End Service, Operations & Lean Six Sigma. What’s Next: Palantir has signed multiple new or expanded partnerships in 2021, including its most recent partnership with Akin Gump law firm. Investors will want to see this continue over the coming months as proof that companies are able to benefit from the use of Palantir's proprietary Foundry and Gotham platforms.

2021-02-17	2021-02-17 14:37:38	MMM	3M Company	ROCE Insights For 3M	3M (NYSE:MMM) posted a 3.14% decrease in earnings from Q3. Sales, however, increased by 2.79% over the previous quarter to $8.58 billion. Despite the increase in sales this quarter, the decrease in earnings may suggest 3M is not utilizing their capital as effectively as possible. In Q3, 3M earned $1.91 billion and total sales reached $8.35 billion. What Is Return On Capital Employed? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in 3M's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q4, 3M posted an ROCE of 0.14%. It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future. View more earnings on MMM ROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows 3M is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth. For 3M, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies. Q4 Earnings Insight 3M reported Q4 earnings per share at $2.38/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.15/share.

2021-01-27	2021-01-27 16:51:50	MMM	3M Company	Why JPMorgan Says 3M's Valuation Is Attractive	The risks from PFAS chemicals are already reflected in 3M Co’s (NYSE: MMM) stock, and the company achieving “a level of sustainable earnings” supports upside, according to JPMorgan. The 3M Analyst: Stephen Tusa upgraded 3M from Neutral to Overweight and raised the price target from $183 to $205. The 3M Thesis: 3M's sales guidance appears “reasonable,” and “assuming the restructuring dynamics through FY22, which should be more clean with potential for inflection, we think consensus is doable, on which the stock is cheap,” Tusa said in the upgrade note. The analyst compared 3M to General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), highlighting that they have the same market capitalization, the analyst said — although 3M’s current free cash flows are at $6 billion versus General Electric’s zero. Moreover, 3M is paying out $4 billion to its shareholders, while General Electric’s payout is a negative dividend of $2 billion, he said. “3M is a pretty solid early cyclical and a relative safety stock mid cycle, as long as it’s attractively valued, with fundamental metrics over a cycle that don’t support this extreme of a discount (to peers).” MMM Price Action: Shares of 3M were trading 4.56% higher to $183.98 at last check Wednesday.

2021-01-27	2021-01-27 13:16:45	MMM	3M Company	3M Posts Surprise 4Q Profit Amid Strong Demand For Face Masks	3M reported better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings results sending its shares up 3.3% on Jan. 26. The N95 mask maker posted EPS of $2.38 in 4Q that beat analysts’ estimates of $2.14. Revenue grew 5.8% to $8.6 billion year-on-year, exceeding the Street consensus of $8.3 billion. 3M’s (MMM) CEO Mike Roman, said, “Throughout 2020 we distributed two billion respirators globally and supported the development and manufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics to help the world respond to COVID-19. We also took significant actions to transform and build 3M for the future, while advancing our core values.” Furthermore, he said, “Moving forward we will continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability as we build on our progress and deliver strong results in 2021.” Revenue growth in 4Q was driven by a 12.7% year-on-year growth in the company’s safety and industrial segment with sales of $3.1 billion. This segment includes sales of personal safety products and industrial adhesives and tapes. (See MMM stock analysis on TipRanks) Another revenue growth driver in 4Q was the consumer segment with sales of $1.4 billion, up by 10.6% year-on-year. The consumer segment includes sales of home improvement and home care supplies. Looking ahead, 3M expects sales in FY 2021 to grow in the range of 5% to 8% with organic revenue growth in the local currency expected to expand by 3% to 6%. EPS is forecasted at $9.20 to $9.70. On Jan. 27, JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy and raised the price target from $183 to $205. In October last year, Tusa had said that going into 2021, “the debate shifts to escape velocity on earnings, where there is risk given multiples that discount optimistic growth assumptions”. Overall, Wall Street analysts are cautiously bearish about the stock and the consensus is a Moderate Sell with 4 analysts recommending a Hold and 3 analysts suggesting a Sell. The average price target of $177.71 implies 1% upside potential to current levels.

2021-01-26	2021-01-26 13:35:25	MMM	3M Company	How Does 3M's Debt Look?	Over the past three months, shares of 3M (NYSE:MMM) moved higher by 8.09%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt 3M has. 3M's Debt Based on 3M's balance sheet as of October 27, 2020, long-term debt is at $18.43 billion and current debt is at $1.17 billion, amounting to $19.60 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $4.12 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $15.48 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering 3M's $45.39 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.43. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2020-12-31	2020-12-31 15:16:42	MMM	3M Company	8 Dental Stocks If You Want to Clean Up	"Intelligence operatives, colloquially known as spies, often reference the fear of going to the “fingernail factory.” You can imagine why. Some countries take a very dim view on their national security being violated. But if I were involved in the clandestine services, I’d fear arriving at the “dentist’s office.” There’s a fine line between service and torture in this industry. But that shouldn’t deter you from dental stocks to buy.
Prior to the novel coronavirus pandemic – and believe me, I’m going to get to that shortly – the cleaning sector, so to speak, offered a reliable upside pathway. During the old normal, industry experts predicted that the global dental market in 2020 would haul in $35 billion, while the following year would generate $36.8 billion. These were hardly unreasonable estimates given prior tallies, thus supporting the case for dental stocks to buy.
Of course, SARS-CoV-2 had a thing or two to say about this sector and so many others. Naturally, with the exploding crisis and government shutdown orders, many elective medical procedures were put on hold. Further, with dentists and their assistants at great risk due to Covid-19 being a respiratory disease, the pandemic had a detrimental impact on this market segment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Nevertheless, it’s important to realize that dental stocks to buy cover a wide range of products and services. For instance, the size of the global oral care market was projected to be nearly $46 billion before the crisis, potentially reaching $53.3 billion by 2025. Frankly, I don’t imagine that these numbers will change all that much. If anything, they might increase.
How so? With the lockdowns impacting dentists’ offices throughout the world, most people likely realized how important self-sufficiency is regarding their health. Therefore, Covid-19 played a sector evangelism role for the industry, which bolsters these dental stocks.

Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC)

					Grading 10 of 2020's Hottest SPACs in Preparation for the New Year				

Because of the highly variable nature of this industry due to the coronavirus, many of these names are not what you call direct plays. That’s on purpose as the dental industry still has some distinct headwinds to overcome. By spreading out the risk across both direct and indirect investments, you’ll likely have a better outcome with these dental stocks to buy.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL)
Source: Shutterstock
	
One of the biggest names among dental stocks to buy is Colgate-Palmolive Company. This descriptor was appropriate well before the pandemic. With the crisis raging to unbelievable levels in many parts of the world, CL stock offers an elementally direct pathway to profitability. Obviously, with another round of shutdowns in place in key economies, there’s never been a more important time for self-care.
Not only that, the fundamentals match the technicals, which is exactly what you want to see with stable investments. On a year-to-date basis, CL stock is up 23%, which is tremendous when you think about it. No, going to the dentist’s office doesn’t rank highly for either patients or dental professionals, especially today. But such an awful dynamic highlights the importance of stocking up on toothpaste and related hygienic accessories.
As if you needed another reason to consider including CL in your list of dental stocks to buy, a Colgate laboratory test demonstrated “that toothpastes containing zinc or stannous and mouthwash formulas with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) neutralize the virus that causes COVID-19 by 99.9 percent.” That’s good enough for me.

Procter & Gamble (PG)

Among the powerful household goods brands in the global markets, Procter & Gamble is also a worthwhile idea out of the dental stocks to buy. Primarily, this is due to its oral care brands, which include Crest, Oral-B, Scope and Fixodent. As with CL above, PG stock has been a cynical beneficiary of the shutdowns, with consumers laser-focused on personal hygiene products.
Though Procter & Gamble doesn’t quite measure up to Colgate-Palmolive in the technical department (PG stock is up nearly 11% YTD), I do appreciate the former company’s broad household exposure. For instance, when the coronavirus first breached our borders, everybody began rushing for essential goods. Obviously, oral hygiene ranked highly during this panic.

But it’s not just about that. Many folks stocked up on toilet paper despite Covid-19 being a respiratory disease, not an excretory one. Whatever, Procter & Gamble still benefited, thanks to its Charmin brand of TP. As well, the company was the go-to choice for laundry products, baby care and other personal needs which we don’t need to discuss because you have an imagination.

Henry Schein (HSIC)
Source: Leonard Zhukovsky / Shutterstock.com
	
At the time I’m writing this, Henry Schein shares are barely above parity. We’re talking just under 1% for the year so far, which is not great. Also, holding HSIC stock is a matter of speculating on capital gains as the company doesn’t pay a dividend. That’s not necessarily high on growth investors’ priorities but it does stink when you’re returning less than 1%.
Of course, that’s better than losing money so we should count our blessings. Nevertheless, HSIC stock could bounce back on a societal and economic recovery. It’s probably not one of the dental stocks to buy right now but it’s definitely worth putting on your radar.
As a distributor of dental and medical products, Henry Schein obviously needs some normalization. Fortunately for the beleaguered organization, the Covid-19 vaccine research, development and distribution have truly happened at warp speed. Theoretically, once we achieve herd immunity, the concept of pent-up demand can lift shares higher.
Don’t believe me? As a guest expert on CGTN America, I discussed that people are buying Christmas-related products out of desperation for normalcy. Once it’s safe, these same folks will likely purchase services that are truly meaningful.

3M (MMM)
Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com
	
Unlike Henry Schein above, industrial giant 3M is in red ink for the year, at least as of this writing. However, the company pays a dividend, which must be accounted for if you’re going to make holistic return comparisons. The other difference with 3M is that this is one of the companies that’s on the margins of what you might consider dental stocks to buy. So, why bother mentioning MMM stock?
If you’re thinking N95 masks, you’re spot on. And it also means I’m becoming terribly predictable, something that should be my new year’s resolution to change. But taking that aside, I believe this will be a critical factor moving forward.
According to DentistryIQ.com, the pricing for N95s lacked transparency. Then, with the Covid-19 crisis, an explosion in pricing – I’m not going to call it price gouging because otherwise, I’d get trolled by those defending billionaire executives’ honor – caused chaos within the sector.


					9 Long-Term Stocks for the Next Decade				

But if there’s a positive here, it’s that we all learned that production of critical products should never be outsourced. This sentiment shift should benefit MMM stock, which has been slowly rising since this year’s March doldrums.

Dentsply Sirona (XRAY)
Source: Cineberg / Shutterstock.com
	
For the vast majority of patients, Dentsply Sirona is a brand of comfort. As one of the world’s leading manufacturers of dental equipment and supplies, the company does its best to make sure that what is sometimes an unpleasant experience is as tolerable as possible.
That is unless you’re an intelligence operative captured by unfriendly forces. Then, Dentsply Sirona may be a distinctly unpleasant brand. But that’s a different topic for a different day.
Unfortunately, XRAY stock also found itself in the dentist’s office, if you get my drift. If you don’t, then check out the equity unit’s YTD performance, which is almost 9% in the red. Since around election day, shares were moving higher. But then coronavirus cases started worsening, and not even the promise of mass vaccinations could help direct dental stocks to buy.
Does this mean you should avoid XRAY stock? For the time being, I’d probably end up waiting on the sidelines. With how much this pandemic has spiraled out of control, I’m not sure when people will feel comfortable going back to see their dentists. However, keep it on your watch list because a return to normal could strongly benefit from pent-up demand.

CVS Health (CVS)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
	
CVS Health isn’t what you call a direct play on dental stocks to buy. But that doesn’t make it any less relevant to oral hygiene. Indeed, if you find yourself needing whatever common health and wellness product, your local CVS store (many of which are open 24/7) will likely be able to help.
This latter point – accessibility/availability – is a lot more crucial for the narrative of CVS stock than some folks might realize. If you think back to the initial wave of shelter-in-place orders, one of the biggest disruptions to our daily lives was loss of convenient access. Suddenly, retailers that were open all hours or well into the night introduced Covid hours. And that put frontline workers who were working non-traditional schedules into a bind.
Naturally, the importance of this convenience thesis faded until recently. With daily Covid-19 cases surging, resulting in a worrying spike in hospitalizations, many jurisdictions have re-imposed strict lockdown measures. Cynically, this helps CVS stock as it’s an essential investment.


					7 Nanotech Stocks To Buy With Huge Returns in Store				

Moreover, I like that CVS isn’t just related to oral hygiene but to a wide range of common needs. Should this crisis worsen in the near term (which is probable), you’ll want to keep tabs on CVS.

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com
	
Throughout this year, Johnson & Johnson has been in the news not as an opportunity among dental stocks to buy but as a Covid-19 vaccine provider. While leaders Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) have dominated headlines, JNJ stock is still relevant in the space because its underlying vaccine is a single-dose approach which doesn’t require frozen storage.
As you know, frozen storage is a bit of a problem regarding the practicality of mass vaccinations. But anyways, that’s a different theme. Here, we’re discussing dental stocks to buy and Johnson & Johnson provides investors with a stable brand that can ride out multiple storms.
First, if we do have that return to normal (or somewhat normal), JNJ stock is primed to benefit. The underlying healthcare giant has a dental professional arm, which sells products like toothbrushes and floss in bulk.
Second, if our trajectory doesn’t lead us to normalcy in an ideal timeframe, then the company offers a full spectrum of oral hygiene products. As we’ve seen with toilet paper runs, common household goods have become top commodities and they could be that way again.

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
Source: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.com
	
Like Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline entered the Covid-19 vaccine sweepstakes. Unlike its rival, GSK stock probably isn’t the most viable play on the pandemic. To be fair, one factor that I appreciate is that the company utilizes a more proven subunit approach. However, Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) has the clear lead in that department. Still, anything can happen, I suppose.
But the lack of credibility in the coronavirus space may have helped contribute to volatility in GSK stock. Certainly, this is one of the ugliest dental stocks to buy from a YTD perspective. However, shares could enjoy surprising upside due to the underlying company’s Sensodyne brand of toothpaste for people with sensitive teeth.
According to a survey of U.S. dental offices, one-in-eight people have sensitive teeth. Sadly, with the pandemic getting out of control, it’s just not feasible for people to head on over to their local dentist. Sufferers must deal with their pain on their own for a while, which cynically lifts GlaxoSmithKline’s investment profile through increased sales of Sensodyne toothpaste.

2020-11-02	2020-11-02 15:42:19	MMM	3M Company	Return On Capital Employed Overview: 3M	Looking at Q3, 3M (NYSE: MMM) earned $1.91 billion, a 41.09% increase from the preceding quarter. 3M also posted a total of $8.35 billion in sales, a 16.36% increase since Q2. In Q2, 3M earned $1.35 billion, and total sales reached $7.18 billion.What Is ROCE? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, 3M posted an ROCE of 0.16%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on MMMROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows 3M is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For 3M, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q3 Earnings Insight 3M reported Q3 earnings per share at $2.43/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.26/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Recap: 3M Q3 Earnings  * Earnings Scheduled For October 27, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The company has been seeing unprecedented demand for its N95 masks amid the pandemic and is on track to produce 2 billion masks this year.3M posted adjusted EPS of $2.43 in 3Q which came ahead of analysts’ forecast of $2.26. However, investors were disappointed as the adjusted EPS fell 5.8% Y/Y despite strong sales. Covid-related costs and a higher adjusted tax rate impacted 3Q earnings.The company’s 3Q sales grew 4.5% to $8.35 billion as demand continued to be strong in personal safety, home improvement, general cleaning, semiconductor, data center and biopharma filtration categories. 3M exceeded the Street’s sales estimate of $8.32 billion. Its Health Care division generated sales of $2.2 billion, reflecting an impressive growth of 25.5%.Meanwhile, the Safety and Industrial segment’s sales were up 6.9% to $3 billion and sales of the Consumer segment grew 5.6% to $1.4 billion. However, sales of the Transportation and Electronics segment fell 7.4% to $2.3 billion as the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on the segment’s auto business and end-markets like hospitality, oil and gas, advertising and highway infrastructure.3M did not provide any guidance for 4Q or full-year as uncertainty continues to prevail amid COVID-19. However, the company said that it expects October sales to be flat to up low-single digits Y/Y. (See MMM stock analysis on TipRanks)Last month, Credit Suisse analyst John Walsh increased his price target for 3M to $197 from $179 and reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst stated that in August, 3M saw continued stabilization in its monthly organic sales growth rate and he expects this momentum to continue into 2021 driven by China, automotive production, and semiconductor/consumer electronics.Meanwhile, the Street has a Hold consensus for 3M with 1 Buy, 7 Holds and 2 Sells. With shares down 8.7% year-to-date, the average analyst price target of $170.20 reflects an upside potential of 5.7% in the coming months.Related News:  First Solar Pops 13% After-Hours On 70% Revenue Surge  Dexcom Drops 9% As Revenue Beat Fails To Impress Investors  Varonis Beats 3Q Profit Estimates; Shares Spike 9%     More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Caterpillar Falls As Dismal Q3 Earnings Reflect Weak Demand   * Rexnord's Quarterly Profit Beats The Street; Analyst Sees 22% Upside   * Fiverr Surges In Pre-Market On Earnings, Revenue Beat   * JetBlue Shares Sink As Covid Fears Overshadow Q3 Beat	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-shares-fall-despite-3q-090737019.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-13	2020-10-13 14:58:04	MMM	3M Company	We Could Be Headed for a Face Mask Glut	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Just a few short months ago, face masks were so hard to come by that companies were sending employees to safeguard shipments from government seizure or mysterious bandits. Now, the world is so awash in face coverings and shields that some of distributors are having a hard time getting full price.Fastenal Co., a supplier of industrial odds and ends for the factory floor, on Tuesday cited an improved supply of certain Covid-19 specific safety products — including masks and face shields — as the biggest reason its gross-profit margins were slimmer than expected in the third quarter. Average daily sales of safety products increased 34.4% in the period relative to a year earlier. While that was a sharp deceleration from the triple-digit increase in the prior quarter when the coronavirus was just taking hold and disruptions were at a peak, it’s strong enough to serve as a reminder that the pandemic hasn’t gone away and neither has the need for personal protective equipment. But many companies are stepping in to fill that void. Not wanting to put their employees at risk of going mask-less or resorting to the guerrilla-style approach to PPE that New York’s doctors had to take in the early months of the pandemic, many companies turned inward to crank out supplies. Ken Engel, Schneider Electric SE’s senior vice president of global supply chain in North America, told me the company purchased mask machines for its factories across the globe. Others, including Boeing Co., Ford Motor Co. and a collection of 3D printing companies, saw an opportunity to ease the public health crisis and started using spare factory space and machines to crank out face shields. The manufacturing and medical worlds require a higher degree of filtration, but most of us are satisfied with regular cloth masks, and the struggling retail industry has been only too happy to provide them. The net result is that it’s just not as hard or as pricey as it once was to buy face coverings.This has ramifications not just for distributors like Fastenal but also for manufacturers like 3M Co. The latter company has aggressively ramped up production to meet the spike in demand and is on track to manufacture some 2 billion masks globally by the end of the year. 3M has repeatedly sought to assure the public that it’s not raising prices on its coveted N95 masks as a result of the pandemic and has filed multiple lawsuits over alleged fraud and price-gouging. Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch has warned that the company could be looking at a price and demand cliff in 2021 as aggressive production efforts from others create a glut of masks. Fastenal’s comments on Tuesday would seem to signal that concern is appropriate. But for both Fastenal and 3M, face masks are a relatively small part of their business. Fastenal also reported “continued softness in underlying business activity owing to a generally weak industrial marketplace” for anything that’s not explicitly tied to battling Covid-19 outbreaks. That’s pressuring purchases of fasteners and a bucket of other factory-floor products that make up about 30% and 45% of its sales, respectively. At the end of the day, having too many masks is much better than the alternative.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-10-07	2020-10-07 12:00:40	MMM	3M Company	Even Dentist Visits Go Remote During the Covid-19 Pandemic	(Bloomberg) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has transformed many in-person activities into remote services delivered over the internet. The latest example is the dreaded visit to the dentist.  Dvora Brandstatter used to drive her son Elchanan half an hour to the orthodontist and back every month to make sure his braces were working properly. Now, from the comfort of her home in Bergenfield, New Jersey, she attaches a special scope to her smartphone camera, opens an app and inserts the contraption into the 11 year-old’s mouth. A video of the boy’s choppers is sent to his dentist who checks progress, diagnoses any issues and sometimes ends the appointment right there. “As a parent having fewer appointments is a good thing,” Brandstatter said. “I haven’t seen a downside so far. It’s probably the way everything is moving anyway.”The app and the scope were created last year by New Jersey-based startup Grin. After the pandemic hit, Chief Executive Officer and dentist Adam Schulhof said the company sped up development of the technology and partnered with manufacturer 3M Co. to quickly distribute it to as many orthodontists as possible. About 5,000 units have shipped out and roughly 1,000 patients have used the system so far, according to Grin.Schulhof, who uses the system for his own practice, said the coronavirus has spurred huge demand for new procedures that help people reduce the close contact that typically happens when they visit the dentist. The CDC has warned that dental instruments create spray that can contain droplets of water, saliva, blood and other debris, and has advised the use of “teledentistry” as an alternative to in-office care. When the Grin videos arrive at the dentist’s office, other software from the startup helps practitioners analyze the condition of the teeth and integrates the footage with existing patient management systems. The app also lets patients see what the dentist sees inside their mouth. Not for the faint of heart.There are already new, internet-focused dental services that Grin is going up against. Companies such as SmileDirectClub Inc. mail invisible aligners and braces to consumers. SmileDirectClub shares have more than doubled since the middle of March. Schulfhof said Grin’s offering is aimed at fighting the challenge to conventional dentistry from such direct-to-consumer offerings. “We’re trying to disrupt the disrupters,” he added.In the short-term, the technology will help orthodontists keep their businesses running while many patients avoid the dentist’s office completely, the CEO said. As smartphone capabilities improve and the software develops, Schulhof expects Grin’s scope to use artificial intelligence image analysis to become a more powerful diagnostic tool for dentists.The CEO also sees the technology gaining traction in general dentistry where insurance companies may back its use. People’s teeth decay at different rates and more regular, remote checks, could be used to identify problems before they require more complicated and expensive treatment at in-person visits every six months, he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/even-dentist-visits-remote-during-120040165.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-23	2020-09-23 08:02:34	MMM	3M Company	3M Looks To Sell Food Safety Business For $3.5B: Bloomberg	3M Co (NYSE: MMM) is exploring a sale of its food safety business division for $3.5 billion, reports Bloomberg.What Happened: The post-it notes manufacturer's food safety division makes test kits for food makers to monitor sanitation and allergens. The company could rake in $3.5 billion by selling its business to raise cash as pandemic has hit the food and restaurant industry.3M could still opt to retain its business as a final decision has not been made, according to Bloomberg.Why It Matters: Coronavirus has sent ripples across industries and 3M is no exception. As the company grapples with the grim business situation, raising cash during the pandemic helps it stabilize.3M reported a 12.2% decline in second-quarter revenue and the company didn't provide guidance as the full impact of the pandemic was not known.Earlier this month, 3M issued guidance for third-quarter revenue of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion, in-line with analyst expectations.Credit Suisse has maintained an Outperform rating on 3M with a price target of $197 on Sep. 16.Benzinga's Take: The food safety business generated $341 million in revenue last year -- representing approximately 5% of the overall health care unit, according to Bloomberg. In such a scenario, parting away with the small portion of revenue to raise cash makes sense for 3M.Price Action: 3M shares closed 0.61% higher to $162.34 on Tuesday. The stock is down 8% year-to-date lagging behind the S&P Industrial index, which is down 5.8%.See more from Benzinga  * KKR Gets A Piece Of India's Retail With 4M Investment  * Tech Selloff Is Far From Over, Warns Morgan Stanley  * Monday's Top After-Hours Movers(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-23	2020-09-23 07:25:16	MMM	3M Company	3M Mulls $3.5B Sale Of Food Safety Division- Report	3M Co. (MMM) is working with advisers on the sale of its food safety business, reports Bloomberg, citing people with knowledge of the matter.According to one of the sources, the unit, which sells test kits and other products to help foodmakers monitor sanitation and allergens, could fetch about $3.5 billion.No final decision has been made and 3M could still decide to keep the business, Bloomberg reported.Shares in 3M are down 8% year-to-date, and the stock scores a cautious Hold consensus from the Street. That’s with 5 hold ratings offset by just 1 buy rating and 2 sell ratings in the last three months.Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $167 suggests only limited upside potential of 3% from the current share price.On 16 September, lone bull John Walsh of Credit Suisse reiterated his buy rating while ramping up his price target from $179 to $197 (21% upside potential). He also boosted estimates to account for better-than-expected sales performance in July and August.In August, 3M saw continued stabilization in its monthly organic sales growth rate (+3% y/y adjusted for days). Walsh sees this momentum continuing into 2021 driven by China, automotive production, and semiconductor/ consumer electronics.“While it is unclear if the company will reinstate guidance on Q3 earnings, we expect 3M to provide guidance once markets stabilize” he stated.Crucially, the analyst notes that 3M currently trades at a 35% discount to short-cycle peers ITW and ROK. At peer valuation, this equates to $58B of “missing” market value, says Walsh, adding that he expects this discount to erode as 3M rebuilds investor credibility.

2020-09-22	2020-09-22 21:05:42	MMM	3M Company	3M Explores $3.5 Billion Sale of Food Safety Division	(Bloomberg) -- 3M Co. is working with advisers on the sale of its food safety business, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The unit, which sells test kits and other products to help foodmakers monitor sanitation and allergens, could fetch about $3.5 billion, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.No final decision has been made and 3M could still opt to retain the business, the people said. A representative of the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company declined to comment.A sale would give 3M extra cash amid the coronavirus pandemic in exchange for parting with a relatively minor part of its sprawling portfolio. The food safety business generated $341 million in revenue last year, roughly 5% of the $7.4 billion posted by the company’s broader health-care unit.3M rose less than 1% to $162.34 at the close in New York, giving the company a market value of about $94 billion. The shares have fallen 8% this year, compared with a 5.8% decline in a Standard & Poor’s index of U.S. industrial companies.3M’s profits came under pressure in the first half as the pandemic stifled several of the company’s end-markets, including automobile production and electronics.The manufacturer, which also makes Post-it notes, has since reported improvements across most of its business including double-digit gains in health care in July and August. 3M said earlier this month that third-quarter sales should reach $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion, roughly in line with current analyst expectations.(Updates shares, adds detail starting in 6th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-explores-3-5-billion-193926648.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-15	2020-09-15 13:48:10	MMM	3M Company	3M Surprises With 3Q Sales Outlook As Street Says Hold	3M Company posted solid August sales results and announced an upbeat 3Q sales outlook that surpassed analysts' estimates. Shares of the company are rising over 1% in Tuesday's pre-market trading.3M’s (MMM) August sales increased 2% year-over-year to $2.7 billion, primarily driven by health care sales growth of 23% year-over-year. Safety and industrial sales also rose 6% while consumer sales grew 3%. However, transportation and electronics sales declined 11% year-over-year in August. The company pointed out that August sales were impacted by only 21 days in the month this year versus 22 days last yearThe industrial company estimates that 3Q sales will generate between $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion, compared with $8 billion in the year-ago quarter. 3Q sales guidance was also above analysts’ estimates of $8.08 billion. The company is set to report 3Q earnings results on Oct. 27. (See MMM stock analysis on TipRanks).On July 28, 3M reported 2Q earnings of $1.78 per share, missing the Street estimates of $1.80 per share. Revenues of $7.18 billion also lagged analysts’ expectations of $7.32 billion in 2Q, due to a plunge in demand across its business units amid the pandemic.Despite the 2Q performance, JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa last month lifted the price target on 3M to $159 (5.6% downside potential) from $154, saying that the shares are &quot;cheap.&quot; He said that the company performed well in 2Q amid a tough environment, and a &quot;stronger-than-expected bounce back&quot; in July is positive. He maintained a Hold rating on the stock.Like Tusa, the Street is sidelined the stock with a Hold analyst consensus. The average price target of $165 implies downside potential of about 2.1% to current levels. Shares have declined about 4.5% year-to-date.Related News:  Monolithic Power Rises In Pre-Market On 3Q Sales Outlook  NextEra Soars 6% After-Hours On Guidance Boost, Stock-Split  Lennar’s 3Q Profit Jumps 33% On Robust Housing Demand More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Lemonade Enters France To Further Expand in European Market   * Carnival To Post $2.9B Loss in 3Q; Shares Drop 3% In Pre-Market   * ExlService Lifts 2020 Profit Outlook As Business Rebounds   * Microsoft, BP Join Forces To Drive Digital Energy And Net Zero Carbon Goals	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-surprises-3q-sales-outlook-134810398.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-15	2020-09-15 11:59:32	MMM	3M Company	How Does 3M's Debt Look?	Over the past three months, shares of 3M (NYSE: MMM) increased by 7.49%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt 3M has.3M's Debt According to the 3M's most recent financial statement as reported on July 28, 2020, total debt is at $20.76 billion, with $19.28 billion in long-term debt and $1.49 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $4.22 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $16.54 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering 3M's $45.08 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.46. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: 3M  * Return On Capital Employed Overview: 3M  * Recap: 3M Q2 Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-10	2020-09-10 09:00:00	MMM	3M Company	Amazon Raised Prices on Essentials Amid Pandemic, Watchdog Says	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. charged inflated prices for hand sanitizer, disposable gloves and other essentials months after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, a consumer watchdog said in a report accusing the world’s largest online retailer of price gouging.The report, released Thursday by Public Citizen, examines roughly two dozen products on Amazon’s site. Relying on its own observations and data from price-tracking sites, the nonprofit public interest group documented price increases of as much as 1,000% when compared with pre-pandemic levels or prices at other large retailers.The report challenges Amazon’s public position that it’s an innocent bystander of price gouging perpetrated by a select few “bad actors” selling products on its popular webstore. It accuses Amazon of price gouging, as well, on products the online retailer sells directly.The company denied it engages in such practices. “There is no place for price gouging on Amazon and that includes products offered directly by Amazon,” a spokesman said. “Our systems are designed to offer customers the best available online price, and if we see an error, we work quickly to fix it.”One of the roughly two dozen items tracked in the report, a 7.5-ounce bottle of Dial-brand hand soap, was available earlier this week for $6.41 from Amazon directly and for about the same price from a third-party merchant. Target Corp. listed the product for $1.49 while CVS Health Corp. charged $2.29, though neither made it available for home delivery. Walmart Inc. only sells the hand soap in stores and didn’t publish a price online (A seller on Walmart’s third-party marketplace posted a higher price, $7.98, than Amazon).The pandemic coincided with waves of complaints about inflated prices, as well as spotty availability, of such in-demand goods as cleaning supplies and baking ingredients. Germany’s cartel regulator also has questioned Amazon about prices during the outbreak. As part of a campaign against inflated prices by resellers, 3M Co. sued, and later settled with, an Amazon merchant.Alex Harman, Public Citizen’s competition policy advocate and the report’s author, calls it “crazy” that Amazon is still grappling with inflated prices months later. He suspects the higher prices he identified on Amazon partly stem from hikes by new suppliers the company found during the scramble after the pandemic began. But that doesn’t mean those prices should find their way to consumers, he said.“Increased demand and lack of supply are literally why there are price-gouging laws,” Harman said.Many U.S. states have laws governing acceptable price increases on essential goods such as food and fuel during emergencies, but they are difficult to enforce. States also define “price gouging” in different ways, with some setting a specific threshold of 10% above usual prices and others using vague descriptions such “unconscionable levels,” which makes it difficult to apply to online marketplaces that match buyers and sellers in different states.The report calls for a national prohibition on price gouging and recommends that Amazon publish list prices and a pricing history for specific items. Amazon’s public policy director Brian Huseman in May called on Congress to establish a national price-gouging law for federal emergencies, saying the company had suspended 4,000 seller accounts for violating its price policies and cooperated with regulators in Tennessee, Alaska and Washington to fight price gouging on its site.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-raised-prices-essentials-amid-090000315.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-09	2020-09-09 12:30:39	MMM	3M Company	Why Are N95 Masks Still So Difficult to Get?	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last week — which is to say, six months into a pandemic that has killed more than 185,000 Americans — the American Nurses Association released the results of a survey of its membership. The survey asked whether nurses were still experiencing shortages of personal protective equipment, or PPE.The answer was a resounding yes. “A third reported that they were out of or short of N95 respirators designed to offer maximum protection in a hospital setting,” according to Bloomberg News. (They are called N95s because they filter out 95% of airborne particulates, including viruses.)Early in the pandemic, N95 masks were in such short supply that hospital personnel were reusing them for days at a time instead of following the proper protocol of discarding them after a single use. Today, that is still the case; almost 60% of the nurses surveyed said they’re “re-using single-use protective equipment for five or more days, and 68% said their facilities mandate re-using the supplies,” Bloomberg reported.When I emailed a top hospital administrator to ask whether mask shortages had eased up, she sent me a one-line reply: “Supply chain is still royally screwed up, and can’t get N95s.”How can this be? The initial shortage of N95s in March and April was more or less understandable. According to 3M Co., the biggest mask maker in the U.S., demand for N95s didn’t just double or triple in the wake of the pandemic; it rose 40-fold. Hospitals needed them, but so did dental offices, long-term care facilities, Covid-19 testing sites and many other facilities. The effort to acquire N95s became a mad scramble. The supply chain collapsed. “Brokers”(1) popped up everywhere, claiming to have access to millions of masks, supposedly stored in warehouses in Los Angeles or Guangzhou or Seoul. Usually, these claims were bogus, but even when they weren’t, obtaining those masks was extraordinarily difficult, with dozens of brokers all promising to deliver the same masks. The market was filled with fakes. Oil traders and hedge funds jumped in, trading masks as if they were oil futures. The price for many masks shot up from around $1 to as much as $5 or $6. Meanwhile, 3M — which has not raised its prices during the pandemic — ramped up production from 22 million N95s a month before the pandemic to 50 million by June. It wasn’t nearly enough.Today, 3M’s U.S. run rate is 1 billion N95s a year. Worldwide, it expects to be churning them out at a rate of 2 billion a year by the end of 2020. The company has also imported tens of millions of N95s from its facilities in China under an agreement with President Donald Trump, who invoked the Defense Production Act. Honeywell International Inc. is also manufacturing N95s for the U.S. market, as are a handful of other companies. Still, hospitals and other entities, including state governments, are having nearly as much difficulty obtaining N95s as they did early in the pandemic. The scarcity has not eased. The N95 black market is still going strong. States are still bidding against one another for mask supplies. Counterfeits and substandard masks are still being sold as the real thing (although 3M has worked hard to rid the market of bogus 3M masks). The only reason this isn’t a bigger issue is that the influx of Covid-19 hospital patients has eased. But if the pandemic has a second wave in the fall, as many fear, it’s going to get ugly again.Consider the situation in Minnesota. The state has orders for more than 5 million N95s, which it hopes to allocate to hospitals that need them. According to the Star Tribune in Minneapolis, it has received only 337,000 masks so far through traditional 3M distributors. Minnesota contracted with Supply Link Inc., a small Ohio company, for an additional 2 million N95s, for which it agreed to pay $4.75 each — or $9.5 million in total. Matthew Kaspar, Supply Link’s president, told me that the company had lined up the purchase, signed a sales agreement and found financiers to front the down payment, which the state was prevented from doing by law. “I actually had Minnesota on the phone with the so-called distributor,” said Melissa Hill, the Supply Link executive in charge of the deal. The distributor assured state officials that it was all on the up-and-up.It wasn’t. When four trucks were sent to the warehouse that supposedly held the masks, Supply Link discovered it was barren. “This is a very dark market,” Hill said. The company’s experience is typical of the scams that are taking place in the N95 black market. Wayne Waslaski, an official with the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, told me that he now thinks it is unlikely the state will ever see those 2 million masks. But Hill and Kaspar insist that they won’t stop trying to unearth them. Minnesota does know where an additional 500,000 N95 masks reside: in a warehouse in China, where they have been tied up for more than three months. The hangup? The U.S. government, which has refused to allow them to be imported. Which gets to the ultimate cause of the problem: the Trump administration.When you get right down to it, it will be years before the enormous gap between the supply of N95s and demand will narrow in the U.S. Before the pandemic, hospitals didn’t use them much, not even for most surgical procedures; a typical hospital might go through a few thousand a month, rather than the hundreds of thousands it now needs monthly. Globalization pushed most mask manufacturing overseas —and once the virus arrived, few countries were willing to allow N95s to be exported. And with such a severe supply shortage, it was inevitable that black marketers and scam artists would try to take advantage of people who needed to buy masks. None of this is surprising; markets don’t function properly when supply and demand are so out of whack.What needed to happen in March — and still needs to happen — is the federal government should be using the Defense Production Act to take control of the N95 market. It alone has the power to negotiate mask deals with countries like China and Vietnam. It could have sent an important message by punishing price gougers and counterfeiters. It could have enlisted other civic-minded companies besides 3M to begin manufacturing N95s. And it could have allocated N95s (and other PPE for that matter) to states and hospitals and nursing homes as they were needed — shifting mask shipments away from states where coronavirus cases were on the wane and toward emerging hot spots.  A competent federal effort wouldn’t have ended the supply-demand imbalance, but it could have drastically reduced its effect on the country.The Federal Emergency Management Agency insists that it has done just that, but the effort has been paltry. Minnesota, for instance, has received a pathetic 3,000 masks from the federal government. What’s more, as the Associated Press pointed out in July, “low population, mostly rural states” — i.e. red states — did better by FEMA than more populous states that were hit harder by the virus. “For example, Montana has received 1,125 items of protective gear per [confirmed Covid-19] case, compared with 32 items per case in Massachusetts, an early hot spot,” the AP wrote. A FEMA spokesperson said that PPE was “distributed evenly” to the states.But the federal government has also hijacked for its own stockpile imported masks that hospitals had already paid for. It has stood aside as the market for N95s devolved into the Wild West. And the FDA, in particular, has made it extremely difficult to import even bona fide N95 masks that were made abroad.Donaldson Company Inc., a filtration company based in the Minneapolis suburbs, is the company trying to bring in those 500,000 masks from China. It has state-of-the-art air-filtration labs scattered around the world, including in China. Though the company had no experience with N95s, it raised its hand to help Minnesota source them. Scam artists in China swarmed all over the company, and early on, it used its labs mainly to detect fraudulent N95s. “We likely saved the state millions of dollars by screening out the procurement of bad masks,” its CEO, Tod Carpenter, told me.Eventually, Donaldson found a legitimate manufacturer in China and set up a supply chain. The company then purchased 500,000 high-quality masks that they believed met the emergency authorization requirements the FDA had established to deal with the pandemic. Those were the masks Donaldson intended to sell to the state — at cost, Carpenter said. After testing them — and confirming that the Chinese company had the necessary registration from its government — Donaldson applied to the FDA to have them brought into the U.S. The agency said no; the application had to come from the manufacturer. The Chinese company then submitted an application directly. Again the FDA said no because its registration was temporary. When the Chinese company got its permanent registration, it tried one more time. Guess what? The FDA still said no. “We’re scratching our heads here,” Carpenter told me. “We’re a filter company. We have labs. We know how to do this. Just tell us what we need to do.” But the FDA won’t talk to Carpenter because under its rules, it can only discuss such matters with the manufacturer, not the distributor. Although Donaldson is still trying to find ways to make its case to the FDA, it’s a stalemate.During the Republican convention, Trump boasted about shipping “hundreds of millions of masks, gloves and gowns to our frontline health care workers.” Having now spent time digging into the world of PPE, I find the following account more credible. It took place in Rhode Island a few months ago, after Governor Gina Raimondo pleaded with FEMA for hospital gear from the federal stockpile.“I’d just constantly get the runaround,” she recounted to Politico.  She continued: “One time they promised me, ‘OK, it will be there today, a truck full of PPE.’ I said: ‘Tell me the time, I’ll check on it myself.’ They said 7 p.m. Great. At 7 p.m., no truck. I call and ask where is it, they say 9 p.m. Fine. Around 9 p.m., I get a text from FEMA: Governor, the truck arrived. Hallelujah! I called my director of health. ‘Great news, the truck is finally here!’” Then they opened the truck. It was empty.(1) One such broker was Brian Kolfage, the decorated veteran who lost both legs and an arm in Iraq in 2004.

2020-08-25	2020-08-25 07:13:10	MMM	3M Company	3M or Honeywell: Which Industrial Stock Is The Street Favoring?	Generally, the industrial sector-which includes aerospace, construction, manufacturing and many other businesses, is quite vulnerable to an economic downturn. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted several businesses and led to huge unemployment. Its impact on industrial stocks has been drastic.Both 3M and Honeywell have been in the news for massive production of personal protective equipment, especially N95 masks. But these industrial giants are highly diversified companies and are involved in several other businesses, most of which are struggling due to the slowdown triggered by the pandemic.Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, we will compare these two industrial giants to see which stock is better positioned to recover faster.3M Company (MMM)The unprecedented surge in the demand for 3M’s N95 masks was not enough to offset the impact of COVID-19 on the sales from end markets like healthcare elective procedures, automotive OEM (original equipment manufacturers) and aftermarket, general industrial, commercial solutions and office supplies.3M’s second-quarter sales fell 12.2% to $7.2 billion and adjusted EPS declined 16.4% to $1.78. Sales from the company’s Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer divisions fell 9.2%, 20.9%, 0.4%, and 6.2%, respectively. The company’s aggressive cost cuts helped in reducing costs by $400 million in the second quarter.3M was struggling even before the pandemic and was unable to deliver strong numbers for businesses like healthcare and consumer, which are not that cyclical. As part of its restructuring efforts, the company streamlined its business segments to four instead of five, sold certain underperforming businesses like drug delivery, reduced headcount and implemented a new global operating model.Meanwhile, 3M is investing in research and development to capture growth opportunities in air quality, automotive electrification and food safety. (See MMM stock analysis on TipRanks)JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa maintained his Hold rating for 3M following the recent results. A well-executed second quarter against a challenging environment and a “stronger-than-expected bounceback” in July made him raise the price target to $159 from $154.RBC Capital analyst Deane Dray was disappointed with the lower-than-anticipated second-quarter earnings and organic sales growth as well as the third-quarter margins outlook. However, he increased his price target to $170 from $158 for 3M stock while maintaining a Hold rating based on a potential positive inflection in July sales given a low-single-digit rise in month-to-date revenue.3M stock has declined 7% so far this year and the average price target of $165.44 indicates a modest 1.2% rise over the next 12 months. One Buy rating, 6 Holds, and 2 Sells add up to a Hold consensus for 3M.Honeywell International (HON)Industrial conglomerate Honeywell provides products and solutions to a wide variety of industries ranging from aerospace, defense, to heaters and Internet of Things solutions.Honeywell’s second-quarter sales fell 19% to $7.5 billion as the pandemic hit its major businesses though areas like defense, warehouse automation and personal protective equipment delivered a strong performance. The quarter’s EPS declined 40% Y/Y to $1.26.The company’s Aerospace business, which is its largest division by sales, plunged 28% due to lower demand as commercial air travel came to a standstill due to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the strength in the defense and space business saved the segment to some extent.Honeywell Building Technologies sales were down 19%. Performance Materials and Technologies sales also fell 19% hit by the pandemic as well as the softness in the oil and gas sector.Safety and Productivity Solutions sales dropped 1% Y/Y as weakness in sensing and Internet of things, productivity products, and gas sensing, was partially offset by robust demand for personal protective equipment and double-digit growth in Intelligrated. Notably, Intelligrated, which provides warehouse automated solutions, experienced a 300% rise in bookings as e-commerce spiked since the pandemic.Honeywell expects its third-quarter organic sales to be down 15% as Aerospace, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Building Technologies sales are expected to fall by over 25%, 10%, and 10%, respectively.Amid this crisis, the company is looking for prospects in providing customer solutions in areas like e-commerce, health and safety. It is also making cost cuts in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion this year, of which 60% to 70% would be permanent cost reductions.Following the better-than-feared results, JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa maintained his Buy rating for the stock and raised his price target for Honeywell to $185 from $177. The analyst believes that the company’s “growth vectors moving forward are underappreciated,” including the connected portfolio and automation products for warehouses and buildings.However, on August 11, RBC Capital analyst Deane Dray downgraded Honeywell to Hold from Buy and also lowered the price target to $158 from $166. While the analyst recognizes that the company is among the best-in-class multi-industry operators, he is concerned about the weakness in commercial aero and oil and gas markets.Dray summarized, “Honeywell is likely to lag in a cyclical rebound. Patient investors may ultimately be rewarded.” (See HON stock analysis on TipRanks)The Street has a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy rating for Honeywell International with 10 Buys and 5 Hold ratings. Honeywell stock has declined about 10% year-to-date. Analysts expect an upside potential of 3.3% with a 12-month price target of $164.62.ConclusionIt will take quite some time for both 3M and Honeywell to recover to pre-COVID levels as their key businesses are closely aligned to economic recovery. While 3M has a higher dividend yield of 3.6% compared to Honeywell’s 2.3%, Wall Street consensus and long-term prospects appear to make Honeywell a more favorable stock pick right now.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-08-14	2020-08-14 11:00:02	MMM	3M Company	What Sells in a Pandemic? Weight Watchers, Pools and Cereal	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One of the more striking features of the pandemic is the inequity of the pain it has inflicted. It has disproportionately affected Black and Latino communities. More than 16 million Americans are unemployed, nearly triple February’s levels, but investors in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index are back in the green for the year. And while some businesses are looking at a multiyear slump in demand, others are experiencing their best sales growth ever. The second-quarter earnings season brought fresh evidence of relative bright spots for spending, from the obvious demand for cleaning products to more surprising splurges like swimming pools and Weight Watchers memberships. That’s a shift from the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. You would be hard pressed to name large companies that didn’t experience some sort of a slowdown from that particular recession, let alone any that were outright beneficiaries. There are no real winners in a global pandemic that has killed more than 150,000 people in the U.S., but the willingness of at least some Americans to keep spending on certain categories is a positive indicator and has most likely served to keep the economic downturn from being even worse. Here’s what stood out:BIG-TICKET ITEMSThe unique nature of the pandemic and months spent under lockdown conditions has some consumers making the kind of large discretionary purchases that are typically the first to get cut in a downturn. New-home sales in the U.S. rose to an almost 13-year high in June, while purchases of existing homes posted the largest ever month-over-month gain as families juggling the work-from-home and virtual-learning experiments seek out bigger properties in less-urban areas. Much of this home-buying now starts virtually. That translated into a 12% gain in monthly users on Zillow Group Inc.’s sites during the second quarter. Better-than-expected sales growth in its internet and mortgages divisions should push the company’s third-quarter operating profit above the threshold it was targeting internally before the pandemic, Chief Financial Officer Allen Parker said on an earnings call last week. High on the list of priorities for some home shoppers is going to be a parking spot. A wariness of public transportation and ride-sharing has underscored the appeal of individual cars and helped the sector bounce back much more quickly than anticipated. General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. both reported better-than-expected second-quarter results amid a strong gain in sales once dealerships and plants were allowed to reopen in May and June. Both could return to profitability next quarter, a sharp contrast to the financial crisis when GM and Chrysler were forced into bankruptcy and Ford only barely avoided the same fate. OUTDOOR LIVING  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says outdoor activities are less risky than indoor ones, and many people are growing tired of being cooped up at home. No wonder RV-maker Thor Industries Inc. cited an “influx” of first-time buyers. Camping World Holdings Inc. said this month that demand had remained strong through the summer months and that it might be on track for its most profitable year ever. Yeti Holdings Inc. posted an 18% increase in second-quarter sales for the division that includes its luxury coolers, waterproof backpacks and fancy camping chairs. If you can’t drive your RV to the beach or a campsite on a lake, the next best option is to create your own personal waterfront oasis. Pool Corp., a distributor of parts and supplies, reported record sales in the second quarter and increased its earnings guidance for 2020. Pool filled most of that demand from existing inventory, but the revenue boom will eventually make its way to Pentair Plc, which makes pool pumps, cleaners and automated control systems. Orders are up for both new pool construction and remodels, CEO John Stauch said on the company’s earnings call last month. With most new pools taking several quarters to complete, that’s not the kind of investment that’s made lightly and not one that’s common in economic slumps. Global sales of pool equipment at Pentair fell 45% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, for example. HOME IMPROVEMENTSadly, a pool remains out of reach for most people. But it’s also seemingly a good time to do something about that cabinet that has never closed properly, replace that appliance that’s making ominous noises or build that new deck. Stanley Black & Decker Inc. rode the do-it-yourself wave to 8% organic sales growth in its tools segment in June and July, compared with the year-earlier periods. Whirlpool Corp. said revenue declines in 2020 wouldn’t be as bad as previously thought, as an initial spike in demand for extra refrigerators and freezers to store all that food people were stockpiling gave way to other upgrades in the kitchen, such as ovens. HVAC systems have been another spending hot spot because a broken air conditioner makes spending 24/7 inside a home even more of a challenge. Proper ventilation is also a critical tool for combating the coronavirus. Orders for residential HVAC systems were up 100% in June compared with those in the month a year earlier and trending up more than 50% in July at Carrier Global Corp., with similar spikes at rivals Trane Technologies Plc and Johnson Controls International Plc. People are also paying closer attention to their yards. Scotts Miracle-Gro Co.’s revenue surged 28% in the quarter ended June 27, thanks to robust demand for gardening and lawn-care products. The sales surge prompted the company to raise its full-year earnings outlook.SELF-IMPROVEMENTOther Americans have apparently made a project of themselves. Rosetta Stone Inc. reported a 92% increase in bookings from a year earlier in its consumer language segment as people decided to use time stuck at home to learn Spanish or brush up on their Italian. That uptake, coupled with increased sales of its literacy products for K-12 students, led the company to boost full-year sales guidance. Rosetta Stone is reportedly looking to capitalize on the demand boom with a potential sale. Meanwhile, WW International Inc., the company behind Weight Watchers, notched 5 million subscribers in the second quarter — a count that was about even with the first quarter, the period that is typically peak season thanks to New Year’s resolutions. The pandemic is prompting a “radical re-appraisal” of life and work in which “health and wellness is definitely moving from what I would think of prior as a luxury to a necessity,” CEO Mindy Grossman said at a recent conference. WW’s quarterly revenue fell from a year earlier, as many of its brick-and-mortar studios were temporarily closed because of the pandemic. But digital subscriptions — a more profitable model that the company is trying to pivot toward anyway — rose 23%.   CONSTANT CLEANINGThe pandemic has put hygiene and sanitization into sharp focus. That has shown up in obvious ways, such as a 22% surge in sales for Clorox Co. in the second quarter and a 19% increase in sales of 3M Co.’s personal-protective gear, including N95 masks. Cintas Corp. is known for its corporate uniforms, but it also helps supply companies with items like hand-sanitizer and masks. Sales for the unit that houses this business grew 22% in the most recent quarter on an organic basis, with demand for safety products more than making up for a decline in the restocking of office first-aid cabinets. It’s not just disinfectants, though. With people spending so many more hours at home, the dishes are piling up more frequently and the floors are becoming grimy faster. That helped power sales of Procter & Gamble Co.’s Dawn dish soap and Swiffer brands in the quarter, which contributed to a 14% increase in organic sales in the company’s fabric and home care division. Colgate-Palmolive Co., too, said it was struggling to keep up with sustained demand for dish soap. Reynolds Consumer Products Inc. recorded a double-digit increase in sales in its Hefty waste and storage bags unit as people generate more trash at home. Americans are also reluctant to share homes that may already feel a bit crowded with bugs and other pests. Rollins Inc., a pest-control company that operates under the Orkin brand among others, said it had outpaced its previous 10 best sales days during the second quarter and the month of July, largely through inbound call volume. IN THE KITCHEN Americans have been eating more meals and snacks at home amid widespread teleworking and safety concerns about visiting restaurants. The chaos of the outside world also has many people reaching for comfort food. Demand for previously forsaken goods like cereal and frozen foods is lifting sales at companies such as Kellogg Co., which raised its guidance for the full year. Newell Brands Inc., the company behind Crock-Pots and Calphalon nonstick pans, said sales at U.S. retailers of its appliances and cookware products were up “double-digits” from a year ago. The stay-at-home lifestyle and a reluctance to venture into grocery stores has also benefited meal-kit maker HelloFresh SE, which increased its ranks of global active customers to 4.2 million in the most recent quarter, up from 2.4 million a year earlier. Its smaller, U.S.-based rival, Blue Apron Holdings Inc., also had an increase in demand. Crucially, both companies experienced a jump in orders per customer, a sign that the services are becoming more of a habit for their users. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-07-31	2020-07-31 18:14:52	MMM	3M Company	Buy Alpha Pro Tech Stock for Big Stockpiling and ‘Buy American’ Trends	Alpha Pro Tech (NYSEMKT:APT) stock is an excellent play. Not only does it benefit from demand for personal protective equipment for the novel coronavirus, but it benefits from stockpiling and the &quot;buy American&quot; sentiment. And APT stock comes with a reasonable valuation. With that in mind, I think APT stock still has room to run. Buy it now.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Alpha Pro Tech's headquarters are in Canada, but its manufacturing facility is located in Utah. That sounds pretty American to me. And in case APT stock is new to you, the company makes PPE like face masks, face shields and infection control suits.Not surprisingly, APT stock has soared during the pandemic. So has the company's revenue. In the first quarter, revenue jumped 47.5% year-over-year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd had an earthquake not impacted manufacturing in Q1, revenue would have been about $300,000 higher. Thankfully, it looks like the company has solved that problem. It said in April it expects to meet all orders for masks and shields through the beginning of Q4.APT stock has soared 66% in the last three months, nearly 535% this year, and 20% in the last month. I think shares have even more left in the tank. APT Stock Benefits From Stockpiling TrendsEven after the pandemic is over, the U.S. federal government, many American states and foreign countries will likely want to buy a large amount of PPE. Why? Everyone will want to be ready for the next pandemic. When the next pandemic occurs, no government will want to be caught unprepared and suffering from PPE shortages. The U.S. government has been there before.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for Beginners to Income Investing Additionally, even after a vaccine is ready, some Americans may choose not to receive it. Consequently, hospitals and paramedics will likely still have to treat a small number of novel coronavirus patients through 2021 or early 2022.Given these factors, Alpha Pro Tech's sales are likely to remain strong for some time. And I have more proof of that. When the company reported its Q1 results, it noted that it had taken orders for face shields and face masks that are not slated to be filled until the first half of 2021. 'Buy American' Trend Supports Alpha Pro TechTurning to the &quot;Buy American&quot; trend, many U.S. politicians have understandably become wary of the country's practice of importing much of its drugs, PPE and medical equipment from China. Tensions between the two nations are rapidly intensifying. And there have been cases in which China has sold dysfunctional PPE to the U.S. Because of this, it is logical for America to reduce its reliance on China for medical equipment.This issues with manufacturing go beyond China. At the start of the pandemic, the U.S. was competing with allies Germany and France for masks 3M (NYSE:MMM) had produced overseas. President Donald Trump and many Republican lawmakers have therefore been looking to increase domestic production of drugs and medical equipment. For example, Trump recently reached an agreement with Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK). The government provided a loan, and now Kodak will help produce generic drugs like hydroxychloroquine.But what happens if Trump loses in November? Former Vice President Joe Biden would likely not be as intent on reducing U.S. PPE imports from China. However, Biden's own &quot;Buy American&quot; plans suggest his administration would at least push the federal government to buy more PPE from U.S. companies.Thus, no matter who wins the election, Alpha Pro Tech's sales should stay meaningfully above their 2019 levels for the next several years. Valuation and the Bottom Line on APT StockA Seeking Alpha columnist recently estimated that, in an optimistic scenario, APT's 2020 earnings per share could reach $1.71. I believe that the company's EPS will drop by 20% in 2021. So its 2021 EPS could be about $1.40. Placing a price-earnings ratio of 25 times -- versus the market average of about 16 times -- on that EPS yields a forward price target of $35. That looks desirable against the current share price near $22.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 13 years.

2020-07-29	2020-07-29 15:45:42	MMM	3M Company	3M Disappoints With 2Q Earnings, RBC Capital Sticks To Hold	3M Company (MMM) 2Q earnings of $1.78 per share missed analysts’ expectations of $1.80. In addition, its revenues of $7.2 billion also fell short of the consensus estimate of $7.3 billion.The company reported a sharp fall in demand across all of its business segments amid the closure of retail stores. Meanwhile, 3M’s personal safety products experienced strong growth, driven by a surge in N95 mask sales.3M produced around 800 million respirators in the first half of this year and targets to produce 2 billion masks in 2020.On July 29, RBC Capital analyst Deane Dray lifted the stock's price target to $170 (9.4% upside potential) from $158 but reiterated a Hold rating. Dray said he is disappointed with the company’s 2Q earnings results and the weaker-than-expected margins outlook for 3Q. However, he remains encouraged about “a potential positive inflection in July sales, as month-to-date revenues were up low-single-digits from last year amid improvement across all geographies and businesses.”Currently, the Street has a cautious outlook on the stock.

2020-07-28	2020-07-28 17:18:44	MMM	3M Company	Unusual Options Activity Insight: 3M	Shares of 3M (NYSE: MMM) saw some unusual options activity on Tuesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $156.09.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-08-07  * Strike Price: $162.50  * Volume: 1014  * Open Interest: 5293 Indications of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual option activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.When a contract has an expiration date in the distant future, it is generally another sign of unusual activity. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being &quot;out of the money&quot;. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment   * Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price  * Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask priceThese observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish option activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Return On Capital Employed Overview: 3M  * Recap: 3M Q2 Earnings  * How Does 3M's Debt Look Like?(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-28	2020-07-28 16:57:49	MMM	3M Company	Return On Capital Employed Overview: 3M	3M (NYSE: MMM) saw a drop in both earnings and sales after Q2. Earnings dropped to $1.29 billion, a 81.7% decrease from the previous quarter. Sales fell to $7.18 billion, down 11.13% from the previous quarter. 3M reached earnings of $7.07 billion and sales of $8.07 billion in Q1.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q2, 3M posted an ROCE of 1.52%.View more earnings on MMMKeep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. For 3M, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q2 Earnings 3M reported Q2 earnings per share at $1.78/share against analyst predictions of $1.8/share.See more from Benzinga  * Recap: 3M Q2 Earnings  * How Does 3M's Debt Look Like?  * Earnings Scheduled For July 28, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-28	2020-07-28 14:22:29	MMM	3M Company	N95 Masks Aren't the Only Thing in Demand	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Dissecting earnings reports is always more of an art than a science. That’s particularly true in a pandemic, when the state of play changes at an ever-faster clip. With a surge in coronavirus cases in the U.S. Sun Belt and burgeoning concerns about a second wave in Europe and parts of Asia, any glimmers of insight from companies who operate on the ground floor of the economy carry extra weight. Nearly five months into this pandemic, CEOs in the manufacturing sector appear to at least have a handle on what’s happening with their businesses, for better or for worse. Tuesday brought results from three companies that sit at key fault lines in the industrial economy: 3M Co., Rockwell Automation Inc. and Raytheon Technologies Corp. Here are my top takeaways: 3M Co. : The maker of N95 masks has been on the front line of the pandemic, but even in normal recessions, it’s usually one of the first companies to see the early signs of a recovery, given the fast turnaround time for many of its products. So it’s particularly encouraging that 3M says it’s actually seeing July sales trending up by a low-single digit percentage compared to a year earlier. That compares with a 13.1% decline on an organic basis in the second quarter that was slightly worse that what analysts had been anticipating, one possible reason for the stock’s slide on the news. The forward trajectory is all that really matters at this point, though. Sales of N95 masks and other protective gear have undoubtedly been one big driver of the growth in July, with 3M on track to make two billion of the respirators this year. But other companies including Fastenal Co. and Cintas Corp. have predicted a moderation of the surge-style spikes seen in the earlier days of the pandemic in April and May as the market is now comparably better-supplied. More importantly, for those seeking signs of economic revival, 3M cited “broad-based sales improvements across businesses and geographies.” While this doesn’t necessarily augur a V-shaped recovery for the manufacturing sector, it does suggest things are moving in the right direction. The cloud over any rebound for 3M is its potential liabilities related to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which have been linked to cancer and other ailments. 3M reached an agreement last week with Alabama that will see it assess contamination from the so-called forever chemicals; invest in treatment and remediation; and research the substances impact on health and the environment — at an unspecified cost to the company. Some analysts had been expecting 3M to take another significant charge on PFAS in the second quarter and the missed opportunity to “kitchen-sink” what were going to be ugly numbers anyway may also be a factor in the stock reaction. Rockwell Automation Inc.: Continuing with the theme of possible green shoots of recovery, Rockwell CEO Blake Moret is confident enough in the trajectory of his company’s recovery that he announced intentions to roll back temporary pay cuts for employees by December and “hopefully sooner.” Rockwell also intends to make another “recognition payment” to manufacturing workers who have continued to come in to factories and kept its operations grinding along. While some companies have had to turn furloughs into permanent job cuts as the pandemic and associated economic slump have dragged on longer than expected, this is an important counterpoint. It speaks to a broader trend across the industrial landscape of companies prioritizing labor and seeking cost cuts elsewhere first in recognition of the unique nature of this particular downturn and shifting expectations of the corporate world’s duty to the community. Railroads CSX Corp. and Union Pacific Corp. have also said they are bringing workers off of furlough as volumes rebound. In terms of numbers, Rockwell actually increased its fiscal 2020 profit guidance for the year and now anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $7.40 to $7.60 on an organic sales decline of about 8%. This is based on an expectation that a “gradual recovery continues, with no increase in pandemic-related facility closures or disruptions to the supply chain.” Coming out of this crisis, Rockwell is set to be a key beneficiary of any significant push to bring manufacturing work back to North America. Raytheon Technologies Corp. : Whatever recovery is happening in manufacturing, it isn’t showing up in the world of commercial aerospace, with flight travel still at a crawl. Raytheon — formed earlier this year from the merger of United Technologies Corp. and Raytheon Co. — burned through nearly $250 million of cash in the first quarter as stable results from its defense businesses failed to offset a disastrous slump in the aerospace operations. The Collins Aerospace parts division, previously the company’s most profitable, was barely in the green on an adjusted basis in the second quarter and Raytheon took a $3.2 billion goodwill writedown on the roughly $30 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins Inc. in 2018 that helped form the unit. The charge reflects the deteriorating outlook for commercial aerospace due to the coronavirus, which no one could have predicted, but it’s worth remembering that the deal was very expensive from the start and the assumptions underpinning that price tag relied on quite a lot of things breaking the company’s way. The Pratt & Whitney engine segment saw sales tumble more than 30% excluding the impact of M&A and currency swings. Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes said the company had cut 8,000 positions in its commercial aerospace divisions and said some of that reduction would be permanent, a shift from the first quarter when he warned about cutting too deep. Arguably, things could have been uglier. The question now is whether the worst is truly behind the company. A slide in the earnings presentation termed “Current Environment” has big question marks next to projections for commercial air traffic and macroeconomic conditions. In case it wasn’t clear what those meant, they are also colored gray, as in this is a gray area.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-07-28	2020-07-28 09:30:21	MMM	3M Company	How Does 3M's Debt Look Like?	Shares of 3M Inc. (NYSE: MMM) rose by 9.85% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt 3M has.3M's Debt Based on 3M's balance sheet as of April 28, 2020, long-term debt is at $19.25 billion and current debt is at $3.25 billion, amounting to $22.50 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $4.25 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $18.24 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering 3M's $46.21 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.49. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry, whereas average for another.Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Earnings Scheduled For July 28, 2020  * P/E Ratio Insights for 3M(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-06-15	2020-06-15 14:10:00	MMM	3M Company	3M Reveals May Sales Slipped 20% To $2.2B	3M (MMM) has revealed that its total sales for May declined 20% year-on-year to $2.2 billion- a disappointment for investors hoping to see a material month-over-month improvement. Shares are currently trading down 2% on Monday.Meanwhile organic local-currency sales (which includes organic volume impacts and selling price changes) fell 21% while acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 2%. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1% year-on-year.Total sales declined 11% in Health Care, 12% in Consumer, 17% in Safety and Industrial, with the most severe drop of 30% in Transportation and Electronics.On a geographic basis, total sales declined 15% in Asia Pacific, 21% in the Americas, and 26% in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa). Notably, China’s recovery took a step backwards from up 7% in April to down -6% in May, marking a sequential deterioration even after adjusting for the extra selling days.MMM pointed out that the above sales information for May 2020 was impacted by two fewer business days. Excluding this headwind, the implied May organic sales decline of roughly -12% would have been sequentially in line with April.The company will have two additional business days in June 2020 versus June 2019. As a result, there will be no year-on-year business day impact for the second quarter.3M will host its second-quarter 2020 earnings conference call on July 28, 2020.Shares in MMM are currently trading down 13% on a year-to-date basis, and analysts have a cautious Hold consensus on the stock’s outlook. This breaks down into 3 recent buy ratings, 6 holds and 2 sells. (See MMM stock analysis on TipRanks).RBC Capital’s Deane Dray is one of the analysts staying on the sidelines. He notes that the company’s historical reputation for being a defensive “safe haven” has been eroded by its now-apparent sensitivity to demand softness and relatively limited forward visibility.“With an +80% short- cycle mix and lack of any large backlog to sustain operations, 3M is acutely exposed to negative inflection points in the cycle” the analyst explains. He has a $157 price target on the stock.Related News:  Tesla’s China Car Registrations Jump In May; Stock Down In Pre-Market On Analysts’ Rating Cuts  Extraction Oil & Gas Files For Bankruptcy; Announces $125M Funding Plan  Unilever To Invest €1 Billion In 10-Year Climate And Nature Fund More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * LabCorp Launches Neutralizing Antibody Test For Covid-19   * BAE Warns Of 15% Profit Drop In H1, Sees ‘Stronger Performance’ In H2   * Nordstrom Delays Annual 11-K SEC Filing, Reopens 90% Of Stores   * Google To Pay Publishers In Germany, Australia, Brazil For Content	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-reveals-may-sales-slipped-141000307.html?.tsrc=rss

(NYSE: MMM) has sued a third-party seller on Amazon.com Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN) e-commerce platform for engaging in price gouging of its products.What Happened A California individual, Mao Yu, and his affiliate companies, sold 3M's N95 masks for $23.21 apiece, 3M said in the lawsuit, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday.The company said the third-party seller inflated the price by more than 18 times, as a unit of its N95 masks usually sells for around $1.25, according to the Journal.Yu sold masks worth more than $350,000 on Amazon, the Journal reported.Why It Matters Amazon has faced criticism over delayed action against third-party sellers attempting to profit from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.Prices of essential items like hand sanitizer gels and facial masks were inflated as early as February in the United States as the coronavirus cases started getting reported outside of China.Amazon has said it has taken action against more than 6,000 sellers and called on the United States Congress to create a federal level law against price gouging during national emergencies.Price Action 3M shares closed 0.3% lower at $166.87 on Monday. The shares traded further 0.5% lower at $166.01 in the after-hours session.Amazon shares closed 1.6% higher at $2,524.06 on Monday and inched further higher at $2,526 in after-hours.See more from Benzinga  * Retailer Michaels' Shares Make All-Time Record 58.6% Jump As JPMorgan Upgrades Stock  * Tesla, Amazon Backer Baillie Gifford Invests M In Air Taxi Startup Lilium  * IBM Discontinues Facial Recognition Technology, Says It Can't Condone 'Racial Profiling' Or 'Mass Surveillance'(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Moreover, over the past month, the stock went up by 12.36%, but in the past year, fell by 0.85%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session.The stock is currently higher from its 52 week low by 46.32%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Specialty Industrial Machinery stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 25.06 in the Specialty Industrial Machinery industry, 3M Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 19.08. Shareholders might be inclined to think that they might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.P/E ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance.

However, their short- to intermediate-term prospects diverge widely.If you want to pick and choose among the bluest of blue chips, you can look at this full list of 30 Dow stocks that we've sorted by analysts' average recommendation. Here's how it works: S&P; Global Market Intelligence surveys analysts' stock calls and scores them on a five-point scale, where 1.0 equals a Strong Buy and 5.0 is a Strong Sell.

How Many Millionaires Are in the U.S.?Phoenix MI is tracking the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which could make for a very different landscape going forward. But last year, at least, the good times continued to roll. Indeed, a record 6.71% (or 8,386,508 out of 125,018,808 total U.S. households) can now claim millionaire status. That's up from 6.21% in 2018 and just 5.81% in 2017.Note well that to be considered a millionaire by the standards of wealth research, a household must have investable assets of $1 million or more, excluding the value of real estate, employer-sponsored retirement plans and business partnerships, among other select assets.Although California and New York have a great deal of millionaires in terms of raw numbers, they don't have the highest concentrations of rich households. It turns out there are numerous states with higher percentages of well-off households, several of which probably will surprise you.And don't forget that between living costs and taxes, a million dollars goes much further in some states than others.Here's a look at the millionaire rankings for all 50 states (plus the District of Columbia), based on the percentage of millionaire households in each. Just for good measure, we're also providing important tax and cost-of-living information.

2020-05-21	2020-05-21 16:41:51	MMM	3M Company	Ford Is the Poster Child for America's Grand Reopening	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- After a prolonged shutdown, Ford Motor Co. officially resumed production at its North American factories this week. It hasn’t been as smooth a process as the company might have hoped: Ford had to temporarily close two critical facilities this week to allow for a deep cleaning after workers tested positive for the coronavirus. An Explorer SUV plant in Chicago was closed a second time after an employee at a nearby supplier facility tested positive for the virus, causing a parts shortage.This is the reality of manufacturing for the time being as companies fret about worker safety and the legal and reputational risks of not doing enough to protect employees. Unlike Ford, whose products fall into a category of consumer spending that’s become even more discretionary amid the pandemic, wide swaths of the industrial sector were deemed essential and allowed to remain operational. Those companies, too, have had their share of growing pains as they adjust to a new way of working.Boeing Co. temporarily closed its factories in the Puget Sound area in March after a worker died of the coronavirus and later briefly shuttered work at its 787 plant in South Carolina. CBS Minnesota reported earlier this month that a Honeywell International Inc. facility in Minneapolis had closed after a worker tested positive. Whirlpool Corp. closed its Amana, Iowa, refrigerator plant at least twice after employees tested positive for the virus, according to the Gazette local paper. Deere & Co. and Altria Group Inc.’s Philip Morris USA are among the many others that have had to close plants on a limited basis to avoid outbreaks among workers. Lockheed Martin Corp., meanwhile, said this week it will temporarily slow production of the F-35 fighter jet because of delays at suppliers.  It’s a lot harder, though, to bring factories back to life than it is to just figure it out as you go along. Ford may be a manufacturer, but because it’s one of the few to have experienced an extended lockdown, it’s arguably a better benchmark for the non-industrial economy. You better believe that office-based companies that have sent most of their workers home are keeping a close eye on how the likes of Ford fare in flipping the switch back on. Seeing the automaker’s setbacks this week, companies that can operate without their employees clustered in the same place may be less keen to rush back. They’re getting a more continuous stream of work out of their employees now than they would if they had to hit the pause button and clear out the office every few weeks. And the mixed messages from the White House aren't helpful: President Donald Trump is due to visit a Ford factory in Michigan that’s been converted to ventilator production and has been wishy-washy on whether he will adhere to the company’s face-mask requirements. Already, American Express Co. CEO Steve Squeri and Visa Inc. CEO Al Kelly said this week that most of their employees would work from home for the rest of the year. Some 28% of employers recently surveyed by Challenger, Gray & Christmas said they would make work-from-home arrangements permanent for at least some employees. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and social media site Twitter Inc. are among those who have publicly said remote working will be their indefinite default option. Facebook Inc. said Thursday it would follow suit and move to a more permanent remote workforce.At the end of the day, manufacturing or non-manufacturing, it's all interconnected. How permanent this shift to work from home will be is debatable, but if companies end up needing less office space, by default that means fewer HVAC systems, commercial lighting, fire and security products or even 3M Co.’s Post-it notes. And if workers aren’t going to be commuting, do they still need to buy cars from Ford? There's a lot riding on getting reopening right.     This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-05-15	2020-05-15 20:59:27	MMM	3M Company	Dow Jones Today: Another Data Defying Day As Retail Spend Plummeted	"Stocks rallied to close the week, again showing resilience in the face of troubling economic data. An extension of the oil rebound and more positive reopening also provided some ballast to equities.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 climbed 0.39%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.25%  * The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.79%  * After being one of the Dow components worst hit by the novel coronavirus, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) was the index leader today on news Florida is taking steps to reopen theme parks, including Disney World in Orlando.Onto the data, which were again dismal. A report released earlier today by the Federal Reserve indicates industrial production plunged 11.2% last month, the worst decline on record (and that data spans more than a century). Even with that, Dow members from the industrial sector 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) closed higher today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSeparately, the Commerce Department said retail spending tumbled 16.4% in April, far worse than the 12% drop economists expected. The April decline follows an 8.3% in March.  * 20 Stocks to Buy If You're Still Betting on America to Thrive Data points like those are sure to cap gains, but the broader market moved higher even as just 14 of 30 Dow names were higher in late trading. Showing Some StrengthNeither of the aforementioned data points would appear to be conducive to success for a stock like Home Depot (NYSE:HD), yet the home improvement retailer was one of the Dow leaders Friday. Today's strength in the name is relevant for several reasons, not the least of which is that the company reports earnings on Tuesday. More Boeing DramaAs has been widely documented, any road to recovery for Boeing (NYSE:BA) is likely to be bumpy and long. Add another bump to that road today following a Barron's article that points out Boeing isn't too big to fail.That doesn't mean Boeing will disappear, but investors shouldn't expect the company will get the same treatment some banks got during the global financial crisis. Bottom line: Boeing is going to have clean up its own backyard. Industrial CarnageAs noted above, a couple of Dow stocks hailing from the industrial sector fought of the weak, related data. Boeing didn't, but the real laggard from the sector Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX). Not only was Raytheon the worst-performing Dow stock today, somewhat quietly it's lower by more than 13% over the past month. No Upgrade HelpGoldman Sachs' (NYSE:GS) joined other financial stocks in the losers column today, even after earning an upgradeto ""outperform"" from ""market perform"" from BMO Capital Markets.""GS's strong capital position, relatively small loan book, limited reliance on spread income, and ongoing expense/ funding initiatives leave GS well-positioned versus most of the money center banks,"" said the research firm. Tepid CoverageMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closed slightly higher after Citibank initiated coverage of the tech giant with a ""neutral"" rating.""We do view shares as somewhat defensive in an uncertain environment, however the downside of the product cycle as well as margin impacts of Xbox launch could reverse some of the favorable trends that benefitted numbers in the earlier part of FY20 (upside to high-margin software franchise,"" said the bank. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIn another day when bad data commanded headlines, but stocks still rose, I thought the following from FactSet might be interesting. To boil it down, companies announcing negative earnings surprises this year aren't being punished in the fashion investors would expect.""Companies in the S&P 500 that have reported negative earnings surprises for Q1 have seen a decrease in price of 1.1% on average from two days before the company reported actual results through two days after the company reported actual results,"" according to the research firm.That percentage decline is below the five-year average of 2.8%.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-05-15	2020-05-15 15:39:07	MMM	3M Company	Bad News Is Good News for Today’s 3M Stock Investors	When it comes to Dow Jones Industrial Average stock 3M (NYSE:MMM), investors have been faced with their share of ailments off and on the price chart. But following a new sales report, will the old doggish trend in MMM stock remain the bears' best friend? Or will it mark new profitable beginnings for bulls? Let's take a closer look at what's going on with 3M right now.Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Many stocks in today's market can point to the novel coronavirus as a source for challenges facing those companies in an unfolding socially distanced environment. Take a look at the grounding in airline giant Delta Airlines (NASDAQ:DAL) or the TKO in casino heavyweight Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) as two common victims. It's not pretty. That's not the entire story though.Many blue-chip stocks within the Dow Jones are adapting. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is one constituent whose price chart points at a company figuring out how to successfully service consumers through the coronavirus pandemic. And tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the market's largest publicly traded company, simply appears to be well-built for this unthinkable, disruptive socioeconomic shift. Unfortunately, 3M (and, by extension, MMM stock) is different.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite the industrial conglomerate's well-positioned N-95 respirator mask success during the new pandemic and some spoils from other health-related business units, 3M's April sales dipped 11% from the year ago period according to a report released Thursday. Softness in other key market segments, including safety and industrial, consumer, transportation and electronics weighed on the company's total sales decline.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week The news comes after 3M announced in late April it was withdrawing full-year guidance due to the pandemic. Management stated it will keep investors informed vis-a-vis monthly updates until a more accurate, longer-term forecast is possible. The first of these reports also appears to have been a surprise for Wall Street.MMM stock slid to its weakest levels since late March during Thursday's session. However, a rebound in the broader market from out-the-gate selling following back-to-back days of profit-taking helped lift the stock well off intraday lows to close down just 0.75%.But is 3M a pullback worth buying? MMM Stock Monthly Price Chart  Source: Charts by TradingViewEarnings at the tail end of April saw investors bid up MMM stock by more than 2.50% and notch a two-month high. The action also established follow-through confirmation for a bullish monthly chart hammer candlestick formed during March's broader market correction. That's not all though.Technically, the hammer is well-supported by the 62% retracement level dating to 3M's 2009 financial crisis bottom. Also favorable, the candlestick's body completed narrowly above a long-term trend-line. It's the sort of evidence that makes the case for a meaningful bottom following a two-year long bear market. But a hard pullback over the past two weeks might raise a flag regarding the pattern's durability.A second look at 3M's monthly chart reveals the immediate post-earnings bid has yielded to another potential lower high pattern in MMM stock's existing downtrend. The rally high also failed rather quickly on an initial challenge of nearby resistance. It's not the sort of price action investors caught purchasing 3M's hammer are likely excited to see.The good news, if any, is 3M's stock is offering a pullback opportunity with solid risk versus reward characteristics. Shares are inside a support area from roughly $115 to $141 and above the trend-line, which held the body of April's hammer. Stochastics have also signaled a bullish crossover inside oversold territory.My advice for any would be buyers of 3M is to set a stop-loss beneath $129. This level minimizes dollar risk to about 5% as of Thursday's close. At the same time, relative to the recent high a return of nearly 20% is possible and skews the risk profile heavily in favor of buying stock. Moreover and to make sure an old and friendly doggish trend doesn't continue to rollover, this exit smartly pulls the plug if a bearish April pivot high is confirmed and 3M falls ominously inside the lower half of its hammer bottom.The information offered is based upon Christopher Tyler's observations and strictly intended for educational purposes only; the use of which is the responsibility of the individual.

2020-05-13	2020-05-13 21:00:00	MMM	3M Company	How Alibaba’s Lazada Turned Produce Dumped In Virus Crisis Into a Business	(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.Farmers in Cameron Highlands, a cradle of Malaysia’s agricultural industry, dumped hundreds of tons of produce in March after Covid-19 lockdowns shuttered wholesale markets and restaurants across the nation. They also gave Alibaba a chance to crack a difficult arena.Lazada Group SA, the Southeast Asian subsidiary of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., opened a virtual store to link farmers and homebound Malaysians. The uptake surprised even the e-commerce giant: consumers bought an average of 1.5 tons of cabbages, carrots and spinach each day. On the fourth day, 3.5 tons of veggies were sold in less than half an hour. By the third week, about 70 tons had been delivered from farms to doorsteps across the country.Fresh groceries -- now one of the top three categories on Lazada Malaysia -- weren’t even an option there three months ago. Before the novel coronavirus, Lazada had dedicated grocery arms only in Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines; after the outbreak, it’s expanded to Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia. It’s keen to maintain that momentum, backed by 30 fulfillment centers across 17 cities in the region.“Covid-19 is a catalyst of digital transformation in Southeast Asia,” Lazada Group Chief Executive Officer Pierre Poignant said in an interview. “When consumers build a habit, it doesn’t easily go away. E-commerce will become a way of life.”Read more: Southeast Asia’s Internet Economy to Top $100 Billion This YearDemand for fresh groceries has surged globally, but the spike in Malaysia opened a window in particular for China’s largest online commerce company into a lucrative market after years of building one of the region’s largest delivery networks. Since March, more agricultural entrepreneurs, fisheries and local businesses have started to pivot brick-and-mortar business to e-commerce, according to Lazada Malaysia Chief Operating Officer Shah Suriye Rubhen. The festive period of Ramadan, in a country where more than half the population is Muslim, has also galvanized demand and farmers have responded by increasing their assortment of goods on offer.“Local SMEs are realizing that digitizing their business is the way forward to remain sustainable in the long-term, diversify their revenue stream, and market to the increasingly growing internet economy,” Shah said.Alibaba’s unit may have scored in Cameron Highlands, but the wider Southeast Asian market remains heavily contested.Read more: New Alibaba Chief Explains Why He Wants to Kill His Own BusinessLazada, started in 2012 by Rocket Internet before Alibaba eventually bought full control of the company, was the first e-commerce outfit to serve six countries in Southeast Asia. But its fiercest rival Shopee, a unit of Singapore’s Sea Ltd., has expanded aggressively in the past year and overtaken Lazada as the most visited website in 2019, according to research firm iPrice Group.In Indonesia, the largest and most promising market in the region, Alibaba-backed Tokopedia ranks as the top e-commerce company based on web traffic, followed by Shopee, Bukalapak and Lazada. Blibli is the online grocery leader, while “Shopee, Tokopedia and Lazada are playing fast catch-up,” said Roshan Raj, a Singapore-based partner at research firm RedSeer Consulting.It’s not just the e-commerce giants -- the resurgence in online grocery has attracted new entrants from adjacent industries. Singapore’s Qoo10 Pte was particularly swift to act when the government ordered bubble tea shops to temporarily shut along with other non-essential services, offering DIY bubble tea kits. Even meal delivery firm Foodpanda started grocery delivery.At home in Singapore, Lazada’s Lazmall, where brands sell directly to consumers, has recently attracted big names like Under Armour Inc. in Singapore and Thailand, Starbucks Corp. and 3M Co. in Indonesia and department store chain Robinsons, which is shutting one of its three Singapore outlets in August.“There are brands that I would not have imagined would come to e-commerce,” Poignant said.The 41-year-old Frenchman, a co-founder who took the helm last year, says Lazada is interested in grocery deals, including acquisitions and joint ventures, in Southeast Asia. “We are very open to that,” he said, adding the company isn’t in concrete discussions at the moment. His firm last month teamed up with Indonesia’s Rumah Sayur Group to source vegetables from 2,500 farmers in West Java.Lazada acquired Singaporean e-grocer RedMart in 2016. It struggled to meet demand and had to temporarily suspend new grocery orders in April to make adjustments. Poignant said changes made to RedMart helped the company serve 50% more customers each day a month later.“Southeast Asia’s e-commerce market is likely to move from a subsidy game to a quality game,” said Lai Chang Wen, CEO of Singapore-based Ninja Van, which helps e-commerce clients deliver more than a million packages daily in the region. “This shift will be pivotal and have a lasting impact.”Read more: Alibaba Bets on Frenchman to Lead High-Stakes Southeast Asia ExpansionPoignant argues Alibaba’s technologies will help differentiate Lazada, starting with live-streaming. He said Lazada is the only player in Southeast Asia that allows consumers to immediately buy items they see on a stream. By the end of June, Lazada plans to host more than 1,000 daily sessions, up from 4,000 per week now. In April, some 7,000 new live stream accounts were created, up 70% from the pre-pandemic era.Alibaba’s artificial intelligence technology is another asset. Lazada has more than 100 people working on personalizing its experience, part of Lazada’s 9,000-strong workforce across six countries.For the Chinese e-commerce behemoth, Lazada is the single most important piece of its globalization strategy. It aims to serve 300 million Southeast Asians by 2030, up from 65 million now, according to Poignant.Underscoring that ambition, Alibaba last week struck a deal to buy half of Singapore’s AXA Tower, valued at S$1.68 billion ($1.2 billion). Poignant says the 50-story landmark, already home to 3,000 Lazada staff, has very good feng shui. The cylindrical structure was inspired by a stack of coins and originally built as the country’s Treasury Building in 1986. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong once had an office in the building, Poignant added.“Southeast Asia is an absolutely critical market for Alibaba,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-lazada-turned-produce-dumped-210000660.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-05-13	2020-05-13 10:47:15	MMM	3M Company	3M Holds Good On Its Promise To Prioritize Dividend	The 3M (MMM) board of directors have declared a dividend on the company’s common stock of $1.47 per share for the second quarter of 2020.The dividend is payable June 12, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 22, 2020.Respirator-maker 3M has paid dividends to its shareholders without interruption for more than 100 years.As of March 31, 2020, 3M had 575,196,371 common shares outstanding and 73,417 shareholders of record.The company recently withdrew financial guidance for 2020, halted buybacks, cut capex, and reaffirmed its commitment to prioritize the dividend.3M also revealed that it aims to double its production of N95 respirators to 2 billion by year-end to meet the escalating global demand.“We are mindful of the fact that 3M is one of the highest-quality Multi-Industry companies, as defined by our Investment Framework, with a coveted spot among the illustrious Primes” commented RBC Capital analyst Deane Dray on April 28.“That said, we believe that the company’s historical reputation for being a defensive “safe haven” has been eroded by its now-apparent sensitivity to demand softness and relatively limited forward visibility.”As a result the analyst reiterated his hold rating while bumping up the price target from $143 to $148. Indeed the stock has an overall Hold analyst consensus, with 4 recent buy ratings vs 6 hold ratings and 2 sell ratings.Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $166 suggests 17% upside potential lies ahead.

Another vendor attempted to sell 10 million N95 respirators to the Florida Division of Emergency Management at nearly 460% percent over list prices.The claims, filed in Florida, Wisconsin and Indiana, are part of 3M’s global effort to protect the public and combat fraud and counterfeiting. “We are grateful that in each of these cases, the false offers were reported to 3M, and the attempts to deceive public officials did not succeed,” said Ivan Fong, 3M Senior VP. “We will continue to take legal action in cases like these and are working closely with national and international law enforcement to help stop the perpetrators of these unlawful and unethical schemes.”As the company points out, 3M has not changed the prices it charges for respirators as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak. It also said it will donate any damages recovered to coronavirus-related nonprofit organizations.In total, 3M has now filed 10 lawsuits in April in its effort to combat fraud. The company, which is currently trading down 16% on a year-to-date basis, has a Hold consensus from the Street and $166 average analyst price target (12% upside potential). (See 3M stock analysis on TipRanks). RBC Capital analyst Deane Dray notes that 3M aims to double its production of N95 respirators to 2 billion by year-end to meet the escalating global demand.However he warns investors that “the company’s historical reputation for being a defensive “safe haven” has been eroded by its now-apparent sensitivity to demand softness and relatively limited forward visibility.” Dray has a Hold rating on the stock and $148 price target (0.4% downside potential).Related News:  Billionaire Warren Buffett Divests Airline Stakes, Sees No ‘Attractive’ Investments  Goldman Sachs: These 3 Stocks Are Poised to Surge by at Least 30%  Amazon Dips 8% on $4 Billion Virus Costs Amid Prospect For 2Q Loss	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-files-legal-actions-over-142251834.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-01	2020-05-01 17:46:46	MMM	3M Company	3M Stock Is Safe to Own Through This Global Mess	"There's an old saying that ""somewhere in the middle lies the truth."" That's part of the story behind 3M (NYSE:MMM) being a stock to own even during these uncertain times.Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Lately, the stock markets have been on a tear. In fact, the April rallies set records not seen since 1987, 1974 and 2000 for the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, respectively. The small caps coming into Thursday had rallied six days in a row for at least 1% each day.To its credit, MMM stock is also 34% higher than it was just 28 days ago. Stocks have roared back to about halfway of the coronavirus crash. And as the saying goes, somewhere in the middle is truth, so it's not as crazy as it seems.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI am not suggesting that it's all up hill from here on the contrary I expect a fade. Stock charts are full of valleys and crests. There is a natural price pattern that unfolds in almost all charts I've ever studied. When long extensions like the recent crash happen, on the way back the price usually stalls around midway. That's why technicians quote the Fibonacci ratios to point that out.  * 7 Fundamentally Solid Dividend Stocks to Buy But, jargon aside, you can easily see that using no tools and just an eyeball. Resistance there is natural, so by definition, I anticipate a swoon. This helps establish a better base for the bulls going forward. MMM Stock Has Support Below and Opportunity AboveSource: Charts, by TradingView I would own MMM shares here, even though I know they could drop a bit soon.I know this won't be the perfect place to start, but over the long term, it's not that important. The stock should have strong support around $145 per share and more of it into $136. Conversely, a breakout from $160 would then trigger a big rally to challenge the January highs. Meanwhile, I am somewhat concerned with investor exuberance in April posing a threat to MMM stock.But my bigger concern is 3M being stuck in the horrendous descending channel it has been in since the 2018 highs. So I would patiently wait for that to happen.Towards the middle of March I wrote about buying the novel coronavirus dip in 3M. It rallied more than 20% after that, so it's fair to say that the trade played out well.But what about now?Nothing has really changed since my last write up. The hoopla over the masks and ventilators has abated a bit. Yet demand for such personal protective equipment (PPE) is still growing, despite the squabble no longer making news. So the company can go about its business. In fact management reported earnings this week and the results were solid despite of the headwinds. 3M management has earned the benefit of the doubt on Wall Street. Get Paid to Go Long 3MSo you're thinking of buying the shares here, but wish MMM stock was a little lower so you would have more conviction? Or, at some point recently you thought you missed the MMM rally from the perfect bottom?Options trades create income from the possibility of buying the shares lower. Instead of buying the shares now and risking $152, you can sell the MMM October $110 put and collect $3 per contract today. If the price stays above $110, then you can keep the premiums as pure profit without any out-of-pocket expense.Otherwise, you own the shares and your breakeven price is $107 per share. In essence, with this play, you're long with a 30% buffer from the current level and you don't even need a rally to retain your gains.Ultimately, this solid 118 year-old American company has an impeccable record, a strong balance sheet and a very healthy and diversified income stream. This makes it the poster child of what businesses are likely to survive this virus crisis and thrive thereafter.Although there are no sure things on Wall Street, this is as good as it gets. It's hard to imagine a scenario where MMM stock fails and the rest of the market is healthy.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2020-05-01	2020-05-01 14:27:51	MMM	3M Company	10 Dow Jones Stocks to Keep Your Portfolio Afloat	"As our country wrestles with the economic damage caused by the novel coronavirus in the first quarter, many investors are understandably charting their longer-term strategies. But according to Hiroyuki Ito, professor of Economics in Portland State's College of Urban and Public Affairs, the second quarter's trajectory depends on ""how much the world succeeds in curbing the spread of the virus."" Given the uncertainties, bullish contrarians may want to go with a tried-and-true approach: purchasing high-quality Dow Jones stocks.Major blue chips have always enjoyed relevance regardless of the market cycle. Known for their stability and technical predictability, Dow Jones stocks can help mitigate any unexpected downfalls as you gear your portfolio for higher growth during bull markets. But in a downturn, these steady names are even more valuable.Typically, blue chips pay dividends, which allow you to accrue passive income while you wait out a storm. Additionally, Dow Jones stocks are levered to critical businesses. Therefore, they are likely to keep the red ink manageable as opposed to speculative growth companies, which can quickly raise your blood pressure to dangerous levels. You may even see an uptick in momentum, depending on the circumstances.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 of the Best Food Stocks to Buy Right Now Further, the corporations that make up the Dow 30 usually dominate their industries. Thus, any consolidation effect that could occur during a bearish phase could end up benefiting Dow Jones stocks. Specifically, I'm targeting these ten names:  * 3M (NYSE:MMM)  * Home Depot (NYSE:HD)  * Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)  * Walmart (NYSE:WMT)  * McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  * Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)  * IBM (NYSE:IBM)  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  * Nike (NYSE:NKE)  * Disney (NYSE:DIS)As with any other investment that has been deeply impacted by the coronavirus, caution is still the name of the game. Even with Dow Jones stocks, you don't want to get too comfortable. Take a modest position now, but make sure to have some ammo remaining for any dip-diving opportunities. 3M (MMM)Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com Although industrial giant 3M had obvious positive implications from the coronavirus -- as you know, they make the highly demanded N95 facemasks -- the first three months of 2020 weren't particularly pleasant for MMM stock. Along with the fact that neither consumers nor healthcare professionals could get reasonable access to 3M's personal protective equipment, the company faced accusations of selling their vital products to foreign entities.Some handwringing and President Trump's invoking of the Defense Protection Act appeared to have calmed tensions. Quickly, MMM stock responded with a robust performance so far in April. While these hiccups were not ideal from a PR perspective, the drama can't detract from the obvious.Previously, 3M was a lumbering, irrelevant organization. Now, they're one of the most critical. In fact, MMM stock has inserted itself into a national debate of restarting our core infrastructure. If so, that would be a big win for American industry, which is why you should keep 3M on your list of Dow Jones stocks to buy. Home Depot (HD)Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com Understandably, when the coronavirus panic first hit the U.S., many investors speculated on grocery firms like Kroger (NYSE:KR). Of course, it was a brilliant move as KR has enjoyed strong upside. But among Dow Jones stocks, Home Depot will probably benefit from a similar sentiment over the next few months.Just like Kroger shares, an investment in HD stock gives you exposure to an essential service. Obviously, most people are concerned about having enough food and water. But once that anxiety subsides, we quickly come to a stark realization: life's mishaps don't pause just because human societies are suffering from a pandemic.  * 7 Fundamentally Solid Dividend Stocks to Buy I'll give you a silly but pertinent example. When I thought I had my basics covered, that's when the bathroom lightbulb went out. I had spares, but I realized that for many people, incidents like these have caught them out. Therefore, even in a prolonged recession, I expect consistent demand to bolster HD stock. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com For most investments, including several Dow Jones stocks, the Covid-19 pandemic is just about the worst news that could happen. And I'm not suggesting that Johnson & Johnson was hoping for such an outbreak to occur. Nevertheless, I can't help but look at JNJ stock with some sense of cynicism. Without the coronavirus, we may be looking at Johnson & Johnson from a different lens.Obviously, the ongoing asbestos controversy has cast a dark cloud on JNJ stock. Last year in October, shares took it in the chin when Johnson & Johnson announced a voluntary recall of its baby powder product due to asbestos contamination. Also, shares have reacted wildly to the company's involvement in the drug addiction crisis.Today? When JNJ stock flashes across your screen, you're probably not thinking about any of these devastating controversies. Instead, you're thinking about the healthcare giant's many positives, including their over-the-counter medication portfolio that has allowed people with mild Covid-19 symptoms to recover. Walmart (WMT)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com As our own Tim Biggam argued, Walmart shares right now look ""tired and toppy,"" to use his language. Admittedly, I find it difficult to argue against that assessment. Plus, the fact that WMT stock is acting like this ahead of Walmart's earnings report doesn't inspire much confidence. But should shares tumble, you may want to consider adding the big-box retailer to your list of Dow Jones stocks to buy.As I mentioned near the top, Walmart may benefit from a consolidation effect. Again, as a big-box retailer, Walmart offers consumers everything. Therefore, in a prolonged recession, I would have concerns about specialty retailers. After all, why would you shop at multiple locations when you can get both your necessities and your discretionary items in one place?  * 7 U.S. Stocks to Buy on Coronavirus Weakness That said, you want to exercise some caution with WMT stock relative to other Dow Jones stocks. Although I like the coronavirus lift, holiday sales were soft in 2019 for brick-and-mortar retailers. Thus, it's one warning sign to watch, especially if we enter a nasty recession. McDonald's (MCD)Source: CHALERMPHON SRISANG / Shutterstock.com Out of the Dow Jones stocks to consider for recession-proofing your portfolio, McDonald's is one of the more perplexing names. Especially with a pandemic-fueled recession, you wouldn't expect MCD stock to do well. For starters, customers must worry about how their food is handled, especially by low-income workers who feel they must work instead of calling in sick. Then there's the simple fact that it's much cheaper to cook your own food.At the same time, even in economic downturns, people need a respite from their day-to-day struggles. For some, that may mean downsizing their dining out budget to fast-food eateries. In that case, purchasing MCD stock on any dips may be a shrewd acquisition.Better yet, strong evidence exists for this approach. During the Great Recession, several fast-food restaurants saw an increase in sales. Therefore, it's reasonable that to believe that MCD could move higher, if only for the reason that humans are predictable. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com If you're thinking about literal consumption-based Dow Jones stocks to buy, you may want to check out Coca-Cola. Just like McDonald's, KO stock doesn't immediately grab you as the best investment to avoid a coronavirus-fueled recession. Plain old water is much cheaper. Plus, drinking too much soda is very bad for your health. Not to belabor the point, but excessive consumption can also cause the underlying health conditions for which Covid-19 is especially deadly.On the flipside, KO stock represents cheap escapism. During bull markets, people may have more expensive tastes for their celebratory occasions. Today, with money being much tighter, consumers will naturally cut back their expenses. But it's unlikely that they'll give up all frivolous pleasures in life.  * The 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Years Another point to consider about KO stock is that its underlying products are cheap pick-me-ups. As caffeinated drinks, Coca-Cola beverages offer a far less expensive alternative to iced coffee from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), for example. Thus, you don't want to ignore this icon if you're focusing exclusively on Dow Jones stocks. IBM (IBM)Source: Laborant / Shutterstock.com Considering the damage that was inflicted on Dow Jones stocks by the Covid-19 pandemic, IBM produced solid results for its first-quarter 2020 earnings report. Against an earnings-per-share target of $1.80, Big Blue delivered $1.84. It also rang up $17.57 billion in revenue, which was a bit short of the $17.62 billion that analysts forecasted. However, the coronavirus impacted its growth opportunities.But that's not the reason why I'm bullish on IBM stock. As we put this ugly chapter behind us, there will be plenty of non-impacted earnings reports to dissect. Rather, the technology giant saw tremendous growth in certain segments even with the virus disrupting everything.According to an email sent to me by Tim Davidson from IBM Corporate Communications, ""despite the massive impact of COVID-19 in Italy, IBM's business grew there by 5 percent -- a remarkable performance that shows how clients turn to IBM in crucial situations for advanced technology and trusted data management and analysis.""In times of trouble, people trust the technologies and innovations from respected brands. I couldn't think of a better reason to bet on IBM stock. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com Historically, Dow Jones stocks have been levered to big, industrial names. But over the last few years, the index has incorporated much more relevant companies like Microsoft. What I like about MSFT stock is that while this security probably won't make you rich, it provides steady returns. Also, I love how the management team reinvigorated a software firm that was going stale.Despite this coronavirus pandemic, I think Microsoft's strengths shine through. For example, because of the nature of my profession, I would be dead in the water without the company's Software as a Solution platform. Yes, other business suites exist but whether you like it or not, the world runs on Microsoft. That's one viable reason to consider MSFT stock.  * 9 of the Best Food Stocks to Buy Right Now Another is that the leadership team emphasizes constant innovation and competitiveness. As a prime example, they're making huge waves in the cloud computing space, giving Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) fits. Also, the company offers Microsoft Teams as an intuitive teleconferencing alternative to Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM). Nike (NKE)Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.com Right now, I'm not a big fan of consumer retail names. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the retail segment suffered the worst hit in March. Within this category, the clothing and accessories segment was absolutely obliterated. Thus, you wouldn't expect much from Nike and NKE stock.But if you're a daring individual, you may just want to consider putting it in your prospective list of Dow Jones stocks. As Matt McCall recently pointed out, Nike has tremendous customer loyalty that is unparalleled within the athletic apparel industry. A great example is the Colin Kaepernick controversy. Typically, companies avoid scandalous players like Kaepernick because it's bad for branding. But Nike knew their audience and ran an advertisement featuring the polarizing figure.Initially, some conservatives pushed back against the apparel behemoth. However, NKE stock won out in the end, driven by strong customer response. I imagine if Nike can get away with a Kaepernick ad, the coronavirus may not be that much of a challenge. Disney (DIS)Source: chrisdorney.Shutterstock.com Fundamentally, when you stack up Disney against other Dow Jones stocks, it's hard to imagine a more embattled organization. Actually, the oil companies like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) are much worse. But DIS stock is taking it on the chin in its underlying pivotal businesses.With movie theaters shut down due to Covid-19, it has unfairly lost hundreds of millions of dollars in box office revenue. Further, with stay-at-home orders, Disney's resort business is non-existent. Then, you have the fact that there are no professional sports. If Disney-owned ESPN wasn't already pointless, the coronavirus proved it in cruel fashion.  * 7 Fundamentally Solid Dividend Stocks to Buy Yet I don't expect this pandemic to be with us forever. When we finally reopen and the fear subsides, DIS stock could be a huge beneficiary of pent-up demand. It will take time, though, so be careful with this one.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

2020-04-28	2020-04-28 17:17:47	MMM	3M Company	You Saw The Earnings, But What Did CEOs Say?	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Tuesday was a jam-packed day for earnings across all sectors. In the industrial landscape, I paid closest attention to 3M Co., Caterpillar Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc., each a bellwether in its own right. You can find the specifics on earnings numbers in the companies’ news releases here, here and here, but in this time of unprecedented volatility, what CEOs are saying about how they are running their businesses is more telling. Here are my top takeaways:3M: Like many companies, 3M has suspended its 2020 guidance given the unpredictable nature of the coronavirus outbreak and rolling economic shutdowns, but in an effort to provide more transparency, the maker of Post-it notes is now going to provide monthly sales updates — broken down by geography and business segment — for the foreseeable future. This follows Emerson Electric Co.’s marathon two-hour-plus earnings call last week that featured presentations by not only the CEO and CFO but also the heads of its main business divisions. It’s nice to see companies setting the bar high on disclosures during this period of upheaval; hopefully others follow suit. The second quarter is expected to bring the worst of the virus impact, and 3M is cutting $350 million to $400 million of costs in the period to adjust to lower demand. Notably, however, much of that involves discretionary spending on things like travel, external services and advertising, rather than cuts to payroll, which 3M says it’s trying to minimize. It’s using furloughs, but they’re paid leaves, and in other cases, employees are being asked to take vacation. Bear in mind that 3M had announced a restructuring plan in January, separate from the coronavirus, that would see it eliminate some 1,500 jobs, so it’s hardly a corporate saint. But given its sales of N95 respirators, you’d be hard-pressed to find a company that better understands the toll the virus is taking, and 3M seems to legitimately want to to do the right thing by its workforce. Like others in the industrial sector, the company also appears wary of cutting too deep and being unprepared for an eventual recovery. 3M is clearly conscious of its image after having its name dragged through the mud by President Donald Trump and billionaire Mark Cuban over production and sales of N95 respirators. The company devoted an entire slide in its earnings presentation to the topic. 3M has already doubled global N95 output to 100 million per month and is investing in capacity to double that yet again; it’s directed 90% of production to health-care workers, with the remainder going to other critical industries such as food production; and the company has cut loose some distributors who acted “unethically” and is pursuing numerous lawsuits amid allegations of price gouging. The company also made a point of highlighting its 76 plants and distribution centers across the U.S. in an apparent nod toward calls for a revival of America’s manufacturing might. “3M has never left our home country,” CEO Michael Roman said on the call. CATERPILLAR : The maker of bulldozers and backhoes is also holding off on sweeping job cuts, and it made an interesting argument as to why that’s the case. Caterpillar held headcount as well as administrative, manufacturing and research spending relatively flat from 2016 to 2019, even as sales increased some 40%. That means there’s less to cut when a downturn hits, CEO Jim Umpleby said on a call to discuss the company’s first-quarter results. It also means Caterpillar doesn’t have to use up cash to pay out large amounts of severance, and “cash is obviously king in this environment,” Umpleby said. So the overall effect is that margins and cash flow will be higher than historically, even though the chaotic nature of the coronavirus outbreak and supply-chain disruptions will likely prevent the company from reaching its targets on those metrics. While Caterpillar has suspended share buybacks and is delaying some R&D and capital expenditure projects with less visible returns, it made the decision to continue investing in growing its services business and expanding its product offerings because it continues to view those initiatives as key to its longer-term profitability. That’s a positive sign that the coronavirus hasn’t completely zapped CEOs’ appetite for investment.UPS: The good news for the package-delivery company is that its services have never been more important as store shutdowns and fear of contagion drive more consumers to online ordering. The bad news is that the spike in sales is coming at the expense of its profit margin. Why? It’s partly due to the sporadic nature of residential deliveries, which  makes the process more expensive than shipping to businesses, and also because of the increased expenses involved in keeping workers safe. The knock-on costs of the coronavirus — including the expense of doing extra cleaning and providing workers with protective gear — amounted to $140 million in the first quarter. That’s an important data point to keep in mind as companies across less essential industries start bringing people back to work. Like Caterpillar, UPS will maintain investments in strategic priorities such as automation to help bolster its longer-term profitability. An expected $1 billion reduction in capital expenditures is going to come largely from a rethink of certain facilities projects and a delay in vehicle purchases. The company is also working with its customers when it comes to investing in their supply chains as the coronavirus exposes the flaws in far-flung networks. In many cases, that's going to mean a shift to third-party order fulfillment and logistics services. This is just an acceleration of a reappraisal that began with the U.S.-China trade war, UPS CEO David Abney said on the earnings call. A lot remains unknown about the coronavirus pandemic, but the messaging from most industrial CEOs at this point has focused on staying the course, whether that means maintaining most of the workforce or following through on investment commitments. UPS's Abney may have put it best: “I don't know that we'll ever get back to what we call the old normal, but we're not ready to declare what we see today as a new normal, either.”This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-04-28	2020-04-28 13:38:23	MMM	3M Company	3M Relies on More Than Just Face Masks to Get Through Pandemic	(Bloomberg) -- 3M Co. jumped after the maker of personal protective equipment reported strength in more than just its face-mask business.Rising demand for cleaning supplies, food-safety products and even home-improvement items helped propel sales and profit above Wall Street’s expectations for the first quarter. While many industries have been decimated by the coronavirus outbreak, 3M reported Tuesday that its revenue rose 2.7%.“These quarterly results were better than feared and indicated that there were still pockets of growth in personal safety, food safety, general cleaning and biopharma filtration,” Deane Dray, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a note. Virus-driven demand for respirators, meanwhile, added 1.3 percentage points of organic growth, he said.The results underscore the dramatic economic upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic. While demand has tailed off in industries such as air travel and restaurants, other companies are seeing soaring interest in products to fight disease, work from home or simply stay occupied while much of society stays indoors.For 3M, whose vast array of products spans Post-it notes to dental tools to electronics components, the sales boost was countered by declines in areas such as automotive parts and office supplies. Total net sales of $8.08 billion topped the $7.88 billion average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted profit rose to $2.16 a share, while analysts’ expected $2.03.“Given the diversity of our businesses, the financial impact of Covid-19 is mixed across 3M,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman said on a conference call with analysts. “Some areas of our portfolio are experiencing high demand, while others are facing steep declines.”The shares climbed 4.7% to $160.84 at 9:35 a.m. in New York, marking the sharpest gain on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 3M fell 13% this year through Monday, while a Standard & Poor’s index of industrial companies dropped 22%.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-relies-more-just-face-133823630.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-28	2020-04-28 09:09:21	MMM	3M Company	China Calls U.S. Trade Adviser Navarro ‘Liar’ on Hoarding Claim	(Bloomberg) -- China’s foreign ministry denounced White House trade adviser Peter Navarro as a “liar,” in the latest volley between the two sides over the coronavirus outbreak.Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on Tuesday repeated its past rejection of Navarro’s claims that the Chinese side had held back supplies of vital personal protective equipment amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “Navarro has been a consistent liar with no credibility,” Geng told a regular news briefing Tuesday in Beijing.Navarro, who wrote “Death by China: Confronting the Dragon -- a Global Call to Action” before joining the White House, has equated the dispute with China to “a war.” “It’s a war that China started by spawning the virus, by hiding the virus, by hoarding personal protective equipment during the time it hid the virus,” he said during an interview Saturday with Fox News.Navarro has redoubled his criticism of China in the wake of the coronavirus, drawing increasingly sharp rebukes from Beijing. While Chinese officials have sometimes denounced U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, they have avoided outright criticism of President Donald Trump himself.Navarro has argued that tariffs have spurred growth amid the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, which dominated headlines about the relationship between the world’s two biggest economies before the virus emerged late last year.The Law Trump Can Use to Order More Ventilators: QuickTakeTrump last month appointed Navarro to coordinate actions under the Defense Production Act, a law that can quicken the production of items needed by hospitals during the pandemic. Navarro has said that the Trump administration had concerns about whether 3M Co.’s production around the world was being delivered to the U.S., as Trump attacked the company over concerns with supplies of protective face masks.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-calls-u-trade-adviser-075414582.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-22	2020-04-22 16:26:33	MMM	3M Company	Counting the Biggest Winners of the $7.2 Billion U.S. Coronavirus Battle	(Bloomberg) -- The federal government has awarded $7.2 billion in contracts to fight the coronavirus pandemic, including one that would pay a little-known Massachusetts biotech firm more than its reported revenue for the last three years combined.The award to Moderna Inc. is just one example of the thousands of federal contracts awarded by the Trump administration to fight the coronavirus, according to a review of federal data compiled by Bloomberg Government. Some companies have secured nine-figure deals to supply thousands of ventilators, face masks, hospital capacity and other critical services needed to manage the outbreak.Amsterdam-based Royal Philips NV has so far been the top corporate recipient with some $661.4 million in agreements. The vast majority of that sum came on April 8 via a $646.7 million contract to procure ventilators from the health technology giant’s Philips Electronics North America unit.Health and Human Services last week awarded seven contracts worth a combined $1.4 billion to secure thousands of ventilators, which are needed to treat the most severe cases. Among the awards were a $350 million pact with a U.S. affiliate of Asahi Kasei Corp., a $552 million accord with Hamilton Medical Inc. and a $408 million purchase from Vyaire Holding Co. Each of those companies have other, smaller virus-related contracts, lifting the total value of their government work.The search for a vaccine to counter the disease spurred other large awards, in addition to Moderna’s. In late March, Johnson & Johnson Inc.’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit signed a $456.2 million deal for Covid-19 vaccine development, plus a $148.4 million award for anti-viral therapies. Shares of the parent company have risen 2.6% this year compared to the broader S&P 500 Index’s 15% decline.3M Co. and Honeywell International Inc. each won multiple contracts totaling more than $180 million apiece, mostly to replenish scant supplies of N95 respirator masks. Other mask-procurement deals include a $55.5 million award to Panthera Worldwide LLC and contracts totaling nearly $46 million with Draegerwerk AG & Co. for masks and other medical gear.The Department of Defense on Tuesday detailed contracts totaling $133 million for 39 million N95 masks made by 3M, Honeywell and a unit of Owens & Minor Inc. over the next 90 days. Those contracts are not reflected in the Bloomberg Government contracting data due to reporting delays.Separately, Canada’s AirBoss of America Corp. was awarded a contract for more than $96 million to supply the Federal Emergency Management Agency with 100,000 powered air purifying respirator systems. The order is the company’s largest ever and exceeds its average quarterly revenue for the last four quarters.Services are another major category of federal coronavirus contracts. RER Financial Group LLC received two contracts totaling $350 million to provide data analysis and loan recommendation services to the U.S. Small Business Administration. FEMA meanwhile awarded more than $100 million each to Aecom and ACS, Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA, to erect temporary hospital facilities in Long Island, New York.Shares of Moderna rose sharply after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agreed to pay as more than $400 million for the company to develop and test its Covid-19 vaccine now in an initial clinical trial.Though its market capitalization exceeds $18 billion, the Cambridge-based biotech firm’s revenue was only $60.2 million last year.Its shares are up 152% this year as of Tuesday’s close.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/counting-biggest-winners-7-2-080000076.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-15	2020-04-15 12:30:23	MMM	3M Company	Fastenal Is One Company That Got Pandemic Planning Right	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As a distributor of factory-floor basics, Fastenal Co.’s earnings are typically a reasonable guide of what's to come when its manufacturing customers report results a few weeks later, and that should hold even in the coronavirus era. But listening to the company’s conference call on Tuesday to discuss its first-quarter results, I was struck by a different kind of roadmap: In step-by-step fashion, CEO Dan Florness laid out Fastenal's response to the coronavirus crisis, offering a case study on best practices when preparing for the disruptions of a pandemic.Fastenal is little known outside of industrial circles, but it's essentially in the business of supply-chain management, and it acted on the warning signs of the coronavirus crisis much faster than the federal government. That's partly a reflection of the nature of Fastenal's supply chain, which is weighted heavily toward Asia, the first frontier of the outbreak. Way back in January, as the spread of the virus forced China into lockdown, Fastenal began monitoring certain product lines to ensure a reliable flow of goods for its customers, Florness said Tuesday as he kicked off the earnings conversation. This is around the time that an array of top government officials began warning of the risks the coronavirus posed to the U.S., even as President Donald Trump publicly downplayed the threat and the prospect of upheaval to Americans’ daily lives, according to a detailed report from the New York Times.The initial focus of the administration's coronavirus task force (formally announced on Jan. 29) was on keeping infected Chinese people out of the U.S., not on testing or supplies, the Washington Post reported. Procurement has since become the government's biggest problem. The federal stockpile of key medical equipment is woefully inadequate to address a pandemic on the scale of the coronavirus and governors across the country have been forced to compete against each other on the open market for masks and ventilators. Fastenal, by contrast, has recent experience when it comes to a nimble rethinking of supply chains, thanks in part to Trump's trade wars. “Quite frankly, after the tariffs became a thing, we began to beat the bushes for additional suppliers outside of China,” CFO Holden Lewis said in a phone interview Tuesday. “I'd love to tell you we moved at lightning pace specifically related to the coronavirus, but we already had the platform in place that allowed us to react to this in the way that we have.&quot; The company’s Asian procurement and quality-control infrastructure has been in place for years.Fastenal sounded internal alarms on Feb. 6 for all of its employees to prepare to marshal resources and vet backup suppliers for certain janitorial and protective-gear products it sells. “It's an unforeseen problem,&quot; Trump said of the virus on March 6 as he signed an initial spending bill that included just $3.1 billion to stockpile medical supplies. &quot;Came out of nowhere.” Federal agencies largely waited until mid-March to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health-care workers, according to a review of purchasing contracts by the Associated Press. By that point, Fastenal had moved to limit the sales of certain key cleaning and health-care products to critical industries to help ensure that the goods made it to the workers that needed them the most. While the government has sporadically invoked the Defense Production Act to spur companies into ramping up the production of ventilators and masks, a concrete plan regarding the distribution of this vital equipment among the states was late in development and is still lacking.Fastenal's efforts to procure alternative sources of personal protective equipment and funnel goods to those most in need has meant that its supply chain is &quot;pretty filled,” CFO Lewis said on the earnings call Tuesday. &quot;Right now we still have product that we’re going to be working through delivering throughout most of April.&quot; Ultimately, these efforts may even help the company bring in new business, CEO Florness said. There are multiple examples of customers reaching out to the Fastenal’s sales team, saying “’I get what your supply-chain resources are about more than ever from what I’ve seen firsthand over the last three weeks,’” he said. Imagine what the world would be like right now if governors were praising the Trump administration's supply-chain resources rather than desperately pleading for needed goods and evaluating sending in the state national guard to protect shipments of masks from seizure by the federal government. This is not the only front on which Fastenal has been ahead of the curve. Like many other companies, it didn’t wait for federal government orders to implement social-distancing measures. On March 6, Fastenal canceled an annual sales event that was meant to take place in mid-April. Doing so deprived it of one of its biggest opportunities to ink new contracts for its onsite supply-chain services and vending machines  — and it’s one reason why 2020 growth prospects are “murky,” Florness said. But it was the &quot;prudent” thing to do, he said. The weekend of March 14, the company closed off public access to its retail locations.(1) That Monday, March 16, the Trump administration announced national guidelines to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people. Fastenal has also expanded paid time-off for both full- and part-time employees to deal with coronavirus disruptions. All of this hasn't saved Fastenal from the coronavirus. While sales of safety products jumped 31% in March, revenue from Fastenal’s traditional fasteners business plunged 10.1% as factories, amusement parks, retail outlets and schools shuttered. On average, daily sales across the company increased 0.2% in March, a marked drop from the 4.7% pace in February. And because safety products are typically lower-margin, that contributed to the 110 basis-point drop in the first quarter in the percentage of sales Fastenal converts into gross profit. Still, the coronavirus crisis is different than the 2009 recession because at least demand is increasing for some products. April sales are down about 10.5% to date, which is relatively mild in the scheme of things and encouraging ahead of results due later this month from companies such as 3M Co. and Honeywell International Inc. While headcount may decline, Fastenal indicated that at this point, any cuts are unlikely to be of the magnitude they were back in 2009. The margin dislocation also will likely fix itself once demand for fasteners bounces back and the need for protective gear eases. Fastenal may be leaving some money on the table when it comes to safety and cleaning products, but it put in strict pricing guidelines early on in the process &quot;because we're more interested in getting through this and getting society through it and getting back to whatever the new normal is,” Florness said. In more ways than one, this is a company that got pandemic planning right. (1) Most of the company's business comes through onsite or delivery services that remain operational for those customers serving critical industries, but profit margins tend to be higher for products purchased through its retail locations, so the closure cost the company on that front.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

The maker of N9N facemasks, and other protective, construction and consumer products, said the partnership could more than double the current production of filters for PAPRs, which is needed as production of PAPRs have been ramped up to meet the surge in demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cummins' facility in Neillsville, Wisconsin will use equipment normally used to make diesel engine filters to make the PAPR filters, as guided by a 3M design, with production expected to begin by the end of April. After the filters are made, they will be sent to 3M's plant in Valley, Nebraska where PAPRs are made. Shares of 3M rose 2.7% and Cummins gained 2.1%. Over the past three months, 3M's stock has lost 17.1%, Cummins shares have shed 13.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has dropped 17.1%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e0f5f3d9-54c6-385d-b161-659395cddc3a/3m-to-partner-with.html?.tsrc=rss

The rise in national cases was below the average daily increase of 10% over the past week. U.S. deaths reached 18,022.In New York, the number of deaths dropped slightly on Friday to 777, a figure that remains grimly high following three straight days of record fatalities, Governor Andrew Cuomo said. The total death toll in New York has reached 7,844, he said. Cuomo said that Friday’s figure shows a high but apparently leveling number of fatalities. He also reported, for the first time, a dramatic drop in the number intensive care admissions.In New Jersey, huge daily infection increases are slowing in Bergen County, which has the state most cases, another big sign that the curve is flattening, Governor Phil Murphy said. Infections in Bergen now are doubling every seven days or more.California added 49 deaths amid improving signs among patients in intensive-care units edged up 1.1% to 1,145 after a decrease the day before, Governor Gavin Newsom said.

But the risk of sparking a second wave of infections by relaxing the curbs too early was seen as too large.Italy had 3,951 new cases, down from 4,204 a day earlier, civil protection officials said. Italy registered 570 deaths in the past 24 hours, less than 610 a day earlier.

Covid-19 is a serious challenge even in countries that say they have the strongest health systems, and it’s alarming how many health workers are catching the disease, he said. “No country can claim it has a strong public health system.”The virus is spreading to rural communities in Africa, which will cause “severe hardship for already overstretched health systems,” said Tedros, Ethiopia’s former health minister. G-20 countries need to expedite assistance for that region as the number of cases on that continent accelerates, he said.France Reports Heart Incidents From Drug (12:30 p.m NY)French authorities reported 43 cases of heart incidents tied to using hydroxychloroquine amid mounting interest in the malaria drug to treat coronavirus cases.

The country is already in total lockdown and has so far recorded abou 2,000 coronavirus cases and 90 deaths.Senators Seek Release of Detainees (11:30 am. NY)A bipartisan group of U.S. senators asked Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to press foreign governments for the release American detainees, citing the health risk from the coronavirus pandemic.“Detention facilities are a fertile breeding ground for Covid-19, with rampant overcrowding, lack of basic hygiene, ill-equipped medical facilities, and poor health conditions,” according to the letter Friday signed by Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy and Florida Republican Marco Rubio joined by Texas Republican John Cornyn and Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy. “In many authoritarian countries, these conditions are further exacerbated by inhumane conditions including malnutrition, medical neglect, and torture.”U.S. Surgeon Casts Doubt on Early Restart (10:15 a.m. NY)U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said few parts of the country will be able to relax social distancing efforts by May 1, taking a more cautious posture as President Trump and his top aides push to get the economy restarted.Some communities with strong surveillance systems “will be able to think about opening on May 1st,” Adams said on Fox News. “Most of the country will not, to be honest with you.”Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday outlined mileposts to meet before mitigation steps are relaxed, including widespread testing and therapeutic medicines, both of which may be months away.Read story here3M Alleges N95 Price Gouging (9:50 a.m. NY)3M Co. sued Performance Supply LLC of New Jersey in federal court, alleging illegal price gouging and deceptive practices in sales of N95 masks. 3M said Performance Supply offered to sell $45 million in N95 respirators to New York City at prices 500%-600% over the list price, according to a statement. 3M said it’s seeking damages.Docket link.Singapore Reports 198 New Cases, None Imported (9:36 a.m. NY)The Ministry of Health confirmed an additional 198 cases of Covid-19, with none of them imported.Earlier, the government placed a fifth foreign worker dormitory under isolation to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the city-state. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong declared a foreign worker housing facility in east Singapore as an isolation area. Singapore started placing some of these dorms under 14-day quarantines from Sunday.The country reported its highest daily increase of infections on Thursday with more than 200 of the 287 new cases linked to foreign worker dormitories.NHS Reports 866 More Deaths in England (9:32 a.m. NY)A further 866 people who tested positive for the coronavirus have died in England, bringing the total of confirmed fatalities in hospitals to 8,114. The patients were aged between 27 and 100 years old, NHS England said. The highest number was in London at 249, followed by 229 in the Midlands.Earlier, Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London who advises the U.K. government, told BBC Radio 4 that it will be “several more weeks” before scientists can draw conclusions about the rate of decline in cases and therefore recommend any lifting of lockdown measures. But he also said there’s preliminary evidence the lockdown is working better than expected.Putin Plans $14 Billion Stimulus (9:15 a.m. NY)Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government plans to dramatically ramp up stimulus measures to prop up an economy that is lurching toward recession. The government will roll out about 1 trillion rubles ($13.5 billion) of new spending, according to two people familiar with the plans. Some of the money will go toward subsidizing salaries of workers idled by isolation measures to fight the coronavirus, the people said.Antibody Tests Could Be Available in a Week or So: Fauci (8:42 a.m. NY)The U.S. will “have a rather large number of tests that are available” within a week or so, Fauci said. Tests for coronavirus antibodies are being validated by the National Institutes of Health and the FDA to make sure they are consistent and accurate, he said on CNN.Portugal Reports Highest Daily Case Increase (8:31 a.m. NY)Portugal reported the highest daily increase in confirmed cases on Friday, while the number of patients in intensive-care units fell for a third day. There were 1,516 new cases, taking the total to 15,472, the government’s Directorate-General of Health said on Friday. Total deaths increased to 435 from 409.Tokyo Games CEO Hints at Further Delay: AP (8:21 a.m. NY)The chief executive officer of the committee organizing the Tokyo Games said on Friday that he can’t guarantee the postponed Olympics will be staged next year, the Associated Press reported. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe issued an emergency declaration this week to battle the virus, putting the country under restrictions after it seemingly had avoided the spread.“I don’t think anyone would be able to say if it is going to be possible to get it under control by next July or not,” committee CEO Toshiro Muto said, speaking through an interpreter at a news conference conducted remotely.Trump Wants Next Aid Round Exclusively for Small Businesses (7:32 a.m. NY)The aid package in Congress should be limited to a funding boost for small businesses to help them keep their employees, “with no additions,” U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet. “We should have a big Infrastructure Phase Four with Payroll Tax Cuts & more,” he said.Trump earlier said he has asked his agriculture secretary to “use all of the funds and authorities at his disposal,” to aid U.S. farmers, whose financial peril has worsened in the coronavirus pandemic.Democrats are holding firm to their demand that a $250 billion economic stimulus for small businesses must include more funds for hospitals, states and localities struggling with the pandemic, leaving congressional leaders at a standoff for now.UN Envoy Warns Libya Escalation is Straining Response (7:13 a.m. NY)An escalation in Libya’s year-long war is straining the North African country’s ability to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, the acting United Nations envoy said. “It’s incredibly reckless. It’s inhumane, it’s stretching the capacity of local authorities and the health infrastructure that is already decimated,” Stephanie Williams told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday.German Hospitals May Face Drug Shortages (7 a.m. NY)German hospitals are concerned that they will soon face a shortage of drugs needed to treat Covid-19 patients who must be ventilated, Der Spiegel reported, citing an Augsburg hospital pharmacist.Earlier this week, the European Union’s most senior health official appealed to the pharmaceutical industry to boost production of critical medicines needed to treat the symptoms of the coronavirus, warning that several member states may soon run out.France Confirms 50 Cases on Aircraft Carrier (6:39 a.m. NY)The French Defense Ministry said 50 of the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle’s crew members have been infected. Three have been evacuated to a hospital in Toulon, south of France, while a medical team was transported on board to conduct a probe. The ship has shortened its mission and is heading toward its base in Toulon in the Mediterranean sea while sanitary processes aboard have been reinforced with all crew members now having to wear a mask.Potential Coronavirus Drugs May Cost as Little as $1 (6:38 a.m. NY)Potential coronavirus treatments could be made for as little as $1, well below their typical price tags in pharmacies, according to an analysis of nine drugs in clinical trials. If their promise is confirmed in ongoing studies, medicines for Covid-19, including hydroxychloroquine, which President Donald Trump touted as a treatment, and Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir could be manufactured from $1 to $29 a course, a study published Friday in the Journal of Virus Eradication found.Moscow Hospitals Stretched to Limit (6 a.m. NY)Moscow clinics and ambulances are being stretched to the limit as the number of hospitalizations from coronavirus doubled over the last several days, Interfax reported, citing Deputy Mayor Anastasia Rakova.“I’ll tell you one thing for sure: we haven’t reached the peak yet,” Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said in a interview with state-run RIA Novosti. “We are still in the foothills of the mountain, and not even half way up.” About two-thirds of Russia’s 11,917 coronavirus infections are in Moscow, which saw cases jump 17% overnight.Belgian Deaths Top 3,000 (5:50 p.m. HK)The pandemic has so far claimed 3,019 lives in Belgium, with a record 325 deaths reported in the past 24 hours and an additional 171 in Flemish nursing homes between March 18 and March 31 that were previously unreported.The numbers include deaths which are highly likely linked to a coronavirus infection without being confirmed by a diagnostic test. The number of patients currently being treated in hospitals rose by 20 to 5,610 and 1,278 patients are in intensive care, a decline of seven from the prior day.

2020-04-09	2020-04-09 19:30:44	MMM	3M Company	Alpha Pro Tech Is a One-Trick Pony	One of the dramatic shifts in our &quot;new normal&quot; is that several mundane businesses have suddenly exploded in demand. Among the biggest beneficiaries of this surge in interest is industrial giant 3M (NYSE:MMM). Previously an increasingly irrelevant organization, 3M's N95 facemask division became a matter of national security. But without adequate production, smaller companies like Alpha Pro Tech (NYSEAMERICAN:APT) have also emerged into the spotlight. Consequently, very few names have skyrocketed quite like APT stock.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com But should you gamble on this speculative organization?Admittedly, recent news makes it appear that APT stock still has some legs. As I mentioned, companies like 3M have ramped up production of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks. However, accusations of immoral profiteering have plagued 3M and the broader PPE industry.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMost notably, Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo grilled 3M CEO Mike Roman on various issues. Easily the most troubling accusation is that the industrial giant sold their PPEs to the highest bidder, including representatives of foreign countries. You can tell from the interview that Bartiromo was doing her utter best to hide her disgust.I back her views 100%. In this circumstance, you can see how a company like Alpha Pro Tech, which doesn't have the PR glare of 3M, may benefit; hence, the case for APT stock.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week The controversy regarding 3M didn't get better until President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act. Suddenly, 3M changed their tune, understanding that the federal government wasn't messing around. As such, PPEs originally destined for foreign countries will now go back to American hands.Still, this fiasco demonstrates the great need for PPEs, which for now supports APT stock. A Narrowing Buy Case for APT StockStill, at some point and perhaps very soon, the question will become, how long will the bullish argument for this company last? If the relationship between the Alpha Pro Tech's technical chart and global coronavirus cases is any indication, we may be nearing the end of this Cinderella story.From around mid-January toward the end of the month, Alpha Pro Tech stock surged 120%. At the time, media reports indicated that China was suffering from a mysterious, infectious disease. Several days before Chinese coronavirus cases hit four digits, speculators reasoned that the outbreak would get much worse.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Matt McCall Research Team Plus, it also helped that APT stock was very cheap on paper. Therefore, just a little bit of sentiment was enough to move shares substantially due to the law of small numbers.But following the 120% surge, shares steadily came back down to earth. Still, it wasn't done moving. In the second half of February, speculators anticipated that Covid-19 would turn into a devastating pandemic. Foreseeing massive shortages for PPEs, they again bid up APT stock, from just under $5 to over $25.Like clockwork, following this 414% lift, shares again steadily deteriorated to where we are now at $12. To believe the optimists means that you anticipate another meaningful surge in coronavirus cases.Here's the problem -- mathematically, we're seeing case growth decelerate sharply. I'm not an epidemiologist, but that's not my point. Instead, I think the low-hanging fruit for this stock is gone.In the first major spike of coronavirus infections (when APT stock jumped 120%), case growth increased by 14,489%. In the second spike, cases grew by 1,591% -- significant, yes, but not nearly enough to take a gamble on Alpha Pro Tech. Don't Repeat History LessonsIn the spirit of full disclosure, a long-term buy argument for APT exists. With harsh lessons learned regarding this pandemic, both individuals and government agencies will prioritize preparedness. Therefore, the runway for Alpha Pro Tech could be longer than many skeptics anticipate.Ultimately, I don't think it matters. For investors to truly feel confident in APT stock, they need to know that shares will grow based off more than just a single catalyst. Historically, that's never been the case.Pull up a long-term chart and you'll see what I mean. Back during the H1N1 pandemic, this company enjoyed a rapid burst in market value. But as the outbreak faded, so too did shares. A few years ago, America was gripped with Ebola fears. Again, it jumped but just as quickly, it fell apart.While APT stock could linger longer this time around, I don't see any fundamental justification for it. Being the same old company, I'll continue to avoid Alpha Pro Tech.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-04-09	2020-04-09 18:38:14	MMM	3M Company	The Best Buy Opportunity in Lakeland Industries Stock Is Long Gone	Amid the devastation from the novel coronavirus comes changes to our lexicon. Today, Americans are all too familiar with the term &quot;social distancing.&quot; But another phrase has far more crucial implications: personal protective equipment (PPE). With medical professionals and first responders throughout the nation struggling to address the pandemic, Lakeland Industries (NASDAQ:LAKE), a hazard-protection gear manufacturer, has come into the spotlight. As a result, it's no wonder that Lakeland Industries stock has skyrocketed.At the beginning of the year, shares were trading hands just below $11. At its intraday peak, Lakeland Industries stock was approaching the $30 level. Although it didn't quite get there, the surge in momentum symbolized the arrival of a paradigm shift. With the rapidly rising equity price came the realization that this was no longer a foreign problem.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo further emphasize our new normal, hospitals in hard-hit states became quickly overwhelmed with thousands of daily Covid-19 cases. Although the Trump administration made appeals to companies like 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) to provide critical PPE, the virus spread faster than many experts anticipated. Unfortunately, this led to hospitals in New York having to come to grips with the fact that they must do without protective equipment.Given the tremendous humanitarian need, this circumstance naturally bolstered the profile of Lakeland Industries stock. Essentially, the coronavirus forced all PPE companies to think in patriotic terms. Furthering this concept, President Trump in early April invoked the Defense Production Act to prevent the export of surgical masks and gloves.Later, the federal government doubled down on this warning. While this environment helps Lakeland Industries stock, the longer-term outlook is questionable. Lakeland Industries Stock No Longer Has Low-hanging FruitIn early March, my colleague Louis Navellier mentioned that LAKE featured solid fundamentals before the pandemic. Obviously, the company today carries the same fundamentals along with a huge uptick in technical sentiment. Further, more investors will likely continue to keep tabs on Lakeland Industries stock after this virus passes.  * 7 Penny Stocks To Buy with Massive Upside Potential Certainly, I don't think shares will go to zero. As Navellier stated, the company was relevant before Covid-19 and will be so afterward. Indeed, whether we go back to the old normal or enter a new one, we won't soon forget about PPEs.But does that mean you should buy Lakeland Industries stock at this point? I have serious reservations, primarily because the low-hanging fruit is all gone.For this argument, a visual aid is most appropriate. In this chart, I compare Lakeland Industries stock to worldwide coronavirus cases. As you can see, Wall Street early birds were closely watching developments in China back in January of this year. Gambling on a big outbreak, they bid shares up to $16.10 from $10.97 -- a near-47% increase.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Matt McCall Research Team However, sentiment quickly declined as it appeared at one point that the coronavirus could be contained in China. Soon, though, it became apparent that the crisis would deteriorate into a pandemic. In the second half of February, shares surged to $21.11 from $12.05 -- a 75.2% lift.At the time, the move wasn't completely unjustified. Since the end of February, the coronavirus has virtually impacted every corner of the world.However, from late February to April 7, global coronavirus cases increased 1,591%. A big jump, yes, but consider that from late January to late February, cases increased nearly 14,500%.In other words, you'd be buying LAKE toward the end of this crisis. Just Do the MathOf course, I'm not an epidemiologist and I don't claim to know when this crisis will fade exactly. But that's not my point. Rather, I'm discussing the sentiment toward LAKE stock and how it relates to Covid-19 trends.As you can see from the chart, sentiment for the stock has consistently led the rise in coronavirus cases. To put it another way, the massive burst in market value came from investor anticipation. In hindsight, these speculators accurately predicted the first two waves of Covid-19 infections.But will the third time be the charm? I doubt it.You don't have to be a medical expert to know that all health-related hazards eventually fade with time. Mathematically, the cases have already sharply decelerated. If you buy Lakeland Industries stock now, you're gambling that cases will continue to rise sharply.Yes, anything is possible. But with most U.S. jurisdictions (and several countries) imposing emergency shelter-in-place orders, that's a bet that I'm not willing to take.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-04-09	2020-04-09 08:00:00	MMM	3M Company	Trump Is Urged to Limit Patent Rights on Ventilators, Treatments	(Bloomberg) -- Medical device makers and scientists around the world are waiving their intellectual property rights to encourage companies to restore depleted stockpiles of emergency equipment and develop new tests and treatments for the Covid-19 pandemic.But it might not be enough.Some researchers and lawmakers are calling on President Donald Trump to follow the lead of Germany and Israel in restricting patent rights for work on coronavirus treatments.“When the lives of a significant population of a country are at stake, it is the inherent sovereign right of a government to override private property rights to protect the lives and health of its citizens,” said Fred Abbott, a Florida State University professor who’s advised the World Health Organization and United Nations on patents and drugs.Trump has asked companies to start producing ventilators and respirators, but his administration has stopped short of taking steps that would give some level of protection from patent lawsuits.“Everything has to be on the table,” said Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat. “The goal here is not to protect a patent. The goal is to get the supplies to people who need them.”She helped draft a letter seeking a promise from the administration that no exclusive licenses will be granted to government-funded research into the coronavirus.One option, Abbott said, would be for the administration or Congress to make clear that anyone making products to fight coronavirus -- whether it’s drugs, medical equipment or protective gear -- is covered by a law that gives the federal government the right to issue a “compulsory license” for any patented invention.Under that law patent owners wouldn’t be able to block use of their inventions in coronavirus equipment or medicines, though they would be entitled to compensation. Products can be covered by multiple patents, owned by multiple companies and a compulsory license would cover all of them, without the patent owner’s permission.Compulsory licensing is a power the U.S. government has rarely exercised outside of the defense industry, said Becky Kaufman, a King & Spalding lawyer specializing in drug-related intellectual property issues. In the 1960s, the government bought the antibiotic tetracycline from a manufacturer in Italy because the U.S.-made drug was more expensive. And in 2001, it threatened to break Bayer AG’s patent on the anthrax treatment Cipro; Bayer instead ramped up production and lowered costs.Outside of government action, some in the private sector and academia have already taken extraordinary steps by putting their patent rights aside in the global fight against the novel strain of coronavirus that has left more than 87,000 people dead worldwide, with nearly 14,000 in the U.S.Device manufacturer Medtronic Plc announced last week that it’s providing specifications online to encourage other companies to copy one of their popular ventilator designs, the Puritan Bennett™ 560, which was introduced in 2010 and is used in 35 countries. The company has also ramped up production of a newer ventilator model to try to meet demand.Meanwhile, three major research groups -- the Innovative Genomics Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute and University of California -- recently offered a “no-fee, royalty-free license” to their work involving the diagnosis and treatment of Covid-19.“We’re trying to do everything we can to not put up any bureaucratic barriers,” said Jennifer Doudna, executive director of the genomics institute and a pioneer in the use of the gene-editing technology CRISPR whose team is developing an at-home test for the novel coronavirus. “People recognize we are in an emergency and we don’t have time to waste.”Doudna, who’s been embroiled in a high-profit patent fight over who was first to develop CRISPR, said patents “can accelerate commercialization and convince companies to invest money where there may not be a payoff for a long period of time,” but this time is different. She said her team is providing information to scientists at universities around the country.Violations of U.S. patents can result in damages as high as three times what the patent owner could make in profit, which can be more than what the manufacturer earns on the copycat. Many industries -- from smartphone makers to pharmaceuticals -- have spent years fighting over patents to billion-dollar products.The president is facing mounting pressure from governors and congressional Democrats to use the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law, under which the government can order any company to start production, even if it’s not in its usual wheelhouse.While Trump has signed an executive order giving him the power to use the act, Democrats have criticized him for not invoking it broadly. He tweeted at GM Friday to start production of ventilators after the automaker had already begun to retool a factory to do so under a partnership with ventilator maker Ventec Life Sciences Inc.The administration also told 3M Co. to prioritize orders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for N95 respirators and stop exporting U.S.-made respirators to Canada and Latin America, which the company said might cause retaliation from other nations.Covid-19 has changed some minds on limiting patent protections, with countries like Germany, the U.K. and Canada saying they will exercise their rights to ensure treatments are widely available. Abbott is backing Costa Rica’s President Carlos Alvarado call for a pool of rights for “technologies that are useful for the detection, prevention, control and treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic.”“The most important thing for the government to do would be to say, ‘Look, solve this problem, we’ll do everything in our power to make sure that you’re not punished for working on Covid.” said Michael Eisen, a biologist and adjunct professor at the University of California-Berkeley.Eisen helped create the Open Covid Pledge, which this week began calling on companies and universities to make their coronavirus-related intellectual property widely available until a year after the World Health Organization declares the end of the pandemic.Congressional members on both sides of the political aisle are considering the issue, Schakowsky, the Illinois Democrat, said. Democrats are embracing ideas such as mandatory compulsory licensing and stripping patent rights from companies found guilty of price gouging, she said.Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska has proposed protecting manufacturers from liability suits, and rewarding companies that hold off getting coronavirus-related patents by granting them extensions on the terms.And it’s not just for drugs. The U.S. Public Interest Research Group organized a petition calling for makers of ventilators to make their designs publicly available so anyone could repair them without fear of being sued.The threat of patent-infringement lawsuits for American citizens making gowns and masks from their homes and dropping them off at local hospitals is relatively low because they’re producing goods in small numbers, said Matt Rizzolo, a partner with Ropes & Gray. That may not help companies working at the scale to provide products for a nation of 330 million people.The issue is later, when a company that owns patents related to drugs, ventilators or other medical equipment “might say, ‘Hey, wait a minute, millions of your products that were covered by my patents were used in responding to this pandemic and I think I should be compensated for that,” Rizzolo said.Rizzolo said a U.S. law that protects manufacturers from product liability lawsuits in public health emergencies might be expanded to include patent actions as well.Frontline medical workers also are facing shortages of generic medicines and protective equipment, which are in short supply as they’re typically made overseas, said Vincent Rajkumar, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.The government should assure companies stepping up to the plate that “We will protect you against patent lawsuits,” Rajkumar said. “If they came out and said that or even if they passed a law, it would be great.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-urged-limit-patent-rights-080000613.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-08	2020-04-08 01:01:31	MMM	3M Company	The World Needs Ventilators. Here's the Snag	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In the face of a global health emergency, automakers are stepping in — or being summoned — to make ventilators. Can they manufacture at the scale required, with the world needing a 10-fold increase in production to cope with the surge in coronavirus infections? It will be a severe challenge.Car companies such as Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. are a natural choice to mass-produce these medical devices. They churn out millions of vehicles every year, procuring and bringing together hundreds of parts from around the world at rapid speed. Ventilators needs anything from 400 to 1,000 components from tubes and sensors to pressure valves, humidification systems and filters. There is significant overlap between the engineering of ventilators and cars, which both bring together electronic, electric, hydraulic and mechanical aerodynamics expertise.The parts are mostly different, though. The constituents of a ventilator come from dozens of countries and through as many as nine layers of suppliers. At the same time, some specialty components, such as oxygenation membranes needed for mechanical ventilation, are made by only a few precision manufacturers— meaning that any attempt to effect a rapid expansion in global production is constrained by the ability of these companies to ramp up.The same disruption the coronavirus pandemic has wrought on automakers’ global supply chains will apply equally to their efforts to make ventilators. In normal times, such a switch might be feasible. However, automakers are only in this position because conditions are so abnormal. The coronavirus has wreaked havoc on supply chains. Logistics, transportation and manufacturing have been upended. Retooling factories will take time and the disease won’t wait.That makes the task even more formidable for companies such as Ford and GM, which have faced pressure from President Donald Trump to move more quickly and repurpose factories to turn out ventilators. Trump invoked the wartime Defense Production Act last week to help ventilator manufacturers procure supplies. Still, the administration’s effort doesn’t cover the full chain from raw materials to distribution, as my colleague Brooke Sutherland has written. The U.S. may need as many as 960,000 ventilators, the Society of Critical Care Medicine estimates, versus 200,000 that are available. India’s requirement is as many as 220,000 compared with an estimate of about 25,000 now, according to the Brookings Institution. These numbers depend on the speed of the disease’s spread and the severity of infections, and can change rapidly. Big manufacturers currently produce around 200 ventilators a week and need to make 10 times that number, according to Bloomberg Intelligence industrials and medical equipment analyst Nikkie Lu. The Indian government is urging local automakers to get involved. In the U.K. and Europe, the likes of McLaren Automotive Ltd. and Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains Ltd. are helping out.GM is sourcing 419 direct parts from 91 so-called tier-1 suppliers for ventilators made at its Kokomo plant in Indiana. While a significant portion are produced in North America, there are suppliers in more than 10 countries including China. GM is helping increase sourcing capacity within the supply chain of its ventilator partner Ventec Life Systems Inc., and is having to develop new sources of parts in its own.While China is reopening for business and putting a priority on medical equipment, other countries are in lockdown. That’s making it increasingly tough to get the right products to manufacturers, particularly where operations are dispersed. For example, New Zealand ventilator maker Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corp. sources components from China for manufacture at home and in Mexico. ResMed Inc., a San Diego-based company that makes a ventilator used during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, does most of its manufacturing in Singapore and Sydney.There are other obstacles. This is a niche industry that’s complex and highly regulated. China has more than 20 mechanical ventilator makers that produce about 2,200 machines a week or about a fifth of total global output; only eight are certified to sell in Europe. Medical devices need to be produced in sterile and clean-room certified conditions. That means converting factories to scale up isn’t a simple matter. In recent weeks, some countries have complained of faulty tests and medical equipment coming from China. Officials there banned the export of medical supplies that don’t meet China’s standards.Then there’s protectionism. Trade barriers are going up in dozens of countries as the world moves into survival mode. Having shipped key medical supplies abroad going into the crisis, the U.S. has now joined the trend, using the defense act to order 3M Co. to halt exports of its protective masks to some nations and prioritize sales to the federal government. The U.S.-China trade war had already showed up the fragility of global supply chains. Covid-19 and the rush to make ventilators will be a telling marker of how effectively they still function. Conditions could hardly be more difficult for such a critical test. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

2020-04-07	2020-04-07 18:39:38	MMM	3M Company	Trump Clinches Respirator Mask Deal With 3M	The Trump administration and 3M (MMM), the U.S. manufacturer announced a joint initiative to import 166.5 million of its N95 respirator masks over a three-month period.Under the terms of the plan, starting in April, 3M will import 55 million masks a month into the U.S. for three months, mainly from its flagship plant in China. The plan will allow 3M to continue to distribute U.S. produced respirators to Canada and Latin America, where 3M is the primary supplier.In addition, 3M said that it agreed with the Trump administration that it would be cracking down on the recent price-gouging and counterfeiting of its respirator masks.“We share the same goals of providing much-needed respirators to Americans across our country and combating criminals who seek to take advantage of the current crisis”, said 3M chairman and CEO Mike Roman. “These imports will supplement the 35 million N95 respirators we currently produce per month in the United States.”The U.S. administration confirmed that it was committed to address and remove export and regulatory restrictions to enable this plan.Since the coronavirus outbreak in January, 3M had ramped up the production of N95 respirators and doubled its global output to 1.1 billion per year, including the 35 million a month in the U.S. 3M said that it had taken actions to double its capacity to 2 billion globally within 12 months, with additional capacity to begin coming online in the next 60 to 90 days. In the U.S., 3M expects to produce 50 million N95 respirators per month in June, a 40% increase from current levels.Wall Street analysts take a cautious stance on 3M. The company’s Hold analyst consensus rating is based on 4 Holds, 2 Sells, and 2 Buys. The average price target of $156.40 suggests potential room for a 6% gain in the next 12 months.

2020-04-04	2020-04-04 00:31:02	MMM	3M Company	Trump Acts to Head Off Key Medical Exports, Calls Out 3M Again	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he had invoked the Defense Production Act to ban the export of crucial medical supplies needed around the world to fight the coronavirus pandemic -- escalating a battle with allies and 3M Co.“The secretary of Homeland Security will work with FEMA to prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves and other personal protecting equipment,” Trump said Friday at a White House briefing. “We need these items immediately for domestic use, we have to have them.”The move flies in the face of a call just last week by Trump and other G20 leaders to work together and present a “united front” against Covid-19.In a March 26 statement following a special video conference, the leaders vowed that “we will work to ensure the flow of vital medical supplies, critical agricultural products, and other goods and services across borders.”Trade experts have warned that any decision to block exports of masks and other equipment would risk retaliatory measures by countries that would undermine international efforts to fight the Covid-19 outbreak.The U.S. is not the first country to do so. China limited exports of protective equipment for a time earlier this year at the height of an outbreak there. The European Union has also introduced new rules that require special permits for any exports of medical products, including protective equipment and ventilators, from member states.Trump’s move came in response to a clamor from medical professionals in the U.S. running out of the equipment needed. That shortage has been blamed on inadequate federal stockpiles as well as a shortfall in domestic production.The U.S. has until now been relying on emergency air shipments from China and other countries to help fill the gap. Yet it is unclear whether other countries would allow such flights to continue if the U.S. is refusing to allow its own exports.“Ordering U.S. companies not to export medical equipment and materials while urgently needing imports of these products from around the world is a losing strategy,” said Wendy Cutler, a former senior U.S. trade official who is now at the Asia Society.“We can’t have it both ways — restrict exports while we scour the world for imports of these essential medical products.”The president has been in a public shouting match with 3M over its export commitments. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said Thursday that the administration has had concerns about whether the company’s production around the world is being delivered to the U.S.3M responded earlier Friday that there would be “significant humanitarian implications of halting supplies of respirators to health-care workers in Canada and Latin America.”The company’s chief executive officer, Mike Roman, said it’s “absurd” to suggest the company isn’t doing all it can to increase availability of masks in the U.S. and stop middlemen from jacking up prices.“The narrative overnight that we’re not doing everything to maximize the delivery of respirators in our home country is false,” Roman said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “Nothing could be further from the truth.”But Trump fired back on Friday, saying he remains displeased with the giant manufacturer.‘Not Happy’“We’re not happy, and the people that dealt with it directly are not at all happy with 3M,” Trump said.The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company has ramped up production to 100 million masks a month globally. 3M highlighted efforts to increase the number of masks imported from its overseas factories, including approval to ship 10 million respirators from China.The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the president’s latest remarks.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also weighed in, saying at a press conference on Friday that 3M has said it’s committed to delivering masks to the country, and that Canada is in discussions with the U.S. about continuing trade in medical supplies without restrictions.“We continue to be confident that we’re going to receive the necessary equipment,” Trudeau said. “We will do everything we can that no part of Canada goes without.”The president is attempting to corral medical resources to meet the growing domestic need for masks, ventilators and other crucial supplies. He said Friday he’d make some exceptions and allow exports to hard-hit countries, like Italy.“I’m not going to be stopping that,” Trump said.Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that the export restrictions could “reinforce the same message that the steel and aluminum tariffs did — that when it comes to national security, the United States no longer treats close allies any different than enemies.”Officials in Germany and France accused the U.S. of using unfair means to obtain protective masks before Trump had even ordered the export ban.Berlin’s state interior ministry blamed the U.S. for confiscating 200,000 masks ordered from an American producer when they were in transit through Bangkok, with one official calling it an act of “modern piracy.”French Prime minister Edouard Philippe said Thursday that his administration has seen orders canceled as a result of the global shortage of protective gear. Some French officials are blaming unidentified Americans for swooping in to outbid them as they try to secure supplies.At the White House briefing, Trump also said that the Department of Health and Human Services had seized nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves, as well as “many, many, many bottles and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded.”“All of this material is now being given to health-care workers,” Trump said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-acts-head-off-key-003102905.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-28	2020-03-28 19:28:14	MMM	3M Company	Mark Cuban Says 3M Not Doing Enough to Keep Face Mask Prices Low	(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Mark Cuban has been trying to do his part to help hospital workers get more protective equipment, working with a non-profit group and delving into the market himself to find gold-standard N95 respirator masks he could buy for medical personnel.He uncovered something else instead. What he found poking around in that marketplace is leading him increasingly to believe that respirator maker 3M Co. is shirking its duty to keep prices low and get masks where they’re needed most during a national emergency. The problem, he says, is that 3M sells the masks through a network of resellers who aren’t held accountable for raising prices and don’t have to direct their sales to hospitals.“3M lists all its distributors online, the ones buying and selling these things, and these distributors are making as much money as they possibly can,” Cuban said in an interview. “It’s wrong, it’s criminal.”A representative for 3M pointed to a previous statement saying the company hasn’t changed the prices it charges for respirators as result of the Covid-19 outbreak, and can’t control the prices dealers or retailers charge for their products. 3M also released a letter this week from Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman to Attorney General William Barr condemning “pandemic profiteers.”Cuban, the 61-year-old owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is an entrepreneur and reality-TV star with 7.8 million Twitter followers and a long history of fines by the NBA commissioner for being too brash. He’s new to the world of medical supplies, but his opinion is getting some reception in Washington. A senior official confirmed that Cuban has held informal talks with the Trump administration, but declined to elaborate or identify who he spoke with. The official said the administration is open to hearing all ideas to speed availability of resources to fight the virus.Cuban confirmed he’s been in touch with higher ups at the White House about “price gouging” taking place among mask-sourcing middlemen, though he clarified he’s not working on a “coordinated effort” with the Trump administration.The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, though President Donald Trump praised the company on Saturday, telling reporters that “I think 3M has done an incredible job.”Surging CostsAcross the U.S., states are bidding against one another for masks priced as much as 10 times the usual amount as more patients show up at hospitals with symptoms of Covid-19. Individual traders are noticing the skyrocketing cost, too.Tamer Abdouni, the founder of Beirut-based Consultium Ltd., a firm that facilitates global trade, was able to source a 3M respirator mask for $1.25 only six weeks ago. Now, through a series of distributors, he can only find a mask for more than five times that cost.“The problem is there are so many middlemen buying these products and reselling them,” says Abdouni, who works with buyers in the U.S. and other countries. “You can’t pinpoint who is to blame.”Bachir Diagne, an entrepreneur who co-founded the impact venture fund United Global Alliance, is working to help governments across Africa and partners in the U.S. find affordable N95 masks. “The price is now unsustainable,” he says, “You find yourself with 10 intermediaries that are acting like it’s the wild, wild west. They’re not interested in the impact of the moves they make.”Scammers may already be trafficking counterfeit or faulty products, according to Premier Inc., which helps 4,000 member hospitals buy and manage their supplies.“A grey market is amassing around personal protective equipment,” Premier said in a warning letter to health-care providers. “We contacted the legitimate manufacturers of these products, who could not determine how these fraudulent sellers obtained supplies.”Premium PricesCuban says his outrage was initially prompted by an influx of emails from so-called distributors trying to sell him “billions” of masks. “I have emails saying, ‘I have a 100,000 masks per sale at $8 per piece.’ I would ask if these were 3M masks, N95s, and if they could prove it. I literally have been offered billions of masks at premium prices from $4 to $8, million-dollar minimum orders, who knows what’s real.”The billionaire began monitoring wholesale prices, speaking with buyers and sellers of masks, and making calls to action for additional information on Twitter.While several companies make N95 masks, 3M, the 118-year-old Minnesota manufacturing giant, is one of the most well-known and prestigious brands. In response to surging demand for the respirators, Roman has doubled global production of N95 masks in the last two months to about 100 million a month, with plans to expand annual production to 2 billion a year over 12 months.Cuban said he’s reached out to Roman but remains dissatisfied.“I’m excited that 3M has increased capacity. But supply hasn’t been matched with demand,” he said. “Why is 3M not telling distributors, pick up the phone, sell your inventory to the hospitals, or will never let you buy more product?”When Cuban has found mask sellers he considers legitimate, he’s diverted them to Project N95, a non-profit organization working with governments and health-care providers to deliver much-needed medical equipment, including N95 and surgical masks, isolation gowns and ventilators. Cuban said he’s working as an adviser to the group, and would support them with capital, should they need it. His work with the group is one reason he’s so incensed by what he sees as profiteering.“It’s operating like an illegal drug market, not a legitimate market,” he said. “I get wanting to make millions of dollars, but people are dying.”(Adds details of Cuban’s price monitoring in second paragraph after ‘Price Monitoring’ subhead)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-cuban-says-3m-not-041949689.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-24	2020-03-24 19:05:44	MMM	3M Company	New York Can’t Wait Until June for Ventilators	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Ford Motor Co. announced a three-pronged effort on Tuesday to help the U.S. bolster its supply of life-saving medical equipment needed to combat the coronavirus. Even as its North American factories remain shuttered for traditional car-making work, Ford is partnering with General Electric Co. to scale up production of that company’s ventilators; it’s working with 3M Co. to manufacture respirators; and its United Auto Workers employees will assemble more than 100,000 plastic face shields a week. It was an impressive show of goodwill, especially for a company whose bloated balance sheet places it among those most vulnerable from a looming, sharp economic downturn.And it’s not going to be enough. Ford expects the first ventilators from its GE partnership — simplified models of what the industrial giant usually makes — to be ready by early June, CEO Jim Hackett told CBS This Morning on Tuesday. Just hours later, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held a press conference and warned that the coronavirus is spreading faster in the state than previously anticipated, putting the area on course to hit the apex of cases in as soon as 14 days. At that point, it will need 140,000 total hospital beds and an additional 30,000 ventilators. “You cannot buy them, you cannot find them. Every state is trying to get them, other countries are trying to get them,” Cuomo said of ventilators. While the governor said it’s admirable that companies such as Ford and General Motors Co. are willing to get into the business, “it does us no good if they start to create a ventilator in three weeks or four weeks or five weeks.”Therein lies the problem. On March 16, I wrote about how America needed to once again marshal its great arsenal of democracy and put the nation’s manufacturers to work producing the tools needed to fight the coronavirus. In the absence of leadership by the Trump administration, manufacturers would have to take it upon themselves to fill the void, I wrote. In the days since, I’ve been genuinely awestruck by the reports of companies taking up the call. But the truth is, the void is too big for industry to fill on its own.President Donald Trump has been reluctant to use the 1950s-era Defense Production Act that gives the government the power to press U.S. industry into service on matters of national need, preferring to orchestrate contributions on a volunteer basis. He did invoke it on Tuesday with regard to production of testing kits and masks, but that fails to address a crucial shortage in ventilators. It’s great that companies are willing to help on this front without being explicitly ordered to do so, but you still need some sort of a plan. Timing is one issue, with Cuomo arguing a more forceful implementation of the Defense Production Act that gave manufacturers the startup capital needed to repurpose factories could help speed things along. Another is that there are many smaller companies who may not have the capacity to make entire ventilators like Ford can, but could make parts or offer services, if only someone would give them some direction and organize them into workable partnerships. Perhaps the biggest is the question of distribution, as my colleague Joe Nocera has written: Who decides where the ventilators go once they are manufactured? Apart from the Ford partnership, GE has doubled its capacity of ventilator production since the start of the coronavirus crisis and plans to double it again in the second quarter. That is incredible and commendable. But who gets them? New York, which has the most cases in the U.S.? GE’s home state of Massachusetts? One of the many other countries around the world where GE does business? The government that’s willing to pay the most for them? I’m not trying to cast doubts on GE’s good intentions here, but these are impossible decisions for any company to make on its own. The federal government is sitting on a stockpile of 20,000 ventilators but has been reluctant to deploy all of those to New York, Cuomo said, with the Federal Emergency Management Agency offering a mere 400. “What am I going to do with 400 ventilators when I need 30,000?” he said. “You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators.” One argument made by the New York Times as to why Trump has been reluctant to apply the Defense Production Act more forcefully is because he doesn’t want to be blamed for how slowly shortages of protective gear and ventilators are addressed. Worded a different way, if true, he is shifting responsibility for that to CEOs who are simply trying to help their country in any way they can, and that is unsustainable. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

In the U.S., the company is producing 35 million respirators a month, with more than 90% being designated for health care workers,and the rest to other critical sectors, such as energy, food and pharmaceutical companies, Roman said in a statement. &quot;As a global company, we also manufacture respirators in Europe, Asia and Latin America, and our products are being similarly deployed to support the COVID-19 response in those respective regions,&quot; he said. The company is expecting to nearly double its capactiy again within the next 12 months and is working with the U.S. and other govermments to explore alternative manufacturing scenarios and cooperation with other companies to accelerate the process. &quot;We've also maximized production of a wide range of other solutions being used in the response, including hand sanitizers and disinfectants,&quot; said Roman. 3M shares were up 1.5% premarket but have fallen 39% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500  has fallen 18% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has fallen 25%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d471da8d-e298-3222-92a3-d3de51b74842/3m-ceo-says-company-has.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-20	2020-03-20 20:37:47	MMM	3M Company	Dow Jones Today: Small Stimulus, Big Shutdowns Drag Stocks Lower	Equities faltered on Friday after California and New York -- two of the three largest states by GDP -- announced shutdowns for all non-essential businesses, and after Senate Republican pitched a stimulus plan the markets viewed as disappointing.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 declined 4.18%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 4.50%  * The Nasdaq Composite fell 3.70%  * On another day where winners were in short supply, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the Dow's top performer, jumping 1.85%.On the stimulus front, there is talk that it could take months, not weeks for eligible Americans to get their checks. Making matters worse is that there are eligibility requirements at all. The GOP Senate plan caps recipients at those that made $99,000 or less in 2018. Both President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the plan doesn't go far enough.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Senate GOP plan wants to give $1,200 to single folks that made $99,000 and less in 2018 and $2,400 to married couples that made $198,000 or less in that year, but the White House is pushing for something broader, indicating that a second round of stimulus could be bigger and more encompassing.  * 10 Stocks to Invest In for a Post-Coronavirus Whipsaw Even some Republican senators are saying that the proposal, in its current form, falls short of adequately stimulating an economy that's very likely in a recession now and will probably be in one until the third quarter.As such, just four of 30 Dow stocks were in the green in late trading. Disney Decked AgainWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has been among the Dow's most repudiated names this month, a theme that continued Friday. One reason could be the delay of the Disney + launch in India, a massive, potentially lucrative market for the company based on sheer size.That alone wasn't the lone reason DIS stock dropped 7.72%, but it's one more point underscoring how vulnerable this name is to recession talk and the COVID-19 pandemic. When Good News Isn't Well-ReceivedDue to its status as one of the largest producers of respirators and surgical masks, there has been some chatter about 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) as a bullish play on the coronavirus. However, the stock has mostly ignored that thesis and did so again Friday, sliding 10%.Worse yet, that decline arrived after 3M said its boosting production of some products essential to fighting the virus and protecting those on the front lines of treating it.&quot;Since the COVID-19 outbreak, 3M has doubled its global output of N95 respirators to an annual rate of over 1.1 billion per year, or nearly 100 million per month,&quot; said the company. &quot;The company is also maximizing production of a wide range of other products used in the COVID-19 response globally including hand sanitizers, disinfectants and filtration solutions as the pharmaceutical industry works to find a vaccine to fight the virus.&quot; Not Helping, at Least Not YetWith no end in sight to oil's bear market and even less clarity on when demand will rebound in earnest, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) continues ranking among the worst Dow stocks on a day-to-day basis. Even good news is having a hard time permeating this downtrodden name.This week, two high-ranking Exxon executives have bought at least $1 million worth of their employer's shares. While it's often said that insiders buy their company stock for a single reason -- because they believe the shares are going to appreciate -- that theory hasn't stopped the bloodletting in Exxon stock.Exxon rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX), itself no angel when it comes to recent losses, got some love from Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read that said CVX is now cheap enough that it's close to be tempting. Under DuressGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was among the worst Dow offenders today, too. One issue plaguing banks are concerns that central bank stress tests didn't forecast a scenario as brutal as the coronavirus. To be sure, U.S. banks, including Goldman, are far sturdier today than in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, but a global recession and a world awash in negative rates will be near-term headwinds on financial services names. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodaySpeaking of Goldman, the bank's revised GDP estimates out earlier today were certainly another factor plaguing stocks to close the week. Close your eyes if you want to avoid the gore, but Goldman is forecasting a 6% first-quarter GDP slide followed by a 24% plunge in the second quarter.The bank is also estimating a full-year decline of 3.1% with unemployment rising as high as 9%.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-03-20	2020-03-20 16:34:25	MMM	3M Company	3M Stock Is an Attractive Defensive Play	With its shares down more than 24% since January, is 3M (NYSE:MMM) stock a buy? The market maelstrom has made blue-chip names like this industrial conglomerate worth buying. A true &quot;dividend aristocrat,&quot; the stock now sports a healthy 4.3% yield. But that's not all! Since the stock's valuation is reasonable, it gives investors a chance to own a high-quality stock at a fair price. Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com The question is if the market has reached a bottom. Fear and uncertainty continue to plague investors. Even though markets may drop further,  3M is a defensive stock, so it could provide investors with a good opportunity.Let's dive in and see why MMM stock could be a buy at today's prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Why Consider MMM Stock Today?It makes sense for investors to be skeptical of 3M stock. As InvestorPlace columnist Tom Taulli noted in his column published on Mar. 11, the company has a few ongoing catalysts at this point.  Many could think the coronavirus from China would boost the company, since 3M makes respiratory masks. But, with its revenue from coronavirus-related products projected to be just $250 million, they probably won't be a needle-mover for the company.If anything, coronavirus is as much a negative catalyst for MMM stock as it is for other big industrial names. Since much of 3M's  revenue comes from China, that nation's slow recovery will make 3M's path forward difficult. And that is on top of the company's existing operating challenges.  * 10 Stocks to Invest In for a Post-Coronavirus Whipsaw Between 2018 and 2019, its sales dipped from $32.8 billion to $32.1 billion. In the same time frame, its net income dropped from $5.4 billion to $4.6 billion. Clearly, the company needs to get back on the growth train. But, after 3M lowered its 2020 profit forecast, don't expect that to happen anytime soon.Upbeat catalysts may be a stretch, but how about the stock's valuation? 3M's shares look reasonably priced, with a forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.2. Granted, its peers, including Honeywell (NYSE:HON), sell at similar valuations (Honeywell has a forward P/E ratio of 15). Other industrial conglomerates, like General Electric (NYSE:GE) sell at even lower forward multiples (GE's forward P/E is 12.9).So, with minimal catalysts and a fair, but not a low, valuation, why should investors buy MMM stock today? Simply put, they could take advantage of a likely future flight-to-safety trend . As a Seeking Alpha contributor recently noted, 3M has historically been a great defensive stock. Add in the stock's strong dividend (see below), and the shares offer investors a lot. Buy for the Dividend, Stay for the Rebound?The key positive trait of MMM stock is its dividend. It's increased its dividend 61 years in a row. With its high yield, the stock is one of the best blue-chip dividend plays out there.Yet 3M's payout ratio is a concern. The company now pays out 62% of its earnings in the form of dividends. Since its earnings may dip this year, it's possible that the company will tighten its belt. I don't think 3M, which has increased its annual payout by an average of 11% over the last five years, will reduce or cut its dividend. The company, however, may increase its payout more modestly than 11%.Nevertheless, 3M's dividend may be one of the safer ones out there. With blue chips like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) rumored to be planning dividend cuts, income investors should consider more stable opportunities than that venerable oil company.3M stock could also be a &quot;buy for the dividend, stay for the rebound&quot; opportunity. I'm not the only one who thinks the stock could rally tremendously. Melius Research's Scott Davis upgraded 3M's shares last month from &quot;hold&quot; to &quot;buy,&quot; giving the stock a $205 per share price target.While $205 per share seems rich compared to the stock's  current prices, Davis believes the company's businesses, which were already in a down cycle, are about to improve. But analysts concede that the company still faces several risks, besides China's slow recovery. For one, the company's potential liabilities from its past use of PFAS (polyfluoroalkyl) substances could hurt it. Gordon Haskett's John Inch believes 3M's total PFAS liability could top $15 billion. Yet all of these negative factors could already be priced into the shares, considering their poor performance in 2019, even as the S&P 500 made new highs. 3M Is a Long-Term Buy at Today's PricesWeighing opportunities against risk, 3M at first glance doesn't look like a strong buy. Despite respirator masks flying off shelves, 3M's potential revenue from them isn't exactly a needle-mover. Factoring in recent risks like coronavirus, along with past issues such as weak sales growth and PFAS liabilities, investors should be cautious.Yet much of these issues could already be priced into the shares. With 3M stock already &quot;priced for disaster,&quot; investors can buy the stock now and start collecting an above-average dividend yield. Once the markets rebound, the stock could soar back to its prior level of around $175 per share.That won't happen tomorrow. It may not happen six months from now. But over the long-term, MMM stock could make an epic rebound.  At today's distressed prices, its shares may now be a good opportunity for shrewd investors.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.

2020-03-16	2020-03-16 13:23:17	MMM	3M Company	U.S. Factories Helped Win World War II. They Can Do It Again.	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When you’re in a critical fight, you need to use all the weapons at your disposal. And so, it’s time once again for America to marshal its great arsenal of democracy. Just as Detroit automakers became aircraft, tank and gun manufacturers during World War II, today’s industrial companies need to repurpose their factories for the tools needed to fight the current enemy: the coronavirus.Countries across the globe sealed their borders over the weekend and relegated citizens to the confines of their homes in an effort to slow the spread of the deadly virus before it overwhelms the Western World’s health-care systems. The president of Massachusetts General Hospital called on Sunday for the federal government to go into a “war-like stance” and launch a “Manhattan Project” to accelerate production of protective gear. No such plan has been announced by the Trump administration, but U.S. industrial companies should heed the call anyway. Because as far as wars go, this is one for which the country is woefully unprepared.The U.S. has fewer than 170,000 ventilators available for patient care, including estimates for those in the national stockpile, according to a report last month from the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. (The school is supported by Michael Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.) The number of face masks in that strategic reserve was depleted in the swine-flu outbreak of 2009 and as of early March it held only about 12 million N95 respirators and 30 million surgical masks, significantly fewer than the 3.5 billion masks experts estimate the U.S. would need in a severe pandemic, according to the Washington Post. It falls to private manufacturers to step in and fill the void.With airlines parking jets, consumers locked in their homes and companies focusing on managing the disruption, demand for jet engines, HVAC systems and factory equipment is going to shrivel up for the near future. Rather than sit idle, American factories should be redeployed for the products needed to fight the coronavirus, whether that’s face masks, ventilators, other health-care equipment or even toilet paper for that matter. The Trump administration has already leaned heavily on companies such as Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings, Roche Holding AG and Walmart Inc. to improve the availability and access to testing. But White House virus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx warned on Sunday that there will be a spike in cases as more people get access to tests. That’s when the real work is going to begin for the nation’s hospitals. It’s in every U.S. company’s interest to make sure they’re as prepared as possible, and manufacturers have a key role to play. Companies such as 3M Co. and Honeywell International Inc. already make masks and personal-protective gear, but they will need help to meet the huge demand.After China declared a “people’s war” on the outbreak in that country, companies including electric automaker BYD Co., petroleum refiner Sinopec and iPhone assembler Foxconn started making masks instead. French luxury-goods maker LVMH announced Sunday it’s converting perfume and cosmetics factories to make hand sanitizer, which it will deliver free of charge to the local authorities and hospital system. In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson is calling on manufacturers including Dyson, Unipart Group, Honda and Ford to help with that country’s ventilator shortage, according to the Financial Times. American companies need to follow this lead. Apart from the moral and patriotic implications, it’s just good business sense. The faster the world responds to this health crisis, the faster it can get back on its feet.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-03-13	2020-03-13 21:56:37	MMM	3M Company	Some short-seller bets looked surprising in coronavirus crash	Some short-seller favorites this week as the U.S. stock market nosedived on coronavirus fears looked counter-intuitive because the companies might benefit from the crisis, notably 3M Co, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc, according to S3 Partners.  Short sellers built their largest dollar bets in biopharmaceutical company Abbvie this week to Thursday, according to S3, but even more notable was the popularity of 3M, which makes everything from Post-it notes to protective masks.  Although mask demand surged as people looked frantically for protection against infection from the coronavirus, 3M saw the eighth biggest increase in the dollar amount of its shares sold short this week, with an additional $245.75 million more of its shares borrowed to sell, the firm's data showed.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-seller-bets-looked-surprising-215637545.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-03-13	2020-03-13 17:21:34	MMM	3M Company	2 Stocks to Buy and 1 Stock to Sell for a Market Rebound	In many ways today's stock market doesn't resemble your grandfather's Wall Street. But some classic trading rules still deserve respect. These old-fashioned rules help investors time when stocks are buyable and determine which ones remain broken.Thursday was an ugly day for many bullish investors. What had already been a nearly unprecedented historic correction now firmly rivals the worst blows of the financial crisis. Losses of 7% to 9.5% in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also squarely landed the broader averages in bear territory.Each of the indices was well past the 20% threshold.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe reasons behind the selloff, other than sheer panic, aren't a secret. From the U.S. government shutting off transatlantic flights to suspended sporting seasons around the globe, Thursday, pardon the pun, was a game changer for investors throwing in the towel in more than one way.But if history repeats or simply rhymes, this is not the end of days. A study of past corrections ultimately always reveals a major bottom. Remember 2018 or 2009? Or if you're a baby boomer, 1987's crash? The one common thread signaling another kind of end is near was a bullish follow-through day (FTD).A follow-through day typically occurs 4 to 7 sessions after an intermediate market low is established. Technical leadership from newer companies -which can become tomorrow's new leaders -- is also critical in establishing a bottom.Move over Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)? OK, maybe not. But investors should make room for stocks to buy like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) or even Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE).But what is a FTD? At its core, at least one market averages needs to rally by 1% or more on heavier volume during this critical window of time. There is a catch though. The 1% requirement is a minimum prerequisite.During more volatile periods like 2020's correction, a rally in excess of 2% and likely upwards of 3% is understandably necessary. This isn't rocket science, but simply street smarts. Volatility is a two-way street. Think about what would happen if investors treated a smaller gain as the all-clear signal, and it was a false positive. That could prove very painful in a bear market.Given the significance of a FTD, let's give the bulls the benefit of the doubt heading into next week. Here are two stocks to buy, and one stock to short, just in case. Stocks to Buy: Zoom Video (ZM)Source: Chart by TradingView Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) is the first of my stocks to buy. The video conferencing upstart is benefiting from the coronavirus from China.Moreover, a growth-filled earnings beat supports the fact Zoom was already a big deal prior to Covid-19 stealing the show and burying the market.On the price chart ZM stock also continues to demonstrate the type of leadership that's storied among growth traders looking for the next big thing as a new bull market gets underway. The fact is while most assets have buckled under the correction's pressure, shares of Zoom have continued to look technically healthy.Currently, Zoom Communications has pulled back to test its cup-shaped breakout for price support. So far the key challenge is succeeding. And given a FTD, ZM is a certain stock to buy. Stocks to Sell: 3M (MMM)Source: Chart by TradingView 3M (NYSE:MMM) may have been -- or might even remain -- in your granddad's portfolio. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent is a stock to sell or short.MMM stock has continued to be a technical dog in 2020 despite booming coronavirus-driven face mask sales. Not even all the headlines calling it a &quot;buy&quot; have helped much.Technically, MMM is just breaching its last of many technical layers of broken price support as its stochastics sport a sickly looking bearish crossover.If shares can establish a new low beneath $130 to confirm a failure of a long-term trend, bears should be able to make hay down to $100-$115 before any significant support comes into play. Stocks to Buy: Starbucks (SBUX)Source: Chart by TradingView Coffee giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is the last stock to put on your trading monitor. Shares cooled off well in front of the broader market's selloff. But now there's reason to believe in a meaningful bottom emerging soon.In a healthy market even the best stocks can expect corrections of up to 30%. Given today's less-fit environment, SBUX's 38% decline over the last several months doesn't spell the end of days for shareholders. But that's not the only reason investors should consider Starbucks as a stock to buy.I am not trying to be dismissive of the coronavirus' very real impact on families, businesses and the economy. But today's pandemic will eventually fade into the sunset on both Wall Street and Main Street.Further, as cases continue to decline in China -- a key growth market for Starbucks -- shares should rebound. As SBUX stock tests support between $51 and $62, it's important to note that bottom isn't coming today. But, nothing's stopping it from finding a bottom as early as next week.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2020-03-13	2020-03-13 17:04:23	MMM	3M Company	Why 3M Stock Is a Buy On the Coronavirus Dip	Are we having fun yet? These are turbulent times on Wall Street, so today's write up is a little different than most. But first, it is imperative that we acknowledge that this virus pandemic is extremely tragic and our thoughts go out to those who are affected by it. I am confident that just like the flu, our medical professionals will get it under control. The discussion for any equities has to start by acknowledging that the stock markets crashed twice this week and today it's Friday the 13th, so we may not be done yet. Thursday alone delivered a drop of 10% in great stocks like 3M (NYSE:MMM).Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com Even the Russell 2000, which is a basket of 2000 stocks, fell 11% just yesterday. In total they are down 34% from the highs, so needless to say that Wall Street is in full panic mode.They are selling everything and blaming the coronavirus from China for the damage. I suggest that the way we reacted caused more of the financial damage than the virus. Do not mistake this statement with the human losses, those carry the highest cost, but the discussion here is to ascertain stocks' value versus the financial threat. For example, last night, we learned that even the happiest place on earth will close starting this weekend. For example, Disney (NYSE:DIS) announced that is is closing its California parks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Expect Big Swings On Wall Street Amid Rising FearUncertainty is almost at record highs as the VIX is over 70, so we must expect the unexpected. Mathematically at these levels markets expect a +/-4% move any day.These are levels we haven't seen since the 2008 financial crash. Back then we had almost all global banks near imminent collapse and many of them actually died. Now we are dealing with a flu that all experts are confident they will control with a vaccine this year. Luckily, the total number of dead has remained low considering what could have happened, albeit one death is too many. This is extremely tragic but nowhere near the tragedies that happen every year from the regular flu.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week This is all to say that this too shall pass and that we need time to come to terms with this new version of the threat. But what could fix stocks overnight is a &quot;V&quot; bottom -- &quot;V&quot; for vaccine. Sentiment is the real problem for stocks and it's horrendous, so people need a reason to flip. If we can learn of a tangible schedule for a vaccine arrival then we can look at this threat from a different perspective.Until then, the smart investors search for great stocks that have been beaten down to levels that warrant attention. And that classification certainly applies to MMM stock. Why MMM Stock Is a Buy On the DipSource: Charts by TradingView The industrial sector was riding high until February when it fell off a cliff. This correction has so far exceeded the 2018 Christmas crash and much faster this time. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLI) is down 36%, but MMM stock is down 50% already from its highs. These are scary statistics, but therein lies the opportunity. Once all the madness abates, 3M will still have a real business. The stock yields almost 4% in dividends, which is more than alternative investment vehicles. Part of this Wall Street tizzy stemmed from the collapse in U.S. bond yields. So the 4% that 3M pays is even more attractive than before and it will bring buyers.If a stock is down, it doesn't mean it's necessarily cheap. Fundamentally, it still sells at an 18.8 price-to-earnings ratio and almost three times sales. So if the market-wide selling persists, this one could have more bad days ahead of it as well. Meanwhile, smart investors do not seek to find the perfect bottom. In this case, we have enough data to tell us that near $130 per share, the stock has entered a support zone with emphasis on the term zone. When the VIX is this high, there are no hard lines in the sand. It's hard to count on one line to act as support because daily price ranges are too wide. Caution Is Warranted for Technical and Economic ReasonsMMM stock has defended the $125 area hard since 2013. Furthermore, it has now been cut in half from its all-time high of 2018. Nevertheless, since there's still so much uncertainty, investors must be humble with their assumptions. I am fairly confident of my opinion, but I have to leave room for the possibility that markets might disagree with me for a little bit longer. So taking full size positions at once is reckless.In addition, there is a technical threat. Once 3M lost $158 for share, it triggered a bearish pattern that targets the $100 mark. Whether it fills the entire potential lower or not depends on sentiment on The Street. These are unprecedented times and only once before has 3M's relative strength index (RSI) been this low. All the signs point toward the fact that we are near bottom. Keep in mind that we remain in headline mode and everyday politicians around the world are shutting down businesses in panic. So it is inevitable that companies will have to revise their forecasts.Stocks will fall on those headlines.This madness has to stop, but we need more data on the virus before people can relax a little. To that end, the best sample comes from South Korea because they have done the most testing. I contend that all other ratios are wrong because they use wild estimates. It is impossible to state a ratio without an accurate denominator. Eventually cooler heads will prevail, but unfortunately we've already caused tremendous financial damage on a global scale. We will likely get negative GDP reports soon, so may have already self inflicted a recession.Stocks like 3M are crashing from no fault of their actual fundamentals or executions on plan. They are caught in this panic storm over a virus that has yet to prove itself as deadly as feared. Unfortunately, only time will tell if this reaction is warranted or not. Until then, stay healthy and be patient and take small bites.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2020-03-13	2020-03-13 14:22:33	MMM	3M Company	Too Many Obstacles to Count on 3M Stock	Things are going from bad to worse for conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM) stock.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Large The maker of Scotch Tape, Post-It notes and Ace bandages has been hammered on Wall Street for close to a year now. MMM stock is down 13% year-to-date, and has collapsed more than 30% since April 2019.And what's more, there seems to be little indication that a turnaround is in store any time soon for MMM stock. Headwinds in China over the automotive market and the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak are formidable obstacles for 3M.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMMM gets a &quot;D&quot; grade in my Portfolio Grader, so you know I'm steering clear of MMM stock for the foreseeable future.  * 7 Stocks to Sell as We Enter a Bear Market Let's take a look at its prospects for the rest of 2020. MMM Stock at a Glance3M deals in five segments:  * Industrials, including tapes, sealants and paint finishing and detailing products  * Safety and graphics, including reflective sheeting on highway signs and license plates, protective eyewear, hearing protection and disposable respirators  * Health care, including medical tapes and dressings, inhalers, dental adhesives, tooth whitening products and computer health information software.  * Electronics and energy, including products used in computer monitors, LCD televisions, notebook PCs, cell phone and tablets and desktop computers.  * Consumer, including well-known products under the Post-It, Nexcare, Scotch-Brite and Scotch brands.It its most recent earnings report, MMM reported quarterly earnings of $1.95 per share, badly missing estimates of $2.10 per share. Revenues of $8.11 billion were down from $7.95 billion a year ago.The company's inability to consistently meet its own estimates -- it missed twice in the last four quarters -- is a troubling trend.Looking ahead, 3M is expecting 2020 sales to be in a range from flat to 2% growth, with earnings of $9.30 to $9.75 per share. But even that modest goal may be difficult to hit considering MMM's recent track record. In the last quarter, MMM's sales in the U.S. fell by nearly 3% and sales in Asia fell 1.7%.None of the company's business segments had sales growth for the fourth quarter.That doesn't bode well for MMM in 2020.Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com The Coronavirus and MMM StockWait a minute, you might be saying. Doesn't 3M make face masks? Those things are flying off the shelves, so won't MMM see increased sales from that segment in 2020?True enough, MMM stock popped a bit when Vice President Mike Pence -- the  public face of the White House's coronavirus response -- said that the government was contacting 3M and other companies to produce 35 million more face masks per month.But it's not as if these masks are big money-makers. With a retail price of $1 or so per N95 mask, there's only about $420 million in extra revenue to be had in a year from the government's order -- and 3M surely can't expect to get 100% of that pie.After expenses, any revenue gain that 3M will get on extra surgical masks will barely be a blip for a company that sells $32 billion a year in products. And it will be dwarfed by the revenue that MMM will lose to its exposure in the industrial and automotive sectors, which are likely to be hurt by reduced production. The Bottom Line on MMM StockOne thing that MMM has going for it its dividend -- now at 4% thanks to depressed stock prices, 3M has managed to increase its payout for 61 consecutive years and has a healthy payout ratio of 62%.But even if you're thirsty for yield, there are many other places in the stock market where you can find strong dividends and a stock with a healthier bottom line. MMM is a stock to avoid until it can provide better sales growth and consistently hit its earnings targets.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-03-13	2020-03-13 10:45:54	MMM	3M Company	The Coronavirus Forces an Interesting Narrative for CGC Stock	In an industry known for its green hue, investors hoped that the cannabis market would be spared the red ink. Unfortunately, this didn't pan out. Instead, a huge drop in the benchmark indices on Wednesday relegated almost every publicly traded company into the doldrums, including sector leader Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC). During the bloodbath, CGC stock dropped nearly 6%.Source: Shutterstock One of the biggest contributors to the fallout was the World Health Organization declaring the coronavirus from China a pandemic. Not helping matters is growing perception that, until recently, President Donald Trump's administration was not handling the situation seriously. Recently, the number of cases in the U.S. exceeded the 1,000 mark. And in all, the worldwide cumulative total is nearly 126,000 cases at time of writing. Supply Chain IssuesIntuitively, these matters don't appear to impact CGC stock. However, Wall Street is worried that community panic could effectively quarantine retail sentiment -- impeding discretionary purchases like cannabis. Furthermore, the coronavirus headwind on Chinese supply chains represent a direct hindrance on the legal marijuana industry.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFirst, most cannabis-specific vaporizer products are manufactured in China. As you know, vaporizers are among the platforms that are featured in the so-called &quot;Cannabis 2.0&quot; rollout in Canada. So a disruption in this category will be a repeat of the supply chain woes when the country first went green.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy After The Market's Historic Sell-Off Second, the widespread panic has dramatically reduced inventory of protective masks and gloves. Obviously, this presents problems to production workers. Companies like 3M (NYSE:MMM) and DuPont (NYSE:DD) promised to boost productions, but the immediate chokehold could hurt for a while.Finally, even mundane aspects of the business such as packaging risks disruption. And with China making almost everything you can think of, CGC stock subsequently took a beating. A Pivotal Geopolitical Discussion May Help CGC StockGiven the extremely negative response in the markets, some readers may wonder if my expectations for the longer-term picture has changed. Furthermore, others may ask if the thesis for CGC stock has been irreparably damaged.However, my answer to both questions is a firm no.Regarding the coronavirus, neither I nor anyone with whom I work with are downplaying the seriousness of this outbreak. But we must all realize that throughout American history, devastating diseases have plagued our communities. At best (or at worst), they impose minimal or transient disruptions. And I expect the same here.As far as CGC stock is concerned, Canopy Growth is the segment leader. As a still-young market, we will see growing pains knock out many competitors. Typically, though, growing pains don't permanently incapacitate the best and the brightest.But in further analyzing the present market dynamic, one unavoidable factor has arisen: our -- and the global economy's -- dependence on China.Although the international community has robust trade relations with China, politics and national security interests have clashed. Back home, government officials from all sides of the ideological spectrum have raised alarms about China's expansionary efforts. And with so many industries -- and subsegments within those industries -- are tied to the nation, it's inevitable that the global community is seeking paths of diversification.Over the long run, cannabis has the potential to explode higher as a largely North American economic engine of mutually beneficial interest. Additionally, the U.S. and Canada have forged an unbreakable friendship over the centuries.Considering that cannabis is a massive job creator, the idea of U.S. full legalization has likely inched a bit closer to fruition. After all, being dependent on Canada is a much more palatable concept. Food for ThoughtLast December, the Trump administration proposed a plan to allow states to import prescription drugs from Canada in an attempt to lower drug costs. Ultimately, industry trade groups from both nations opposed the plan. For the Canadians, they worried that the proposal would hurt supplies for their own citizens.Today, Americans are rapidly waking up to that reality.Of course, any plan to create alternative supply chains will experience severe difficulty. China doesn't just control specific drug supplies, but a wide range of them, including over-the-counter meds.With so much in China's hands, policy makers will likely consider not only relaxing cannabis restrictions, but encouraging their development -- particularly for cannabis-based medicines and therapies. So from both an economic and scientific perspective, cannabis really is a homegrown, viable catalyst.This won't just be a net positive for CGC stock, too. Rather, it could foster a long-term revenue source unencumbered by geopolitical tensions; Something that we urgently need.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-03-10	2020-03-10 18:48:51	MMM	3M Company	The Decline of MMM Stock Has Created an Attractive Buying Opportunity	As the coronavirus from China spreads globally, economic uncertainty has deepened. However, amidst every challenge and market plunge, there are golden buying opportunities. I see one such buying opportunity in 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stock. Since reaching $181 in January, MMM stock has tumbled 17% to $148 today. In my opinion, the stock's valuation is attractive at this point.  Click to Enlarge Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com When the market's outlook is uncertain and appears to be weak, it makes sense to go overweight on stocks with low volatility. MMM stock fits the bill.In addition, the company is certain to report strong cash flow in fiscal 2020, indicating that it can sustain its current dividend of $5.88 per share. 3M's dividend yield of 3.89% is attractive at a time when the 10-year Treasury bond is yielding 0.72%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips3M expects FY20 earnings per share in the range of $9.3 to $9.75. The midpoint of the guidance is about $9.53, which put the forward price-earnings ratio of MMM stock at 15.8. That valuation is attractive, considering the fact that 3M has stable cash flow and a robust dividend yield. Even after the recent meltdown, the S&P 500 trades at a P/E ratio of about 22. The Company's Healthcare Segment Will Drive Its GrowthI believe that, even given global macroeconomic uncertainties, 3M is well-positioned to meet its EPS guidance in FY20.  * Buy the Dip in These 7 Online Advertising Stocks Now One of 3M's segments that can potentially outperform is its healthcare business. In FY20, the company expects the revenue of its healthcare business to increase by 2%-4%.However, with the coronavirus from China spreading around the world,  the segment can grow much more. Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research, stated that &quot;3M is one of only a handful of S&P names that sells a necessary product in virus containment.&quot;The U.S. government has already ordered 35 million N95 masks per month from 3M. Last week, 3M's India shares jumped 20% as demand for masks and sanitizers in the country spiked.In addition to strong demand from the U.S., 3M's healthcare business stands to benefit from strong sales in Europe and Asia. To give investors an idea about demand for 3M's healthcare products, the company expects &quot;demand for respirators and other supplies to outpace supply for the foreseeable future.&quot;Besides the virus factor, 3M is likely to benefit from its acquisition of Acelity in FY19. Acelity has annual revenue of $1.5 billion and growth , excluding acquisitions,,of 5%. The acquisition will boost 3M's growth in the advanced wound care industry, which is growing 4% to 6% on an annual basis.It is important to note that 3M bought Acelity for $6.7 billion, showing that 3M is prepared to make big acquisitions to boost its growth. With 3M likely to generate $5 to $6 billion in free cash flow, the company can pursue attractive targets. A Manufacturing Recovery Can Boost 3M's GrowthOne of the key reasons that MMM stock has underperformed in the recent past is the slowdown of the global manufacturing sector. 3M sells products to manufacturers and, with the global manufacturing sector in recession, it was likely to be hurt by the sector's struggles.The coronavirus outbreak has delayed the potential recovery of the manufacturing sector. However, the manufacturing sector is expected to rebound in the second half of FY20, and the recovery is likely to accelerate in FY21.Therefore, I believe that 3M 's safety and industrials segment is well-positioned for strong growth, excluding acquisitions, in the next 12-24 months. That should help boost 3M's cash flows and MMM stock.One risk for 3M is that the prices of its raw material will continue to increase. It remains to be seen if the company can mitigate this risk by increasing its productivity. The Bottom Line on MMM StockMMM stock has declined relatively sharply in the recent past. Further, the stock has underperformed in the last few quarters due to the global manufacturing slowdown.However, 3M's valuation is attractive,  and it probably won't cut its dividend. Further, the coronavirus outbreak will boost the company's healthcare business.

2020-03-06	2020-03-06 14:57:36	MMM	3M Company	3M Stock Could See a Billion-Dollar Boost from Trump	3M (NYSE:MMM) has quickly become another &quot;blood in the street&quot; opportunity.Source: Nor Gal / Shutterstock.com After plummeting from a high of $180 a share to a low of $144.44, the stock offers sizable opportunity.For one, 3M is aggressively oversold at double bottom support dating back to Oct. 2020. Two, President Donald Trump is about to light a fire under the stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Stocks to Buy If People Get Stuck at Home At the moment, I strongly believe MMM stock could refill its bearish gap around $180 shortly. Coronavirus Creating Monster Opportunity for 3MJust this week, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, as quoted by The New York Post, said the coronavirus has risen to a level of &quot;outbreak,&quot; even a &quot;pandemic.&quot;&quot;We're dealing with clearly an emerging infectious disease that is now reached outbreak proportions and likely pandemic proportions,&quot; said Dr. Fauci. &quot;If you look at, you know, by multiple definitions of what a pandemic is, the fact is this is multiple sustained transmissions of a highly infectious agent in multiple regions of the globe.&quot;Of course, news like this only induces panic. However, for investors, it also creates opportunity. Trump Could Send $1 Billion in Sales to 3MIt creates big opportunity, which is especially true for face mask companies after the U.S. Health and Human Services says the U.S. only has 10% of face masks needed for a full-blown virus pandemic. They estimate the U.S. would need at least 3.5 billion medical-grade N95 masks.Better, the Trump Administration has plans to source millions of masks from 3M to help combat the virus threat. If so, that could generate up to $1 billion in sales for the company. Vice President Mike Pence said in a press conference:We're going to make sure and protect the health of our healthcare providers. As the President said, we have more than 40 million masks available today. We've contracted now with 3M. Thirty-five million more masks per month will be produced, and we're also going to be working with other manufacturers.For 3M, it's not all about face masks, though. It's also ramping up global production for respirators and other safety products, &quot;as quickly as possible,&quot; noted the company. &quot;In China and around the world, 3M is working with customers, distributors, government and medical officials to help get supplies where they are most needed. 3M is also closely monitoring and responding to any potential impact.&quot;Granted, 3M isn't the only game in town. Alpha Pro Tech (NYSE:APT) has also benefited from the demand for face masks. With regards to 3M, though, &quot;The simple reality is that 3M is one of only a handful of S&P names that sells a necessary product in virus containment,&quot; according to a Melius Research report. &quot;This is being ignored by the market.&quot;Melius Research also upgraded the stock to a &quot;buy&quot; from a &quot;hold&quot; rating. The Bottom Line on 3M StockThe biggest catalyst for 3M is the coronavirus story.With the virus spreading rapidly throughout the global community and a severe shortage of face masks, 3M could be one of the biggest beneficiary of the demand boom. Currently at double bottom support, I strongly believe 3M will refill its gap at $180 shortly.Ian Cooper, an InvestorPlace.com contributor, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.

2020-03-02	2020-03-02 18:01:30	MMM	3M Company	Worst of Coronavirus Is Yet to Come for U.S. Factories	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The worst of the coronavirus is yet to come for U.S. factories.Data released Monday by the Institute for Supply Management showed manufacturing activity hovered just above the borderline between an expansion and contraction in February. No matter how you look at it, that’s a downshift from a January read that showed an uptick in production and new orders after a trade-war lull. But the on-the-ground dynamics for U.S. factories are more stressed than the headline number of 50.1 would seem to suggest. Notably, supplier delivery times stretched to the longest since 2018. While that’s typically a positive indicator showing parts makers are struggling to keep up with demand, in this case it shows the distortion already happening to supply chains as governments and companies pursue drastic measures to try to stem the spread of the Covid-19 respiratory illness that’s already killed more than 3,000 people.Unlike retailers or airlines that feel the immediate hit of missed lattes and canceled flights, the supply-chain pain wrought by the coronavirus takes more time to manifest. Most companies operate with some kind of buffer in inventory and many likely pulled forward work to accommodate the Chinese Lunar New Year. There are positive signs that China is making progress bringing factories back on line as the spread of the coronavirus in that country slows. But the longer this public-health crisis drags on, and the more countries it ensnares, the harder it is to ensure parts can travel seamlessly through intricate, far-flung networks. Notably, one ISM respondent was quoted as saying the coronavirus “is wreaking havoc on the electronics industry.” That is bad news for the likes of 3M Co. and DuPont de Nemours Inc., which supply materials and components to the sector. Neither company included an impact from the coronavirus in their initial 2020 outlooks, nor have they issued a formal update.The growing – and more troubling – concern is that the supply-chain disruption is just the tip of the iceberg, and that the coronavirus could start to weigh heavily on underlying demand. Global manufacturing activity contracted in February by the most since 2009 amid a plunge in production and new export orders, according to the JPMorgan Global Manufacturing PMI. Aerospace is a particular watch item, with the International Air Transport Association forecasting the first decline in global passenger traffic since the financial crisis. Notably, that assumed that the worst of the airline capacity cuts was confined to China-linked markets; many carriers have since extended suspensions to Japan, South Korea and parts of Italy.On Monday, Ryanair Holdings Plc cut its short-haul flight program to and from Italy by up to 25% for a three-week period amid weak demand. Fewer flights means that fewer planes need the lucrative spare part and maintenance work that’s been supporting aerospace supplier’s profits amid the grounding of Boeing Co.’s 737 Max. The prospect of monetary policy action and, in some cases, fiscal stimulus calmed markets on Monday and will soften the financial blow for companies grappling with disruption, but the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank can’t make people get on planes. As with most things related to the coronavirus, this latest data point on manufacturing is a reminder of how much we still don’t know about the virus itself and the ultimate economic impact. But all signs point to more pain before the healing process begins. To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

I say this as someone that lives in the Golden State: spreading of the virus here would likely have severe repercussions for the broader U.S. economy -- potentially dragging on the travel and leisure industry (looking at you Disneyland and Las Vegas) to technology and more.California is home to four Dow components: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), all of which have been taken to task by the coronavirus.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn late trading, 29 of the 30 Dow stocks were in the red. Microsoft MauledRemember earlier this month when Apple yanked guidance for the current quarter due to supply chain issues in China? Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) followed suit yesterday, pulling guidance for the quarter, citing the coronavirus. The news sent the stock lower by 7% today, making it one of the worst offenders in the Dow.Microsoft remains a quality company with enticing fundamentals and lots of growth levers, including the Azure cloud business.For investors that missed out on the 2019 pop in MSFT stock and have been waiting on a retreat, that pullback has arrived. The issue is pinpointing exactly when MSFT stock will cease faltering due to the coronavirus. Intel IntrigueIn late trading, six Dow stocks were down at least 4% and semiconductor giant Intel was part of that group.&quot;Worries over COVID-19 have recently pressured semis … as of now most semi companies have not baked in much, if any, virus downside,&quot; said Bernstein analyst Stacy Ragson in a note to clients today. &quot;Given this, investors should likely be girding for semiconductor revisions in the near future as they may need to join the supply chain in lowering numbers.&quot;As is the case with tech brethren Apple and Microsoft, Intel remains a strong company, but one that is hard to buy over the near-term because the COVID-19 issue is far from settled. Oil, AgainExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have been making steady appearances in this space in recent weeks for all the wrong reasons.Analysts continue opining on the fate of dividends paid by the two largest domestic oil companies (and others in the space). Exxon and Chevron yield 6.56% and 5.26%, respectively, and by some estimates the companies need oil at $87 per barrel and $57 to cover 2020 dividends. West Texas Intermediate closed around $47 a barrel today. Not as Defensive as You ThinkHow bad are things getting for equities? Not one of the Dow's consumer staples names -- usually shelter from the storm havens -- closed higher today. In fact, charts on some of these stocks, including Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), are looking ugly.P&G slammed through its 200-day moving average today and is officially in correction territory. Compounding the woes of some staples names are frothy valuations that add risk to a sector that is often perceived to be low risk. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayPlenty of historical comparisons are being bandied about on the web about just how bad things have gotten. To be clear, the S&P 500 had two five-day selloffs in 2015 that were worse than the prior two days and two others in 2011.That may constitute &quot;good news&quot; and that's the problem. Even more problematic is the estimate that 94% of the Fortune 1000 have recently highlighted supply chain issues attributable to the coronavirus.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

It’s a significant development as China battles the oubreak and new cases spread elsewhere around the globe.New infections were diagnosed in countries from Pakistan to Brazil, which reported the first case in Latin America, while Italy and Iran confirmed additional patients with the disease. Germany said it was likely at the start of an epidemic, and 700 people remained confined in a hotel in Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands.In the U.S., President Donald Trump and federal health officials plan to brief the public Wednesday on efforts to prevent the spread of the pathogen. A top American health official said that the increase in outbreaks outside China will make it harder to keep the virus outside the U.S.Key DevelopmentsChina death toll at 2,715, Hubei province adds 52 fatalitiesU.S. confirms 15th case, not including ship evacueesGlobally 2,771 have died and 81,233 people have been infectedHong Kong sets stimulus package with one-time cash handoutsClick VRUS on the terminal for news and data on the coronavirus and here for maps and charts.

The Nestle measure extends to March 15 and will be reviewed, the company said.3M Climbs as Virus Boosts Mask Demand (2:10 p.m. NY)3M Co. rose the most in almost three months as Melius Research upgraded the shares to buy from hold, citing demand for N95 respirator masks now in short supply.U.S. health officials said there could be a need for 300 million facemasks to combat a domestic coronavirus outbreak. St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M, which makes everything from dental equipment to Post-it notes, is the biggest supplier of the masks, which are widely used by health-care workers.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told a House panel Wednesday that the U.S. has about 12 million N95 respirators stockpiled currently, but would need significantly more in the event of an outbreak in the country.Azar Says 15th Case Confirmed in U.S. (2 p.m. NY)Azar said the U.S. has a 15th confirmed case of the coronavirus. His count doesn’t include the 42 passengers who were evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship or three who were repatriated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak.Nassau County Monitoring 83 People (1:40 p.m. NY)Health officials in Nassau County on New York’s Long Island are monitoring 83 people who have visited mainland China or may have come in contact with the new coronavirus, officials said Wednesday.Radio station 1010 WINS, citing County Executive Laura Curran, said six people have been tested so far and that five have been confirmed not to have it. Results of the sixth test aren’t in yet.Health officials around the U.S. have been testing hundreds of travelers who had visited China, where the coronavirus originated.Spahn: Germany at Beginning of Epidemic (12:45 p.m. NY)New cases of the virus in the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Wurttemberg are a sign that Germany is “at the beginning of a coronavirus epidemic,” Health Minister Jens Spahn said in Berlin on Wednesday.“It is questionable whether out current strategy of isolating the infection and capping infection chains will work further,” Spahn said. “The probability that this virus will circumvent Germany won’t be fulfilled”Pakistan Confirms First Coronavirus Cases (12:05 p.m. NY)Pakistan’s health minister said the country had identified two cases of coronavirus, the first in the country.Both cases are being treated and are stable, Pakistan health minister Zafar Mirza said on Twitter. “No need to panic, things are under control,” Mirza said.Europe Health Official Predicts Wider Outbreak (11:46 a.m. NY)“It is likely that Europe will see similar developments like in Italy, varying from country to country,” the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said in an update Wednesday. “The risk of the occurrence of similar clusters, similar to the ones in Italy, associated with Covid-19 in other countries in the EU/EEA and the U.K. is currently considered to be moderate to high,” ECDC said in its risk-assessment report.Even though “we are still in the containment phase,” European Union member states should review their “pandemic plans,” the bloc’s health chief, Stella Kyriakides, said in Rome earlier today.“All Member States need to inform us about their preparedness plans and how they propose to implement them,” Kyriakides said in a press conference, according to a copy of her prepared remarks. “This is the kind of crucial information that we all need to have if the virus spreads further and I urge Member States to share this with us and each other, as this is important for our mutual security.”White House Says Not Planning to Appoint Virus Czar (11:27 a.m. NY)The Trump administration said it doesn’t plan to appoint a “czar” to take over response to the coronavirus, pushing back on a report in Politico that it was considering doing so.White House spokesman Judd Deere said the talk of a czar being appointed wasn’t accurate:Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has been leading an administration task force on the virus, and has said U.S. containment efforts have been working well so far. “I don’t anticipate one, I think this is working extremely well,” he said Wednesday, responding to questions about the appointment of a czar from Congress. “That would be for the president to decide.”Trump Administration Could Seek More Virus Funding (10:45 a.m. NY)Azar suggested the Trump administration may seek more money for a virus response than the $2.5 billion announced on Tuesday. He told a House panel Wednesday that the administration is planning to spend “at least” that amount and would work with Congress on a final figure.“We’re trying to be flexible,” he said in response to questions.Azar on Tuesday faced critical questioning about the administration’s response from members of both parties at congressional hearings on Tuesday.

2020-02-21	2020-02-21 10:46:56	MMM	3M Company	3M Stock has Double-Digit Upside Potential as Industrial Growth Resumes	Shares of industrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM) have been under tremendous pressure over the past year, as MMM stock has dropped from $220 in early 2019 to $150 today, amid persistently sluggish industrial economic growth in China, the U.S. and pretty much everywhere else across the globe.Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com But, I think that the worst of this global industrial slowdown is over, and 3M stock is ready to rip higher in 2020 by more than 20%.Specifically, it increasingly appears that -- once the coronavirus outbreak in China subsides (and it will, soon) -- global economic activity will rebound sharply and quickly, especially in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. As it does, 3M's revenue growth trends will meaningfully improve. At the same, management has announced significant restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives, the sum of which will drive margin expansion in 2020, too.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRecharged revenue growth and margin expansion will power reinvigorated profit growth at the industrial conglomerate. That's the good news. The better news for bulls? The stock presently trades at a five-year low valuation of just 15.7x forward earnings.What do you get when reinvigorated profit growth converges on a five-year low valuation? A sharp jump in the stock price. That's exactly what will happen to 3M stock in 2020. Coronavirus Won't LastWhen you take a step back and look at the big picture, it becomes increasingly obvious that the global industrial economy is set for a significant re-acceleration over the next few quarters.  * 7 Exciting Stocks to Buy for Aggressive Investors Right now, China's industrial sectors is getting hit hard by coronavirus, which has forced multiple factories and manufacturing sites to temporarily shut down. Those closures are disrupting global supply chains, slowing manufacturing around the world thanks to the coronavirus.But, this all just temporary.Soon enough, like all other epidemics, the coronavirus outbreak will pass. Chinese factories and manufacturing sites will re-open. Global supply chains will be fixed, and the industrial economy will stop slowing. Growth Trends Will ImproveMore than that, the industrial economy should actually push higher in 2020, for a few reasons.First, in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the People's Bank of China and many other central banks across Asia have injected a ton of fiscal stimulus into their respective economies. That provides ample firepower for a sharp economic rebound once virus fears subside.Second, also partially in response to the coronavirus, China has been more open to trade negotiations with the U.S. This increased openness will continue, because China doesn't want to upset its already fragile economy, so trade tensions will meaningfully de-escalate in the coming months.Third, with stability set to be re-injected into the global geopolitical environment, corporations are set to re-accelerate their capital spending plans in 2020. Capital spending is the backbone of the industrial economy. Thus, as capital spending trends improve on the back of easing trade tensions, industrial economic activity will rebound.Fourth, the industrial economy was already rebounding prior to the coronavirus outbreak. Just look at Purchasing Managers Index readings from across the globe in the back half of 2019 and into January. They were rebounding, everywhere, because of supportive central bank policies and easing trade tensions.Come mid-2020, there will be more fiscal stimulus and more trade tension de-escalation, so this rebound will likely kick into second gear. 3M Stock is Too CheapGiven that the industrial economy is set to rebound in 2020, 3M stock is simply too cheap for its own good here and now.That five-year low valuation got down there because the company's growth trends decelerated in 2019, amid sluggish industrial growth across the globe.But, as industrial growth picks up in 2020, 3M's growth trends will pick back up, too. When that happens, the current discount in the stock should disappear.So, throughout 2020, 3M stock should power higher, supported by renewed profit growth and steady multiple expansion.  * 7 'Strong Buy' Stocks With Over 50% Upside Potential How much firepower does this rally have? Consensus 2021 sell-side earnings per share estimates sit around $10. The stock's five-year average forward earnings multiple -- and the average forward multiple for industrial conglomerate stocks -- is 20x. Combine those two, and you arrive at a reasonable 2020 price target for the stock of $200. Bottom Line on MMM StockIt's been a rough run for MMM stock over the past few years amid sluggish industrial growth across the globe. But once coronavirus fears subside, those sluggish industrial growth trends should materially improve on the back of easing trade tensions and supportive monetary policy.As those growth trends bounce back, so will 3M stock.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Add in the dividends - all 30 Dow stocks are dividend payers - and the total return comes to a whopping 85%. The blue-chip average, trading at record levels, has 30,000 in its sights. That would have been unimaginable even half a decade ago.But not all Dow stocks are created equal. Each index component has a solid pedigree. However, their short- to intermediate-term prospects diverge widely, according to Wall Street's analyst community.If you want to pick and choose among the bluest of blue chips, you can look at this full list of 30 Dow stocks that we've sorted by analysts' average recommendation. Here's how it works: S&P; Global Market Intelligence surveys analysts' stock calls and scores them on a five-point scale, where 1.0 equals a Strong Buy and 5.0 is a Strong Sell. Scores between 3.5 and 2.5 translate into a Hold recommendation. Any score lower than 2.5 means that analysts, on average, rate the stock as being Buy-worthy. The closer a score gets to 1.0, the better.Here's a look at how analysts rate all 30 Dow stocks right now - and why.

2020-02-13	2020-02-13 19:25:33	MMM	3M Company	3 Dow Jones Industrial Average Stocks to Sell	Global equities are reeling as the coronavirus from China continues to spread globally, killing its first victim in Japan. The outbreak is also forcing China to choose between killing its economy or killing more citizens by sending people back to work too early. Add to that reports the U.S. military is preparing quarantine facilities on bases and people are suddenly feeling fearful again.No surprise then that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is stalling just below the 30,000 level and looks set for another test of its 200-day moving average last touched back in October. Here are three stocks that are already rolling over.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Dow Jones Stocks: 3M (MMM)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com3M (NYSE:MMM) shares are rolling over after the company reported disappointing earnings despite a 2.1% increase in sales from the prior year period. And mixed forward guidance only added to the pressure. The company is feeling the pressure from the going ons in China because of its exposure to the automotive sector, where it provides things like acoustic systems. Thus, the company's transportation and electronics segment saw a 5.9% drop in sales.Management is responding with job cuts to bolster profitability, but cost cutting is always a bad look especially when years of top-line growth have spoiled investors. This was bad timing for the folks at Wolfe Research, who just upgraded the stock to &quot;neutral.&quot; Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comShares of healthcare icon Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are threatening to fall below their 20-day moving average. Such a fall would break the post-October uptrend the stock has enjoyed as consumer health claims continue to dent sentiment. A New Jersey state jury recently ordered the company to pay $750 million in punitive damages to four plaintiffs. Legal headwinds also remain from opioid and antipsychotic medications.Investors are also feeling sour after a mixed earnings report at the end of January. Sales of baby products in the United States -- a key retail category for the company and a source of a lot of brand goodwill -- fell nearly 27% year-over-year. Merck (MRK)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comMerck (NYSE:MRK) shares have fallen below their 200-day moving average, breaking an uptrend pattern going back to early 2018. This looks like classic profit taking as the company just reported solid earnings. But why all the selling? The pharmaceutical company reported revenue rising nearly 8% year-over-year on a 7% increase in pharmaceutical sales.Well, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' win in the New Hampshire primary could be a concern. Sanders has been a vocal critic of drug prices and an advocate for single-payer healthcare in the United States. President Donald Trump, in his State of the Union address, also called for a &quot;bipartisan legislation on drug prices.&quot; That's probably the only thing Sanders and Trump would ever agree on: Prescription drug prices are too high.As of this writing, William Roth does not hold any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-06	2020-02-06 18:01:53	MMM	3M Company	No, Boeing Isn’t Ruining Trump's 3% Growth Target	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Boeing deserves blame for many things, but dragging U.S. economic growth below 3% isn’t one of them. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business on Thursday that Boeing Co. is a big reason the U.S. won’t see the 3% expansion in gross domestic product that the Trump administration had been predicting for 2020. The Max crisis will shave 50 basis points or more off of GDP this year, Mnuchin said.Boeing is the largest U.S. exporter, and a production halt for its grounded 737 Max that took effect in January will undoubtedly be a drag on growth, particularly in the first quarter, and economists have said as much. Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson said Thursday that Boeing had discovered yet another new software issue on the Max in the latest reminder that the jet’s return remains highly fluid and that the current best estimate for a mid-2020 reintroduction may be realistic rather than conservative.(1) But to believe Mnuchin’s statement, you have to also believe that there was ever a real shot of 3% growth this year. Most economists would disagree.The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for 1.8% U.S. GDP growth this year. That number hasn’t been above 2% since May 2018, almost six month before the first Boeing Max jet crashed off the coast of Indonesia. The Max wasn’t grounded globally until five months after that. Even the most optimistic of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg haven’t called for 2020 GDP growth of 3%-plus since around last March, and there was little indication then that the Max crisis would drag out as long as it did or be as painful for the economy as it will end up being. Boeing initially said it would have all necessary paperwork in to the FAA by late March and didn’t signal it was even thinking about taking the drastic step of shutting down production until July. For the record, the median forecast for 2021 GDP, when Boeing Max production should be ramping back up, is 1.9%.   It feels like Boeing is a convenient scapegoat for an administration that doesn’t care to admit its trade war with China dragged the manufacturing sector into a mild recession last year and that expectations for a swift recovery off of the eventual ceasefire signed in January were overblown. Even after the Max production halt was announced, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC Jan. 21 that U.S. GDP growth would get to 3% this year. In reality, plenty of industrial companies that have almost nothing to do with Boeing have been downbeat about their growth prospects in the coming year, calling for a still sluggish first half and a second-half recovery that many analysts expect to be relatively muted. “It took industrial activity a while to cool off and it will take a while to heat back up,” Jim Foote, CEO of railroad CSX Corp., said on the company’s earnings call last month. He didn’t mention the Max as a factor. Emerson Electric Co. and 3M Co. both announced fresh restructuring pushes to counter what remains a  lackluster economic environment; neither of those companies are major suppliers to Boeing. The trade ceasefire agreed to in January will result in some rollback of tariffs: China said Thursday it will cut levies on some $75 billion of American imports later this month, while the U.S. will cut tariffs on about $120 billion of more consumer-facing goods. But the initial tariffs placed by the U.S. on some $250 billion of mostly manufacturing-related products from China remain in place. Meanwhile, China has been wishy-washy about how firm the purchasing commitments agreed to in the trade deal actually are, with caveats including market demand, quality and safety standards and, reportedly, the impact of the burgeoning coronavirus crisis. The U.S. economy likely isn’t going to grow at a 3% rate in 2020. But you can’t lose something you never had.(1) This particular problem has to do with an alert for the so-called trim system that moves the plane's nose up and down.

2020-02-05	2020-02-05 19:01:53	MMM	3M Company	3M Stock Is a Toxic Stock After Earnings	3M (NYSE:MMM) stock has spent the last two years stuck in bear country. And just when it looked like the industrial giant was going to finally depart, a nasty earnings announcement upended its flight plans. Today we'll take a renewed look at the trends and price levels that matter in the aftermath of January's disappointing report.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com 3M stock put together an impressive recovery attempt during the fourth quarter, rising 19% off the lows. The ascent powered 3M back above its 200-day moving average for the first time since April's disastrous earnings pushed it into the abyss.Buyers returned, optimism improved, and the stock was poised for a solid start to 2020. Until earnings arrived to trash the turnaround, that is.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends January's announcement revealed adjusted earnings per share of $1.95 on $8.11 billion in revenue. Analysts were estimated $2.10 of earnings on $8.11 billion in sales. The company also announced additional job cuts. 3M Stock ChartsSource: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade The weekly trend shows 3M still stuck in a two-year descending channel. With last week's debacle, it's now submerged back beneath its 50-week and 20-week moving averages.I peg support at $154 and resistance near $182. Until either level gives way, expect more of the same choppy to bearish behavior. From its 2018 peak, 3M is down 38%. I won't even mention its relative performance. With the S&P 500 courting record high after record high during the past two years, you can imagine how abysmal 3M has been by comparison.The daily chart more clearly reveals the details of last week's whack. In the six days since its underwhelming report, the stock has fallen 10.5%. Along the way, it's almost given back all that was gained during its fourth-quarter recovery.The shares are popping today buoyed by the rebound in the broader market, but with the sharp increase in momentum during its downswing, I suspect this is a rally that will fail. Rather than fishing for a bottom, I suggest using strength as an opportunity to build bearish trades from a better vantage point.Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade A run toward $165 or $170 would create a compelling bear retracement setups.Volume patterns are weighing in favor of a bearish view. Five of the past seven trading sessions saw distribution suggesting institutions are heavy sellers right now. Color me skeptical that a multi-day bounce will change their disposition. Plus, with all the support zones shattered during the recent downswing, there are multiple resistance zones now looming overhead. Implied VolatilityOn the implied volatility front, premiums have deflated modestly after last month's earnings report and now sit at the 37th percentile of the one-year range. The expected daily moves moving forward are $2.23, so set your expectations accordingly.With implied volatility essentially in the middle of its range, I don't have a strong opinion on whether long or short options trades are best. Couple that with a stock that is just starting to bounce from oversold conditions, and it's difficult to suggest a trade at this point.That said, if 3M stock can rally back to the $165-$170 area, then I think short trades are worth a shot.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-31	2020-01-31 14:56:08	MMM	3M Company	Markets Are Ignoring Manufacturers' Glum Message	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The stock market’s blind optimism is colliding with industrial CEOs’ realism. Caterpillar Inc. and Honeywell International Inc. rounded out a busy week of earnings for the manufacturing sector on Friday, with both companies pointing to a continuing slide in growth in 2020 that flies in the face of expectations for a swift rebound following the signing of the U.S.-China trade deal.“We expect continued global uncertainty” in 2020, Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby said in a statement. That will push demand among end-users of its equipment down as much as 9% and encourage dealers to continue chipping away at existing inventory stockpiles rather than replenish them. The company predicted a decline in residential and non-residential construction markets in North America and continued weakness in oil and gas, offset somewhat by a pickup in mining equipment, calls that have wide-reaching implications for much of the industrial sector. Sales in China may decline as much as 5%, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield told Bloomberg News. Honeywell’s earnings guidance was in line with analysts’ estimates, but the range was fairly wide for the company, with a 40-cent swing between the best and worst case. Honeywell is “remaining cautious” on the macroeconomic outlook and the risks to its businesses that are among the first to reflect changes in activity. It warned sales may be flat in 2020 after backing out the impact of M&A and currency swings.Honeywell has a history of being conservative, but you’ve heard comments like this from a variety of industrial CEOs over the past few weeks, including CSX Corp.’s Jim Foote, W.W. Grainger Inc.’s DG Macpherson, DuPont de Nemours Inc.’s Marc Doyle and 3M Co.’s Mike Roman. Most are expecting the growth environment to remain lackluster – and for some markets, to get a bit worse – in the first half of the year before improving in the back end. But for many companies, that “improvement” has more to do with easier comparisons than any true demand spike. We’ve also seen this movie before, and forecasts for a back-end-weighted recovery rarely play out as hoped. Heading into the year, CEOs listed the risk of a recession as their top concern for 2020, according to a global Conference Board survey. While the trade deal improved sentiment, corporate profits need to pick back up to drive increased spending, note Bloomberg Economists Andrew Husby and Yelena Shulyatyeva. There are a variety of complicating factors on the horizon, including the U.S. presidential election and potentially the ramifications of the burgeoning coronavirus epidemic. And don’t forget, U.S. tariffs remain in place on some $360 billion of Chinese goods.For now, business investment remains muted, with orders for non-military equipment falling 0.9% in December, excluding aircraft, according to data from the Commerce Department released this week. Arguably, one benefit of elevated stock prices is that buybacks are untenable and that may drive more CEOs to put their money to work on capital investments once the uncertainty clears. Honeywell plans to do both, buying back a minimum of 1% of its shares and spending as much much as $150 million on capital expenditures in 2020. But for industrial companies as a group, earnings gains appear to rely more heavily on continued cost-cutting and productivity improvements rather than true fundamental growth.Caterpillar, which is currently predicting a second straight year-over-year decline in profit, said Friday it has a $200 million placeholder for strategic restructuring and is “prepared to respond quickly to any positive or negative changes in customer demand.” There has also been a troubling increase in below-the-line benefits and earnings adjustments, even at the typically clean Honeywell. Below-the-line items are expected to be as much as a $250 million benefit in 2020, compared with a $57 million drag in 2019, the company said. This impacts perceived quality, notes Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch.And yet investors seem only mildly concerned.  After initially sliding as much as 3.2%, Caterpillar shares were at times little changed and were down only about 1.5% as of mid-morning. Expectations were higher at Honeywell and that stock was down about 2%, but it’s still within spitting distance of an all-time high hit earlier this month. Investors may have the luxury of being more optimistic than CEOs, but I’d listen to the guys who have to make the actual decisions when it comes to hiring and spending. And those guys (yes, they’re all men) are still waving the yellow flag of caution.  To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

Analyst Christopher Muir lowered his stock price target by $11 to $65 and cut per-share earnings estimates. Our target is a 17% peer-discount 17.1x our '20 EPS estimate, which we think is warranted by our view of a below-peer three-year EPS growth rate,&quot; the analyst wrote in commentary. &quot;Looking ahead, we see lower segment results in '20 driven by nylon headwinds in T&I and the absence of certain gains recorded in 2019, offset by synergies, cost reductions, and other items.&quot; DuPont said slack demand for nylon will weigh on 2020 earnings. Weak industrial production has been cited by other manufacturers as a headwind this year, including 3M  and UPS . DuPont shares slid 8.1% after its report and are down 37% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500  has gained 21%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3df6d312-6249-3636-8411-e8edd60a0a1a/cfra-sticks-with-buy-rating.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-29	2020-01-29 09:37:48	MMM	3M Company	China’s Virus Outbreak Triggers a Global Run on Face Masks	(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.People across the globe are stockpiling facial masks to protect themselves from the new coronavirus, depleting online malls and store shelves from California to Beijing. Yet their efficacy against an outbreak that’s claimed more than 130 lives remains uncertain.On Amazon and Alibaba, many shops peddling anti-virus masks had run out of stock as of Wednesday. Across China, Hong Kong and Singapore, people lined up for hours at stores and pharmacies hoping to secure dwindling supplies. People from San Francisco to Orlando said they were unable to find surgical masks at their usual outlets.While the rush is global, Chinese people living abroad have been buying masks -- especially the popular N95 variant made by 3M Co. -- to send back to family members or resell them online, often via Tencent’s WeChat messaging app. Demand is only likely to increase -- even though doubts have surfaced among the medical community about their effectiveness in curbing the disease, which some doctors say can spread through physical contact. The coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected more than 6,000 -- more than the 5,327 cases officially reported in China during the SARS epidemic of 17 years ago.“I’ve been running around town for days to buy masks,” said Liu Yan, a 36-year-old, who works in the cryptocurrency industry in Tokyo and said she scooped up 2,000 masks to send back to people in China without asking for additional money. She added she may stop buying soon because patient numbers were on the rise in Japan and she didn’t want to deprive locals of supplies.While it’s still unclear how the 2019-nCoV virus is spreading, one confirmed channel is through direct contact with infected people -- most likely coming into contact with respiratory secretions or virus-containing droplets from an infected person’s cough. It’s also possible the virus could be shed in other ways, including through the fecal waste of acutely infected people.Good hand hygiene, including the regular use of an alcohol-based sanitizer, may be more effective than face masks at preventing transmission of the 2019-nCoV virus, said Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at Australia’s Canberra Hospital.China’s government has responded to the worsening shortage by cracking down on vendors who sell fake masks or overcharge online. Over 80 shops on e-commerce platform Taobao, run by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., allegedly sold counterfeit 3M and N95 face masks, Chinese state-media reported Monday. The company said on its official Weibo account it removed shops found to engage in false advertising or price rigging. The e-commerce site said it sold 80 million face masks through Taobao within two days.In Hong Kong, some store chains have begun restricting sales. Watsons said on its official Facebook account it would receive a limited supply on Jan. 30, then limit purchases to 50 masks per person on a first come first serve basis. People in the city who have tried to send masks to mainland China said their deliveries got bounced back without being given a clear reason.3M said it’s increasing output and working with distributors to ensure sufficient inventory to meet demand and supply existing customers, according to a representative. Other factories are ramping up production. In Japan, plants that supply personal care company Unicharm Corp. have been working around the clock since Jan. 17 after orders increased ten-fold, according to spokesman Hitoshi Watanabe.Meanwhile, the global mask stockpiling is spurring market speculation. Shares in surgical equipment maker Medtecs International Corp. have more than quintupled since the start of the year.(Updates with share price surge in the final paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Ryan Edward Chua, Aaron Mc Nicholas, Sharon Chen, Jason Gale and Jeffrey Hernandez.To contact the reporter on this story: Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-virus-outbreak-triggers-global-093748971.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-28	2020-01-28 21:35:01	MMM	3M Company	Stock Market Today: Earnings Season Gets Intense; Buy Uber?	The stock market came under pressure on Friday afternoon and was slugged on Monday, as the S&P 500 fell 1.57%. On Tuesday though, the bulls were back in action, with investors enjoying a rally in the stock market today.The S&P 500 gained 1.01%, a day after we said both bulls and bears failed to gain momentum in the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe market has two main catalysts right now -- those being earnings and the coronavirus. Despite United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) saying it would limit flights to China and the country updating its death and infected list, equities were resilient in the stock market today.That's also despite disappointing quarterly results from companies like 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). Pfizer missed on earnings and revenue estimates, while 3M beat on non-GAAP earnings, but missed on sales. 3M also announced 1,500 layoffs and took a $134 million restructuring charge.Here's what the charts for both stocks look like now.Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) also slipped on Tuesday, falling about 3% after the company missed on earnings and revenue estimates. Gross margins fell year-over-year and missed estimates, while retail sales dropped 3.1% in the U.S. Given all that, shares certainly could have done worse.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for Your Income-Generating Portfolio After the close is littered with big-name reports, and Wednesday has plenty too. A few of tomorrow's big ones include Boeing (NYSE:BA), General Electric (NYSE:GE), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and AT&T (NYSE:T) in the morning. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) report after the close on Wednesday. Movers in the Stock Market TodayBorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) slipped 7.6% in the stock market today, after announcing a takeover of Delphi Technologies (NYSE:DLPH). The all-stock deal comes out to a $3.3 billion transaction, sending DLPH shares up about 60% on the day. BWA made the deal to help further its future products in the auto market, and expects the deal to be meaningfully accretive in its second full year.Old faithful not so faithful anymore? Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) not only hit one-year lows, but is approaching its lowest levels since 2010 (on a dividend-unadjusted basis). Oil and the energy sector have struggled, as oil prices remain capped by a waiting supply line in U.S.-produced oil. Even though Exxon has been spending, it hasn't generated the income needed, and may need to do an asset writedown like Chevron (NYSE:CVX).Following the tragic helicopter accident on Sunday that claimed nine lives, including basketball star Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Nike (NYSE:NKE) is trying to juggle its online store. Early reports suggested that Nike pulled its Kobe shoes, but other reports have said Nike is already sold out. For now, the company no longer has any Kobe-related gear available and instead has a post honoring him.As for a few analyst moves, Uber (NYSE:UBER) was making waves in the stock market today. The stock was initiated with a &quot;buy&quot; rating at UBS, with analysts assigning a $56 price target on the stock. Shares rallied about 2% in response, with the price target still implying more than 50% upside.Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) finished notably off its session high, but still climbed 1.8% after receiving a new overweight rating and $155 price target from Wells Fargo.Wells Fargo also initiated Slack (NYSE:WORK) with an &quot;overweight&quot; rating.

2020-01-28	2020-01-28 17:53:37	MMM	3M Company	When Face Masks Are a 3M Big Seller, That’s Telling	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- 3M Co.’s messy quarter does little to inspire faith in the company or the industrial economy at large.The maker of Post-it notes, Scotch tape and wound dressings announced a pair of charges – $134 million for a restructuring plan and $214 million for litigation related to PFAS chemicals – that pulled its fourth-quarter earnings per share below analysts’ estimates. 3M’s particular issues aside, the company sits on the front lines of any economic swings, and there was scant evidence in its results that the great industrial turnaround heralded by President Donald Trump’s trade truce with China has in fact arrived.Sales at 3M fell 2.6% in the fourth quarter after backing out the impact of acquisitions and currency swings, leaving the company with its biggest annual decline on that basis since 2009. With U.S. tariffs still in place on some $360 billion of Chinese goods, political uncertainty tied to the American presidential election and few specifics about alleged purchasing commitments from China — not to mention the potential economic impact of the widening coronavirus crisis — a recovery is apt to be more muted.(1) 3M’s concerns run deeper than just a weak macroeconomic backdrop, though. PFAS — which stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — are  known as the “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down in the environment and accumulate in the body. They have been linked to health problems including cancer and immune system dysfunction, spurring a series of lawsuits against manufacturers including 3M and DuPont de Nemours Inc.’s Chemours Co. spinoff. The charge 3M announced Tuesday reflects updated expectations for customer-related litigation and environmental matters for sites where it historically manufactured the chemical. 3M also disclosed on Tuesday that it had received a grand jury subpoena related to non-compliant discharges from an Alabama facility, and said it had discovered similar issues at an Illinois plant as part of a fourth-quarter review.The charges are a reminder of how much investors still don’t know about 3M’s financial exposure to lawsuits and potential environmental regulation. Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch has estimated 3M’s ultimate liability for PFAS – including remediation, personal injury settlements and monitoring expenses – could be about $27 billion. The company didn’t do itself any favors by waiting until the call to disclose the grand jury probe. That was General Electric Co.’s attitude in 2018 when it casually dropped a mention of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into some of its accounting practices an earnings call. That isn’t the company you want to keep when it comes to transparency and accountability.In that light, I treat 3M’s latest restructuring push with a dose of skepticism. The company will dismantle the international operations arm that was tasked with setting priorities for geographic regions and instead give its business groups global control over decisions affecting their strategy and resources. This is meant to be “the next step in its transformation journey” following a shakeup last year, where 3M rethought how its businesses are divided up. The idea was to group its products by customers, rather than market – i.e. sales of automotive products to retail shops would fall under the “consumer” unit rather than be lumped in with automotive revenue from manufacturers or body shops. In theory, this all makes sense and should streamline decision-making processes; 3M says it will help the company save as much as $120 million a year. But it also feels like a bit like reshuffling the deck and a convenient way to throw some corporate-speak at a plan to cut 1,500 jobs that might otherwise have felt less like a “transformation”  and more like a reaction to still stubbornly sluggish sales growth.For 2020, 3M warned organic sales may be flat at worst. That’s a weaker forecast than some analysts had been expecting, but RBC analyst Deane Dray warned even this downbeat outlook may not be pessimistic enough. It’s possible sales slump yet again, particularly given 3M’s dependence on China’s economy and the impact from the coronavirus outbreak. 3M had been modeling low-to-mid-single digit growth in China in 2020 off of depressed 2019 numbers, CEO Mike Roman said on the earnings call. While the company had already been expecting a sluggish start to the year in China largely due to still-weak automotive markets, the coronavirus is “changing things as we go,” Roman said. Offsetting the possible negative impact on China’s overall economy is the growing demand for 3M’s face masks and other respiratory-protection products.The coronavirus aside, it’s hard to give 3M the benefit of the doubt after a staggering series of guidance cuts over the course of 2018 and 2019. Even if 3M finally did get its outlook right for a change, its best-case scenario for sales growth is a meager 2% increase. Such sluggish but stabilized revenue growth is likely to describe many manufacturing companies’ performance in 2020, but unlike 3M — which declined in 2019 and fell again on Tuesday’s earnings news — many of them aren’t priced for that kind of environment.(1) Elsewhere on Tuesday, CommerceDepartmentdata showed orders for non-military capital goodsexcluding aircraft—a proxy for business investment —unexpectedly declined 0.9% in December.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-01-28	2020-01-28 16:54:30	MMM	3M Company	3M Tumbles Most Since April After Revealing Subpoena, Job Cuts	(Bloomberg) -- 3M Co. dropped the most in nine months after revealing it had received a grand jury subpoena in an environmental probe and saying it would cut 1,500 jobs amid slumping markets from car parts to electronics.The pared workforce is part of a restructuring -- affecting “all business groups, functions and geographies” -- starting this month that will recast reporting lines and consolidate manufacturing oversight, 3M said Tuesday as it reported earnings. The company anticipates pretax savings of as much as $120 million a year from the changes.The cuts, on top of 2,000 layoffs announced in April, cap a rough year for the maker of everything from Post-it notes to touchscreen displays. 3M trimmed its forecasts multiple times in 2019 because of trade disputes, headwinds in China and flagging demand in the automotive and electronics markets.3M is positioning itself to capitalize on an eventual rebound, Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman said in an interview. While he acknowledged recent challenges in several markets, “they are stabilizing as we come into the year,” he said.The shares fell 5.7% to $165.59 at 11:45 a.m. New York after skidding as much as 6%, the most intraday since April 25. 3M fell 7.4% in 2019, the third-worst performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The company received a federal grand jury subpoena last month regarding discharges at an Alabama facility that may not have complied with relevant permits, Roman said in a call with analysts. 3M is cooperating with the investigation, which followed a previously reported company disclosure to authorities, he said.The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company took a pretax fourth-quarter writedown of $214 million for litigation related to PFAS chemicals. The company, along with chemicals- and materials-making peers such as Chemours Co., faces potentially substantial liability from lawsuits over the harmful effects of the so-called “forever chemicals.”As part of the latest restructuring, non-U.S. employees will now report to their business groups rather than the international operations organization, which is being eliminated. Julie Bushman, who oversees international operations, will step down April 1, 3M said.The job cuts, representing about 1.5% of the company’s workforce, prompted a fourth-quarter pretax charge of $134 million, the company said. Total adjusted profit fell to $1.95 a share in the period, trailing the $2.10 average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 2.1% to $8.1 billion.The quarter was “noisy,” with “unexpectedly large” charges, Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.The transportation and electronics unit continued to weigh on results, with revenue dropping 6.2%. The strain was countered somewhat by the health-care division, a recent bright spot, which boosted sales 25% in the quarter.China VirusInternational corporations are now grappling with a new challenge from the deadly coronavirus that has killed more than 100 people in China and is spreading around the globe. Many companies have restricted employee travel and taken other steps in response.3M has a particularly direct relationship to the crisis as a top maker of protective face masks. The company is “ramping up production to meet the demand” for respiratory protection and other health-care products needed to combat the virus, Roman said.3M gave the first peek at its expectations for 2020, saying adjusted profit will be $9.30 to $9.75 a share. The midpoint of the range trailed the $9.60 average of analyst estimates. Organic sales, excluding the impact of currency conversions, will rise no more than 2% this year.To contact the reporter on this story: Richard Clough in New York at rclough9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Case at bcase4@bloomberg.net, Tony RobinsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-cut-1-500-jobs-125322355.html?.tsrc=rss

But in all three cases, the charts suggest reason for caution as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 3M (MMM)Source: Provided by Finviz The first of Friday's big stock charts suggests a move is imminent. The question for 3M (NYSE:MMM) is in which direction the stock will head:  * MMM stock has established a textbook triangle pattern after trading in a tight range over the past month. Usually, once that pattern is exited, the trend accelerates in that direction. At the moment, that seems like good news for MMM stock, which rallied nearly 2% on Thursday. Near-term moving averages look like they're providing support in recent sessions. There's a reasonably solid uptrend from October lows. The 200-day moving average could provide resistance if MMM stock moves higher, but there's a technical case that a breakout looms.  * Fundamentally, the news is a bit more mixed. I was skeptical toward MMM stock in early August, not far below current levels. Execution has been lacking in recent years. The chances of a cyclical downturn suggest valuation should be reasonably moderate. On the other hand, a 3.35% dividend yield and an 18x forward P/E multiple both seem reasonable, even in that context. And progress on the trade war could drive improved results in China, which has been a difficult market for the company of late. It's likely trade optimism has contributed to the rally in recent sessions, and that sentiment could provide a tailwind to the stock in 2020.  * All told, a true breakout may be too much to ask for in the near term. But there's some reason for optimism that 3M stock can keep grinding higher. And if shares can breach the 200DMA, it's possible that breakout may arrive after all. Arista Networks (ANET)Source: Provided by Finviz Thursday's big stock charts focused on networking stocks, which mostly have struggled this year. Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) has been no exception, falling over 35% from its highs after three consecutive post-earnings sell-offs. Shares have managed to rally in recent sessions, but there's a case that the rally could be short-lived:  * The second of Friday's big stock charts shows that ANET stock has established a relatively textbook flag pattern at the moment. Flags are continuation patterns, and the months-long trend here obviously is bearish. The 50-day moving average portends near-term resistance, with $220 the next key level. The reversal isn't guaranteed, and may not arrive immediately. But aggressive traders may want to mark their calendars for mid-February, when Arista reports fourth quarter earnings.  * Fundamentally, there's some reason for concern. ANET stock is cheaper, but at 22x forward earnings it isn't necessarily cheap, particularly by the standards of the sector. The reactions to recent earnings reports don't seem overblown, as key customers have pulled back on spending. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the culprit in the second quarter, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) appears responsible for soft guidance given with the Q3 release.  * There is potentially a contrarian case for shares. Chris Tyler made the case for ANET in early November, and that case has played out so far. Arista still should be able to drive growth going forward, and investors may see Arista stock as one of the last reasonably-valued cloud plays out there. Still, between the chart and recent history, it seems risky to own Arista stock ahead of what looks like an important release in February. Gap Inc. (GPS)Source: Provided by Finviz Like many mall-exposed retailers, Gap (NYSE:GPS) has had a difficult 2019, with shares down 31%. But the issue for Gap actually is concentrated in its business outside of traditional malls. Both the third of Friday's big stock charts and qualitative concerns suggest a rally may take some time:  * Technically, there is a bit of optimism here. GPS stock exited a narrowing wedge to the upside earlier this months. Support seems to have held around $16. But resistance quite obviously has been firm at $18, and given that level has reverted from previous support, it will take some momentum to bust through.  * The problem is it's difficult to see what drives that momentum. Despite its name, Gap is an Old Navy story at this point; the concept almost certainly drives over two-thirds of consolidated profit. Gap plans to spin that business off, but those plans are in doubt after chief executive officer Art Peck stepped down last month. Meanwhile, Old Navy's results have been disappointing so far this year, and management commentary suggests improvement isn't likely until 2020.  * From a long-term standpoint, GPS still looks intriguing, one reason why I own shares in the company. But barring a sector rally or news on the spin-off front, this likely is a 2020 story at best.As of this writing, Vince Martin is long shares of Gap Inc. He has no positions in any other securities mentioned.

2019-12-18	2019-12-18 14:45:47	MMM	3M Company	For FedEx, It Can Always Get Worse	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It can always get worse for FedEx Corp.Back in June, I wrote that the parcel-delivery company had managed to fall out of a basement window when it issued fiscal 2020 guidance that fell well short of already depressed expectations. Two guidance cuts later, it seems we’ve sunk below the foundation and are in the dirt with the worms.  The latest of these misses came after the close of trading on Tuesday, when  FedEx said it would earn no more than $11.50 a share in adjusted earnings and perhaps as little as $10.25. At the low end of the range, FedEx is facing an earnings slide nearly on par with what it experienced in 2009 amid the financial crisis. What’s worse is that its plan to fix this debacle rests largely on a “ just trust us” defense from a management team that continues to point the finger for its woes at a weak industrial economy and rising e-commerce costs — things that rivals United Parcel Service Inc. and DHL seem to have a much better handle on.The current quarter could still bring more disappointments, with FedEx not calling for a significant rebound in slumping profit margins at its ground unit until the last three months of its fiscal year, which ends in May. But FedEx chief financial officer Alan Graf proclaimed that the company was “at the bottom and we’re going to come up off the mat.” He may be right. Amazon.com Inc. stopped using FedEx to transport its own packages earlier this year and this week announced that it was banning the carrier from shuttling Prime packages for third-party merchants. While FedEx has said the impact to its revenue from the lost Amazon business is small, it’s still been a drag. The upside is that will make the comparisons easier in fiscal 2021. FedEx will also see the volume benefits from its rollout of seven-day delivery service, while a trade deal between the U.S. and China ( should one actually materialize) could boost the industrial sector and global economy. In the meantime, FedEx is reducing capacity at its Express air-delivery unit and plans to cut international and domestic flight hours by as much as 8%. It’s also planning a price increase on large packages in January and is trying to drive more volume from businesses, which tends to be more profitable than the e-commerce shipments it ferries to consumers’ doors.But these feel like the sort of things that should have been announced more than a year ago and could have helped the company avoid some of its present pain. It’s not like FedEx’s challenges only recently sprung up, so it’s hard to fathom how the company could be caught so flat-footed by the November quarter’s disappointments. And FedEx only reluctantly took responsibility for the shortfalls. It fielded three questions from three different analysts on why there was such a giant miss on operating margins before CEO Fred Smith acknowledged on the earnings call that FedEx probably underestimated some of the cost of standing up the seven-day-a-week delivery service. It’s hard to think of a parallel example where management credibility is so low and management seems completely oblivious to that fact, although 3M Co. comes to mind.For all this talk of a bottom, the real turnaround would likely come in fiscal 2022, when management says capital expenditures will decline significantly as it completes a replacement program for aging aircraft and at long last wraps up the costly and lengthy integration of its acquisition of European carrier TNT Express. The decline in spending will be a relief for investors who have been flummoxed by the lack of returns on the billions FedEx has spent upgrading its network over the past few years, but it still doesn’t answer the question of why that payoff has failed to materialize. One argument for FedEx’s severed relationship with Amazon is that as the e-commerce giant expanded its in-house logistics operations, it was only handing off the least profitable packages to third parties like FedEx. Troublingly, FedEx’s average yield in the ground business still declined by 0.1% in the fiscal second quarter even without the Amazon impact, while pricing power in the U.S. express business declined 0.3%.The best-case scenario is that this isn’t a structural shift, but an execution issue. At a company that’s repeatedly struggled with execution over the past few years, that doesn’t inspire a lot of faith.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-12-06	2019-12-06 21:21:50	MMM	3M Company	Dow Jones Today: Jobs Jubilee Sends Stocks Soaring	The November jobs report delivered today before the opening bell brought some holiday cheer and that was enough to send stocks soaring to close the week as the major equity benchmarks closed higher for a third consecutive day.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 surged 0.91%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.22%  * The Nasdaq Composite soared 1%  * For the second time this week, industrial 3M (NYSE:MMM) was the Dow's daily leader, advancing 4.32% on news of an asset saleThe Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 266,000 new jobs last month, while the October number was revised higher to 156,000. Economists were expecting the addition of 180,000 jobs in November.Alright, so let's assume there are naysayers out there and there probably are. They'll say, and they're not wrong, that November report was aided by 41,000 General Motors (NYSE:GM) employees heading back to work, seasonal hiring for the holiday shopping season and census hiring. All true, but even combined, those factors likely didn't account for 266,000 jobs in a single month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Hot Stocks for 2020's Big Trends Moreover, the unemployment rate dipped to a 50-year low of 3.9% while wages rose 3.1%. Some investors may be apt to look for the political implications of these numbers and there are undoubtedly some, but these numbers also reveal that near-term downside for stocks may be limited and that's obviously good news.In late trading, 27 of the Dow's 30 components were in the green and of the three losers, downside was limited. UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) was the Dow's worst performer today, but its Friday loss was modest and that stock has been on a tear of late. 3M RenaissanceIndustrial conglomerate 3M is one of the Dow's worst-performing names this year and it will take a miracle, Christmas or otherwise, for the shares to finish the year flat. A 13.70% year-to-date loss is difficult to overcome with not many trading days left in the year.However, 3M did give investors reasons to cheer today as it paced the Dow on rumors that the company is mulling a sale of its drug delivery systems unit, which could command $1 billion. That's not jaw-dropping news for a $95 billion company, so the stock's move today was likely more attributable to the jobs report and news that China is planning to waive some tariffs on U.S. commodities imports.That's relevant to 3M because the stock is trade sensitive and with China showing a gesture of good faith, President Trump may decide to back off of tariffs slated to go into effect on Dec. 15. Consumer CheerThe aforementioned jobs report wasn't the only cheery piece of economic data out today. The University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index for December jumped to 99.2 from from 96.8 last month. An interesting element of that report is that respondents were divided along partisan lines with Republicans feeling good while sentiment among Democrats declined.Politics aside, the Dow's three consumer discretionary names -- Home Depot (NYSE:HD), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) -- all closed higher. Underscoring the strength in that trio, McDonald's was the worst performer today, adding about half a percent.Keeping with theme of consumer strength, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the largest domestic retailer, meaning it's highly levered to the jobs and consumer sentiment data points, added 0.94%. Disney DividendWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) announced a modest dividend increase, saying its payout for fiscal 2019 will be $1.76 a share, up from $1.72 in fiscal 2018. That works out to 88 cents per share on a semi-annual basis.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice &quot;This has been a monumental year for The Walt Disney Company, marked by the launch of our new streaming service Disney+ and the completion of our acquisition of 21st Century Fox,&quot; said Disney CEO Bob Iger in a statement. &quot;We are pleased to deliver another substantial dividend to shareholders as we continue to invest in the company's future.&quot; Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayFor those addicted to Federal Reserve rate cuts, today's data points weren't good news, but that's good news for the rest of the market. Sure, November's pace of job creation will be difficult to maintain, but even it remains simply &quot;strong,&quot; the Fed won't be compelled to trim rates again anytime soon.&quot;We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market and stable inflation,&quot; said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in Congressional testimony last month. &quot;There is nothing in the November jobs report would seem to undermine that view.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-06	2019-12-06 20:01:55	MMM	3M Company	3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Short	Wall Street is in Santa Claus rally mode at the end of the week. But will it be another and more bearish December to remember? One thing is for certain, blue-chip stocks 3M (NYSE:MMM), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) are showing technical signs that admired income streams will be trumped by capital gains for bearishly positioned investors.Let me explain.Wall Street is breathing much easier at the end of the trading week. Following a bearish opening act after POTUS took aim at China and the E.U. and a back-and-forth NATO summit provided market volatility but finished empty handed, investors are cheering Friday's jobs data. For its part, the Dow Industrials with its cadre of blue-chips is up roughly 1% and off fractionally for the five-day period.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors are also finding strength from a &quot;calmer tone on trade&quot; and perhaps motivated by seasonal bullish tendencies. The fact is it has been a solid 2019 and window dressing those gains could be in full-force this season. Still, there's always the chance the market could see a repeat performance more in keeping with last year's memorably bearish December.  * 7 Hot Stocks for 2020's Big Trends At the end of the day, historical patterns such as a Santa Claus rally are nice to consider. But as we've seen, those leanings are far from ironclad opportunities. And with uncertainty surrounding Dec. 15 when a new round of tariffs on Chinese imports are set to begin, the chance for other bearish drivers to emerge or maybe reawakened concerns to rear their ugly head, it's a good time to keep some blue-chips on the radar for shorting. Blue-Chip Stocks to Short: 3M (MMM)Source: Charts by TradingView3M is the first of our stocks to short. As of this writing, this blue-chip stock is the Dow Industrial's biggest dog with its year-to-date loss of nearly 14%. Income-oriented investors might see this weakness coupled with a dividend of 3.45% as an opportunity. But I don't buy it. I see MMM's bearish patterns and overhead resistance as keeping shares in a shortable position.MMM Stock Strategy: Short this blue-chip stock if shares can break beneath the low of the November topping candle for a second time. One caveat is to make sure this price action is accompanied by a bearish stochastics crossover. It may mean shorting at a lower price in MMM stock, but it's worth the confirmation given what's been stated.Look to support near $133 - $140 for taking initial profits in 3M shares. Likewise, respect pattern resistance for exiting this blue-chip stock if necessary. ExxonMobil (XOM)  Source: Charts by TradingViewExxonMobil is the next of our stocks to short. This blue-chip stock isn't in the same dog house as MMM, but XOM has been a definite laggard with its flat-line, year-to-date performance. And the price chart is telling me the worst is yet to come.Here, I'm focused on a broadening pattern top to complete in conjunction with a test of the 62% level. And as XOM stock wrestles with a breach of its long-term trendline and a bearish crossover of the weekly stochastics, there are good indications $60 - $62 will come into play.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice XOM Stock Strategy: For this blue-chip stock I'd recommend shorting shares beneath this week's opening price of $68.50. From there, the aforementioned support area is where bearish traders should look to take profits. As important, since this is XOM stock's fourth stab at rejecting technical trendline support, there's not a whole lot of margin for error. I'd allow a bit of wiggle room, but $71 to cut down losses makes sense off and on the price chart. Home Depot (HD)   Source: Charts by TradingViewHome Depot is the last of our blue-chip stocks to short. Technically, all stocks face corrective periods and bearish cycles at one time or another. And right now, HD stock's monthly chart supports the argument that this phase is just beginning.Shares of HD have confirmed November's bearish engulfing candlestick as part of a larger broadening top pattern. The price action also has the backing of a bearish stochastics crossover. And with this blue chip still near the pattern's signal price and support significantly lower near $140 or worse, HD is a stock to short today.HD Stock Strategy: To accompany a short in HD stock, I'd recommend using the pattern top to contain exposure to greater losses if required. This poses stock risk of around 11%. It's slightly more than I'd typically allow in a name like Home Depot. However, given the pattern's prospect's and skewed risk-to-reward in favor of bearish positioning, it makes a strong case for your consideration.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

In other words, stocks can go from dismal days (yesterday) to excellent showings (today) rather rapidly.  * The S&P 500 jumped 0.63%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 0.53%  * The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.54%  * Industrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM), a fairly trade-sensitive name, paced the Dow today, gaining about 1.2%On Tuesday, President Trump said a trade deal with China wasn't necessary until after the 2020 presidential election, exuding confidence he'll win a second term and that China needs a resolution much more than the U.S. That stoked speculation that both sides could proceed with punitive tariffs that would only serve to ratchet up hostilities. Wednesday brought a different, more sanguine story.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 of the Best-Performing Conglomerate Stocks of 2019 &quot;Negotiators are getting near an agreement on the amount of tariff relief in a phase-one accord between the world's two largest economies. President Donald Trump said discussions with China are going very well, just a day after downplaying the urgency of a deal,&quot; reports Bloomberg.In other good news, U.S. oil inventories declined by more than analysts were expecting, helping Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the two largest domestic oil companies, join the ranks of the Dow winners.No one, not even President Trump himself, knows what tomorrow will bring on the trade front, but today was the best day of December to this point as 25 of the 30 Dow members were higher in late trading. Diverting BlameAvid readers of this column know that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been in hot water for much of this year, disappointing investors along the way, due in large part to litigation risk, be it asbestos or opioid.The stock rallied 1.62% today, putting it in the upper echelon of Dow performers after JNJ said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was wrong when it said it found traces of asbestos in its popular baby powder.&quot;Our talc is safe and asbestos free, and these 150-plus tests, and the tests we routinely do to ensure the quality and safety of our talc-based products, are consistent with the results from renowned independent research labs over the past 40 years,&quot; said JNJ in a statement out Tuesday evening.The company did say that the  previously announced recall of Lot 22318RB of Johnson's Baby Powder remains in effect. Speaking Of Healthcare…It was another solid day at the office for managed care provider UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) as the stock gained about 1%. An array of analysts were out today boosting price targets on UNH shares, including BMO Securities to $310, Credit Suisse to $320 and Piper Jaffray to $325. Even the average of those targets, which is just over $318, implies significant upside from the $280 area at which UNH currently resides.

Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayTomorrow is a new day and with it comes the aforementioned potential for new headlines on the trade front, but some market observers believe President Trump's trade musings are minor blips on the radar and won't derail stocks this month.&quot;I do not believe that they will follow through with the December tariff,&quot; said Peter Boockvar, Bleakley Advisory Group's chief investment officer, said in an interview with CNBC. &quot;If we do not have a [China trade] deal, I think they'll couch it and we're just postponing the tariffs … The administration knows how sensitive we are to the possibility of those extra tariffs particularly hitting the consumer.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-27	2019-11-27 16:37:31	MMM	3M Company	Deere's Dour Outlook Tests Faith in Manufacturing Rebound	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Deere & Co. results show the trouble with reading the economic tea leaves.The maker of tractors and construction equipment slumped on Wednesday after announcing a depressed outlook for fiscal 2020 that caught investors off guard. Deere expects net income to be no higher than $3.1 billion next year, a decline relative to 2019 and well below the $3.46 billion analysts had been modeling. Here was investors’ response:The root of the disappointment is Deere’s expectation that global agricultural and turf equipment sales will slump 5% to 10% next year. Heading into earnings, there was optimism that Deere might even see growth in that division, should the prospect of a trade deal and the Trump administration’s plans to pump financial support into the farming industry incentivize growers to finally swap out aging equipment. Indeed, data released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed that capital spending excluding aircraft increased in October by the most since the start of the year, adding credence to the idea that the slowdown in industrial growth is bottoming out.With the trade war still lingering in the background, though, it appears Deere CEO John May isn’t banking on much of anything. That seems the prudent path to take. For one, May only just ascended to the CEO role this month and is likely disinclined to set goals he can’t guarantee in such an uncertain environment (3M Co.’s Michael Roman, who’s cut guidance an absurd number of times in his short tenure, should probably take note). But even CEOs who have been around for a while would have trouble predicting how their customers will act six to nine months down the road. This industrial downturn has been different from others in that it’s not a function of supply-and-demand dynamics but of political uncertainty. Manufacturing data can naturally be lumpy given the volatile timing of big projects, or in the case of this year, the General Motors Co. labor strike. But the unpredictable nature of trade negotiations makes the trajectory of any recovery particularly difficult to predict.The tariffs that China and the U.S. have levied against each other have made inventory management something more akin to an Olympic sport as companies try to get ahead of the levies but also guard against getting stuck with a bunch of unwanted goods. That challenge was reflected in Deere’s outlook. Looking at the broader market, Deere expects demand for agricultural equipment to drop 5% in the U.S. and Canada, while the European, South American and Asian markets are seen remaining flat. That’s not as severe as Deere’s forecast for its own business, a dynamic which Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann says likely reflects an expectation that dealers are still sitting on too much inventory and will work through that before placing new orders. An upwardly revised GDP figure released Wednesday of 2.1% for the third quarter also reflected inventory accumulation.   Point being, no one really knows anything, and everyone is afraid of moving in the wrong direction. One reason Deere’s lackluster guidance hit its stock particularly hard is that the forecast wasn’t accompanied by much detail on restructuring that the company had previously indicated would be forthcoming. The company will implement a voluntary separation program for some employees that should save about $150 million annually when combined with 2019 cost-cutting efforts. If the outlook is really as bad as Deere claims, though, you would think we would see something more substantive on cost cuts. But to get aggressive with restructuring, Deere also has to be confident that this market isn’t going to turn around on a dime if there is in fact a legitimate trade deal, lest it end up short-staffed. The Trump administration is quickly running out of ways to describe the trade talks and proximity to a “phase-one” agreement. One day we were down to the “short strokes,” the next we’re in the rather morbid sounding “final throes.” But while investors are more than happy to price in those words as a done deal, CEOs are thinking differently. Deere’s downbeat guidance follows similar outlooks from Caterpillar Inc. and Emerson Electric Co. that in certain lights could be construed as conservative. Or they might just be accurate.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-11-20	2019-11-20 21:32:09	MMM	3M Company	Dow Jones Today: Investors Desperate for a Trade Deal	The slow slog of the U.S.-China trade deal hampered stocks Wednesday, sending all three of the major domestic equity benchmarks lower on the day.Source: Chart courtesy of finviz.com   * The S&P 500 shed slid 0.3%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 0.4%  * The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 0.5%  * Johnson & Johnson was one of the lone bright spots in the Dow Jones today, adding 0.8%When it comes to the trade wranglings, at least two prominent themes are hindering stocks. First, the sheer amount of time it's taking to get a deal done. Phase I of the trade accord was supposed to be settled earlier this month, but now it looks like Dec. 15 is the target date.However, that's far firm.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSecond, there are dueling views on the state of the talks themselves. Some market observers view the situation as sanguine, while others see plenty of tensions lingering.&quot;Some people close to the talks describe them as being in a sensitive, make-or-break stage and caution that what President Donald Trump proclaimed as a done deal a month ago, sending U.S. stocks soaring to records, could still easily fall apart,&quot; reports Bloomberg.  * 7 High-Yield ETFs to Buy Now Those competing views and frequent postponements have created an aura of uncertainty. The markets dislike this uncertainty, as reflected by the fact that just nine Dow components were higher in late trading. Some Juice For JNJJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was the leader of the Dow today. Shares of JNJ were boosted after Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen initiated coverage of the stock yesterday with an &quot;outperform&quot; rating and a $160 price target.&quot;Upwards earnings revisions to JNJ's Pharma business and multiple expansion…driven by diminishing headlines risks from talc and opioids, should move shares higher,&quot; said the analyst.JNJ has been a Dow laggard this year, as it has been hampered by fears of opioid-related litigation costs. But investors may have over-exaggerated those fears. As Chen notes, the company's pipeline offers room for growth. An Interesting Day For OilExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) -- the two largest U.S. oil companies -- were among the Dow Jones winners today, mainly because domestic inventories data showed a smaller than expected increase.That's a credible catalyst, but the strength in shares of Exxon is arguably surprising because Moody's Investors Service lowered its credit rating on the oil giant, citing &quot;cash burn&quot; concerns.&quot;ExxonMobil's negative outlook reflects the company's substantial negative free cash flow and expected reliance on debt to fund its large growth capital spending program,&quot; said the ratings agency. &quot;The company's high level of growth capital investments cannot be funded with operating cash flow and asset sales at projected levels given ExxonMobil's substantial dividend payout.&quot;The dividend is one of the primary reasons investors have stuck by Exxon stock and the company may be loathe to cut it. Plenty of OffendersToday's lift of Dow losers, of which there many, featured a predictable cabal of trade-sensitive fare, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), among others.  * 10 Best High-Growth Stocks to Buy for Young Investors Home Depot (NYSE:HD) followed up yesterday's 5.4% tumble with a slide of 2.2% today after rival Lowes (NYSE:LOW) reported decent quarterly results that sent that stock higher by nearly 4%. Looming Black Friday promotions and the rest of the holiday shopping season stand as tests for both home improvement retailers. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayWhile trade will continue commanding headlines over the near term, it may take a step back Thursday simply because several marquee economic data points are due. In addition to a broad swath of retailers reporting earnings (no Dow components), the Philadelphia Federal Reserve manufacturing index for November will be reported along with October's existing home sales.&quot;Economists are estimating 5.46 million U.S. homes sold in October, according to Dow Jones. This is after U.S. home sales unexpectedly fell to 5.38 million in September, following two months of gains,&quot; according to CNBC.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-31	2019-10-31 20:23:15	MMM	3M Company	Dow Jones Today: China Trade, Impeachment Drive Return of Headline Risk	Stocks were roiled Thursday by the return of headline risk, which was compounded by the variety of that risk -- it was both domestic and foreign in nature.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com Starting in the latter category, China appears intent on adding another chapter to the long-running trade saga with the U.S. Today, the world's second-largest economy sounded cool on the idea of the two sides reaching a more comprehensive trade accord. Beijing appears steadfast in the view that no more concessions will be made until the U.S. budges on hot button issues.&quot;Chinese policy makers are gathered in Beijing for a key political meeting that's set to conclude on Thursday,&quot; reports Bloomberg, citing sources close to the talks. &quot;In meetings ahead of that plenum some officials have relayed low expectations that future negotiations could result in anything meaningful -- unless the U.S. is willing to roll back more of the tariffs. In some cases, they've urged American visitors to carry that very message back to Washington, the people said.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere in the U.S., in what President Donald Trump is calling the biggest witch hunt in our country's history, the House of Representatives voted, mostly along party lines, 232-196 to proceed with impeachment of the 45th U.S. president. Assuming this effort makes it out of the Democrat-controlled House, it will almost certainly die in the Republican controlled Senate.Still, Mr. Market isn't a high school government class expert, but he is an expert in gauging uncertainty. Uncertainty is undesirable in financial markets, but that's exactly what the impeachment proceedings are creating.  * 7 Stocks to Buy in November So that gets us to the Nasdaq Composite falling by 0.14% while the S&P 500 retreated by 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.52% with just five of its 30 holdings in late trading, one of the worst ratios seen in weeks. Thank Goodness for AppleInvestors cringing at the thought of how bad things could have been today for the Dow if not Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are right to feel that way. Apple, the third-largest member of the price-weighted Dow, gained 2.26% today and was easily the best performer among the thinly populated club of Dow gainers.Thursday's bullishness in Apple came after the company reported a blowout set of fiscal fourth-quarter results after the close Wednesday. Apple notched earnings of $3.13 on revenue of $64.04 billion while Wall Street was expecting earnings of $2.84 on revenue of $62.99 billion. Declines in iPhone sales moderated and there was solid growth in other areas of the company's businesses.&quot;The company posted 18% growth in services, nearly 17% growth in iPad sales and 54% growth in wearables, driven in particular by AirPod sales,&quot; according to Barron's. On A Related Note…Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), a soon-to-be competitor of Apple's in the streaming entertainment war, was one of the other Dow winners today, albeit in modest fashion. Disney reports earnings for the quarter on Nov. 7, with analysts expecting EPS of 95 cents on revenue of $19.03 billion.News that Disney's European Riviera Resort project is set to be operational by mid-December was viewed as one of the reasons for the stock's small gain today. Sour CyclicalsIt was a rough day for cyclical stocks, such as Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and 3M (NYSE:MMM). That pair have endured plenty of rough days this year, but news that the US/China trade issue is, well, still an issue, pressured Caterpillar today. Both of those stocks fell more than 2% today.The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and China's PMI, data points released earlier today, were seen as bad and that was enough to weigh on cyclical names.The likes of Caterpillar and 3M could be tested again Friday with the October jobs report and the Institute for Supply Management's October survey due out before the bell. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayNovember starts on Friday, and let's hope history holds true to form because the eleventh month of the year is usually kind to equities. Over the past 20 years, the Dow has averaged November gains of 1.6%, the third-best month of the year for the blue-chip index, while closing higher in the month 70% of the time.Interestingly, industrials are one of the best-performing sectors on a historical basis in November. The aforementioned weakness in 3M and Caterpillar could test that thesis this year.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-29	2019-10-29 16:48:21	MMM	3M Company	The Kiplinger Dividend 15: Our Favorite Dividend-Paying Stocks	Income investors love dividend stocks for their regular payouts; any stock-price appreciation is just gravy. The Kiplinger Dividend 15, the list of our favorite dividend-paying stocks, delivers on the first front, yielding 3.4%, on average, compared with a 1.9% yield for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and a 1.7% yield for the 10-year Treasury bond. What's more, over the past year, our list has slathered on the gravy, too, returning 13.6%, on average, counting dividends and price appreciation, compared with a 4.3% return for the S&P; 500&#92;. Big gains don't come without some strings attached. Like many stocks that have ridden this record-long bull market, some of the names on our list appear to be richly valued now. And although dividends buttress returns when a stock's price slides, pricey stocks could take a big hit in the event of a stock market plunge. Perhaps more salient for dividend investors, major boosts in the share price diminish a stock's yield, as is the case with Blackstone Group and Realty Income--two stocks originally chosen for our list because, among other things, they historically provided yields above 4%. Although they've slipped below that bar, we're not yet ready to jettison them for performing too well, and we believe that their yields can return to historical averages. We're keeping an eye on them, but we're making no changes to the list at present. The Dividend 15 are divided into three categories: stocks with a long history of stable dividends, stocks with the potential for rapid growth in their payouts, and high yielders. Find a dividend stock that suits your needs, or select a mix.

2019-10-28	2019-10-28 20:46:35	MMM	3M Company	Dow Jones Today: Another Trade-Fueled Rally	It took three months, but the major U.S. equity benchmarks revisited all-time highs Monday, supported by more good news on trade. Now comes the hard bard: basically every equity market breakout dating back to last year has been met with immediate selling.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com Things could be different this time around because the U.S.-China news appears to be improving and this week, there's another round of marquee earnings reports for investors to digest. Plus, the Federal Reserve meets this week and with that could come another interest rate cut.And for good measure, the October jobs report will be delivered Friday by the Labor Department.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo all of that is to say while previous breakouts have failed, there are enough catalysts from a wide array of sources available this week to support continued upside in equities. We'll see what the rest of the week brings, but on Monday, equities were in style.The Nasdaq Composite added 1.01% while the S&P 500 jumped 0.56%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.49% with 21 of its 30 components higher in late trading. Microsoft: Still WinningThose invested in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) by now know the company recently scored a significant coup in beating rival Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for a Department of Defense contract, explaining in part why Microsoft was the best-performing member of the Dow Jones today.  * 10 Stocks to Buy Regardless of Q3 Earnings The size of the contract, $10 billion, isn't overwhelming, particularly not for a company with a market capitalization north of $1 trillion, as is the case with Microsoft. The story here is that Azure, Microsoft's cloud business, the one the company said grew by 59% in the third quarter, is becoming an indomitable force in the cloud computing space.Yes, there's controversy surrounding this win for Microsoft, but it's not directly related to the company itself. Amazon seems miffed that it lost this competition because it was viewed as the leader throughout and there are rumblings that President Trump steered this agreement in favor of Microsoft due to some ill will toward Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. There's a lot of moving parts there, none of which involve any impropriety on Microsoft's part, and it's likely the company keeps the DoD contract. Apple AdvanceAs noted above, there are some bellwether companies reporting earnings this week and that includes none other than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which steps into the earnings confessional Wednesday after the close of U.S. markets.Apple has been on a torrid pace as of late and the stock can ill afford any disappointing news on the iPhone 11 or Apple + streaming, which is slated to debut in November. The stock was up 1%, so it appears some investors are buying in advance of Wednesday's report.&quot;Apple's guidance for the quarter calls for revenue of $61 billion to $64 billion, with gross margins of 37.5% to 38.5%. Analysts expect profits of $2.84 a share, which would be down from $2.91 in the year-ago quarter,&quot; according to Barron's. Credit Where It's Due3M (NYSE:MMM) is a name I've been mentioning quite a bit lately due in large part to what can be described as erratic behavior by a struggling stock, but the shares gained 1.79% following an eventful week last week. Every recovery has to start somewhere, but some market participants still have plenty of reservations about 3M.&quot;Fundamentally more of the same, including continued weakness in auto [and] electronics [and in] China,&quot; said JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa in a note out Monday. &quot;However, there were material incremental negatives including downside at health care which many view as the &quot;crown jewel of the portfolio&quot; posting 2% organic on the easiest [comparison] of the year.&quot;Translation: bottom fishing with 3M is still a risky proposition.  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio  Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThis is an eventful week in terms of earnings, macroeconomic headlines and domestic economic data points and the next few days are likely to go a long way in determining the fate of riskier assets into year end and how equities will start 2020. While there will be jitters this week, there are still reasons to remain engaged with equities.&quot;In hindsight, 2016 was a classic mid-cycle slowdown,&quot; said BlackRock in a note out Monday. &quot;We think 2019 could be similar but acknowledge this time could be riskier simply because the cycle is older and the economy has less slack to offer a buffer. Yet we don't see this as the end of the economic expansion -- or equity gains. End of cycle is usually marked by spiking commodity prices, wages that are rising too quickly, and the Fed lifting rates to avert economic overheating. None of these are evident today. In fact, it's just the opposite. One potential upshot: A continuation of slow growth and a stock market that can grind higher.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-25	2019-10-25 20:13:58	MMM	3M Company	Dow Jones Today: Trade Talks Have Stocks Flirting With Records	There were plenty of important earnings reports to digest today, but stocks appeared to take their cues from good news on the U.S.-China trade front with the major equity benchmarks approaching all-time highs on word that trade talks are progressing in positive fashion.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com &quot;They made headway on specific issues and the two sides are close to finalizing some sections of the agreement,&quot; according to a statement out earlier today from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's office.President Trump is pushing to sign the first phase of the trade accord next month at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Chile.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe trade talk helped the Nasdaq Composite advance 0.70%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.41%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average powered higher by 0.57%. Give the Nasdaq some credit. Today's gains were built without much from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which was beaten up after its third-quarter earnings report. Or maybe Amazon itself deserves some credit because it closed the day at $1,761, well above the day lows around $1,695. Tech SupportOn Thursday, I mentioned the importance of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) earnings report in terms of propping up the semiconductor space in the wake of the disaster that was Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) earlier this week.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow Up Intel delivered in epic fashion, surging almost 8% to easily rank as the Dow's best-performing member today. The semiconductor giant posted third-quarter earnings of $1.42 per share on revenue of $19.2 billion. Those numbers absolutely crushed what Wall Street was expecting, which was $1.24 per share on $18.1 billion. Dogs BounceTwo of this year's most frequently mentioned Dow dogs, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), were the next best performers in the blue chip index today after Intel. Certainly in the case of Caterpillar, these were probably China news-driven trades. Both companies reported earnings earlier this week and neither report was particularly strong, so today's bounces in these embattled names may be no more than trades, not opportunities to be long these stocks for lengthy time frames. Post-Earnings MalaiseVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) reported decent third-quarter results earlier today, but investors weren't overly enthusiastic about the numbers as the stock was one of the Dow losers on the day.Verizon said it earned $1.25 per share on revenue of $32.9 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.24 a share on revenue of $32.7 billion. Making matters interesting in terms of Verizon's price action today was subscriber growth that beat estimates. In theory, the stock should have been up on that news.&quot;The company's consumer unit added a net 193,000 new wireless postpaid lines and its business segment added a net 408,000,&quot; according to Barron's. &quot;That leaves a total of 601,000 new customers who receive a monthly bill, a closely watched metric for wireless companies. Wall Street analysts had been expect 524,000 new postpaid wireless subscribers.&quot; Another Surprise LoserDow high-fly act Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) was one of the index's offenders today, which is surprising given the tenor of a Morgan Stanley note out earlier today on the stock.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian said &quot;P&G is likely to be able to increase its revenues faster than its peers even if it raises prices only modestly, given its broad-based strength,&quot; according to Barron's.He reiterated an &quot;overweight&quot; rating and $134 price target on the Dow component.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch  Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayNext week brings another raft earnings reports, including some big-name technology stocks and some members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. With that in mind, this earnings season has been decent relative to earlier expectations.&quot;To date, 40% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for Q3 2019. In terms of earnings, the percentage of companies reporting actual EPS above estimates (80%) is above the five-year average,&quot; according to FactSet Research data. &quot;In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 3.8% above the estimates, which is below the five-year average. In terms of sales, the percentage of companies (64%) reporting actual sales above estimates is above the five-year average. In aggregate, companies are reporting sales that are 1.1% above estimates, which is also above the five-year average.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-24	2019-10-24 20:19:09	MMM	3M Company	Dow Jones Today: Another Sluggish Day Despite Earnings Avalanche	Considering the sheer number of earnings reports out today, including several from bellwether/marquee companies, it was another listless day for stocks. That's not necessarily bad nor is it good. It is what is and it means that over the past several days, investors have been taking cues from factors beyond quarterly earnings updates.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com China is part of that because trade negotiations remain ongoing, but the good news is that the country appears poised to buy a massive $20 billion worth of goods from American farmers.&quot;Investors also watched the latest developments in the ongoing trade dispute. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence criticized China's actions against protesters in Hong Kong while calling for greater engagement between the world's two biggest economies,&quot; according to Bloomberg. &quot;The Asian nation aims to buy at least $20 billion of agricultural products in a year if it signs a partial trade deal, people familiar with the matter said.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn stock-specific news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged, becoming the largest domestic automaker by market value following a stellar third-quarter earnings report. For those looking for more gauges of risk appetite, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and two Dow components report earnings after the bell today.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow Up For today, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.82%, while the S&P 500 added 0.21%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the offender among the major U.S. benchmarks, sliding 0.09% with fewer than a third of its 30 components higher in late trading. Egregious OffenderOffenders were easy to spot today, but one that stands out for all the wrong reasons, obviously, is 3M (NYSE:MMM). Mentions of 3M in this space this year have been mostly negative simply because the industrial conglomerate's price action has done little to suggest anything positive.That trend continued today as shares of 3M lost 3.82%, extending its year-to-date loss to nearly 12% while cementing the stock's status as one of the worst-performing members of the Dow. 3M's 2019 outlook led to today's decline.The company forecast 2019 adjusted earnings of $9.09 a share, below the prior estimate of $9.25 and well below the $9.31 a share Wall Street was expecting. In third quarter, 3M sales of $8 billion missed estimates of $8.17 billion and it appears as though per share earnings of $2.72 only topped estimates due to a one-time gain.3M is the latest industrial member of the Dow to issue cautious if not depressing guidance. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) did the same yesterday, but the stock rose. However, Caterpillar shares traded lower today, indicating investors are concerned about the slowing global economy and its impact on that stock. Watch the ThroneInvestors looking for better news among Dow components today should look at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which jumped almost 2% following another stellar earnings report.&quot;For the quarter, the software giant reported revenue of $33.1 billion, up 14% from the comparable year-ago quarter and ahead of the Wall Street analyst consensus forecast of $32.23 billion,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;Profits were $1.38 a share, up 24% from a year ago and ahead of the consensus at $1.24 a share.&quot;Azure, the company's cloud computing business, continues growing at rapid rate, notching revenue growth of 59% in the most recently completed quarter. On A Related Note…Perhaps in sympathy with the Microsoft rally or because they are the two Dow components reporting earnings this afternoon, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Visa (NYSE:V) were two of the other Dow leaders today.Following the bloodbath that was the quarterly update from Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) earlier this week, the semiconductor industry could sure some good earnings vibes from Intel, one of the group's largest constituents.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Analysts are expecting Intel to report earnings of $1.23 per share and $18.05 billion of revenue. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayEarnings are always important, but these reports are taking on added significance against the backdrop of slowing global. Unfortunately, the likes of 3M and Caterpillar are confirming, not bucking the sluggish growth outlook and that's something to be aware of into year end and heading into 2020.&quot;The IMF's October World Economic Outlook shows world GDP growth slowing from 3.6% in 2018 to 3.0% in 2019 and 3.4% in 2020, lowered from July's interim projections,&quot; according to FactSet Research. &quot;A 3.0% growth rate would be the slowest global growth since the 2008-2009 global economic slowdown. According to the IMF, risks to the global growth outlook skew to the downside as trade barriers and heightened geopolitical tensions disrupt global supply chains and hamper confidence, investment, and growth.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-24	2019-10-24 19:48:54	MMM	3M Company	5 Top Stock Trades for Friday: TWTR, PYPL, F	It's one of the busiest earnings days of the years, as an influx of quarterly numbers hit the wires on Thursday. Here's a look at a few top stock trades for Friday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Twitter (TWTR)Sorry bulls, but there's no way to sugarcoat the beating in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Shares were rocked lower by 20% on the day with earnings being the culprit.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top-Notch REITs to Buy for Income Amid the decline, TWTR fell out of its rising channel (blue lines) and knifed right through the 50-week moving average like it wasn't even there.Aggressive bulls may consider a long position in Twitter near $28. However, it may be too tempting on the long side should it get to about $26. That level has been a significant mark in the past, while the rising 200-week moving average is just below. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: PayPal (PYPL)PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is getting some much-needed reprieve on Thursday, up over 7% after reporting earnings.While the stock's sharp rally out of its falling wedge is nice, it would have been more attractive if PYPL were to close over its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.From here, see if PYPL can reclaim its 200-day moving average. North of that and bulls may consider a long trade. Below the 61.8% retracement, and $100 or lower may be on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Ford (F)Ford (NYSE:F) stock is not having a good day of trading, falling almost 7% after earnings. $9.40 resistance ultimately held Ford in check and now on the downside, bulls will look to see if $8.40 to $8.50 can buoy the name.Below $8.40 puts the October low of $8.30 on the table. Beneath that and Ford stock may be heading for the $7's. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Ford is a tough stock to own. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: 3M Co (MMM)Earlier this month in back-to-back weeks, 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) bounced off the $150 area. This mark was support in 2016 after acting as resistance in 2015.Holding this mark now would be best for 3M Co bulls, particularly after its earnings report. Falling below it could usher in a wave of selling for this dividend stud. On the upside, we need to see a move north of $170, clearing it over short-term downtrend resistance (purple line).From there, it puts $180-plus is on the table, where it will find its 50-week and 200-week moving averages. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Lam Research (LRCX)Despite the doom and gloom of the others, Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a breath of fresh air. Shares are up more than 12% to new 52-week highs on the day. That also gave a big boost to chips and semi stocks.Shares have been moving higher in a channel over the past year. That action continues now after its breakout over $240. See that $240 now holds as support on a future pullback, while looking to see if channel resistance does its job and acts as resistance.Keep in mind, the stock has a Fibonacci extension up at $273.85. In combination with channel resistance that area could impede LRCX stock in the short-term, should it continue higher.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

This after spending the past four months trying to hold near current levels.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With 100% Upside Potential A number of component stocks are weakening badly. Here are five stocks to sell now:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips McDonald's (MCD)McDonalds (NYSE:MCD) shares are dropping below their 200-day moving average for the first time since the summer of 2018 as store visits slow, pulling shares down roughly 10% from their recent high.

2019-10-24	2019-10-24 15:03:43	MMM	3M Company	3M Enters Hall of Fame of Disappointments	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Another earnings report, another guidance cut. What else did you expect from 3M Co.?The $93 billion maker of Post-it notes and industrial adhesives  lowered its earnings and revenue forecast for 2019, with Chief Executive Officer Michael Roman on Thursday citing a “challenging” macroeconomic environment. Roman has been in his role since July 2018, and he’s had to cut the company’s outlook in some way during every quarter of his tenure but one. The exception was this year’s second quarter, when 3M maintained its forecast for 2019 sales to grow as much as 2%, absent the impact of currency swings and M&A. That depended on a stabilization in China and automotive markets; unsurprisingly, that didn’t materialize, and Thursday’s deep guidance reduction shows the company would have been wise to be more cautious. 3M now expects sales to at best decline 1% for the full year. That will be its worst showing since 2009.The series of guidance cuts under Roman has been sloppy and, at times, illogical. His initial 2019 forecast called for organic sales growth of as much as 4%, even as economic data pointed to a cooling in manufacturing demand. It’s telling that 3M shares initially fell only about 1% on this latest earnings miss. No one really believed Roman when he said in July that 3M’s guidance was still realistic. That lack of credibility should be troubling for the company.But the fact is, there’s a lot to be concerned about in this latest disappointment, both for 3M and for the broader economy, and the stock slumped 5% as investors dug into the numbers more closely. The guidance cut reflects in part a 15-cent per-share negative impact from 3M’s $6.7 billion takeover of wound-care company Acelity Inc., which closed earlier this month. But even when you back that out, the magnitude of the outlook reduction is severe. 3M anticipates fourth-quarter organic sales may decline as much as 3%, a sharp shift from a 1.3% slide in the third quarter that was already worse than analysts had expected. Looking at the U.S. as a region, organic sales declined 1.1% in the three months ended in September, compared with a 0.1% gain in the second quarter. In Asia, sales slumped 4.4% on the same basis in the third quarter. It doesn’t take long for 3M’s products to go from the factory to the end customer, so it’s on the front lines of any economic weakness. Thursday’s earnings report offers troubling fresh evidence that the current manufacturing slowdown is accelerating and deepening.  This follows the first quarterly earnings decline in nearly three years at another industrial bellwether, Caterpillar Inc., on Wednesday, though its commitment to cut production and other costs to adjust to the weaker demand environment helped offset investors’ concerns about its  downbeat profit and sales outlook. Also on Thursday, toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker Inc. cut its full-year earnings guidance below even the lowest analyst estimate and announced a new $200 million cost-cutting plan. That’s on top of a “margin resiliency” program focused on using digital technologies to improve profitability by $300 million to $500 million by 2022.3M lacks the same kind of promise of margin protection. Because of the Acelity deal, 3M has reduced its planned share repurchases for 2019. Meanwhile, its acquisition of artificial-intelligence platform M*Modal for $1 billion earlier this year and other growth investments are pressuring margins in the health-care division. 3M announced a $225 million to $250 million restructuring plan in April, but it’s still grappling with inventory pullbacks in its more industrial-facing units as nervous customers worry about the sustainability of demand. Economic weakness plays a role here, but there are also signs of operational foot faults. Adding another earnings disappointment to CEO Roman’s resume won’t help 3M fix the perception that its days as a safe bet are over, and not soon to return.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-10-24	2019-10-24 14:25:23	MMM	3M Company	3M Tumbles as Industrial Weakness Forces Another Forecast Cut	(Bloomberg) -- 3M Co. dropped the most in six months after slashing its profit and sales outlooks -- the latest sign that a global industrial downturn is hobbling the manufacturer.Adjusted earnings will be no more than $9.09 a share this year, below even the $9.25 bottom of the previous range, the company said Thursday in a statement as it reported quarterly results. Analysts had been predicting $9.31, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.“3M posted broadly disappointing third-quarter operating results and lowered its full-year EPS guidance once again, representing the fifth guidance cut in the past seven quarters,” Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note. “If investors were bracing for a tough operating macro across the sector in the third quarter, 3M’s results confirmed those worries.”The diminished outlook deepens the challenge for 3M, a poster child for the manufacturing slowdown that has cut its guidance multiple times since Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman took the helm last year. The maker of Post-it notes, adhesives and touchscreen displays has cited obstacles from a weak automotive market, to high raw-material prices, to headwinds in China.“The macroeconomic environment remains challenging,” Roman said in Thursday’s statement. “We’ll continue to focus on driving operational improvements and investing for the future.”3M slid 5.2% to $160.02 at 10:16 a.m. in New York after declining 5.3%, the most intraday since April 25 and Thursday’s worst performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock fell 11% this year through Wednesday, the industrials’ third-weakest showing.Sales dropped 2% in the third quarter to $8 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $8.17 billion. Profit rose to $2.72 a share, which includes a 14-cent gain from a divestiture, 3M said.The revenue figure was hurt by a 5% decline in the Asia-Pacific region. Sales dropped in the safety division and the transportation and electronics unit as well. Health care again proved to be a bright spot for 3M, with revenue rising 4.7%.Weak DemandThe softer demand prompted the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company to cut its sales expectations for this year. Organic revenue in local currency will decline between 1% and 1.5%, down from a previous projection for growth of as much as 2%.The revised adjusted-profit forecast accounts for the recent acquisition of Acelity to its health-care portfolio, which hadn’t been previously included. The outlook excludes litigation-related charges as well as the impact of a divestiture and the deconsolidation of a Venezuelan subsidiary, 3M said.To contact the reporter on this story: Richard Clough in New York at rclough9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Case at bcase4@bloomberg.net, Susan Warren, Tony RobinsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-tumbles-industrial-weakness-forces-142523536.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-16	2019-10-16 20:32:21	MMM	3M Company	Dow Jones Today: Retail Worries Take A Toll	After a strong earnings-driven rally yesterday, U.S. equity benchmarks gave back some of those gains Wednesday following some slack retail sales data.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com Retail sales dipped 0.30% in September, disappointing analysts that had been forecasting a 0.30% increase. In better news, the Commerce Department revised the August figure to a gain of 0.60%, but as stocks' performance today indicates, market participants focused more on the September number, a logical approach considering the holiday shopping season is essentially upon us.I've been reluctant to join the calls regarding a recession, but I've also been clear that the consumer is integral when it comes to holding things together for the U.S. economy. Another bit of silver lining is that the September retail sales figure was the first decline in seven months and that the decline was largely attributable to spending drops at motor vehicle supply stores.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmong Dow components, looming earnings reports from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) should bring the state of the consumer into clearer view.For today, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.30% while the S&P 500 declined 0.20%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated by 0.08% with just 12 of its 30 components higher in late trading.Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was the only Dow stock to gain more than 1% today on what looked liked some follow through on Tuesday's earnings report as well as some favorable reaction to some of the various opioid-related verdicts the company is contending with. Other Bright SpotsIn late trading, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, was clinging to a modest gain. This might be another example of follow through on yesterday's earnings report as well as a sympathy move on the back of Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) strong report out earlier today.  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever &quot;Given the fact that multiple rate cuts have already occurred, with the possibility for more, this was not surprising,&quot; said Morningstar in a note on JPM out yesterday. &quot;Management also nailed down its expense guidance a bit more, coming in at roughly $65.5 billion, whereas before the guidance was simply for less than $66 billion. After incorporating these and other changes, we are increasing our fair value estimate to $114 per share from $110.&quot; Finally Some Good NewsShares of 3M Co. (NYSE:MMM) traded lower today, extending the stock's run as one of this year's worst-performing Dow names, but the stock is up more than 8% over the past week and some analysts are waxing bullish on the industrial conglomerate.&quot;Even after the 4% bounce on Oct. 11, we still believe the stock trades at a discount to intrinsic value in a diversified industrial space with few bargains,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note on 3M. &quot;As a GDP-plus business, 3M doesn't offer much in the way of top-line growth. Even so, we like the name with speculation of an upcoming recession because 3M is a defensive stock.&quot; Oil WoesWhile there was some talk that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) may extend recent supply cuts, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were the worst performers in the Dow Jones today.Big oil companies report third-quarter earnings later this month, but some analysts are already warning that estimates could be missed and that could explain some of the malaise in the group today. This year, energy is the worst-performing group in the S&P 500.  * 7 Big Bank Stocks on the Move  Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayReminder that International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) reports today after the bell and that tomorrow is light on the Dow earnings front with none of the index's members report. American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) resume Dow earnings season on Friday before the bell.As for the consumer, there are some good data points to consider.&quot;Perhaps the biggest difference versus last cycle: consumers are less indebted. On the eve of the financial crisis consumers were contending with record levels of debt,&quot; according to BlackRock. &quot;At its peak in 2007, household debt was more than 130% of disposable income. Today household debt is less than 100% of income. Not only are debt levels lower, but thanks to historically low yields the cost of servicing the debt is near an historic low.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-16	2019-09-16 16:42:02	MMM	3M Company	Can General Electric Stock Stay Above Vital Support?	Shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) had enjoyed a strong 2019. The stock bottomed out in December just below $6.50, before General Electric stock rallied more than 75% to $11.27 in February.Source: Carsten Reisinger / Shutterstock.com Since then though, GE stock has been consolidating in a mostly sideways pattern. However, that sideways pattern is starting to develop into a rather negative look. That's even as General Electric stock has remained well-above its December lows.  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now It has got investors wondering if there's been a &quot;change in tune&quot; with GE stock and if the sideways action will result in dead money -- or worse, losses -- rather than resolve higher. Before diving into the company, let's look at the technicals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Trading General Electric StockWe have been covering General Electric stock here on InvestorPlace for quite some time. It's no wonder, given its former place among America's blue-chip companies. That's no longer the case, even among its own industry. Names like Honeywell (NYSE:HON), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) are all considered superior entities.In any regard, we kept such a close eye on GE stock because of its tight trading range. Specifically, we continued to highlight range support at $9 and range resistance near $10.50. The latter elevated itself to around $10.70 in June and July, but we've seen a drastic shift in sentiment since.  Click to EnlargeInterestingly enough, those range levels have now doubled in significance, as it highlights two key Fibonacci retracements. The 38.2% retracement sits up at $10.60, while the 61.8% rests at $8.99.The question now is, can GE stock reclaim former range support and the 61.8% near $9?Last month, General Electric stock traded down to support and gapped below it, plunging to $7.65. On the subsequent retest though, this former support level acted as resistance, as GE again pulled back to sub-$8 levels. That's where the &quot;change in tune&quot; reference comes in.Now just under $9 again, bulls need to make a strong showing. If General Electric stock can reclaim the $9 level, it puts the 200-day moving average at $9.25 and the 50-day moving average at about $9.50 on the table.GE stock will need to reclaim those two key moving averages in order to get back to range resistance near $10.60.If $9 acts as resistance, August support at $8 is a possibility. Below that and the August lows, and sub-$7 is on the table. Key Analyst Will Move GE StockA key catalyst for General Electric stock has been JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa.Tusa upgraded GE from underweight to neutral in December, sparking an enormous rally. To be clear, he wasn't bullish, just less bearish given that the stock had gone from $30 to $7 in a relatively short period of time.Throughout the past few quarters -- through earnings and investor presentations -- Tusa has been critical of the company and of management's outlook. He has since gone back to his underweight rating. About a month ago, he wrote that the company's fundamentals &quot;continue to look negative.&quot;He still maintains an underweight rating and $5 price target on the stock, implying more than 45% downside. GE Stock GrowthFor the most recent quarter, General Electric stock beat on earnings and revenue expectations. It also provided better-than-expected guidance. But not everything was perfect in the quarter.For one, GE warned about headaches stemming from the grounding of Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes. Specifically, GE's cash flow could take a $1.4 billion hit if the planes remain grounded all year. It could also impact guidance.Growth is far from robust, too. Analysts expect revenue to decline almost 4% year-over-year in 2019. In 2020, estimates call for just a 70 basis point advance. The plus side is that revenue would be done going down in this scenario, but disappointing in that it's still sub-1%.GE is still a few years away from returning to any type of impressive growth for investors. In the meantime, it needs to focus on strengthening its balance sheet and improving its free cash flow. If it can attack the latter, investors -- and Tusa -- will take notice.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

After all, the index does represent some of America's largest and finest companies. Thanks to their large moats, strong cash flows and big dividends, Dow Jones stocks really are the bluest of the blue-chips and make great portfolio additions.However, the various shades of blue do vary.Thanks to the recent market hiccups, rising global tensions, the trade war and overall economic malaise, not all the Dow Stocks would be considered champions at this point. And in fact, a few of them downright stink. Misreads on trends coupled with the current global economic problems have made several stocks in the blue-chip index chronically underperform in recent weeks and in fact, years for some. That puts them firmly in the &quot;don't buy camp.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September But how can you tell which Dow Jones stocks are big buys and which are downright sells? Luckily, here at InvestorPlace, we've done the leg work for you. Here are three of the Dow's biggest stocks to avoid. Dow Jones Stocks to Sell: 3M (MMM)Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Percent Off 52-Week High: 26%The reason to buy industrial giant 3M (NYSE:MMM) stems from the fact the firm is so global in its revenues. A huge portion of its sales come from overseas. That has driven the stock's cash flows and profits in recent years. The reason to sell 3M is also that it's so global in its sales.As the trade war has dragged on, 3M has been hit hard by the overall slowing global economy. A prime example was its last earnings report. Despite a hefty share buyback program, earnings-per-share for this Dow Jones stock slipped over 37% year-over-year, while net revenues declined 2.6%. The vast bulk of the slippage in sales continues to be from Asia, Europe other emerging markets. These are the regions that drove sales in previous quarters. Moreover, the strong dollar and local currency fluctuations continue to hit 3M hard.This is a big deal going forward. With no end to the trade war in sight and major international economies -- such as Germany -- slowing way down/contracting, 3M could be between a rock and hard place. During its last conference call, the industrial stock warned things could get rough. Management is now guiding to earn $8.75 per share on the high-end -- a dip of 3.1% from its last EPS estimate.While 3M isn't in any danger of cutting its dividend and ending its long streak of payout increases, the continued dip in EPS could spell trouble for its pace of dividend jumps. And with a PEG ratio of nearly 2 and forward P/E of 18, MMM stock isn't exactly a bargain.With many of the catalysts for ownership now deteriorating and the stock relatively expensive, this is one of the Dow Jones stocks to avoid for the time being. IBM (IBM)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Percent Off 52-Week High: 12%There are plenty of old school tech stocks that have pivoted correctly in the new paradigm. Dotcom leaders like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have successfully changed their operations to better compete in the cloud and across many new trends in tech. And their investors have been rewarded.Then there's IBM (NYSE:IBM).Big Blue should be a leader. Unfortunately, IBM has managed to make plenty of missteps over the last decade. Missing key trends like the rise of cloud computing has continued to hurt the firm's bottom line. Revenues last quarter marked the fourth-straight quarterly revenue decline for the tech dinosaur. Based on full-year estimates for 2019, IBM will have seen its sales drop by nearly 19% over the last five years. That's just terrible.So, it's no wonder why IBM decided to buy out Red Hat to inject some growth into the firm for $34 billion. And there is potential for growth. Fellow InvestorPlace contributor David Moadel recently mentioned that the Dow Jones stock could be a major contender in open-source software and in the cloud. However, based on its estimates, IBM says Red Hat won't boost earnings until 2021 at the earliest. And given how lousy IBM has been at integrating acquisitions in recent history, the potential may not be realized.What's worse is that Big Blue recently suspended its lucrative buyback program to pay for the deal. Those buybacks have actually managed to reduce its share count by roughly 25% over the last few years.  * 7 Low-Risk Mutual Funds to Buy Now In the end, there's a lot of risk for IBM and not much safety net anymore. Red Hat will take a ton of time to integrate and in the meantime, investors are getting nothing but declining sales while waiting. There's better tech stocks out there and this is one of the Dow Jones stocks to avoid. Caterpillar (CAT)Source: aapsky / Shutterstock.com Percent Off 52-Week High: 25%It's easy to pick on Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) based on the trade war and continued lower demand from China. After all, China's massive expansion and infrastructure upgrades have long been a huge driver for construction equipment. So, with China slowing, CAT is in some hot water.The issue for the heavy-machinery firm is that it's not just woes from China that are hurting its bottom line. It turns out, construction spending across the board is starting to wobble in a big way. Both Cummins (NYSE:CMI) and Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) both recently warned that CAPEX spending is dropping in the U.S. as well. That CAPEX spending is also coming to the metals and mining industry as well as the sectors. The same could be said for agricultural and forester equipment. Overall demand for powerful diesel engines and other heavy machines is now dropping as the trade war has trickled on.This is a huge problem for CAT. Sales in the U.S. as well as key segments -- like energy -- have helped keep the profit engine growing and they have also helped it overcome many of the woes from China/Asia in general. But with many of these markets now seeing contraction and spending dwindle, CAT could be hit hard. And in fact, management is now predicting EPS come in at the lower end of their estimated guidance. If things continue to turn poor and the recession finally hits, the Dow Jones stock could be in a world of hurt.Now, CAT still pulls in a ton of cash flows and has seen rising sales. This has translated into a big 20% dividend boost and improved buyback program. But now that sales and cash flow growth have been muted in the new tariff-filled environment, that robust pace of dividend/buyback growth could slow if things start to really hit the fan.And for investors, that could make CAT a stock to place on their watchlist for now.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Here are five Dow Jones Industrial Average components that are under pressure:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips American Express (AXP)Shares of American Express (NYSE:AXP) are dropping to test critical support from the August lows as a violation of the 200-day moving average looks likely. Just a retest would be worth a loss of a little more than 4% from here. The company will next report results on Oct. 18 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.03 per share on revenues of nearly $11 billion. Boeing (BA)Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares have fallen back below their 200-day moving average after stalling at overhead resistance set between $360-$380 on reports the re-certification of the 737 MAX could take longer than previously believed.

The company will next report results on Nov. 13 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 81 cents per share on revenues of $13.1 billion. Chevron (CVX)Chevron (NYSE:CVX) shares look vulnerable to a breakdown out of a multi-month consolidation range going back to February as the 200-day moving average looks like it's unable to hold. This caps a sideways range that has been in play since early 2018 and will likely give way to another test of the 200-week moving average, which would be worth a loss of more than 10% from here.

2019-09-03	2019-09-03 17:52:03	MMM	3M Company	U.S. Manufacturing Gauge Contracts for First Time in Three Years	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. A key U.S. factory gauge unexpectedly contracted for the first time since 2016, sending stocks and bond yields lower and boosting expectations for interest-rate cuts as global manufacturing woes deepen.The Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers index fell to 49.1 in August, weaker than all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists, data released Tuesday showed. Figures below 50 indicate the manufacturing economy is generally shrinking. The group’s gauge of new orders dropped to a more than seven-year low, while the production index hit the lowest since late 2015.The data add to concern a broader U.S. recession is coming and may complicate the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, whose pledges to revive manufacturing have been a signature issue. At the same time, Trump’s escalating tariffs on imports from China have been a major reason behind factory weakness that threatens to spread to consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the world’s largest economy.In the U.S. stock market, the ISM numbers torpedoed a morning rebound and left the S&P 500 poised for its worst loss in seven sessions, down as much as 1.2% to erase almost half of last week’s rally. The 10-year Treasury yield and the dollar fell.Traders of fed funds futures boosted the amount of easing they expect from the U.S. central bank this year, following a July 31 quarter-point cut that was the first since 2008. For the next Fed decision on Sept. 18, investors increased bets on a half-point reduction but continued to lean toward a quarter-point cut.“This piece of data is part of the puzzle that helps to push us into recession,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial Inc. “The ramifications of the trade war show up in the euro zone, in Asia and now in the U.S. If the deterioration in the U.S. continues, it’s going to feed into the overall labor market.”What Bloomberg’s Economists Say“To be sure, economic anxiety related to tariffs and increasing trade tensions is extracting a significant toll on business confidence. However, there was limited direct evidence of tariffs creating upward price pressures or materials shortages in the details of the report. As such, the second-order impacts from the tariffs (i.e. confidence effects and currency appreciation) appear to be having the more substantial impact.”-- Carl Riccadonna, chief U.S. economistAlthough manufacturing only makes up about 11% of the U.S. economy, there are concerns that entrenched weakness -- and any layoffs that may result -- could filter through to the rest of the economy and endanger the record-long expansion.Transportation equipment was one of seven industries in the ISM report to report shrinking business activity last month. Automakers, which report their August sales on Wednesday, account for some of the slowdown. General Motors Co. has ceased production this year at a car plant in Ohio and transmission factory in Michigan, two of the four U.S. sites that it has said aren’t being allocated future product. Other automakers are reducing production shifts, including Nissan Motor Co., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Honda Motor Co.Weakness in the automotive and electronics markets is also impacting 3M Co.’s bottom line. Sales and profit at the diversified manufacturer fell in the second quarter even as earnings topped expectations. At Caterpillar Inc., a slowdown in crude extraction from the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oil patch, is reducing demand for machinery. What’s more, the equipment maker’s worldwide machine sales in June and July were up 4%, the slowest in two years.Manufacturing is technically already in a recession in the U.S. with a Fed measure of output declining in two consecutive quarters. The malaise is consistent with developments in the sector around the world. By one measure, global factory activity has contracted for four straight months.The ISM’s measure of new orders, which are tracked by some as a leading indicator of a downturn, declined to 47.2. It was the first time since December 2015 that the gauge fell below 50. ISM’s production gauge also sank below that mark, to 49.5 in August from 50.8.The slump in demand and output spilled over into the labor market as the ISM’s gauge of factory employment fell to 47.4, the lowest level since March 2016. That suggests this Friday’s employment report will show weakness in August manufacturing payrolls, which were surprisingly solid the previous two months.“It confirms that the weakness that we’ve been seeing for a number of months now on the global front and on the tariff front is really washing up to the U.S. shores,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “What’s important here is that it’s not just the current conditions that have deteriorated quite sharply but also the forward-looking components.”A measure of export orders, a proxy of overseas demand, sank to 43.3, the lowest reading since April 2009 during the depths of the last recession.A separate factory PMI from IHS Markit came in at 50.3 on Tuesday, showing manufacturing was barely expanding. Economists and investors tend to more closely follow the ISM report, which dates to 1931.The “shock effect” of the latest ISM report “adds to recession fears, and the components were also pretty weak,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, in an interview. “This does confirm that we’re not bottoming out yet in manufacturing in this country, and that’s significant.”(Adds companies in eighth and ninth paragraphs)&#92;--With assistance from Chris Middleton, Elena Popina, Vildana Hajric and David Welch.To contact the reporter on this story: Reade Pickert in Washington at epickert@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Scott Lanman at slanman@bloomberg.net, Vince GolleFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-manufacturing-contracts-first-time-140000169.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-30	2019-08-30 15:37:52	MMM	3M Company	3 Large-Cap Stocks to Sell in September	Analysts tend to regard large market cap companies as good and stable long-term investments. Therefore, I personally do not make investment decisions on such solid stocks based on daily hype. However, even the darlings of Wall Street get held down from time to time. Today I'm going to discuss three stocks, 3M (NYSE:MMM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), that may experience further volatility in September.I believe there will likely be some profit-taking with these names in the coming weeks. Investors may consider waiting on the sidelines if they do not currently have any positions open in MMM, JNJ or TSLA stocks.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off Alternatively, if they already own shares, investors may either consider taking some money off the table during this market bounce or hedging their positions. As for hedging strategies, covered calls or put spreads with Oct 18 expiry could be appropriate. Straight put purchases could be expensive due to heightened volatility. Any short-term decline in these shares may offer better entry points for long-term investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Stocks to Sell: 3M Company (MMM)Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com 3M, a coveted member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is clearly going through a difficult patch in its history.In January 2018, MMM stock reached an all-time high of $259.77. Since then, it has been in a multi-month decline. Year-to-date, 3M stock price, which has missed the broader market rally of 2019, is down about 15%.On July 25, MMM stock reported second-quarter earnings. During the quarter the group's sales fell 2.6% year-over-year to $8.2 billion. Similarly 3M's adjusted earnings per share fell 28% year-over-year to $2.20. Management highlighted 3M's struggles with low demand in China's automotive and electronics sectors.Following the earnings report, despite the fall in profits, MMM stock initially went up. However, that move was rather short lived as on Aug. 28, 3M shares saw a 52-low week low of $154.If there were further external events, such as increased trade tensions with China or a slowing down of the U.S. economy or company-specific problems, it is possible that management may also take the extraordinary measure of cutting MMM stock's dividend.At this point, the bulls are not yet in control and the selling pressure has increased, especially after the Q2 earnings report. Therefore MMM shares will need a catalyst to make them attractive in the eyes of long-term investors, who are probably still skeptical about the near-term prospects for the company.I'd find MMM stock attractive if it falls below $130 -- especially if it heads toward $110. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com With a market cap of $339 billion, Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare giant, is currently number 37 on the Fortune 500 list. The group builds its moat by investing heavily in its diverse pharmaceutical pipeline.JNJ operates in three segments that provide it with diversified sources of revenue, earnings and cash flow:  * Pharmaceutical (contributes more than 50% of JNJ's pre-tax profits)  * Consumer  * Medical Devices and DiagnosticsJNJ's diversification enables the company to withstand economic cycles more effectively. Geographically, the U.S. provides almost half of the revenue.However, the Johnson & Johnson brand has recently been hit by a landmark Oklahoma court ruling. According to the ruling, the drug giant has responsibility for helping fuel the state's opioid epidemic by aggressively marketing painkillers. JNJ has been ordered to pay $572 million in damages.Although the actual amount of this fine may not necessarily dent JNJ stock's fundamental metrics much, I tend to take lawsuits and rulings of this kind rather seriously. In other words, there is usually more headache to follow.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week Year-to-date, JNJ stock is flat. I'd consider buying JNJ stock if it falls below $120 and especially if it heads toward $100.Investors who buy Johnson & Johnson stock now will enjoy a dividend yield of almost 3%. The conglomerate has raised its dividend each year for over half a century. With its diverse range of products, I think JNJ is likely to continue to be a high-dividend staple stock. Tesla (TSLA)Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.comWhen Tesla released worse-than-expected second-quarter 2019 earnings on July 24, many investors possibly ended up with more questions than answers on what to expect from Tesla stock for the rest of the year.Before reporting earnings, TSLA stock closed at $264.88. The next morning it opened at $233.50. Now Tesla stock price is hovering around the $220 range.The past year has seen the demand for electric vehicles decline in the U.S. And Tesla's Model 3 sales have not been at the levels expected. Tesla's Q2 results showed that the gross margin of its automotive segment is declining. Last quarter, it was 20.2%. In Q4 and Q3 of 2018, the metric was 24.3% and 25.8%, respectively.As we discuss Tesla's problems, we have to mention that the auto sector is susceptible to the trade-war risk. As the demand in the U.S. declines, Tesla needs to achieve increased sales numbers from overseas, namely from China, which has the largest electric vehicle market in the world.In late 2017, Tesla and the Chinese government agreed that the company would manufacture cars in China, and build and own a factory in Shanghai.TSLA is continuing to build its manufacturing plant in Shanghai. However, the details as to when actual production will begin at the plant are sketchy. Tesla is yet to release definite dates and production goals for the plant.Therefore, before committing any capital into the shares, I'd like to see the next earnings statement, expected in late October. By then, we might even have an earnings warning statement, which would send the stock even further south.At this point, Tesla bears have the upper hand and I'd consider investing in TSLA stock as a speculative bet.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-22	2019-08-22 19:06:27	MMM	3M Company	Dow Stock Is Cheap for Too Many Reasons	The short history of the new Dow (NYSE:DOW) stock has brought little more than declines. An initial spike after Dow again became a separate company has given away to four months of falling stock prices. Today, it sells near its lowest point since its reintroduction.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The ongoing trade war with China explains much of the decline. However, the spinoff of the former DowDuPont into Dow, DuPont de Nemours (NYSE:DD) and Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) has left investors with a company structure few seem to understand. Until Dow can simplify the company and resume its previous flow of trade with China, DOW stock will likely continue its descent. DOW Stock Continues to DeclineA little more than a month ago, I turned bullish on DOW stock after having been a bear. While I saw possible headwinds related to the trade war, I figured the low price-to-earnings ratio and the generous dividend made a position in DOW worthwhile.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThen, earnings happened. A revenue miss sent it on a downward journey. The declines continued as two analysts downgraded DOW stock to a sell, both cite weakening global demand as the reason. Today, it trades in the $43 per share range, near its 52-week low.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential From a certain point of view, this does not change my previous rationale for recommending DOW stock. The forward P/E ratio now stands at 9.6. Moreover, thanks to the lower stock price, the $2.80 per share annual dividend currently yields almost 6.5%. Dow's Problems Go Beyond the Trade WarHowever, other factors have since persuaded me otherwise. As InvestorPlace columnist Bret Kenwell states, free cash flow did not cover the cost of the DOW stock dividend. Furthermore, with the company just having separated itself from DuPont, investors have no dividend history where they can turn.Moreover, investors have struggled with the business model backing up Dow stock since it became separate. Our own Josh Enomoto goes so far as to compare DOW stock to General Electric (NYSE:GE) and 3M (NYSE:MMM). He points out its consumer, industrial and packaging categories as evidence that Dow has become a hodgepodge of different companies without a focused purpose. Between that and the lower revenue tied to the U.S.-China trade war, the selling continues in DOW.In fairness, DOW stock is not the only equity in this industry which has suffered. Peers such as Westlake Chemical (NYSE:WLK) and LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) also have fallen to 52-week lows. Furthermore, one has to wonder when the market will finally consider the trade war priced into DOW stock and its peers?For now, DOW continues to fall. Even with a low P/E and a high dividend yield, investors rarely succeed by fighting the herd. Moreover, when it does come time to buy, investors must ponder whether they would prefer DOW stock or one of its peers. For example, LyondellBasell stock sells for only 5.8 times forward earnings. At about 5.8%, it pays a slightly lower but still impressive dividend yield. Also, this dividend has risen for seven straight years, and yes, the company cash flows cover this payout. The Bottom Line on DOW StockDOW stock needs both a cohesive focus and for China trade to begin moving higher. Dow stock has fallen since the company missed revenue for its second quarter. Even a low multiple and a generous dividend yield have not stemmed the decline.To some degree, DOW faces the same issues with China trade as its peers. As a result, these peers also have seen their stocks fall to 52-week lows. However, many investors and analysts struggle to understand how the company works since the spinoff. Moreover, with the lack of a dividend history, investors cannot know whether the payout will remain stable under current market conditions. The fact that it does not generate sufficient cash flows to cover this payout merely casts more doubts.Until investors know DOW stock has priced in trade war concerns, investors should stay away. Also, when it comes time for buyers to return to this industry, the case for buying DOW could appear weak. With LYB stock offering a lower valuation and a more stable dividend, investors may not buy Dow stock at that time either.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-08-21	2019-08-21 16:17:52	MMM	3M Company	How Companies Spent Their Summer Vacation: Selling Bonds	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- By all accounts, it was supposed to be a sleepy August for the U.S. corporate bond market. Three weeks ago, the thinking went something like this: Sure, the Federal Reserve would cut its benchmark lending rate on July 31, in what Chair Jerome Powell would call a “mid-cycle adjustment.” But Treasuries were already pricing in such a move on the short end. Further out on the curve, the 30-year yield was about 2.6%, still more than 50 basis points away from its all-time low. Ten-year yields were about 2%, which seemed like a comfortable range for both buyers and sellers. For company finance officers, it had the makings of a sellers’ market but one that would be around once summer drew to a close.Then things got crazy. The 30-year yield lurched lower by 8 basis points on Aug. 1, then 13 basis points on Aug. 5, then another 13 basis points on Aug. 12. After a one-day reprieve near its all-time low of 2.0882%, it cruised through that level, tumbling to as low as 1.914%. The rally was so intense that the U.S. Treasury Department made an unusual, unscheduled announcement that it was again exploring issuing 50- or 100-year bonds. Companies clearly felt they couldn’t afford to pass up this opportunity. In the first full week of August, CVS Health Corp., Humana Inc. and Welltower Inc. headlined $35 billion of debt sales among investment-grade firms, easily surpassing estimates. Then in the week through Aug. 16, more than $22 billion went through, including a rarely seen offering from Exxon Mobil to the tune of $7 billion. Market watchers expected that would just about wrap things up until after Labor Day on Sept. 2.Some finance officers had other ideas. 3M Co. borrowed $3.25 billion on Monday to help finance its acquisition of medical-products maker Acelity Inc. In total, issuers sold $6.65 billion of investment-grade debt on Aug. 19, already topping some predictions for $5 billion this week. Then on Tuesday, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. priced $1 billion at the lower end of its expected yield range, along with a handful of other borrowers with multimillion-dollar deals.All this is to say, companies are simple: They see staggering low yields, and they issue bonds. Investors, for their part, can’t get enough of them. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Bond Index has returned 13.3% so far in 2019. Over the past 12 months, the index is up 12.5%, compared with just 1.5% for the S&P 500 Index. The average spread on corporate bonds has widened to 122 basis points, from 107 basis points at the end of July, but that’s just because they couldn’t keep up with the relentless rally in Treasuries, not because of a lack of buyers.  If Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Hans Mikkelsen are correct, the demand in credit markets has lasting power. They say the $16 trillion of negative-yielding debt globally has left investors — and particularly those outside the U.S. — with few alternatives besides purchasing companies’ debt. “There is a wall of new money being forced into the global corporate bond market,” they wrote on Aug. 16. “Given the near extinction of non-USD IG yield, foreign investors are forced to take more risk.”Of course, buying investment-grade bonds hardly qualifies as a speculative endeavor. Exxon Mobil, in fact, has the same credit rating as the U.S. government from both Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings. On the other hand, Bloomberg News’s Jeannine Amodeo and Davide Scigliuzzo reported this week that three leveraged-loan sales that had been languishing in the U.S. market for weeks were pulled as investors sought higher-quality assets. Vewd Software became the fourth on Tuesday, scrapping a $125 million term loan due to market conditions. Leveraged loans, it should be noted, are floating-rate securities and so face weaker demand when the Fed appears poised to cut rates, as it does now. But for large, highly rated companies, their behavior in recent weeks is exactly what should be expected. Exxon Mobil issued 30-year bonds to yield 3.095%. In November, five-year Treasuries offered the same amount. 3M, rated a few steps below triple-A, priced 30-year debt to yield 3.37%, less than the going rate on long Treasury bonds just nine months ago. No matter how you slice it, they’re getting borrowing costs that seemed unthinkable around this time last year.Interestingly, these low yields should be encouraging governments to borrow more, too. I wrote last week that the bond markets were begging for infrastructure spending. However, it seems neither Germany nor the U.S. has any appetite for that sort of initiative. The German government is reportedly preparing fiscal stimulus that could be triggered by a deep recession, while President Donald Trump hasn’t ruled out a payroll tax cut to stave off any economic weakness.It’s certainly possible that U.S. yields will only fall further from here, and other companies can also borrow or refinance at rock-bottom interest rates. But the move in global bond markets in recent weeks could was extreme, to say the least. The weak demand for Germany’s 30-year bond auction on Wednesday, which offered a coupon of 0% at a yield of -0.11%, suggests there are at least some lines that investors won’t cross.For prudent companies, it was well worth delaying summer vacations to get their deals done.To contact the author of this story: Brian Chappatta at bchappatta1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2019-08-16	2019-08-16 13:55:42	MMM	3M Company	10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever	[Editor's note: &quot;10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever&quot; was previously published in July 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]In a market environment that overwhelmingly encourages constant activity by investors who seemingly want to double their money every week, a discussion of stocks to buy and hold forever seems comically out of place.And yet, for better or worse, that's the mindset all of us should adopt when deploying most of our investing capital. More often than not, the more you trade, the worse you end up doing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt has been said (and verified) that 95% of true &quot;day traders&quot; -- the most aggressive and active of all market participants -- end up losing money by being too active for their own good. Conversely, the fact that Warren Buffett's favorite holding period is &quot;forever&quot; and how he's got a track record most investors would envy is just as telling.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of 10 stocks to buy and hold forever … or at least until something significant changes with your life plans or the companies themselves. AT&T (T)Dividend Yield: 5.%  Year-to-date gain: 20%Calling a spade a spade, shares of telecom giant AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) haven't been easy to own in a while. The stock is down from its mid-2016 peak, while most other stocks are well up for the timeframe.Source: Shutterstock The impasse has been an increasingly-tougher wireless and broadband market. But now that it's acquired media outfit Time Warner Inc (NYSE:TWX), a turnaround might have begun.If your intended timeframe really is &quot;forever&quot; though, a tough couple of years is nothing … particularly considering you're collecting a healthy dividend yield on your position's current value.More than that though, this is a telco name with a lot of clout, and a little more than $50 billion in the bank. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG)Dividend Yield: N/A  Year-to-date gain: 12.7%Fans and followers of the company will likely know that Google parent company Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) beat Q4's  earnings estimate, posting $12.77 per share.Source: Shutterstock What got lost in the shuffle is how operating margins fell to 21 % from last quarter's 24%.Appreciated or not, Alphabet is a profit and revenue growth machine that has earned its spot on a list of &quot;forever&quot; stocks to buy. It may not always beat estimates, but it does always increase its numbers.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On That's because it keeps finding a way to serve as the middleman for about 70% of web searches done on desktops, and boasts being the preferred search engine for about 90% of the queries made via a mobile device.If it was going to be toppled, we'd see evidence of it by now. 3M (MMM)Dividend Yield: 3.67%  Year-to-date gain: -18%In an era where complicated companies are shedding disparate parts of themselves so each arm can be hyper-focused on doing one thing exceedingly well, 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) is something of an outlier.Source: Shutterstock It offers everything from office supplies to healthcare products to the power transformers you see perched on top of power-line poles.It's wild mix that seems to work for 3M though, giving the company something to sell regardless of the economic environment.The clincher: 3M has managed to pay and increase its dividend every year going all the way back to 1977. Walmart (WMT)Dividend Yield: 1.88%  Year-to-date gain: 21%Yes, the advent of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has proven problematic for the world's biggest retailer, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT).Source: Shutterstock Rumors of Walmart's death at the hands of Amazon, however, have been greatly exaggerated.After being knocked over a few years ago, the company has regrouped, having figured out a way to fight the ever-growing reach of its online rival. The evidence? Last quarter's revenue, excluding currency fluctuations, jumped 2.9%.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On While it has been an ugly battle at times, Walmart has finally learned how to compete with Amazon.com. The fact that it can leverage its stores to do so only bolsters the bullish case. Southern Co (SO)Dividend Yield: 4.49%  Year-to-date gain: 30%No list of stocks to buy and hold forever would be complete without a utility stock. In good times and bad, consumers almost always pay their electricity bill.Source: Shutterstock And, even though margins are thin and power providers don't have a ton of pricing power, they have little competition in most markets. Most requests for rate hikes are also approved without question.To that end, Southern Co (NYSE:SO) is one of the top picks of the litter.Southern serves nine million customers, mostly in the south, although it's represented in most of the major regions of the United States. More important, Southern Co has dished out stunningly consistent (even if tiny) profit growth, setting the stage for equally consistent dividends. It has not failed to increase its annual payout since the late 90's. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Dividend Yield: 2.9%  Year-to-date gain: 1.15%As advanced as we've become as a society, the need for medicines, surgical products and simple healthcare solutions like Band-Aids and Tylenol is never going to go away.Source: Shutterstock That means Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) -- which maintains a bigger product portfolio than most investors realize -- will always have something to sell to someone.That being said, don't think for a minute that a play on J&J is capitulation in the search for respectable growth. The company isn't just about treating tummy troubles and selling no-tears baby shampoo.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On It still operates a pharmaceutical arm as well, with its pharma operational revenue jumping 4.4% year-over-year last quarter, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B, BRK.A)Dividend Yield: N/A  Year-to-date gain: -2%If the Warren Buffett mindset is the underlying philosophy in play here, why not go straight to the source and buy a piece of the fund he built from the ground up? That's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.B, NYSE:BRK.A).Source: Shutterstock Sure, in his most recent letter to shareholders, the Oracle of Omaha said he's struggling to find new companies at a &quot;sensible purchase price,&quot; which is the life-blood of the organization's growth. There's also the stark reality that the 87-year-old Buffett is increasingly less involved with Berkshire Hathaway. That separation is only going to widen as time marches on.Still, he has more than proven his way works for the long haul. Over the course of the past half-century, Berkshire stock has performed about twice as well as the S&P 500 has. Waste Management (WM)Dividend Yield: 1.73%  Year-to-date gain: 33%There's an old adage … the only two sure things in life are death and taxes.Source: Shutterstock It's a humorous point about the limited nature of human life and the far-reaching power of the IRS. But, it's not necessarily a complete cliche. There's a third certainty. That is, as long as people are living on the planet earth, they'll be creating garbage to shuttle to their nearby landfill. Some of the best stocks to buy and hold are companies that haul that garbage away.Enter Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), which runs garbage-pickup services for 21 million North American customers. Although its top and bottom lines ebb and flow, the bigger trend for both is pointed upward.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On Look for more of the same too. As CEO Jim Fish pointed out last year, &quot;The babyboomers are coming into a period of heavy medical spend. All of our parents are aging and spending more on medical spend. There is medical waste generated from that, we are in that business. The industrial economy is important to us.Whether it's through repatriation from the new tax law, or just through the fact the U.S. and Canada are great places to do business and the industrial economy is showing some signs of life, we are a big industrial player on the back-end of the cycle.&quot; American Water Works (AWK)Dividend Yield: 1.61%  Year-to-date gain: 37.4%Perhaps just as certain as death, taxes and the creation of trash, as long as people are alive they're going to need water to survive. That puts a water utility name like American Water Works Company Inc (NYSE:AWK) in the catbird seat. Reliability and demand make water utilities safe stocks to buy when others seem sketchy.Source: Shutterstock Much like electricity providers Southern Company, American Water Works Company -- which offers water and sewer services to 15 million people in the United States -- is rarely told no when it wants to raise rates.Water service prices have risen at above-inflation rates for the past several years, and American Water Works Company has benefited from that industry-wide trend. It's not apt to change anytime soon. Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Dividend Yield: 2.40%  Year-to-date gain: 21%Last but not least, while the purchase of things like cars are cyclical, and the automobile industry itself is subject to constant reinvention, there are some consumer goods people just buy over and over again without a second thought. When it comes to the best stocks to buy and hold, you just can't forget consumer staples.Source: Shutterstock Among those often-repurchased items are Colgate toothpaste, Palmolive dish soap, Speed Stick deodorant and Cuddly fabric conditioner.Yep, they're all made by Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), though they're only a small sampling of the brands you'll find under the company's umbrella.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On Those who know the Colgate-Palmolive story well will know the company has gotten into some sloppy spending habits, crimping margins more than most shareholders would like. That's starting to change, however, with a serious and rather impressive cost-cutting initiative. The benefits of that work could last years, if not decades.As of this writing, James Brumley hold a long position in AT&T. You can follow him on Twitter, at @jbrumley.

2019-08-16	2019-08-16 09:01:20	MMM	3M Company	Geopolitics Push a Confusing Dow Inc Stock from Bad to Worse	Theoretically, an industrial giant like Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) should perform better than your typical growth company. As a supporting piece of evidence, DOW stock features a generous dividend yield of 6.4%. That's getting into speculative high-yield territory, yet the company has a rich heritage extending back to the early 20th century.Source: Shutterstock And right now, investors are placing a premium on defensive names. Many folks are avoiding your typical &quot;risk-on&quot; opportunities like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Instead, they're moving into safe-haven assets, such as precious metals. In this environment, a dividend-bearing company levered toward secular industries should appeal to the markets. Yet Dow stock hasn't benefited from this dynamic in the slightest.In fact, shares closed lower on a percentage basis during the midweek massacre than either AMD or NVDA, and that's a confusing proposition if you think about it. One of the factors that sparked the selloff was the yield curve inversion, as the payout for 10-year Treasuries slipped underneath the yield for 2-year Treasuries. Stated differently, investors are getting less reward for more time risk on the benchmark 10-year bonds.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut such a circumstance absolutely favors an investment like DOW stock. Why? It has everything to do with implications.The &quot;2-10&quot; yield-curve inversion doesn't make economic sense. To correct this, the Federal Reserve essentially has no choice but to pull levers to reduce the 2-year yield. But that creates demand for high-yielding assets like Dow Inc stock, especially in this period of geopolitical uncertainties.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul So, that being the case, why hasn't DOW stock acted rationally? Confusing DOW Stock has no Standout ProductsWhen I wrote about Dow stock a few months back, I noted that while the shares will always attract eyeballs for their yield, one factors bother me: the underlying company is too complicated:&quot;Despite the much-covered DowDuPont breakup, Dow Inc stock doesn't provide a clean, linear path. Instead, the underlying company is stretched wide, featuring businesses in consumer products, packaging, industrial materials, large-scale infrastructures and technology.From a topical perspective, the separation into three entities streamlined operations for the individual cogs. Somewhat left out in the equation was that the individual cogs also have non-intuitive structures.&quot;Having broad coverage across multiple industries doesn't guarantee solid performances. In fact, it doesn't even guarantee mitigation of volatility. Just look at the longer-term charts for General Electric (NYSE:GE) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) for proof.Aside from the confusing structures, DOW stock also lacks a driving catalyst. I visited their website and browsed through their products across consumer, industrial, and packaging categories. Here's the takeaway: DOW makes very useful products. However, none of them really stand out.In a sea of sameness, Dow Inc stock risks death by a thousand cuts.Furthermore, DOW stock is a different proposition than GE or 3M. For instance, GE has a viable aviation business. It's also under new management and a fresh vision. As for 3M, I like that they found an innovative product in their &quot;Flex & Seal Shipping Roll.&quot; This packaging invention could change the supply chain narrative for the ever burgeoning e-commerce industry.Admittedly, both GE and MMM are risky investments. But they both have at least one compelling product to offer. And both performed notably better than Dow Inc stock in Wednesday's carnage. Dow Inc Stock Needs Geopolitical ClarityAnother problem for DOW is the present geopolitical madness. Sure, this affects everybody else, too. However, management was especially worried about the turmoil.For example, in their most recent second quarter of 2019 earnings report, DOW reported a 3% decline in volume. In response management cut guidance for full-year capital expenditures from $2.5 billion to $2 billion.  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now That was in late July. After the company disclosed its financials, DOW stock dropped nearly 4%. In mere weeks, the situation has drastically worsened. That doesn't give me confidence in these shares.Of course, we can't ignore the dividend yield, as my InvestorPlace colleague Will Ashworth pointed out. But after how recent events unfolded, I'm very hesitant.Even during the height of the bull market when people viewed China more as a culinary muse than a harbinger, investors eschewed complicated companies for streamlined, agile ones. With a possible bear market on the horizon, I'm not sure if Dow stock is any more attractive.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-14	2019-08-14 16:47:35	MMM	3M Company	Why the Turnaround Thesis on 3M Stock Is Gaining Credibility	It's been a rough run for 3M (NYSE:MMM) stock over the past two years. During that stretch, slowing global growth trends have coupled with rising geopolitical and trade tensions to create significant revenue and margin headwinds for the global industrial giant.Source: Shutterstock As a result, its revenue growth is flat, its margins have retreated, and its profits, as well as 3M stock price, have dropped.Back in 2018, MMM was a $250 stock. Today, MMM stock trades hands around $160. That is a 35% shellacking over the past 18 months. MMM hasn't dropped that much since the 2008 financial crisis.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn other words, 3M stock is acting like the global economy is sprinting straight into a recession.It's not. Instead, multiple data points suggest that the global economy is actually starting to stabilize and even improve after it suffered a setback in early 2019. One of those data points is 3M's second-quarter results.In Q2,  the company's  revenue growth and margins rose versus Q1, Moreover, its top line and margins look poised to continue to rise for the rest of the year.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul As a result, the present selloff of MMM stock seems overdone. Over the next several quarters, the global economy will pick up steam. As it does so, 3M's revenue and margin trends will continue to improve, causing  MMM stock to bounce back. 3M's Numbers Will Continue to ImproveThe first part of the bull thesis on 3M stock is that this company's underlying trends and fundamentals will improve meaningfully over the next few quarters.There's a big debate right now as to whether the 2019 economic slowdown is just another bump in the road or the final straw that will break the camel's back. I think it's the former.For starters, the Fed and Trump are trying to boost the economy and the stock market. For better or for worse, U.S. President Donald Trump has tied his success to the success of the stock market. Because of that, he doesn't want to enter the 2020 election cycle with stocks in a tailspin or the U.S. economy in trouble. Thus, all his trade-war talk is just chest-puffing; Trump won't do anything that will meaningfully harm the U.S. economy before the 2020 election.At the same time, the Fed has also somewhat married itself to the idea that its job is to prolong the current economic expansion. Thus, the central bank has shown  a willingness to inject stimulus into the economy.This combination of proactive stimulus and a president who is inclined to put the trade war on hold for the foreseeable future indicates  that global economic activity should re-accelerate over the next few quarters.As it does, 3M's growth trajectory - which mirrors global economic growth - should re-accelerate, too. That's already happening.In Q2, its organic revenues dropped just 0.9% year-over-year, better than Q1's 1.1% drop. Further, its underlying core margins improved from Q1 to Q2. For Q3, its organic revenues are expected to be flat to up, while its margins are expected to continue to improve. 3M Stock Will Bounce BackAssuming that 3M's growth trajectory does meaningfully improve in the back half of 2019, then 3M stock is attractively positioned for a gigantic rally heading into the end of the year.Here are the numbers. MMM's organic revenue growth was negative in Q1 and Q2. Management thinks it will be flat to up in Q3, and the full-year guidance implies that the company expects its organic revenue growth to  be solidly positive by Q4.Meanwhile, MMM said on its conference call that its underlying margin trends are improving, and that the rebound will persist into the back half of 2019, implying that its Q4 margins could rise  YoY.So 3M could go from negative revenue growth and margin compression today to positive revenue growth and margin expansion by Q4. That is the sort of turnaround that will force the analysts to raise their estimates.At the same time, such a turnaround would get investors to once again believe in the long-term growth outlook of 3M. As investor sentiment improves, the valuation of MMM stock will normalize, from today's forward price-earnings multiple of 17.5 back to the five-year-average forward P/E multiple of nearly 20.All in all, then, MMM stock has the potential to benefit from both rising estimates and multiple expansion in the back half of 2019. If all that materializes as expected, then MMM stock could have a huge second-half rally. The Bottom Line on MMM StockThe last 20 months have been ugly for MMM stock. But there's reason to believe that the worst is now in the rear-view mirror for 3M, and that, going forward, its fundamental growth trends will meaningfully improve. If they do, then 3M stock is poised for a huge rally over the next few quarters.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long MMM.

2019-08-14	2019-08-14 16:05:20	MMM	3M Company	5 Stocks to Avoid Amid the Ongoing Trade War	Thanks to the trade war, numerous S&P 500  stocks could arguably deserve a place on a &quot;stocks to avoid&quot; list. Over the last few years, much of the growth in the most-established United States equities has come from China. With almost four times the population as the U.S., many saw the country's potential when it began to turn away from communist doctrine.Now, many of these have become stocks to avoid in today's market. With a trade war that has lasted more than 18 months, many equities have sold off due to dimming earnings prospects.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul However, investors should also remember that China has built its emergence in large part on the American consumer. Their need for access to U.S. markets should lead to an eventual trade deal.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut until the U.S. and China sign such an agreement, the following companies should remain stocks to avoid. Stock to Avoid: 3M (MMM)Source: Shutterstock As an applied science and manufacturing powerhouse, 3M's (NYSE:MMM) dependence on China should not surprise anyone. In 2018, 31.3% of the company's revenues came from the Asia-Pacific region, of which China is a dominate influence. It comes as somewhat of a shock that in what many consider the &quot;century of Asia,&quot; revenues from that region have fallen over the last year, helping to make MMM stock one of these five stocks to avoid.Moreover, the firm once known as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company faces issues of its own. It remains a conglomerate in an era when such business groupings make less sense. Also, although it continues to innovate, e-commerce has made it easier for small companies to invent competing products and bring them to market.MMM stock has lost 37% of its value since the trade war began. Despite this loss, investors will likely not rush in at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of almost 16. Nor will they want to buy 3M stock with a predicted long-term growth average of 3.4%. They might react to the dividend yield that has moved near 3.5%. However, with a payout ratio above 56%, even the dividend faces some dangers.While investors should not write this company off, MMM's profit growth will struggle to gain traction without help from Chinese consumers and businesses. General Motors (GM)Source: Shutterstock Arguably, all U.S. car companies could make the stocks to avoid list due to the trade war alone. However, General Motors (NYSE:GM) likely faces the most pain. GM stock has seen little price growth since it resumed trading in 2010. In 2018, GM sold almost 700,000 more vehicles in China than in the U.S.GM has long faced struggles with sales growth in other regions. This includes North America, where it would struggle to earn a profit it not for strong truck and SUV sales. Hence, General Motors' overall sales growth depends on China. Due to tariffs, investors do not seem optimistic that this growth will materialize.On the surface, GM stock looks like a bargain. It trades at around six times forward earnings and its dividend yields almost 4%. Still, with no average profit growth expected over the next five years, investors should see little reason to buy.  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now Even without tariffs, GM and its peers would struggle in China amid intense competition. However, GM's P/E ratio likely prices in these troubles. If it can escape the tariffs, GM stock may finally sustain a move higher. Still, with the specter of these import duties, GM will remain cheap for a reason. Las Vegas Sands (LVS)Source: Shutterstock Despite the company name, the growth of Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) depends on mainland China. Five of the company's nine casinos operate in Macao, a special administrative region of China.Because China has banned gambling outside of Macao, the company's significant presence in this region would seemingly guarantee LVS stock billions in revenue. However, as the Chinese spend less amid the tariffs, they have also gambled less in Macao's casinos.This has devastated LVS stock. Las Vegas Sands peaked at over $81 per share in June 2018. Thanks to reduced revenue related to the tariffs, the stock has fallen by more than 35% to the $52 per share range. Over the last year, it has tested the high-$40's per share range more than once only to bounce back.That said, LVS maintains a forward P/E of about 15.6, and analysts expect meager long-term growth. This does not make Las Vegas Sands cheap. Still, a trade deal, or even the hint of one, could take it off of the stocks to avoid list. As late as July, LVS stock traded in the mid-$60's per share range simply due to the earlier optimism of a trade agreement. Unless such confidence leads to an actual deal, investors should stay away. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Shutterstock By most measures, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock should not find itself on a stocks to avoid list. The world's smartphones depend on its chipsets to operate. The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed an amicus brief asking that Qualcomm be granted reprieve in a ruling that labeled the company a monopoly. These chipsets will help lead the 5G revolution, and even Chinese smartphone users cannot afford for tariffs to block Qualcomm's technology.Moreover, QCOM stock trades at a low valuation given its growth prospects. The forward P/E ratio is close to 16.7 as of the time of this writing. However, this buys average annual growth of an estimated 27.03% per year over the next five years.Still, the company depends on China for about two-thirds of Qualcomm's revenue. Despite its headquarters in San Diego, this makes the company a de facto Chinese equity. If tariffs further hurt QCOM stock, it will struggle to meet analyst growth targets. Even a resolution with the government or a better-than-expected 5G rollout may not save Qualcomm stock in that instance.  * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What Qualcomm will wield tremendous power as 5G rolls out. For this reason alone, I would recommend buying QCOM stock in most cases. However, without a resolution to the trade dispute, stockholders will struggle to benefit from the 5G technological revolution. Starbucks (SBUX)Source: Shutterstock Strangely, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock has become one of the stocks to avoid due to the company's success. SBUX stock has risen by more than 80% over the last year. It also increased following its latest earnings report as comparable-store sales across the world rose by 6%.Still, saturation in both the U.S. and Canada has forced the company to look abroad for growth. Over the last few years, it has made expansion across China a primary growth goal. As of January, the company had established 3,684 stores in China, its second-highest store count behind the U.S.Moreover, Starbucks faces an emerging competitor in Luckin Coffee (NASDAQ:LK). Luckin has existed for less than two years. However, the Beijing-based coffee house opens a new store every 15 hours on average. Such a threat would constitute a challenge to Starbucks under the best of circumstances. However, a brutal tariff war could further undermine the Seattle-based coffee chain.China has helped keep earnings increases for Starbucks in the double digits. However, one has to question if investors will continue to pay more than 30 times forward earnings should the trade war end the growth of Starbucks China. This uncertainty, coupled with the multiple, should make SBUX one of the stocks to avoid.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-08-12	2019-08-12 11:40:24	MMM	3M Company	3M Stock Isn’t Crumbling, but It’s No Bargain Either	The decline in 3M (NYSE:MMM) continues. Despite an earnings beat, the quarterly report initiated another selloff in 3M stock.Source: Shutterstock Thankfully for longs, it did not happen in the dramatic fashion that affected the company in the first quarter.Nonetheless, it indicates MMM stock has not stopped falling. With stagnant growth forecasted and an ongoing trade war with no end in sight, I do not think investors should buy 3M at this time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What  3M Wins and Still DisappointsIn a previous article, I proposed that 3M stock would not recover until the trade war ended. Since Asia makes up more than 30% of company revenues, I still do not see how the company prospers with uncertainty clouding such a large percentage of its revenue.So far, this theory held up through second-quarter earnings. Even beating on both revenue and profits could not rescue the stock. Consequently, it has stagnated in the low-$160s per share level, near a point where it turned around in early June.I agree with my colleague James Brumley who stated that conglomerates in today's business world make much less sense. However, unlike Brumley, I do not think the time has come to start comparing 3M to General Electric (NYSE:GE). I need to see more bad news before I will start believing that it will fall that far.While I disagree with InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto overall on 3M, I find myself almost as impressed with the packaging material called the &quot;Flex and Seal Shipping Roll.&quot; It might even become their most popular creation in decades. MMM Isn't CheapUnfortunately for traders, cool products do not necessarily beget hot stocks. Even with the stock trading at bargain prices compared to this winter, I do not see the 2019 drop in MMM as enough.The forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 17.2 stands well below S&P 500 averages. However, with profit growth expected to average 3.43% per year over the next five years, I would not call that multiple &quot;cheap.&quot;Moreover, the current dividend yield of about 3.5% significantly exceeds the S&P 500 average yield of 1.91%. The six decades of annual payout hikes build further confidence in both the dividend and the company itself.Still, that payout now costs the company 67.55% of its net income, up from just 37% in 2011. While I do not think the company would end dividend hikes unless it was unavoidable, the payout has become a tremendous burden.However, as I implied earlier, any doomsday prediction is premature at this stage. Perhaps the company will spin off divisions to improve their focus. Maybe their packaging material or other product will bring investors back to 3M.Still, investors looking for a beleaguered stock in an established company with a decades-long history of dividend increases have more choices than 3M stock.Companies such as AT&T (NYSE:T) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) offer forward multiples in the single digits and payouts which rise every year and offer a yield exceeding 5%. Moreover, the path to recovery for both equities appears more evident than that of MMM stock. The Bottom Line on 3M Stock3M faces too much uncertainty to buy at current levels. One might think an earnings beat would send MMM stock higher, particularly after the massive selloff that followed its first-quarter report.However, with its business in China facing uncertainty and its profit growth modest, investors have shown little inclination to pay 17.2 times forward earnings.Moreover, a dividend payout ratio approaching 70% should create concerns about its six-decade streak of payout hikes.3M is no GE. Company management still has time to turn this ship around. However, investors can find cheaper stocks which pay higher dividend yields and have a clearer path to recovery.As of this writing, Will Healy is long ABBV stock.

2019-08-08	2019-08-08 17:08:54	MMM	3M Company	Expect to Wait for General Electric Stock to Turn Around	General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock is reeling after an earnings disappointment. Shares in the conglomerate have fallen more than 10% since announcing earnings July 31. The GE stock price opened at $10.76 on July 31, and has since slid to a close of $9.57 on August 6.Source: Shutterstock With quarterly sales down 1%, and total orders down 4%, the turnaround led by CEO Lawrence Culp remains a work in progress. Since 2018, investors have tried to call a bottom in GE stock. Some said the bottom would be $10 a share, only to see the stock fall as low as $6.51 a share in December. While shares have appreciated since the start of 2019, this recent earnings disappointment calls into the question the rebound of General Electric stock.  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates So what is the verdict on GE stock? Is the company's turnaround plan still in motion, or will the company experience additional headwinds? Let's take a closer look, and see whether investors can expect upside in the GE stock price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A Closer Look at General Electric StockAs mentioned above, GE's second quarter 2019 earnings failed to meet expectations. The year-over-year revenue declines were largely attributable to issues in the Power segment. The unit saw sales drop 25% from the prior year's quarter. Segment profits were down 71%. But GE's other units had performance issues of their own. The company's Renewable Energy segment saw significant revenue growth (26% year-over-year), but posted a segment loss of $184 million. Aviation saw sales bump up 5%, but segment profits were down 6% from the prior year's quarter.Healthcare was the only segment that saw an improvement in operating earnings, with quarterly segment profit up 3% from the second quarter of 2018. The Oil & Gas unit saw a 7% revenue increase, but a 2% decline in segment profit. GE Capital, the company's most complex and troubled segment, was able to trim losses from continued operations. Combined with gains from discontinued operations, GE Capital earned $148 million in the second quarter.But despite this tepid performance, the company has improved their outlook for 2019. In March, the company projected revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digits for the year. Now, the company believes sales will grow in the mid-single digits. The adjusted EPS (earnings-per-share) forecast has improved from a range of 50 cents to 60 cents, up to a range of 55 cents to 65 cents. GE even reduced their projected restructuring costs from $2.4-$2.7 billion, down to $1.7-$2 billion.In the short-term, GE stock faces headwinds. Long-term, the Culp-led turnaround is still in play. Does this make General Electric stock a buy today? Let's take a look at valuation and see if investors should buy at the current GE stock price. GE Stock Valuation: In Line With PeersGeneral Electric stock currently trades at a forward Price-to-Earnings (Forward P/E) ratio of 21.7. The company's trailing twelve month Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio is 13.5. Here are the valuations of GE's peers in the industrial conglomerate space:Danaher (NYSE:DHR): Forward P/E of 24.7, EV/EBITDA of 21.9Honeywell (NYSE:HON): Forward P/E of 18.8, EV/EBITDA of 14.3Textron (NYSE:TXT): Forward P/E of 12, EV/EBITDA of 93M (NYSE:MMM): Forward P/E of 16.2, EV/EBITDA of 14United Technologies (NYSE:UTX): Forward P/E of 15, EV/EBITDA of 12The valuation of GE stock is in line with peers. GE's EV/EBITDA number may be skewed by the GE Capital unit, which utilizes a great deal of leverage. Nevertheless, investors are not paying a premium for General Electric stock. On the other hand, they are not getting a tremendous bargain. But with the company in the midst of a turnaround, operating earnings could materially improve, helping to boost the GE stock price.But with recent stumbles, can Lawrence Culp successfully pull off a turnaround? As the former CEO of Danaher, investors have high expectations for his skills as an operator. Danaher saw significant long-term stock appreciation thanks to its ability to generate high operating margins from mature industrial businesses. Can Culp do the same for GE? Bottom Line: GE Stock Has PotentialGeneral Electric stock has potential. But many stocks have &quot;potential.&quot; The question is whether the company can pull off a turnaround, remaking itself as a high-margin industrial conglomerate. If Culp can do for GE what he did at Danaher, the company could see not only improvements in earnings, but an enhanced stock valuation. This means significant upside in the GE stock price.For investors entering the stock today, do not expect things to turn around by next quarter. In fact, I would not be surprised if GE stock took another tumble. But for long-term investors looking to make a contrarian bet, GE is a strong opportunity.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-07	2019-08-07 17:55:16	MMM	3M Company	3M Stock Only Looks Cheap at Current Levels	The case for 3M (NYSE:MMM) is that an iconic American company has gone on sale. The MMM stock price dropped 27% in less than six weeks following first quarter earnings in April. 3M stock did manage a brief rally, but amid market-wide trade tensions the declines have resumed -- and the sale has returned. MMM sits less than 3% above a three-year low reached in late May.Source: Shutterstock At this lower price, 3M stock looks somewhat cheap at just 17.4x 2019 analyst EPS estimates. Its dividend yields a healthy 3.5%. Given its 100-year-plus history, bulls argue, these problems, too, shall pass -- and the MMM stock price eventually will rally.Perhaps. But as I pointed out in arguing against 3M stock before Q2 earnings, similar cases have applied to a number of disastrous investments in recent years. Investors could have said the same thing about General Electric (NYSE:GE), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), or Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 3 Steps Every Investor Should Take Before the Next Stock Market Crash The world is changing. Companies that don't keep up get in trouble. 3M may be able to get out of this tailspin -- but this isn't a selloff that has come from a simple overreaction. 3M has real problems. At the least, they may get worse before it gets better. Why Did the MMM Stock Price Run So Far?In retrospect, at least part of the problem for 3M stock appears to be that it simply ran too far. Before the disastrous Q1 release, MMM was trading at over 20x the midpoint of what was then its 2019 EPS guidance. That was simply too high -- for two reasons.First, 3M's growth already was decelerating. Organic constant-currency revenue increased just 3% in 2018. Adjusted EPS seemed to grow nicely, at 14% year-over-year. But about nine points of that growth came from a lower tax rate driven by U.S. tax reform. Adjusted operating income rose just 5.4%.Those might be figures that suggest a low-20s P/E multiple, particularly in this market. Indeed, I argued that 3M stock looked attractive last June, albeit at a price below $200. But there was a second issue which colored even that growth: 3M is a cyclical company.Given a strong macro environment in the U.S. -- which drove about 40% of revenue last year, per figures from the 10-K -- 3M should have been growing. And while MMM stock was rising, cyclicals across the board were falling in the second half of last year and (mostly) into 2019. Whether construction-related stocks or other machinery makers like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and John Deere (NYSE:DE), investors were discounting most other companies that had cyclical exposure. For whatever reason, 3M was excluded.The problem for 3M stock now is that it's only 'cheap' relative to the MMM stock price in April. But that price simply looks like it was too high, even ignoring the results since. In a market where the likes of CAT and DE are trading at 11-13x forward earnings -- and many cyclicals have single-digit multiples -- 20x+ seems far too much to pay. 3M Stock Going ForwardIf that's the case, then there's an obvious issue with 3M stock in the near to mid term. If 20x EPS is too expensive -- and that seems like the case -- then 17x+ isn't exactly cheap. Put another way, 3M stock might have fallen quite a bit, but part of the reason it fell is because it went too high in the first place.3M potentially could grow earnings next year, admittedly. Consensus next year is for EPS of $10.22, which suggests 7.6% from the midpoint of updated 2019 EPS guidance.But I'm not quite ready to start baking in growth just yet. That guidance was slashed after Q1 to $9.25-$9.75 on an adjusted basis. That's suggests a steep decline from 2018 levels (about 7-11%). Even worse, the high end of the range is actually below 2017 profit levels, normalized for the company's tax rate.3M isn't growing right now. And while the Street believes that could change in 2020, analysts also didn't see the Q1 guidance cut coming. And some caution is warranted, as there are obvious near-term risks to growth.After Q2, 3M again talked up weakness in China and in automotive end markets. Neither headwind seems likely to fade any time soon. 2018 revenue growth was driven by the company's Industrial and Safety and Graphics segments -- likely the two most cyclical businesses 3M has. Are we sure 3M is simply bouncing back next year, even with easier year-over-year comparisons?We shouldn't be. Because, again, this is a story that has played out before. No one expected GE stock to hit the single digits. Few expected a dividend cut from the likes of General Electric, Kraft Heinz and Anheuser-Busch.To be sure, 3M's situation isn't as dire as those became. But those stories prove how dangerous it can be to ignore real risks because the company has &quot;been around a long time&quot;. New Lows on the Way?From here, it wouldn't be at all surprising if 3M stock headed below $160 -- and potentially well below that figure. From a multi-year standpoint, this looks like a business that has stalled out. Looking forward, there are real risks in key end markets and in a suddenly nervous market. Execution has been spotty, between the guidance cut and an internal bribery investigation. Valuation is acceptable, but hardly compelling.The dividend yield might help the cause for some investors. But it's still 10%+ downside to even a 4% yield, which wouldn't be completely out of line. 3M has been aggressive in growing its payout, which has more than doubled since 2013. It's going to have to pull back on those increases. The payout ratio on an earnings basis is headed to 60%, and the company already has paused share repurchases after its purchase of Acelity.  * 10 Stocks to Buy on the Trade War Dip Indeed, if 3M hadn't run to $220 in April, it simply wouldn't look all that cheap or necessarily all that attractive right now. And it's probably not going to look either cheap or attractive until performance improves or the MMM stock price drops quite a bit further.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-08-05	2019-08-05 09:16:18	MMM	3M Company	3M Stock Can ‘Flex and Seal’ Its Way to a Recovery	Of the current Dow 30 companies, 3M (NYSE:MMM) has got to be one of the most disappointing. Although MMM stock isn't the worst performer on a year-to-date basis -- that dubious honor goes to Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) -- the Post-It Notes-maker has nonetheless frustrated stock investors to no end. The company's recent second quarter 2019 earnings report provides yet another example why.Source: Shutterstock On paper, the the company posted better-than-expected numbers. Against a per-share profitability target of $2.04, 3M delivered earnings per share of $2.20. On the revenue front, the company rang up $8.2 billion in sales. That haul was notably ahead of the consensus forecast, which called for $8.02 billion.And yet, the MMM stock price took a tumble on the report. Although the market-value drop wasn't as severe as when the industrial firm disclosed Q1 results, it was still conspicuously bad. Even more problematic, 3M stock really didn't benefit from a sympathy rally.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo why did shares decline after a strong print? As InvestorPlace contributor James Brumley noted prior to Q2, analysts had lowered their expectations, especially after the Q1 disaster. Therefore, most folks expected a beat from 3M.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels Plus, key metrics were down against the year-ago quarter results. For instance, EPS was down 28.3%, while top-line sales slipped 2.6%. Under that context, perhaps shareholders should be grateful the fallout in the MMM stock price wasn't more pronounced.And Brumley brought up a great point: consumer loyalty doesn't really exist anymore today. With e-commerce, people can buy whatever products they want, often at a great price.Product-wise, there's no compelling reason to buy 3M stock, until now. New Packaging Product a Game-changer for 3M StockIn the age of digitalization, the biggest risk for the viability of the MMM stock price is irrelevancy. Simply put, with everything seemingly moving to the cloud, a company that focuses on physical products seems anachronistic.Ironically, though, digitization has actually pushed greater demand toward the physical realm. Specifically, I'm referring to packaging materials. Even if retail moves completely online, retailers must still ship their products to their customers.This fact is why I'm so excited about 3M stock, a phrase I thought I'd never utter. The Minnesota-based company will release a new type of packaging material which requires no tape or protective fillers. Called the &quot;Flex & Seal Shipping Roll,&quot; this innovation has the potential to upturn all retail in a good way.Essentially, Flex & Seal is a form-fitting mechanism. Put your desired product on the roll, cut out the required space, fold the &quot;empty&quot; side of the roll atop the product, and you're good to go.The conglomerate provides a video demonstration of Flex & Seal, which I recommend you watch. When you do, you'll quickly see why the bulls can finally justify optimism toward MMM stock.For one thing, Flex & Seal is perfect for the on-demand economy. More importantly, 3M can market this product to everyone, from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Target (NYSE:TGT) to small retail businesses. Not only can customers save a boatload of money using 3M's innovation, the company may have also built a moat. That's because individual retailers won't benefit from economies of scale if they build their own solutions in-house and for their internal use.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 It also answers a key criticism that bears have brought up: 3M finally brought to the table a must-have product. MMM Stock Back on TrackOne other point about Flex & Seal I'd like to emphasize is its universal appeal. Sometimes, I find myself searching for the perfect-sized cardboard box to mail things. Often, I have to compromise, filling dead space with gobs of protective material.With Flex & Seal, the package conforms to the product, not the other way around. This is such a profound, groundbreaking innovation. Yet is it enough to justify a risk in 3M stock?Of course, I understand investor hesitation. Since January 2018, 3M stock has traded inside an ugly bearish trend channel. The risk here is that you're about to hold the bag.That said, I think investors can find some technical encouragement to go along with the fundamental optimism. After a contextually ho-hum earnings report, the MMM stock price has held up reasonably well. Now, investors just need a good reason to push things forward. I genuinely believe Flex & Seal is the catalyst stakeholders have been searching for.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-01	2019-08-01 12:33:00	MMM	3M Company	3M says federal court has dismissed more than 5,000 lawsuits relating tor surgical warming system	3M Co.  said Thursday a federal court has dismissed more than 5,000 lawsuits against the company over its Bair Hugger system, which is used to warm patients before during and after surgery. The ruling comes after a six-year battle with plaintiffs who argued that the warming system caused infections in joints. The lawsuits were consolidated into a multidistrict litigation in federal court in Minnesota. The ruling does not apply to two similar cases filed in state courts in Missouri and Texas, 3M said. The company said the infection theory was invented by a competitor, Augustine Temperature Management and its founder Scott Augustine, who has sought to malign the Bair Hugger system in order to market his own product. The company argued in court to dismiss the plaintiffs' causation experts, leaving them with no scientific evidence to prove their claims. 3M shares were slightly lower premarket and have fallen 8.3% in 2019, while the S&P 500  has gained 19%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/facd0771-22fc-33aa-98dd-392d309a408d/3m-says-federal-court-has.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-25	2019-07-25 20:14:51	MMM	3M Company	Dow Jones Today: That Was Not Pleasant	Amid a batch of earnings reports that were not to investors' liking, and expectations that the second-quarter GDP number due out tomorrow will signal rapidly slowing growth in the world's largest economy, stocks stumbled on Thursday.Rumors that the European Central Bank (ECB) could unveil substantial monetary stimulus to support sagging Eurozone economies were not enough to support global stocks, either.&quot;Much of the problem boils down to lackluster expectations about forward growth (the European Central Bank itself recently lowered its 2019 growth expectations in the EU by almost 40%, from 1.7% to 1.1%),&quot; said BlackRock in a recent note.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere in the U.S., the Nasdaq Composite backed off recent record highs, slipping 1% while the S&P 500 did the same, falling 0.52%. It was a rough day for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 0.46%. We'll get into that in a moment. Lots of Dow Jones OffendersUnfortunately, Thursday was one of those days where there was no shortage of Dow losers to pick from. In late trading, 18, or more than half of the Dow's 30 components, were in the red.Boeing (NYSE:BA), the Dow's largest member and a regular guest in this space, slid 3.64% after the stock lost 3.15% yesterday. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said today there is no set time frame for Boeing's 737 Max passenger jet to return to service, rankling a slew of airline stocks and sending those names lower in the process.As just one example, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said it will keep the 737 Max out of service until at least early next year out of an abundance of caution.Chemicals maker Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW), another name that has recently spent time in the spotlight, though for positive reasons, sank 3.83% today and was the second-worst Dow performer after Boeing. Dow sank Thursday for a reason that was expected and has been playing a role in a lot of second-quarter earnings calls: weakness in China.Dow beat second-quarter earnings estimates, but the company said it is paring spending for the rest of the year due to the U.S.-China trade spat and amid a glut of supply in the plastics market.A real disappointment in the Dow today was industrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM), which rallied earlier in the session following decent second-quarter numbers, but failed to hold those gains and closed lower by 0.70%. Already one of the Dow's laggards this year, 3M trade as high as $187.12 today only to close at $178.17.3M reported a second-quarter profit of $2.20 a share on revenue of $8.17 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of per share earnings of $2.05 on sales of $8.05 billion. The company trimmed its 2019 EPS guidance $8.25 to $8.75 from $8.53 to $9.03, but still expects to earn $9.25 to $9.75 on an adjusted basis. Dow Bottom LineObviously, Thursday's action was glum, but plenty of tests await investors tomorrow. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Dow component Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), among others, report after the close today.If any of those stocks and the aforementioned GDP report disappoint, it is reasonable to expect that stocks could trade lower again tomorrow. The upside of a slack economic data point that carries some weight, which GDP certainly does, is that it could give the Federal Reserve the push it needs to lower interest rates at its meeting next week.There may near-term advantages to establishing defensive positions, but investors should note that many of the sectors that are viewed as defensive and low volatility destinations are currently richly valued.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-25	2019-07-25 13:30:24	MMM	3M Company	Did 3M Buck the Trend or Is It Just in Denial?	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- 3M Co.’s decision to maintain its sales guidance for the year leaves the company dependent on a second-half turnaround that seems unlikely to materialize.The maker of Post-it notes and industrial adhesives reported second-quarter earnings per share on Thursday that were significantly better than analysts had expected as the company’s cost-cutting plan took hold. But sales declined 0.9% in the period after backing out the effects of M&A and currency swings. That’s in line with CEO Michael Roman’s comments in May that the second quarter was trending toward a decline similar to the 1.1% drop that 3M saw in the first quarter. That performance leaves the company with a 1% organic sales decline for the first six months of the year. And yet the company is still holding out hope that it can get to a 2% gain for 2019. That seems a bridge too far.   Yes, the year-over-year comparisons get easier in the third and fourth quarters. But to push organic sales growth into positive territory, 3M likely needs to see a stabilization in China and automotive markets and avoid fresh trouble spots, RBC analyst Deane Dray wrote in report before the release. Other companies are much less sanguine about the prospects of such a recovery. Rockwell Automation Inc. also released its results on Thursday and noted weakness in markets with shorter sales cycles, including automotive, semiconductors and food and beverage. Rockwell is cutting its organic sales and earnings guidance for the full year because “uncertainty with respect to global trade is impacting some customers’ investment decisions.” Ford Motor Co., which released its results late Wednesday, did shrink its operating loss in China to $155 million in the second quarter, versus a loss of $483 million in the year-earlier period. The company said it was encouraged by that, but the Chinese economy and the vehicle market in particular are under “recent and persistent stress.” Ford’s second-quarter earnings and an updated full-year outlook both fell short of analysts’ estimates. Caterpillar Inc.’s results released on Wednesday also showed a significant slowdown in Asia amid competitive pricing pressure in China.Taken together, it’s more evidence that a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut alone may not be enough to spur investment in manufacturing activity or counteract negative trends overseas and damaging trade policy. Industrial companies have thus far borne the brunt of fallout from the U.S.-China trade war, both through the cost of tariffs and the demand slump wrought by the associated uncertainty. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  are set to travel to China on Monday for the first high-level, face-to-face negotiations since President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to a tentative cease-fire at the June G-20 conference. But there remain significant differences of opinion and there’s little sign the protracted conflict will be resolved in a tidy fashion any time soon.On the bright side, 3M’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings will go a good ways toward rebuilding the company’s reputation as a top notch operator that can defend its margins even in downturn. And CEO Roman avoids the credibility hit of yet another guidance cut (before this, the company had lowered its sales or earnings outlook five times in just one year). But the risk is that 3M has only kicked the can down the road.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-07-22	2019-07-22 10:48:51	MMM	3M Company	Why 3M Stock Is Untouchable	There's no denying 3M (NYSE:MMM) stock is, despite all of its woes, still a dividend champ. With February's increased payout now on the books, the annual payout of 3M stock has climbed for 61 consecutive years. And, with a dividend of $5.76 per share of 3M stock scheduled for 2019, there's tons of wiggle room for 3M, since analysts, on average, are calling for full-year earnings of $9.40 per share.Source: Shutterstock But even with 3M stock price beaten down to near $173 and MMM stock yielding 3.26%, the shares aren't appealing. This company's got problems, and its China headwind may be the least of them.  * 8 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than Amazon The foremost challenge facing 3M stock may be its ultra-diversified business model itself, followed closely by waning loyalty towards its brand.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A Symptom of a Bigger IllnessThis coming Thursday, 3M will reveal its second-quarter results. For better or worse, the bar for its Q2 results is set low. After 3M lowered its full-year profit outlook when it released its weaker-than expected Q1 results,  analysts, on average, are only calling for Q2 income of $2.06 per share of 3M stock. The company reported EPS of $2.59 in the same quarter a year earlier.China received the lion's share of the blame for the Q1 EPS miss. Though 3M's year-over-year sales fell by higher percentages in Europe, Middle East and Africa, China is a much bigger market than they are. The Q1 revenue of 3M's Asia-Pacific unit fell 7.4% YoY.That decline, however, wasn't offset by its North American revenue., as its U.S. sales inched up a paltry 0.1%. Perhaps worse, its total organic sales volume fell somewhat dramatically.That's an indirect sign that 3M may not command the same kind of pricing power it enjoyed just a few years ago.That certainly jives with data indicating that consumers and corporations aren't as loyal to particular brands as they used to be. They don't have to be. The advent of the internet has given rise to transparency. With equivalent alternatives now readily available at lower prices, buyers of all ilks are choosing options besides 3M.More than that, though, 3M is arguably ill-equipped to restore the kind of brand loyalty that can meaningfully improve its pricing power and sales volume. Conglomerates Are BrokenThere was a time when conglomerates worked. Dissimilar organizations under the same umbrella could at least share shipping costs, while similar products could be cross-promoted. Think Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) selling detergent to the same customers who usually buy its paper towels.Once again though, the advent of the internet has largely negated that edge. Anyone can start a business and reach P&G's customers all over the world. Indeed, smaller outfits like Dollar Shave Club have capitalized on doing one thing incredibly well: utilizing clever marketing to chip away at dominant names in the business like Gillette and Schick.Noteworthy is the fact that Dollar Shave, along with similarly small startups like Harry, have been acquired by big conglomerates. Equally noteworthy is the fact that the conglomerates that acquired them have largely left them alone.That, in turn, has lead some owners of 3M stock to wonder if the company's office-supply arm would be better served by operating on its own.As for 3M's more industrial-oriented product lines, rival brands haven't been the problem as much as size and saturation. A lack of focus, however, could still be a key liability for 3M.That's certainly been the case for General Electric (NYSE:GE).For decades it successfully managed to operate businesses ranging from light bulbs to locomotives to life sciences. It could do so because the world moved slowly, and competition wasn't everywhere. With China now fully industrialized, digitalized and capitalized, though, speed matters. Saturated markets matter. The large amount of manpower needed to manage such complex enterprise now gets in the way. There's a reason GE is now selling assets. The Bottom Line on 3M StockNone of this  means that 3M can't move past its hurdles, restore pricing power and optimize its conglomerate in a way few other companies are even willing to try anymore. Anything's possible.Even before it's fully addressed its more philosophical challenges, though, it's making itself even more complicated. 3M announced in early May that it would be acquiring wound-care company Acelity for a hefty $6.7 billion as a means of ramping up the growth of its healthcare business, whose 2018 results were disappointing. But if the company can't sell what it already makes, what assurance can it offer investors that it can sell Acelity's products any more effectively?There may be a legitimate answer to the question, but if there is, it wasn't passed along to the owners of MMM stock.Meanwhile, investors may be cheering for a turnaround, but there are reasons 3M stock price continues to make lower lows. There's a lot of work, longer-term initiatives, and tough decisions that 3M needs to make at this point, but it doesn't appear the company is ready for that just yet.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-19	2019-07-19 19:00:02	MMM	3M Company	CSX Leads Industrial Earnings Off the Rails	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- To get Brooke Sutherland’s newsletter delivered directly to your inbox, sign up here.It’s going to be unbearably hot across much of the U.S. this weekend, but the early returns on industrial earnings have been decidedly cool. A nearly 30% run in CSX Corp. shares heading into its second-quarter earnings report suggested this was a company where investors thought they could find shelter amid a growing body of worrisome manufacturing data. They were wrong. The shares slumped more than 10% the day after CSX reversed a forecast for low single-digit growth in revenue this year and predicted instead that revenue would dip as much as 2%. The East Coast railroad says it’s being cautious, but the time for conservatism is when you start the guidance-giving process, so that strikes me as an inadequate explanation for such a deep cut. CEO James Foote said the macroeconomic backdrop was one of the most “puzzling” he’s ever experienced and that there are no concrete signs of improvement in weak coal, intermodal and industrial volumes.Elsewhere in transportation, J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. and West Coast railroad Union Pacific Corp. actually saw their shares pop on earnings, but that seems to be a case of more realistic expectations than a drastically more positive view of the macroeconomic environment. J.B. Hunt was essentially flat going into earnings, for example, and Union Pacific had sold off in sympathy with CSX before it reported. Union Pacific said it expects second-half volume to be down about 2%, which implies a decline for the full year compared with an earlier call for a low-single digit gain – basically mimicking CSX’s move. The other challenge with CSX is that it appears to be far enough along in its conversion to precision-scheduled railroading that there isn’t as much fat left to cut as there is at Union Pacific. But it’s track record of improved performance is still relatively short, capping its ability to make market share gains amid a surplus of capacity and lower spot rates in the trucking market. Bloomberg News’s Cameron Crise points out the sharp divergence in the performance of S&P 500 railroads and FedEx Corp. over the past, calling it a proxy of sorts for the trade war-inspired slowdown that’s hit companies with international exposure like FedEx harder than those focused on the domestic market. If U.S. railroad stocks fail to recover from the CSX-inspired selloff and the gap to FedEx narrows, that could be a sign that the domestic economy and the bull market are running out of steam, he writes. FedEx, of course, has plenty of idiosyncratic issues holding back its stock. The company’s annual report filed this week included interesting disclosures abut the risk of an activist shareholder getting involved and some additional detail on the logistics investments that could render Amazon.com Inc. a competitor. Things were a bit better at the multi-industrial companies, but there was still cause for concern. Textron Inc. said its aviation backlog slipped by $100 million in the second quarter as macroeconomic concerns and President Donald Trump’s threat to impose wide-ranging tariffs on Mexico spooked business-jet customers. That’s counteracted by Honeywell International Inc.’s report of double-digit sales growth for new business jet equipment, but still a troubling sign of just how nervous people are about making big investments. You can usually count on Honeywell to churn out an earnings beat, and the company didn’t disappoint, raising its profit guidance for the full year. But the outlook wasn’t as robust as some analysts were expecting. Organic sales growth of 5% could end up being the pace to beat this quarter, but that was weaker than anticipated and a forecast for 2% to 4% growth in the third quarter would suggest an accelerating slowdown. The dynamic of somewhat disappointing sales numbers but steady earnings growth in some ways reinforces Honeywell’s argument that last year’s breakups and a pristine balance sheet will make it more resilient in a downturn, but I remain unconvinced that margins for anything except funeral homes are recession-proof. It helped Honeywell that the sales weakness was mostly confined to its safety and productivity solutions unit, the smallest of its four main businesses, and aerospace remained impressively robust with 11% organic sales growth. The industrial companies on tap to report earnings next week may not be so lucky, particularly 3M Co., which seems destined for yet another guidance cut to reflect the deepening slowdown.ALL BOEING WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS IS A FLYABLE MAXBoeing Co. this week pre-announced a $4.9 billion after-tax second-quarter charge to reflect its estimate of compensation owed to airlines grappling with a grounding of the beleaguered 737 Max that’s now entering its fifth month. American Airlines Group Inc., Southwest Airlines Co. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. this week pulled the Max from their schedules through the beginning of November – a timeline that jibes with Boeing’s call for the plane to return to service during the fourth quarter. But the risk remains that the grounding stretches into 2020. The Federal Aviation Administration, mindful of restoring its reputation as the global standard-bearer of safety protocol, is keen to coordinate a return to service with European and Asian regulators. And while a fix for the flight-software system linked to the Max’s two fatal crashes has essentially been completed, there remain hurdles to remedying a separate issue with a microprocessor that was identified in June, including convincing the FAA that a software update is sufficient, according to the Wall Street Journal. Even if Boeing can get the plane recertified and flying again by the fourth quarter, it matters a great deal which particular month that happens. Airlines estimate it will take a month to 45 days to complete the maintenance necessary to bring the Max jets they already operate out of storage, which is to say nothing of the additional planes they had been expecting to support busy schedules. I would imagine airlines’ demands for compensation would rise materially if they are forced to scramble and reassess capacity for holiday flights. Ryanair Holdings Plc said this week it’s prudently planning for a December return of the Max, but pared its growth plans for the 2020 summer travel season. It can only accept six to eight new Max planes per month, which will leave the budget airline with about half of the fleet it had been planning on for that peak season. Data points like that make me highly skeptical of Boeing’s aspirations to ramp up to a 57-per-month production pace for the 737 program in 2020.A WORD ON WAREHOUSESThere has been a surge of spending over the past few years on industrial warehouse assets. The latest deal came this week , when Prologis Inc. agreed to buy Industrial Property Trust and its 236 properties in areas such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago and New Jersey for about $4 billion. This follows Prologis’s acquisition of DCT Industrial Trust Inc. last year for more than $8 billion and its pursuit earlier this year of GLP Pte’s U.S. warehouse assets, which ultimately went to Blackstone Group LP instead for $18.7 billion. Meanwhile, Tom Barrack’s Colony Capital Inc. is exploring a sale of its unit that owns warehouses as part of a strategic review meant to resuscitate its plunging market value, according to Bloomberg News. I understand the logic of these deals: Retailers are under immense pressure to build out their e-commerce capabilities and shorten their delivery times and on the face of it, that trend looks less vulnerable to the trade war and macroeconomic uncertainties than many others. Even so, it gives me pause to hear Honeywell say customers for its Intelligrated warehouse-automation business are pushing major system rollouts into the second half of the year. Intelligrated is still growing rapidly, with organic sales growth of more than 20% for the first half of 2019, and Honeywell CEO Darius Adamczyk said he knew for a fact that the delayed orders hadn’t gone away. But going back to my earlier comment about funeral homes, I’m getting less confident that even this trend can withstand the test of a true downturn. I asked Bloomberg Opinion's retail expert Sarah Halzack what she thought. She pointed out that companies like Walmart Inc. and Williams-Sonoma Inc. are too far along in converting their businesses to e-commerce to back out, whereas those who are already struggling such as J.C. Penney Co. will find it harder to justify making those kinds of investments.DEALS, ACTIVISTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCEJohn Flannery has resurfaced. The former CEO of General Electric Co. will now be an advisory director to Charlesbank Capital Partners, a middle-market private equity firm managing more than $5 billion of capital. I’ve always felt a bit bad for Flannery, who spent 30 years working his way up the ladder at GE and finally ascended to the CEO post, only to find out that his actual job was going to be more akin to a garbage man. Sure, he made his share of mistakes as CEO. But the reality is he was probably never going to last in that job no matter what he did. GE needed one CEO to publicize and unearth the skeletons in its closet ($22 billion goodwill writedown on the disastrous Alstom SA deal, $15 billion reserve shortfall in the long-term care insurance business) and another CEO to try to fix the mess. That’s now Larry Culp. Still, it has to sting a bit that Steve Bolze, Flannery’s competitor in the race to succeed Jeff Immelt, is a senior managing director at Blackstone, a slightly more prominent firm than Charlesbank. Bolze is blamed by many investors for mismanaging GE’s power unit and exacerbating the financial pain from a slump in gas turbine demand.Crane Co.’s bid for Circor International Inc. got a last minute surge of support. Mario Gabelli’s Gamco Investors Inc. agreed to tender shares to Crane after the buyer raised its price to $48 a share earlier this month. Roughly 45% of outstanding Circor shares have been elected to be tendered, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. That’s not enough to force a merger (although there are still a few more hours before the tender offer expires at midnight), but it should be enough to get the attention of Circor’s board’s. In the wake of the Crane offer, Circor laid out a bold (and by nature, rather fluffy) plan to boost margins and lower debt. Shareholders are now signaling quite loudly that they don’t have much faith in the company’s ability to follow through. It’s pretty remarkable to see this level of pushback outside of an annual meeting, though. I had worried Crane’s bid might have been the victim of bad timing, with its offer becoming public a few weeks after Circor’s 2019 meeting. The fact that Circor’s board had privately received the Crane offer prior to the meeting and didn’t feel a need to tell investors about it has been one of Gabelli’s chief criticisms. This level of support from Circor shareholders may save Crane from having to wait a year to relaunch its bid with a proxy fight.Osram Licht AG, the lighting maker that’s agreed to sell itself to Bain Capital and Carlyle Group LP, disclosed this week that Austrian industrial manufacturer AMS AG had made a fresh offer for the company at a higher price. Bain and Carlyle are offering 35 euros per share, or 3.4 billion euros ($3.8 billion), while AMS had proposed to pay 38.50 euros per share, or about 3.7 billion euros. The problem is, AMS itself is valued at less than what it offered for Osram; it’s had negative free cash flow for at least the past two years; and it’s already carrying about 1.2 billion euros of net debt. Osram agreed to let AMS perform due diligence, but said the probability of a deal materializing was “rather low.” Literally the same day that its latest offer was disclosed, AMS said it was walking away. In some ways that’s actually kind of surprising – why wouldn’t you take the opportunity to do due diligence? But anyway, this amusing M&A adventure has now come to an end.Callon Petroleum Co. agreed to buy Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at $3.2 billion including debt. Bernstein analyst Bob Brackett called it a “pretty lame deal all-in-all”, while my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Liam Denning said the merger sounds a “distinct sad-trombone note.” Carrizo helps Callon double down on the Delaware Basin with contiguous acreage and lets it add free cash flow on the cheap, but it also dilutes its status as a pure-play operator by adding acreage the Eagle Ford region, where it may be harder to find cost savings. Some investors may have viewed Callon as a target and are disappointed to see it on the other end of a deal. The consolidation of shale players is healthy and necessary, Liam writes. But the fact that Carrizo has chosen to sell at a modest premium when its stock was trading at the lowest levels in a decade is pretty telling, too.CRH Plc agreed to sell its European plumbing and heating-distribution business to Blackstone for 1.64 billion euros ($1.9 billion). CEO Albert Manifold has been trying to steer the company toward higher growth markets including cement and raise money for acquisitions. This deal helps it do both. Davy analyst Robert Gardiner says the purchase price is attractive at about 16 times earnings before interest and taxes.BONUS READING Saturday Will Be Hot.

2019-07-19	2019-07-19 10:30:24	MMM	3M Company	Ahead of Next Week’s Earnings, Should Investors Buy 3M Stock Into Weakness?	3M Company (NYSE:MMM), a coveted member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1976, is an industrial conglomerate. The group got its start in the early 20th century by extracting corundum mineral.Source: Shutterstock These days, however, 3M stock has expanded beyond corundum to the point of recent conundrum. After reaching an all-time high of $259.77 in Jan. 2018, MMM stock price has been in a multi-month decline. Year-to-date, 3M stock price which has missed the broader market rally in 2019, is down about 8%.As MMM stock gets ready to report earnings on July 25, many of our readers are wondering whether July may offer a good entry point into MMM shares, which are currently trading around $175. Here is a candid look at the the prospects for 3M stock so that potential investors may decide if the shares should belong in their long-term portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips How Does 3M Stock Make Money?Although most consumers first think of 3M's ever-popular signature products, e.g., Scotch Tapes and Post-it Pads, the company produces and sells a diverse line of products ranging from adhesive tapes to air filters, filters for computer screens, heatshrink tubing, knee supports, lint rollers, lubricants, safety goggles, and sand paper.To be more precise, its current product range includes over 50,000 items. In other words, most consumers would probably feel somewhat lost while looking through 3M's website. And very few companies would have the capital, time, or technology to build market share in many of the lines of business.The group divides its business into five segments:  * Industrial (such as tapes, adhesives, and supply chain management software);  * Safety and Graphics (such as protective gear and security products);  * Electronics and Energy (such as fibers and circuits);  * Health Care (such as medical and surgical products as well as drug delivery systems); and  * Consumer (such office supplies and home improvement products).However, with this kind of growth and business range, a big headache has also come; 3M Company is simply too large to run efficiently, i.e., bigger is not necessarily better. MMM Stock's First-Quarter Results Were DisappointingOn Apr. 25, 3M released Q1 2019 results with lower-than-expected earnings. CEO Mike Roman summed up the earnings results in one sentence when he said &quot;The first quarter was a disappointing start to the year for 3M.&quot;  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown MMM stock's EPS came at $2.23, adjusted vs. $2.49 expected. Revenue was $7.863 billion, instead of the expected $8.025 billion. Management partly blamed a litigation-related pretax charge of $548 million, or 72 cents per share, for the poor results.The group also cut 2019 guidance and announced plans to lay off 2,000 workers. Wall Street was not impressed and the stock tumbled.Going forward 3M's five business segments will be restructured into four.  Management has been trying to paint a better future picture for MMM stock as the company believes it will increase productivity, reduce costs, and increase cash flow levels.However, Wall Street is not necessarily hopeful about the company's upcoming Q2 results as many analysts do not necessarily expect 3M stock's results to show any signs of real recovery. Is MMM Stock's Dividend Safe?In a low-interest rate environment, stock investors pay special attention to shares with robust dividend yields. Dividend stocks can be one of the best ways to generate a regular passive income for long-term shareholders.In general, big blue-chip names tend to be consistently generous dividend payers. And 3M, which has increased its dividend for decades, has traditionally been regarded as a safe dividend play.Yet with the recent poor results and on-going issues, analysts have also started wondering whether MMM stock's dividend may also be cut.The dividend payout ratio can show investors if a stock is paying out either less or more than the company earns. In other words, if a company earns $1 per share but pays a dividend of $1.30, management may have to decrease the dividend at some point in the near future. A payout ratio of over 100% means that a company is paying out more in dividends than it earns.MMM stock's payout ratio is 0.59 which makes the dividend sustainable as long as the company keeps the earnings around the current levels. However, in case of a miss in earnings, I'd become sceptical of the dividend amount and would even expect a cut.Experienced dividend investors also pay close attention to a company's free cash flow as dividends are ultimately paid out of cash.Free cash flow is what remains in the bank after 3M has paid interest on its debt, paid any taxes owed, and made all of the capital expenditures necessary to run and invest in the giant business. MMM stock's capital structure has been under stress due to legal liabilities and decreasing revenue.Companies do not cut dividends in good times. And 3M Company is clearly going thorugh a difficult  patch in its history. If there were further external events (such as increased trade tensions with China or a slowing down of the U.S. economy) as well as company-specific problems, it is possible that management may take the extraordinary measure of cutting MMM stock's dividend. Where is 3M Stock Price Now?On June 3, MMM stock hit a 52-week low at $159.32. In other words, as it hovers around $175, 3M stock is trading just above its 52-week lows right now. The downtrend since Jan. 2018 as well as Apr. 25, 2019 is a stark reminder that its all-time high of $259.77 is now in the rear-view mirror.If you are an investor who also pays attention to technical analysis, then you may want to know that over the past 18 months, 3M stock has suffered from a damaging technical picture.In addition to its long-term technical chart which still looks weak, MMM stock's short-term technical chart, trend lines and support and resistance levels, are telling investors to exercise caution.Although MMM stock's momentum indicators, which describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period, are currently in oversold territory, they can stay oversold for quite a long time, especially when the overall trend is down.Therefore, buy signals based on momentum indicators need to be conﬁrmed with further chart analysis before the stock is a buy from a technical standpoint.Among 10 Wall Street analysts, there is one strong buy rating, seven hold ratings (which effectively mean sell) and two sell ratings on 3M stock. Recently its price target was cut from $201 to $182. In other words, could MMM share price have already seen the high for 2019?If there is any broader market weakness, say due to market worries over U.S.-China trade wars, 3M stock price may be further adversely affected.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy At this point, the bulls are not yet in control and the selling pressure has increased especially after the Q1 earnings report of April 25. Therefore MMM shares will need a catalyst to make them attractive in the eyes of long-term investors, who are probably still skeptical about the near-term prospects for the company. The Bottom Line on MMM StockI am of the camp that 3M stock's price weakness is a clear reflection of investor sentiment and major fundamental worries, especially regarding a large conglomerate with legal woes and which is going through a major restructuring process amidst falling revenues.If you aren't already long MMM stock, you may want to remain on the sidelines until the earnings report on July 25 to give yourself time to study the balance sheet as well as the outlook by the management. Many questions, such as the effects of the current trade wars, decreasing margins, falling revenues, viability of the dividend as well as the level of free cash flow, remain yet to be answered.If you already own 3M shares, you may also consider initiating covered call positions in conjunction with being long MMM stock. For example, Aug. 16 expiry at-the-money (ATM) covered calls may enable you to hedge your long position in case of profit-taking following the earnings report. You would also be able to participate in a further up move in 3M stock price.If you are considering investing in 3M stock, you may want to start building a position between the $150 and $160, and expect to hold the stock for several years.Investors who are interested in buying into 3M Company shares, but do not want to commit all their capital to a single stock may also consider investing in various exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) that have MMM stock as a holding, including the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA), Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLI), or iShares Core High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:HDV).As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The cut comes about two weeks before 3M is scheduled to report second-quarter results, ahead of the July 25 open. Karas kept his rating at neutral. He said he believes 3M has some &quot;proving out&quot; to do: &quot;After five guide-downs in five quarters, it is our view that investors will be hesitant to put new money to work in 3M until growth stabilizes and earnings again hit targets. The Q2 FactSet earnings-per-share consensus is $2.05, but that is down from a $2.64 consensus at the end of the first quarter.

2019-07-12	2019-07-12 14:27:50	MMM	3M Company	3 Things to Consider Before Becoming a 3M Stock Contrarian	3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stock price has fallen slightly this month, even as the market has rallied, partly due to an analyst's downgrade based on legal troubles. 3M stock has long been a defensive pick because of its positions in the consumer-products industry and respectable dividend yield.Source: Shutterstock However, 3M stock price has underperformed after RBC Capital Markets cut its rating on 3M from &quot;Outperform&quot; to &quot;Sector Perform,&quot; citing worries about the firm's legal issues as the main reason for its decision.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond When a stock like 3M  underperforms on bad news, the contrarians start chomping at the bit. However before you buy 3M stock on weakness, here are three points to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Environmental UnknownsRBC analyst Deane Dray pointed to 3M's ongoing legal issues regarding chemicals called perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, or PFAS, which have been linked to several illnesses.3M has been accused of knowingly contaminating the food and water supply of the U.S. with high levels of PFAS, resulting in a slew of legal trouble with no end in sight. Because of the widespread use of PFAS, 3M could be bogged down by complaints about the chemicals' environmental impact for the foreseeable future. Dray says the cost of 3M's lawsuits can't be calculated at present because their scope is unclear, but other estimates say the firm might have to pay more than $6 billion, or roughly 6% of its overall market capitalization, to clean up the mess. Earnings IssuesEven disregarding the uncertainty that MMM stock's legal troubles bring to the table, the firm still looks risky. Earlier this year, 3M stock price made its way more than 10% lower after its management cut its 2019 guidance. Not only did the guidance reduction shake investors' confidence, but it signaled somewhat of an emerging trend,  as it marked the firm's fourth guidance cut in just over a year. There are a lot of reasons to worry about the building trend, but the biggest concern is the fact that the trend takes away the draw of 3M stock as a defensive play. A lot of investors added 3M to their portfolios because they thought it was a good name to own in case of an economic downturn. However, the more 3M struggles, the less it looks like a good bet if the market turns sour. Growth ConcernsMMM stock's earnings weakness isn't coming out of the blue. Several of the firm's key markets are on the rocks right now, which is hurting the company's sales. 3M stock is particularly exposed to slowing growth in China; nearly a third of the firm's sales come from the Asia-Pacific region. On top of that, 3M is working on a restructuring program that will restructure its business into four separate units. During its first-quarter earnings call, the firm announced its plans to merge its safety and graphics business with its industrial business.  The restructuring  is bound to create some setbacks at 3M over the next few quarters, especially considering that several of the firm's top executives have elected to leave at the same time. Contrarian Play3M stock is facing several headwinds at the moment, making it a risky bet. Chief among investors' concerns now is the company's exposure to litigation regarding PFAS. The bottom line on MMM stock  is that no one knows exactly how far-reaching the consequences will be for 3M as more is discovered about what the company knew when using the chemicals. There's certainly a good contrarian case for buying 3M now, though. If there's one thing we can count on, it's that the public has an extremely short attention span. The list of publicly traded companies that have been in the spotlight for knowingly harming people is extensive, and the majority of those same firms are trading on top of the world right now. So, it's not crazy to think about buying stocks when analysts start their hand-wringing over the latest scandal.Right now, I think worries about the PFAS litigation are overdone. While there has been a lot of chatter about what 3M knew and didn't know regarding the contamination and the negative effects of PFAS, so far, it doesn't appear that the FDA is planning to take any further action. The Bottom Line on MMM StockOf course, 3M stock still carries a lot of risk due to unanswered questions about its PFAS litigation and the slowing growth of its key markets. However, the firm looks capable of coping with these problems, and its respectable 3.48% dividend yield could take the edge of while investors wait for the dust to settle.

2019-07-11	2019-07-11 13:14:40	MMM	3M Company	The 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy Today	[Editor's note: &quot;The 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy Today&quot; was previously published in February 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]It's no secret that industrial stocks move and groove with the overall economy. That was kind of a problem last year. Thanks to the worries about slowing global growth and the trade war with China, many industrial stocks fell by the wayside. The broad sector measure of industrial stocks -- the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLI) -- sank by over 13% last year as investors ran from the economically sensitive sector.But investors may not want to dump industrial stocks just yet.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsProgress continues to be made on the trade front and recent meetings between the U.S. and China have gone in a positive direction. Meanwhile, here at home, economic data seems to be stabilizing after a few months of steady drops. With the Federal Reserve pausing on rate hikes and even considering cutting them, we could still see some more quarters of gains for the sector. No wonder why the sector has rebounded in a big way. XLI has jumped nearly 20% so far this year and is leading the market.The best part is that several industrial stocks are still trading for discounts to the overall market. And with that as well as the potential for thawing on tariffs/trade, the sector could be ripe for the picking.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown But which industrial stocks could make sense in today's market? Here are five of the best industrials to buy today. Corning (GLW)I bet if I asked you what one of the fastest growing sectors were, glass wouldn't even make into the top five. After all, who uses glass anymore? But for industrial stalwart Corning (NYSE:GLW), glass is driving double-digit revenue growth.That growth from glass is coming from two major factors. First off, GLW is still the fiber optics king and makes solutions for telecom networks, data centers, and networking customers. With cloud computing, the upgrade to 5G wireless and increased data usage all converging, Corning has seen demand for its fiber optic cables surge. In the first quarter, optical communications revenues jumped an impressive 20% year-over-year. With our modern lives demanding, even more, data/connectivity, Corning should see more revenue gains for its optics products.The second factor is device adoption itself. Corning's Gorilla Glass has become the standard on many smartphones, wearable devices, augmented reality displays and now automobile dashboards/infotainment units. For GLW, this again has translated into some impressive revenue growth.All of this has helped profits and cash flows at the firm. After building out capacity last year, sales have translated back in earnings-per-share gains, as core EPS  jumped 29% year-over-year . Moreover, GLW has continued to return excess capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends.With growth still at hand, Corning could be one of the best industrial stocks to own in the quarters ahead. Dover (DOV)Like many industrial stocks, Dover (NYSE:DOV) has its hands in many soups. This includes everything from your local service station's gasoline pump to the refrigeration units at your local grocery store. Its wide product catalog across automation equipment, refrigeration and fluid management has allowed the firm to reward shareholders over its history. DOV has managed to pay an increasing dividend for the last 63 years.And it looks like that streak will continue.DOV has moved forward with some restructuring plans to reduce costs and improve margins. Likewise, accreditive buyouts and bolt-on acquisitions have worked in its favor and have reduced the bumpiness in its refrigeration segment. Because of this, Dover managed to see a 29% adjusted earnings increase during the last quarter. Sales grew by  5%. This highlights that the restructuring is working and the steady nature of Dover's product mix. Many of DOV's products tend to be must-haves for other consumer and industrial applications. This makes them a bit immune to changes in the economy.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.80 and a  1.9% yield, Dover could be a great industrial stock to buoy your portfolio. Xylem Inc (XYL)Perhaps one of the most critical commodities out there happens to be water. Moving, cleaning and storing it for our ever-increasing population is becoming a paramount issue. And Xylem Inc (NYSE:XYL) is the industrial stock to make that happen.With its appropriate name, the former spin-off from industrial giant ITT (NYSE:ITT) makes a whole host of equipment like pumps, controllers and filtration devices for wastewater treatment plants across the globe. That's a great position to be in. Growth in water treatment is steady and surging.Here in the U.S., replacing aging water infrastructure has become a top priority. Moreover, XYL has quickly moved in helping utilities with smart-metering, leakage detection and other efficiency applications. That provides plenty of higher margins versus just pumps.Secondly, Xylem's real growth is coming from overseas. Just after its spin-off, Xylem changed its strategy and started looking towards key markets like China, the Middle East and South East Asia. Here, populations are growing and access to clean water is shrinking. Last quarter, XYL managed to score a 12% gain in adjusted net income.The shift to higher margin products and to the emerging world has helped XYL boost its cash flows, reduce its debt and pad shareholder's pockets as well.At a forward P/E of 21.6, XYL isn't super-cheap. But when it comes to industrial stocks, it has an impressive growth profile and it is worth the slight premium. Ingersoll-Rand (IR)Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE:IR) could be leading the pack of industrial stocks … at least when it comes to sector moves. The firm slimmed down in a big way after the recession. And now that many of its peers -- like General Electric (NYSE:GE), Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) -- are splitting apart, IR is building up its portfolio of products.This time, Ingersoll-Rand made its biggest buyout ever. IR agreed to pay $1.45 billion for Precision Flow Systems from a group of private equity investors. Precision Flow makes a bunch of engineered pumps, boosters and other systems for water, chemicals and food and beverage customers. This is an easy bolt-on for IR's current fluids management business and actually would nearly triple the size of its current revenues from the segment.At the same, IR has continued to see more demand from its air conditioning and HVAC unit Trane. Both here and across the world, heating and cooling are often the biggest demanders of electricity/power. With global energy surging, especially in key emerging markets, IR has steadily clipped higher revenues from the unit.All of this has made, IR a growth machine among industrial stocks. The firm saw continuing EPS grow more than 61% during Q1 and more than 24% for all of 2018.   * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown For investors looking for a great growth industrial stock, IR is it. iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (IYJ)Perhaps the best way to play the surge in industrial stocks is to own them all. Here's where exchange-traded funds can come in handy. However, investors may want to bypass the previously mentioned XLI and choose the iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (NYSEARCA:IYJ) instead.For one thing, the IYJ has a much broader portfolio of holdings and includes more mid-cap industrial stocks in its portfolio. These mid-caps have provided plenty of growth as well as being M&A targets for the sector. It has also allowed IYJ to outperform the XLI over the longer haul. Over the last ten years, the iShares fund has managed to produce an average annual return of over 13%. At the same time, you still get plenty of large-cap industrial stocks as well. Top holdings in the ETF include Honeywell, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and 3M (NYSE:MMM).As trade begins to thaw and the economy continues to move along, IYJ should be able to post some impressive returns. In the meantime, investors can clip at 1.3% dividend yield.While IYJ isn't the cheapest ETF in the world -- at 0.43% or $43 per $10,000 invested in expenses -- it's certainly not high-priced. And with a strong performance and breadth of holdings, it could be a great way to play all the industrial stocks out there.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-10	2019-07-10 15:04:01	MMM	3M Company	3 Technically Fragile Dow Stocks to Short	The following are not Dogs of the Dow stocks in 2019, but risky looking price charts hint at looming dogged price action in 3M (NYSE:MMM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And the always real possibility of these companies making that list next year is a strong reason to short MMM, CAT and AAPL stock today.Dow Jones stocks sometimes go up and at other times, they go down. Mostly these days, it happens to be the case the bulk of these blue-chips go up. For its part the bellwether average is up nearly 15% on the year and roughly 1% removed from its recent all-time-highs.At the same time, leading Dow constituents Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), American Express (NYSE:APX) and Visa (NYSE:V) are up roughly 30% to 35% in 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe gains are certainly nice, as are AAPL stock's own outperformance of nearly 27%. Still, what goes up does eventually go down. And CAT stock's relative under-performance of 5% and MMM stock's decline of nearly 13.50% are testaments of this cyclical certainty. And if the price charts allow, sometimes investors are even offered a well-placed short stock opportunity.  * 10 Stocks to Buy on College Students' Radars With that in mind, MMM, CAT and AAPL stock are in this technically perilous situation right now and ready for shorting. And if today's bearish price patterns behave really dogged in 2019's second half, these three shorts might even land on next year's yield-driven Dogs of the Dow list for buying. 3M (MMM)  Click to Enlarge3M is our first bearish Dow Jones stock to short. MMM stock is the worst performer of today's three names. And right now, the chart is offering a good entry point to profit from continued weakness.The weekly chart points to MMM stock following through on the downside out of a bearish flag. The pattern has formed inside a former support area comprised of key Fibonacci levels which failed this past spring and have turned into staunch resistance.The MMM Stock TradeWith shares already confirming the pivot high within the bear flag and stochastics forming a bearish crossover from neutral levels, MMM stock looks like a short today. I'd suggest a stop loss of 8% to contain potential losses and smartly exit if resistance is overcome. Optimistically though, a profitable trend for bears could put shares back toward the 2016 lows near $125. Caterpillar (CAT)  Click to EnlargeCaterpillar is our next Dow Jones stock to short. CAT stock is already showing relative weakness this year. But if a weekly price chart showing lower highs and a couple bullish trend failures since late last year have any say, conditions are going to get worse.Bearish operators also have a nice spot to short this Dow Jones stock with limited risk and potentially outsized rewards. Following June's rally, shares have formed a pivot top within a countertrend rally against resistance.The CAT Stock TradeMy recommended strategy in CAT stock is to wait on a short through last week's topping candle low of $133.22. That price confirmation should also help a stochastics set-up that's currently on the cusp of turning lower and signaling a bearish crossover.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half For this Dow Jones stock short I'd suggest a 9% stop and size the position accordingly. Similar to MMM stock, this exit limits losses and closes the position if pattern resistance fails. On the downside, I'd look to take partial and much larger profits on a test of last year's corrective low near $110. Apple (AAPL)Apple is our third and final Dow Jones stock to short. AAPL stock's gains this year are nothing to sneeze at, but a second lower high pivot on the weekly view doesn't look good. And with price action set against a former trend line, the current cycle's 76% resistance level and a mostly favorable-looking stochastics position, an AAPL short looks even better.The AAPL Stock TradeWith Apple stock confirming a pivot high this week as shares moved through $200.65, shares could be shorted today while using a stop-loss above the pattern's candlestick high of $205.08.But I'd wait.Since this Dow stock finished Tuesday modestly above the short signal price, I like placing Apple shares on the radar for shorting on a bearish re-cross of $200.65 for additional confirmation. The entry is also contingent on last week's high remaining intact and of course, using it for keeping risk well-managed off and on the price chart.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-07-10	2019-07-10 12:51:41	MMM	3M Company	3M Stock Is More Than Just a Dividend Darling	When I'm vetting stocks to add to my long-term holdings, I have to think very differently than I do when I'm swing trading or scalping.For one thing, I commit to blocking out the noise and focusing on the company's long-term viability; moreover, I look at its dividend as a sign that the company is in good health and likes to reward loyal shareholders.Source: Shutterstock Besides being a long-standing Dow Jones component, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) offers a compelling 3.31% dividend yield; that's not too bad at all. That alone wouldn't be enough to convince me to buy 3M stock, though, so I have to weigh a multitude of other factors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019  3M Stock Price Is NiceTo begin with, the 3M stock price is closer to its 52-week low of $159.32 than its 52-week high of $219.75. Some traders might view that as a red flag, but I'm a contrarian by nature, especially when I'm thinking about the long-term outlook of a stock. In the case of 3M stock, I really like the idea of accumulating shares at the current valuation and collecting dividends until the price reclaims its previous 52-week high.If your broker has granted you permission to trade options - and if you have enough free capital in your brokerage account to buy 100 shares of MMM stock - you could collect what I call a &quot;second dividend&quot; by purchasing 100 MMM shares and selling an at-the-money covered call option. Between the premium payment you'll collect and the quarterly dividend payments, you could actually earn some meaningful income even if 3M stock price stays relatively flat. Analysts Like 3M StockI'm not one to blindly follow analysts' price targets, but I'll generally give more credence to the research firms than the retail crowd because the firms have better research and analysis tools at their disposal. Concerning 3M stock, the average 12-month price target among brokerages that have issued a report on it in the last year is $188.33, indicating an upbeat outlook overall.Citigroup's price target of $221 on 3M stock is particularly optimistic, while Gorden Haskett's $191.98 price objective is also fairly ambitious. The insider buying activity of 3M Director Gregory R. Page, who recently purchased 1,000 shares and is currently the owner of 4,000 shares of the company, is also a positive sign in my humble opinion. You Take the Good, You Take the BadCritics of the company were quick to cite 3M's disappointing first-quarter 2019 earnings report, which was released on April 25. But  I'm encouraged by the fact that 3M CEO Mike Roman openly acknowledged that the company's adjusted Q1 EPS of $2.23 versus last year's $2.50 (a drop of 10.8% year-over-year) was disappointing.Beyond just admitting the problem, Roman cited 3M's plan to rectify the company's short-term issues:We have stepped up additional actions - including restructuring - to drive productivity, reduce costs, and increase cash flow as we manage through challenges in some of our end markets.Roman also detailed how 3M plans to reorganize itself in order to meet consumers' demands going forward:We recently implemented a significant portfolio realignment from five to four business groups, which will enable us to better serve our customers and global markets.And let's not ignore the good news: 3M's Q1 GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) earnings came in at $1.51 per share, an astounding 54.1% YoY jump. Plus, 3M paid $830 million in dividends to the owners of 3M stock and repurchased $701 million shares of MMM stock  during the quarter. For long-term investors like myself, robust dividends and share buybacks are signs that a company is in good health and confident in its own fiscal future. The Bottom Line on 3M StockThe critics will always be able to find something to complain about, but when I look at 3M, I see a Dow stalwart with a solid plan and the potential to beat Q2 expectations; moreover, the compelling 3M stock price and its generous dividend payouts complete the picture of a stock that's earned my seal of approval.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-09	2019-07-09 20:18:46	MMM	3M Company	Dow Jones Today: Averting Catastrophe, but Nothing to Brag About	If not for some bullish tidings in the technology sector, the largest sector weight in the S&P 500, today's losses likely would have been more substantial. As it was, the Nasdaq Composite, which closed higher by 0.54% was the only one of the major U.S. benchmarks to close higher today.Source: Shutterstock The S&P 500 added 0.12%, averting a third consecutive day of declines while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.08%. Overall, these were not bad losses by any stretch. But the recent scuffling by stocks indicates there is some level of importance around Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's congressional testimony, which kicks off tomorrow.&quot;Focus this week will be on Fed chief Jerome Powell's remarks at his two-day testimony before the Congress, starting Wednesday,&quot; reports Reuters. &quot;Also due on Wednesday is the central bank's June policy meeting minutes.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs has been noted in this space, market participants are pricing in the following Fed facts: no interest rate cut this month and no cuts totaling 50 basis points this year. Hope burns eternal for a rate reduction of 25 basis points, but Powell's two-day testimony and the June meeting minutes could indicate otherwise.In late trading, just 12 of the Dow's 30 components were in the green and none of that dozen had gains in excess of 1%. Tuesday's big winner was Merck (NYSE:MRK), which added 0.98% after the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) &quot;accepted for review six supplemental Biologics License Applications (sBLAs) to update the dosing frequency for KEYTRUDA, Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, to include an every-six-weeks (Q6W) dosing schedule option,&quot; according to a statement.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half The company is seeking &quot;KEYTRUDA indications in melanoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and Merkel cell carcinoma,&quot; it said in the release. One More Ray of SunshineAgain, Dow winners were hard to come by Tuesday, but Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded modestly higher after the company said it will acquire optical semiconductor maker Acacia Communications (NASDAQ:ACIA) for $2.6 billion in cash.Acacia's products &quot;are designed to transform communications networks through improvements in performance, capacity and cost,&quot; according to Cisco.Cisco has one of the tidier balance sheets and one of the larger cash hoards in the technology sector, so it can easily absorb an acquisition of this size. Troublemakers on Dow Jones Today3M (NYSE:MMM), already one of the Dow's worst-performing components this year with a double-digit loss, was one of the index's worst offenders Tuesday, sinking 1.99% following an analyst downgrade. RBC Capital Markets cut its rating on 3M to &quot;market perform&quot; from &quot;outperform&quot; while slashing its price target on the industrial conglomerate to $176 from $207.Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which was one of the Dow's worst performers yesterday, continued that ominous trend today, shedding 1.52%. The stock's year-to-date gain has all but withered while shares of primary rival AT&T (NYSE:T) are higher by almost 18%. Bottom Line: Fed Help and EarningsPowell's aforementioned testimony could bring some near-term relief for stocks, particularly if a valid takeaway is that rate cuts are still on the table following the strong June jobs number. There are also some glimmers of hope, be they faint, on the earnings front.&quot;During the second quarter, analysts lowered earnings estimates for companies in the S&P 500 for the quarter. The Q2 bottom-up EPS estimate (which is an aggregation of the median EPS estimates of all the companies in the index for the second quarter) dropped by 2.6% (to $40.42 from $41.46) during this period,&quot; according to FactSet.As the research firm points out, &quot;the average decline in the bottom-up EPS estimate during a quarter has been 3.3%.&quot;Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-09	2019-07-09 18:14:09	MMM	3M Company	4 Stocks to Sell Now	The Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to fall away from its recent push towards the 27,000 level. Investors were taking a pause or looking for stocks to sell after Friday's strong job numbers called into question the likelihood of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts this year. We will know more when Fed chairman Jerome Powell gives his semi-annual testimony to Congress starting on Wednesday.As a reminder, the economy added 224,000 new jobs in June as wages rose at a 3.1% annualized rate. Before the jobs report, the futures market had assigned a 26% chance of a 0.5% rate cut. Now, those odds are at zero.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half Wall Street is also waiting for actual progress on the renewed U.S.-China trade talks, as well as indications that the troubles at Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) aren't signs of more systematic problems over in the Eurozone. In response, a number of mega-cap stocks are rolling over and look headed for further losses. Here are four stocks to sell or avoid:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Stocks to Sell: 3M (MMM)3M (NYSE:MMM) shares are dropping hard and fast away from their 50-day moving average, closing back in on its late May lows in the wake of a downgrade from analysts at RBC Capital Markets -- echoing an earnings warning from German chemical maker BASF. The company is highly attuned to industrial activity globally, which is slowing.The company will next report results on July 25 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.10 per share on revenues of $8.1 billion. When the company last reported on April 25, earnings of $2.23 missed estimates by 27 cents on a 5% decline in revenues. Apache (APA)With energy prices drifting lower, Apache (NYSE:APA) is retesting its late May lows and looks set for a drop back to its late December lows near $24, which would be worth a loss of nearly 8% from here. The tensions in the Persian Gulf with Iran and a recommitment by OPEC+ to keep production low haven't been able to push energy prices back up -- weighing on the entire energy sector.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 The company will next report results on July 31 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 25 cents per share on revenues of $1.7 billion. When the company last reported on May 1, earnings of 10 cents per share missed estimates by two cents on a 6.4% decline in revenues. DuPont (DD)Shares of DuPont (NYSE:DD) are cutting back below their 50-day moving average, heading for a return to their May lows, which would be worth a loss of roughly 10% from here. This continues a downtrend that has been in play since January 2018, capping a loss of more than 30% overall.The company will next report results on Aug. 1 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 87 cents per share on revenues of $5.6 billion. When the company last reported on May 2, earnings of 84 cents per share missed estimates by a penny on an 8.7% decline in revenues. Fastenal (FAST)Shares of Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST), which are directly tied to industrial activity via its sales of screws and other fasteners, is breaking down out of a three-month consolidation range in what looks like a return to its May lows. This comes as the 50-day moving average proves to be intractable resistance. A violation of the 200-day moving average would set up a fall all the way back to its December low.The company will next report results on July 11 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 37 cents per share on revenues of $1.4 billion. When the company last reported on April 11, earnings of 34 cents per share beat estimates by a penny on a 10.4% rise in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-03	2019-07-03 11:25:02	MMM	3M Company	Sell the Bounce in 3M Stock	Finally, shares of 3M (NYSE:MMM) have bounced. The 3M stock price has rallied almost 9% since late May, when MMM stock touched a three-year low.Source: Shutterstock That low was reached thanks to a hugely disappointing first-quarter earnings report in late April. Lowered guidance and a big miss led the 3M stock price down 13%; that's an absolutely huge move for a Dow Jones Industrial Average component.In fact, it was such a big decline that 3M alone took almost 200 points off the Dow. It was the biggest decline in MMM stock since the 1987 stock market crash.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIncredibly, it got worse: 3M stock kept falling. At those lows, MMM had declined 27% in less than six weeks.From that standpoint, the rally of late isn't surprising or concerning to those of us who question broader market valuations. Dividend stalwarts like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) trade near all-time highs. Income investors looking for dividends and value are looking to 3M stock for the obvious: shares are seemingly &quot;on sale&quot; and yield a still healthy 3.3%.  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer But it's not necessarily a good thing to pick one stock because others are too expensive. And the bounce in 3M stock ignores the fact that the decline occurred for good reason. 3M's business isn't healthy. Longer-term headwinds remain intact.Furthermore, MMM stock -- yield or no yield -- isn't that cheap. Investors looking to jump on 3M need to remember that price and dividend yield alone don't make a buy case. The Case Against MMM StockThe argument against 3M stock at this point is reasonably simple: significant end markets are in rough shape. As 3M CFO Nicholas Gangestad noted at a recent conference, 30% of revenue comes from automotive, China, and electronics.None of those markets seems healthy at the moment. Sales in the three markets combined fell &quot;mid-single-digits&quot; in Q1, leading organic sales on the whole to decline. But this isn't a single-quarter problem. &quot;Peak auto&quot; is a long-running concern. Chinese demand is slowing, and the trade war may well impact 3M's positioning longer-term. Electronics prices continue to fall, putting pressure on manufacturers which may make its way to 3M.What's notable is that beyond those three markets, it's not as if performance was all that impressive. 3M's commentary suggests that the other roughly 70% of the business maybe grew organic sales 1% in Q1.Plus, cyclical worries could hit demand. Inventories are at high levels, as analyst Stephen Tusa -- who has been prescient about the fall of General Electric (NYSE:GE) -- has noted. Growth is stalling out at the end of the cycle. This raises the question of what will happen once that cycle inevitably turns. The Case for 3M StockIt's easy to argue with 3M that this, too, shall pass. It's a 117-year-old company: 3M has been through worse and come out on the other side. Revenue is diversified. China may well bounce back. 3M is a dividend king, with 61 consecutive years of payout increases. That logic suggests the applied-sciences giant will be just fine.Meanwhile, a 17-times forward multiple leaves the 3M stock price relatively cheap, even after the bounce. A 3.3% dividend yield means investors &quot;get paid to wait&quot; for the business to improve.But that case seems too thin, and too high-level. There are real problems in the business right now. So real, in fact, that 3M had to cut guidance three months after it was issued.As far the broader argument about 3M's history, multiple, and dividend, investors could have made the exact same argument about GE. They could have said much the same about healthcare distributor Owens & Minor (NYSE:OMI), or Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD).To be sure, I don't expect MMM stock to follow the trajectory of those names, who slashed their dividends and have fallen -- in the case of OMI -- as much as 90% in recent years. 3M's dividend may be at risk at some point, but it appears safe for now. (The company is pulling back on share repurchases, however, after its recent acquisition of medical products manufacturer Acelity.) And I'm not betting on 50%+ downside for MMM stock. Concluding ThoughtsBut this isn't a case where the market is overreacting. Neither is a nervous market taking down the 3M stock price. The market is at all-time highs, but 3M isn't.Therefore, investors aren't overreacting to some perceived external threat; 3M delivered the bad news itself. Anyone buying the dip here should keep that in mind.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-07-02	2019-07-02 19:21:36	MMM	3M Company	10 Stocks to Buy for A Summer Rally	It has been a record year for the stock market. In the first half of 2019, the S&P 500 rose 17%, marking the best first half performance for the index since 1997, when stocks were up more than 20% in the first half of the year. Following that 20%-plus rally in the first half of 1997, the S&P 500 proceeded to rise another near 10% in the back-half of the year, and closed the year up more than 30%.In other words, not only are stocks off to their best year in over two decades, but the last time stocks were this hot to start a year, they stayed hot into the end of the year.Will history repeat itself? Maybe. There are two big risks facing the markets right now: the U.S.-China trade war and slowing economic expansion. But, the trade war has been put on hold, and it looks increasingly likely that a deal between the two countries will get done soon. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is acting like they are going to cut rates, an action that should goose the economy and boost economic expansion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever Thus, the two biggest risks holding back stocks, may disappear over the next few months. If they do, stocks will have a big summer. With that in mind, let's take a look at ten stocks to buy for a potential summer rally. Alibaba (BABA)Source: Charles Chan Via FlickrThe Catalyst: U.S.-China trade dealThe Thesis: Shares of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) have been under pressure over the past few months as trade tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated. But, those trade tensions are now de-escalating once again, as both countries have agreed to resume trade negotiations and put a truce on the trade war.It appears increasingly likely that a trade deal will get done soon. As investors grow more optimistic regarding the prospects of a trade deal in the foreseeable future, Chinese stocks will head higher since such a trade deal will provide a material boost to the Chinese economy. The biggest and most high profile of those Chinese stocks? Alibaba.Consequently, as trade tensions cool in the summer and China's economy picks up steam, BABA stock should bounce back toward the $200 level. Facebook (FB)Source: Shutterstock The Catalyst: Revenue growth re-acceleratingThe Thesis: Shares of global social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were under pressure in 2018 due to data privacy and regulation concerns. But, such concerns have faded into the background in 2019, and the stock has rallied big year-to-date.This big rebound rally in FB stock should continue into the summer as the company's revenue growth trajectory ramps back up for several reasons. First, a trade deal should help Facebook's business, since it means companies won't have to worry about cutting costs from supply chain disruptions, and will have more budget to allocate toward advertising. Second, a potential rate cut should goose the economy, and increase corporate spending on things like advertising. Third, the pivot into commerce should provide a new revenue tailwind.  * The Top 10 Best Sectors in the Market for 2019 Net net, Facebook's growth narrative is set to improve substantially over the next few months, and as it does, investors will continue to buy into the FB rebound narrative. Crocs (CROX)Source: Shutterstock The Catalyst: Strong earningsThe Thesis: Over the past several years, sandal footwear brand Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) has orchestrated one of the most impressive retail turnarounds anyone has ever seen, simply by narrowing the product portfolio and focusing on the company's classic foam clog (which has reinvigorated revenue growth and cut expenses from the operating model). This turnaround has propelled CROX stock from $6 in mid-2017, to over $30 by early 2019.Over the past few months, that big turnaround has hit a snag as the whole CROX growth trajectory slowed against the backdrop of broader retail turmoil in early 2019. But, that dour retail backdrop has significantly improved since then, as U.S. labor markets have remained healthy, rates have plunged and trade tensions have eased. Plus, consumer interest with respect to Crocs has only surged higher since then, and the company just scored a big partnership with Vera Bradley.Overall, then, the numbers over at Crocs should be a lot better this summer, than they were in early 2019, and that sequential improvement should drive a big rebound rally in CROX stock. Nvidia (NVDA)Source: Nvidia The Catalyst: Improving semiconductor market conditionsThe Thesis: Shares of GPU giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have struggled over the past year as slowing demand across the global semiconductor market has converged on huge inventory levels to create a material drag on semiconductor revenues and margins. Nvidia has been no exception. Revenues and margins have dropped over the past year, and as they have, NVDA stock has dropped, too.But, the fundamentals underlying the semiconductor market are starting to improve. Demand remains weak, but should improve as trade tensions between the U.S. and China cool, and as the Fed cuts rates. Meanwhile, supply remains high, but a rebound in demand should help alleviate the inventory glut. At the same time, bitcoin prices have come roaring back, and that brings bitcoin mining revenue back into the picture. Cloud gaming catalysts in the back half of 2019 should similarly provide a boost to Nvidia GPU demand.  * 7 Restaurant Stocks to Put on Your Plate All in all, the fundamental backdrop supporting NVDA stock should substantially improve in the summer of 2019, and into the end of the year. Those improvements should drive up investor demand for Nvidia stock, and ultimately push the stock higher over the next few months. 3M (MMM)Source: Shutterstock The Catalyst: A stabilizing global economyThe Thesis: Economically sensitive industrial giant 3M (NYSE:MMM) has suffered from a slowing growth and compressing margin trend over the past several quarters as the global economy has similarly slowed. This slowdown has led to a wipe-out in 3M stock, which is presently more than 30% off its 52-week highs.But, the global economy is starting to show signs of stabilization, and could start to improve in the back-half of the year as U.S.-China trade tensions cool and as the Fed cuts rates. This global economic improvement should lead to a boost in consumer and business confidence, which should lead to a boost in consumer and business spending. Ultimately, some of that spending will find its way onto 3M's income statement, and this company's numbers in the back-half of the year could be much better than the numbers early in the year.This fundamental improvement will converge on a stock that is trading at a discount to its average valuation and is more than 30% off 52-week highs. In other words, fundamental strength will converge on stock price weakness in the back half of 2019. That convergence should produce a nice bounce-back rally in 3M stock. Foot Locker (FL)Source: Shutterstock The Catalyst: Strong earningsThe Thesis: Once struggling athletic footwear retailer Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) has staged a nice comeback over the past few years, as the athletic apparel sector has stabilized in its shift from wholesale retail to direct retail. As it has, Foot Locker's numbers have improved. Last quarter, this company reported both positive comparable sales growth and margin expansion.Yet, FL stock presently trades 35% off its 52-week highs, and at a measly 8X forward earnings. Why? The trade war. Foot Locker finds itself at the epicenter of the U.S.-China trade war. The athletic footwear industry outsources a lot of production. The biggest destination of that outsourcing is China. As such, higher tariffs on Chinese imports stand to significantly and adversely impact Foot Locker's numbers. Investors have been persistently nervous about this, and FL stock has remained very weak.  * 7 Stocks on Sale the Insiders Are Buying But, the U.S. and China agreed to a trade war truce recently, and it looks likely that a trade deal is coming soon. At the same time, the Fed will likely cut rates soon, and that will provide a boost to consumer spending. Net net, Foot Locker's biggest headwinds will significantly ease in the back-half of the year, clearing the way for a big rally in depressed, beaten-up and dirt cheap FL stock. Tesla (TSLA)Source: OnInnovation via FlickrThe Catalyst: Delivery reboundThe Thesis: Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have been under immense pressure in 2019 as the company's growth trajectory has fallen flat. Specifically, delivery numbers for Tesla fell from late 2018 to early 2019, while competing models gained market share. Investors freaked out, and TSLA stock plunged.But, there are signs emerging that indicate that Tesla vehicle demand is ramping back up from the depressed early 2019 levels. At the same time, there are also signs that Tesla remains the runaway leader in the U.S. EV market, and competitors aren't gaining that much ground. There is also a Model S refresh coming soon, and hope that new Model Y production will start in late 2019.Broadly, the TSLA growth narrative hit a snag in early 2019, but appears to rebounding nicely from that trough. Summer 2019 numbers should be markedly better than early 2019 numbers. Bad early 2019 numbers caused a huge sell off in TSLA stock. Better summer 2019 numbers should spark a rebound. Netflix (NFLX)Source: Vivian D Nguyen via Flickr (Modified)The Catalyst: Strong subscriber numbersThe Thesis: Shares of streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) had a big rally to start the year. But, ever since late January 2019, NFLX stock has traded largely sideways as investors have tried to balance continued strong numbers with a stretched valuation and forthcoming competitive risks.This balancing act should end soon. The key with NFLX stock is to follow the content. When the original content pipeline is strong in a certain quarter, the subscriber trends in that quarter are usually similarly strong. The opposite is true, too. Fortunately, over the past several months, Netflix's original content pipeline has been about as good as it has ever been, both on its face and relative to the competition.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever This strong content pipeline will produce strong Q2 subscriber numbers. Furthermore, a healthy content line-up into the back-half of 2019 will produce a strong Q3 subscriber guide. Strong Q2 sub numbers and a healthy Q3 sub guide will lead to NFLX stock breaking out of its sideways trading pattern. Dave & Buster's (PLAY)Source: Shutterstock The Catalyst: Rate cutThe Thesis: Arcade and restaurant owner Dave & Buster's (NASDAQ:PLAY) has suffered from a sideways stock for several years now. Since late 2015, PLAY stock has bounced between $30 and $70. Ultimately, though, it has made no sustainable upward progress. In late 2015, this was a $40 stock. Today, PLAY trades hands around $40.The trouble with Dave & Buster's is that growth is slowing. Back in 2015, Dave & Buster's was winning big thanks to a huge pivot towards experience-oriented spending. That tailwind has dried up, and this company has gone from 8.9% comparable sales growth in 2015, to 3.3% in 2016, flat in 2017 and a 1.6% loss in 2018. As comparable sales growth has consistently decelerated, the stock has failed to gain ground.But, comparable sales came in at a loss of 0.3% in the first quarter of 2019, better than last year's 1.6% decline. Further, management is guiding for a loss of 0.5% comparable sales growth this year, which is also better than last year's 1.6% decline. And the forthcoming Fed rate cuts give potential upside to that -0.5% guide.In other words, in 2019, the trend should reverse course for Dave & Buster's. Slowing comparable sales growth will turn into rebounding comparable sales growth, and that trend reversal should cause a similar reversal in PLAY stock. Canopy Growth (CGC)Source: Canopy Growth The Catalyst: Edibles, extracts, & topicalsThe Thesis: Canadian cannabis giant Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) has had a really good 2019. Over the past several months, it has become increasingly obvious through continued Canadian market dominance, key acquisitions, and certain legal developments, that Canopy projects as the leader in a potentially very large global cannabis market. As Canopy has gained long term growth visibility, CGC stock has rallied. Year-to-date, shares are up 50%.But, CGC stock is also 25% off recent highs as the Canadian cannabis market continues to fight through growing pains. The latest growing pain? Continued supply shortages, and an inability to transfer illicit sales into the legal channel. These struggles weighed on Canopy's early 2019 numbers, and CGC stock has subsequently sold off from its recent highs.The numbers will get better in the back-half of the year. Specifically, Canada is set to legalize cannabis edibles, extracts, and topicals later this year. The introduction of these new products into the market will do two things. First, it will boost demand. Second, it will increase margins, since these products have higher margins than dried flower.  * 7 Restaurant Stocks to Put on Your Plate Overall, then, the introduction of edibles, extracts, and topicals into the legal Canadian cannabis market will provide a lift to Canopy's numbers in the back-half of 2019, and that lift should translate into a rally for CGC stock.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BABA, FB, CROX, FL, TSLA, NFLX and CGC.

Viewed as an American industrial titan for decades, the company has undergone a miraculous deterioration. Three years ago, GE stock was trading north of $30. In December 2018 it was flirting with falling below $6. Now back above $10, GE stock is showing signs of life. Does that make it a buy?Source: Shutterstock From a fundamental perspective, the answer seems like a resounding &quot;no.&quot; From a technical point of view, though, GE stock is looking much healthier. But just because its charts are pointing to potential gains doesn't mean its balance sheet issues have been resolved or that its cash flow woes have vanished  * The 7 Top Small-Cap Stocks Of 2019  The Growling BearJPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa called the demise of GE stock. He was the first analyst to turn bearish on the industrial conglomerate and, for the most part, he's stuck to his guns. As GE stock fell last year, Tusa was ahead of the ball. He would lower his price target or issue negative reports only to see the stock price get nailed weeks or months later on continued weak fundamentals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTusa told investors to stop selling GE stock in December. Well, sort of.He raised his &quot;sell&quot; rating on General Electric stock to a &quot;hold&quot; rating, but maintained his $6 price target. The shares bottomed near $6.60 and embarked on a violent upside reversal. Investors -- or at least momentum traders -- used Tusa's upgrade as an opportunity to squeeze GE stock higher.I don't mean to put too much weight on one analyst. But it got to the point that investors were using Tusa's statements, rather than those of GE's management, to determine how the company was really doing.Tusa downgraded GE stock again a few months ago. He now has  a &quot;sell&quot; rating and a Street-low $5 price target on General Electric stock. While many of his peers and management are cheering the company's &quot;conservative&quot; $55 billion of new aviation orders from the Paris Aviation Show, Tusa said the takeaway for GE &quot;was on net more negative than even we were thinking when it comes to the Aviation debate.&quot; Valuing General Electric StockGiven the bullish price action of GE stock since December, it's no wonder Tusa's bearish stance has drawn some criticism. And that's where there's a diversion between GE's fundamentals and the technicals of GE stock.Fundamentally, it's hard to make a case for being long General Electric stock. But as you'll see in a moment on the charts, the stock continues to get healthier.Management already told us that the company's cash flows would be pressured for the rest of this year and be weak next year as well. For a company like GE, that's not good news. The company has already essentially slashed its dividend down to nothing and has had to part ways with assets at less-than-favorable prices.Analysts' expectations for the company aren't great, either.Analysts, on average, are calling for earnings of 59 cents per share this year, a near-10% decline from last year's 65 cents per share. The consensus estimate for 2020 calls for earnings of 74 cents per share. If attained, that represents growth of 25% from 2019. However, it's still lower than the 76 cents of basic EPS that GE had in 2016.Its revenue is expected to decline 3.8% this year to about $117 billion and rebound just 1.3% in 2020 to $118.5 billion. But its 2020 top line, like its 2020 bottom line,  is expected to be lower in 2020 than it was in 2018. Moreover, in 2016 the company generated revenue of $119.4 billion.In short, GE  has been bleeding like crazy. General Electric stock has been rallying because investors are banking that management can stop the bleeding. If it can't, Tusa's price target may pan out. If it can, the shares will probably be able to climb over time.Compared to a company like Honeywell (NYSE:HON) or a high-dividend stock like 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) though, it's hard to find GE stock attractive. Trading GE Stock  Click to EnlargeNot long ago, I pointed out that GE stock could rebound. My statement came as the shares were knocking on the door to $10.50, which has been range resistance throughout 2019. The stock broke through and ran to $10.71, but then retreated.At the time, I said that, if its breakout failed,  GE needed to use its major moving averages as its support. GE is now using its 20-day moving average as support. If GE stock stays above the 20-day moving average , a retest of the $10.50 resistance point should be in the cards.GE still has plenty of support below the 20-day. The now-uptrending 50-day moving average is $9.92, while the 200-day moving average is  $9.61. Just above that is prior downtrend resistance (depicted by the blue line). Below all that, GE stock has range support at $9.The bottom line? See if GE gets another opportunity to break out over $10.50.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-06-24	2019-06-24 15:04:56	MMM	3M Company	How Chinese Culture Could Affect the Future of 3M Stock	3M (NYSE:MMM) stock price has begun to recover from one of the more significant drops in company history. An earnings miss related to the trade war and speculation about the security of the dividend of 3M stock  have hammered the shares.Source: Shutterstock Both factors have added significant risk to a company most regard as stable. Although 3M stock price should recover, unusual risk factors make MMM stock suitable for only income-oriented, risk-tolerant investors.  * 7 Top S&P 500 Stocks of 2019 (So Far)  Threats to 3M's Dividend Hit 3M stockIn late April, 3M stock price went into free-fall following a massive earnings miss. The stock plunged by about 13% following the announcement. Warnings about the stability of the company's dividend caused MMM stock further pain.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast month, analyst Stephen Tusa of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) kept his &quot;underweight&quot; rating on 3M stock and took his price target on MMM stock down to $143 per share. He also warned that the company could cut its dividend.  Tusa's note led to a further decline in 3M stock price over the next month. The drop would take MMM stock from a high of almost $220 per share to a low just above $159 per share.Any time analysts talk about the end of a 60-year streak of dividend increases, it is a serious matter. Such an action could bring years of devastation and stagnation to 3M stock.For now, traders have shrugged off the underweight rating. Just three weeks after hitting its 52-week low, the 3M stock price has risen to nearly  $174 per share. 3M Is a ConglomerateIf only scotch tape and post-it notes held this company together, I would be wary of the move higher by 3M stock. However, much like another well-known conglomerate named Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), 3M's products extend across several divisions and industries. Health Care, 3M's only division to report revenue growth last quarter, will likely receive a boost from the company's recent $6.7 billion acquisition of Acelity.Still, this diversification does not make 3M stock bulletproof. All one has to do is study the decline of General Electric (NYSE:GE) to know that older industrial conglomerates can face devastation and even fail. I see Tusa's call on the dividend as extreme. However,  if the U.S.-China trade war persists long enough, the dividend could be cut. Do Not Forget the Trade War, Culture RiskIt is the trade war that I see as the most significant risk to 3M stock. The Asia-Pacific region, which includes both China and Japan, accounted for 31.3% of 3M's overall revenue in 2018. The trade war has lasted longer than almost anyone thought it would.Investors also need to consider cultural factors that statistics cannot quantify. China's President, Xi Jinping, basically runs China as a dictatorship. While an end to the trade war would benefit both the Chinese people and 3M stock, dictators often act contrary to their people's interest.Another factor involves Chinese culture itself. The Chinese consider saving face quite important. This makes China unlikely to sign a trade deal that will make it appear to be the loser. As a result, not only must U.S. negotiators sign an agreement that works for America, but they must also create an arrangement that at least appears to benefit the Chinese.This creates a conundrum for the owners of 3M stock, as such a deal could happen tomorrow, two years from now, or perhaps never. Still, I see reasons to buy MMM stock for those who can handle risk. The current price-earnings ratio of 3M stock is  18.5, which is below the historical average of 23.2. Moreover,  most analysts believe the company's  earnings will resume growing next year, although their profit estimates likely factor in an end to the trade war.Further, thanks to the decline of 3M stock  price, 3M's dividend yield now stands at about 3.3%. 3M pays out 58.6% of its income in dividends. If that percentage moves closer to 100%, the payout would be endangered. However, 3M has some cushion before it has to resort to ending its streak of payout hikes. Final Thoughts on 3M Stock3M stock carries culture-based risk which investors rarely consider. Consequently, MMM stock best suits investors who can tolerate risk and need income. JPMorgan's Tusa may have exaggerated the threat to 3M's dividend. Nonetheless, the trade war appears unlikely to end soon, and China accounts for a large percentage of 3M's revenues.But complicating an end to the trade war is China itself. Due to 3M's dependence on China, the future of 3M depends heavily on a dictator who's intent on saving face. This factor could make 3M stock riskier than it's ever been.MMM stock pays a generous, growing dividend. It also trades at a low multiple. However, with the future of the stock hanging on geopolitics and Chinese culture, only those willing to deal with those risk factors should buy the shares.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-06-19	2019-06-19 18:41:17	MMM	3M Company	Has DOW Stock Reached an Attractive Entry Point?	The new Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW) stock and company is the result of a two-stage spinoff of Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) and DOW stock by  DowDupont (NYSE:DD) that started on Apr. 1. The split came about because of agitation from an activist shareholder, Third Point's Dan Loeb.  No doubt, the main objective was to benefit the owners of DowDupont stock and DOW stock.Source: Roy Luck via Flickr (modified)And of course, the CEO of DOW, Jim Fitterling,  boasted about the restructuring. In a press release, he said:&quot;The changes we have made to Dow's portfolio, cost structure and mindset are significant. The new Dow is a more focused and streamlined company with a clear playbook to deliver long-term earnings growth and value creation for all stakeholders.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut unfortunately, Wall Street hasn't been so kind to Dow Inc stock. Since early April, DOW stock has gone from $58 to $49.  * 7 Value Stocks to Buy for the Second Half  The Issues With Dow Inc StockSpinoffs can be disruptive. There is often a large turnover in the shareholder base, which can put pressure on the shares.Yet that overhang will dissipate in the longer term.  So could DOW stock now be an interesting value play? Is it time to consider buying Dow Inc stock?Well, I'd still be cautious. DOW is still a complex organization. As seen with other companies like GE (NYSE:GE) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), complexity has become a big drawback on Wall Street. Investors nowadays want agile companies that can focus on growth opportunities and be nimble enough to stave off rivals.InvestorPlace.com columnist Josh Enomoto aptly described the complexity of DOW and how that could be a hindrance:&quot;Dow Inc stock doesn't provide a clean, linear path. Instead, the underlying company is stretched wide, featuring businesses in consumer products, packaging, industrial materials, large-scale infrastructures and technology. From a topical perspective, the separation into three entities streamlined operations for the individual cogs. Somewhat left out in the equation was that the individual cogs also have non-intuitive structures.&quot;However, complexity may not be the biggest risk facing DOW stock. Rather, the slowing of the global economy looks to be the main problem.For now, there is little clarity on a resolution to the dispute between the U.S. and China. In the meantime, there is also the potential for trade disputes between the U.S. and Europe.The World Bank has reported that global growth will come in at 2.6% versus its January forecast of 2.9%. That would be the weakest global growth in three years.As for DOW, the company is definitely sensitive to the swings of the economy. When the economy slows, it's easy to put off a decision to purchase new raw materials and commodities. The Bottom Line on DOW StockDOW has positive attributes. Keep in mind that the company continues to streamline its operations and cut costs. DOW plans to eliminate $700 million of costs this year. It is also being more disciplined when it comes to capital investments.As for the valuation of Dow Inc, stock it is fairly cheap. Consider that its forward price-earnings multiple is nine and its dividend yield is a hefty 5.7%.Yet such factors likely mean that DOW stock has some downside protection. However, because of the macro weakness across the world, it could be tough for Dow Inc stock to advance meaningfully.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-06-18	2019-06-18 20:22:47	MMM	3M Company	Dow Jones Today: Why the Best Stocks in the DJIA Are Rallying	All it took was a little love on the trade front to send stocks surging on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 rallied 1.39% and 0.97%, respectively, with the latter closing in on another record in advance of the Federal Reserve meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, added a respectable 1.35%.Source: Shutterstock Finally, a tweet from President Trump involving trade talks proved efficacious for stocks. In a tweet out earlier today, Trump said he and Chinese President X had a &quot;very good&quot; conversation via telephone and that the two are &quot;extended meeting next week at the G-20 in Japan.&quot; Trump added that representatives from both sides will hold talks prior to the two leaders getting together.The stage is set for stocks to continue climbing, particularly if the Federal Reserve cooperates. The U.S. central bank commenced its two-day meeting today. While it appears unlikely that the Fed will announce an interest rate cut tomorrow, what will captivate investors' is language that could imply a rate cut is imminent, perhaps as soon as July.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThose are the types of headlines that riskier assets love. In late trading, more than two-thirds of the Dow's 30 components were in the green, but a few were sporting particularly robust gains. Let's look at a few here. Boeing (BA)Boeing (NYSE:BA), a frequent guest in this space and the Dow's largest component, surged 5.50% today, an encouraging sign because it is good to see the big kahuna rally in a price-weighted index like the Dow. Yesterday, it was noted that Boeing was making some bullish predictions at the Paris Airshow.  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for a Seemingly Sleepy Summer That theme continued today when the company said that British airline group IAG inked a deal to buy 200 of Boeing's 737 max jets. Yes, that's the same 737 max passenger jet that has recently caused Boeing investors so much consternation. IAG owns British Airways, Aer Lingus and Spain's Iberia, among other European carriers. The deal could be worth up to $24 billion. 3M (MMM)Industrial conglomerate 3M Co. (NYSE:MMM) is the epitome of a cyclical stock that has been battered by the trade war. Shares of 3M are saddled with a second-quarter loss of 20% and the stock has been careening lower since late April.3M, which has a dividend yield of 3.45%, got some relief today, climbing 2.98%. As is the case with Boeing, 3M's rise is particularly good news for the price-weighted Dow because Minnesota-based 3M is the eighth-largest component in the price-weighted index.&quot;We believe the market has overreacted to two key variables: 1) 3M's latest guidance cut; and 2) 3M's potential PFAS litigation exposure,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note.&quot;Since Mike Roman has been at the helm for nearly a year, 3M has been forced to cut guidance on five different occasions. That said, 3M consists of short-cycle businesses that are notoriously hard to predict. Most of the slowdown has come from three distinct end markets which make up over 30% of its revenue base, which include automotive, electronics, and China. And the company simply missed reacting to slowing demand.&quot; Intel (INTC)As has been widely documented, semiconductor stocks have been primary victims of the trade controversy. What was once one of the year's best-performing groups rapidly turned south in May, but the anti-semiconductor trade probably got too crowded too quickly, giving way to a snap-back rally.That rally may have started today and Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) got in on the act. At one point Tuesday, eight of the 10 best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 on a percentage basis were chip stocks.After gaining 2.74%, Intel was the Dow's best-performing technology stock today. Nike (NKE)Athletic apparel and footwear giant NIKE Inc. (NYSEARCA:NKE) gained 2.82% today, probably due in large part to the encouraging news on the trade front. The company is heavily dependent on foreign labor and was previously warned the White House that tariffs on its exports to China would be &quot;catastrophic&quot; for its business. With those factors in mind, it probably was not surprising to see NIKE rank as the best-performing consumer discretionary stock in the Dow today.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-17	2019-06-17 18:58:20	MMM	3M Company	The 5 Worst Dow Jones Stocks So Far in 2019	The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained nearly 12% so far in 2019. It doesn't seem like a whole heck of a lot, but considering the topsy-turvey markets of 2019, it's a pretty strong lift. That gain was driven by the majority of the Dow 30 as most of the stocks in the DJIA index contributed to its postive year-to-date gain.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the biggest winner of the bunch, gaining more than 30%. But owing to the odd price-weighted nature of the index, it's likely Visa (NYSE:V), with a 28% gain and a higher share price, that has been the biggest driver behind the Dow's gains.Not every component of the Dow Jones today has had a strong year, though. Five of the index's 30 stocks have declined so far this year. But not all of them make the list of the five worst Dow Jones stocks in 2019, which we'll recount in greater detail going forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today For reasons that go beyond pure performance, these five components have had the roughest year so far, which means they have the most to prove in the second half of 2019. Walgreens (WBA)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrWalgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) is the easiest pick on the list. That's somewhat ironic considering that Walgreens is one of the index's newest members, replacing General Electric (NYSE:GE) just last year. WBA stock far and away has had the worst performance in 2019: its 22.6% decline is almost exactly twice as steep as that of the index's second-biggest decliner. WBA touched a five-year low late last month before a modest rally in recent weeks.As I wrote in April, disappointing store-level execution clearly has been a factor. But what might be more worrisome for WBA is that the entire retail pharmacy industry seems to under threat. Shares of rival CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), too, have touched a multi-year low.Smaller Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) continues to plunge, with a hefty debt load adding to the pressure. Front-end sales aren't growing, and in pharmacy higher generic prices are compressing already-thin margins.WBA stock is cheap, now at less than 9x forward earnings. But right now, Walgreens looks a lot like most other retailers - and that will have to change for Walgreens stock to reverse its performance in not only 2019, but the last few years. Dow Inc. (DOW)Source: Roy Luck via Flickr (modified)It's a little unfair to put Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) on this list. DOW shares actually have gained 6% since they were spun off from what is now (again) DuPont (NYSE:DD) on April 1st.But DOW is part of the DowDuPont spinoff, a hugely complicated financial engineering project that was supposed to create real value for shareholders. It hasn't happened. DWDP shareholders received one share of Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) and one share of DOW for every three DowDuPont shares they owned. At current prices, that totals about $50 in value. DWDP shares closed 2018 near $54 - after declining 25% last year.This was a case where many value investors saw significant upside. Yet trade war concerns and post-spin trading have led DWDP to destroy value, at least so far. DOW and its former siblings still have time, and room, to rally. But a lot of smart investors likely see the YTD performance as among the most disappointing in their portfolios. Intel (INTC)Source: Shutterstock Performance-wise, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) hasn't been a bad stock in 2019. It's underperformed the market, but a 0.5% decline actually turns very slightly positive when accounting for dividend payments.Still, 2019 hasn't been a good year for Intel. It's suffering chip shortages. It's still behind in 10nm -- and about four years late. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is gobbling up market share in CPUs. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) settled with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in large part because Intel couldn't move quick enough to get the iPhone to 5G.Intel still is a behemoth in the chip space, and the company still has time to right its ship. With INTC stock at barely 10x earnings, there's upside if and when that happens. But the company's performance so far this year inspires little confidence, which has been much weaker than a flattish stock price would imply. 3M (MMM)Source: Shutterstock The 11.4% decline in 3M (NYSE:MMM) shares so far this year is the second-worst performance in the Dow. But no component has posted a worse quarterly report than 3M did with its Q1 release in late April. 3M stock plunged 13%, its worst one-day decline in over 30 years. The drop was big enough to on its own pull the index down over 100 points.MMM stock still hasn't recovered: it would drop nearly another 20% in the following weeks before bottoming of late. And there's a case for the stock after the big decline, as James Brumley argued earlier this month. A 3.4% dividend yield helps the argument, and 3M's diversified business should allow it to ride out any further near-term or market volatility.Still, Q1 was an obvious concern: stocks like 3M don't fall 25% in a matter of weeks for no reason. And it was the automotive and Chinese markets that led to the poor quarter. Neither seems likely to rebound sharply all that soon. At the very least, it's going to take a lot more than one good quarter for 3M to make back what it lost after Q1. Pfizer (PFE)Source: Shutterstock It's a bit unfair to put Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) on this list. Pfizer certainly hasn't had a terrible year. PFE stock is down 2.6%, the third-worst performance in the index. But drugmakers generally underperform in bull markets, and many drug stocks have done worse in 2019. A 3.4% dividend yield offsets most of those losses anyhow.That said, Pfizer hasn't had a great year, either. Rival (and fellow Dow component) Merck (NYSE:MRK) has gained 8%-plus. And it's hard not to get the sense that PFE, which traded mostly sideways for over three years in the middle of the decade, is back to being stagnant. There doesn't seem to much of a catalyst on the horizon to change the Pfizer story, while external pressures on the industry continue to mount.It's true that, even this year, PFE shareholders could have done worse. But given that 25 Dow Jones stocks are up YTD, it's obvious they could have done better.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-06-12	2019-06-12 10:40:20	MMM	3M Company	As Solid as It Is, Looming Fears Will Hold Back Caterpillar Stock	Between 2016 and 2018, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) earnings more than tripled. Unsurprisingly, the stock price soared. Caterpillar stock started 2016 near $60; it started 2018 roughly one hundred points higher.Source: Anthony via FlickrThere were several factors at play in earnings growth. Easy comparisons helped, certainly. Revenue fell 18% year-over-year in 2016. That was the fourth straight year in which sales declined, a first for the company. Not even during the Great Depression did Caterpillar's top line stay negative for so long. Those four years of declines also led to a great deal of pent-up demand, which has benefited results over the last nine quarters.In addition, Caterpillar aggressively cut costs: its headcount shrunk by 20% between the end of 2013 and the end of 2017. Corporate tax reform boosted EPS. Almost everything has gone right of late - but that hardly seems reflected in Caterpillar shares.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Indeed, over the last eighteen months, Caterpillar stock now has declined over 20%. Yet earnings still are expected to grow, if at a slower rate. Caterpillar is guiding for adjusted EPS this year (excluding a one-time tax benefit) of $11.75-$12.75, 5-14% above 2018 levels. Investors don't seem to care: the CAT stock price touched a 2019 low just week, and now sits at a little over 10x the midpoint of that guidance range.The issue is that investors aren't looking at 2019, or 2016. They're looking at 2020 and beyond. To some investors, that might present an opportunity. To others, it explains why the CAT stock price continues to fall and may have further to go. The Cyclical CATAlong with John Deere (NYSE:DE), Caterpillar is one of the most widely-held cyclical stocks. That's been particularly true this decade. Back in 2012, the company generated nearly $66 billion in revenue. That year, the so-called commodity supercycle driven in part by Chinese growth peaked, and Caterpillar sold billions of dollars of equipment to miners worldwide. Commodity prices collapsed, demand dried up, and the overhang of barely used equipment pressured sales for years.Indeed, Caterpillar's Resource Industries segment saw revenue drop by over 70 percent between 2012 and 2016. Operating profit went from over $4 billion to a loss of $1 billion. That business now has recovered - but a $1.6 billion profit in 2018 obviously sits well below early-decade peaks.That volatility explains, at least in part, why Caterpillar stock looks so cheap at the moment. Investors always know Caterpillar is a cyclical play, but the roller-coaster ride of this decade remains fresh in their memories. In theory, a cyclical stock should see its earnings multiple expand at the bottom as was the case in 2016 when savvy investors started buying CAT stock ahead of its rebound.Of course, that also means multiples should contract at the top, and it's the fear that we indeed are at, or near, the top that explains why the CAT stock price sits at barely 10x 2019 earnings per share. The Cycle Weighs on Caterpillar StockTo be sure, there are some company-specific factors as well. Caterpillar cited a $70 million direct impact from tariffs just in the first quarter, and trade war fears no doubt have weighed on CAT. Like other American firms including Deere, 3M (NYSE:MMM), and even Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the company also cited market share struggles in the Chinese market.But China only accounts for roughly 10% of Caterpillar revenue. Potential market share issues in one region don't offset the fact that Caterpillar earnings have soared - or that the company seems to be performing exceedingly well everywhere else.CAT's cheap multiple is a function primarily of cyclical worries. To be sure, it's not alone. Banks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) look cheap. Homebuilders Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), too, trade at single-digit multiples, even after solid YTD rallies.Investors in these stocks, and in Caterpillar, are looking to ahead to looming trouble. That might be a trade war. It might just be the natural end of a U.S. economic expansion heading into its eleventh year. Caterpillar is a more global play. Over half of its sales come from outside North America, but the logic is the same. A slowdown is coming and investors don't want to own the stocks most likely to be affected. The Bet on CAT StockAnd so investors aren't really focused on 2019 results and they're not going to be. An extra dime or two in 2019 EPS doesn't matter much, if at all, if those earnings start declining in 2020 anyhow. UBS (NYSE:UBS) made that case last week, cutting its CAT stock price target to $115 while projecting a decrease in earnings next year.That's the problem for Caterpillar stock right now: there's not much Caterpillar can really do. It's cut costs so significantly of late that there's probably less room to react if sales do start turning negative. What growth it does muster in 2019 could well be overshadowed, or ignored, amid fears of what comes next. Moreso than other cyclicals, CAT is going to be held hostage to the broader sentiment toward the global economy.Of course, that's precisely what makes CAT so interesting, particularly near YTD lows. There is a nice case here for the stock. As Dana Blankenhorn pointed out last month, CAT is an attractive pick for income investors. The dividend already yields 3.3%, and Caterpillar management has promised further hikes going forward.Those hikes are presumably dependent on some degree of cooperation from the broader economy, but at least for now the dividend is well-covered.But even a 4% dividend isn't quite enough to turn bullish. An investor has to trust the global economy to go long CAT, even at these levels. And if an investor does see global macro worries as overdone, there are few better plays than Caterpillar stock.Another leg up in the global economy and particularly in demand for commodities like minerals, oil and natural gas would allow earnings to keep growing. CAT's earnings multiple likely would expand as well thanks to increased investor confidence. It's not unreasonable in that scenario to see Caterpillar stock clearing $200, something like 14-15x adjusted EPS of $14-$15. For what it's worth, the high Wall Street target price is exactly $200.It's not quite that simple but it's close. CAT is a bet on the global economy being better than feared. It's not a bet I'm quite willing to take but I can see why other investors might.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-06-11	2019-06-11 15:06:51	MMM	3M Company	With or Without DuPont, DOW Stock Is Almost Too Complicated	It wasn't a big surprise at all when chemical manufacturer Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW) split off from the organization formerly known as DowDuPont. Announced last year, the massive conglomerate would form three separate entities: DOW, DuPont (NYSE:DD) and Corteva (NYSE:CTVA). Moreover, the general consensus was that DOW stock, along with the other two names, would perform better individually.Source: Roy Luck via Flickr (modified)The principle idea behind this strategy is simple for anyone to appreciate. As a combined entity, DowDuPont was incredibly confusing and convoluted, similar to General Electric (NYSE:GE). And as you can tell from GE's technical chart, very few people today value large, aimless companies. The emphasis now is on agility, something that Dow Inc stock lacked when tethered to unrelated businesses like Corteva's agriculture.So far, though, that &quot;untethering&quot; thesis is on shaky ground. Sure, DOW stock is up nearly 8% in June. However, shares have crumbled since mid-April. Despite the strong start to the month, DOW is still about 14% shy of returning to its closing high.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows However, optimists might note that Dow Inc stock suffered from the same pressures as everyone else; namely, geopolitical tensions with China. Of course, the situation currently looks terrible, with both sides not willing to concede an inch.That said, the smart money would eventually go toward a resolution between the No. 1 and No. 2 economies. After all, prolonged tensions do neither side any good.Additionally, the Trump administration's hard-nosed act could be just that, an act. It wouldn't be the first time that the President said one thing and did another. And if we did get that resolution, DOW stock would presumably jump higher.Still, I wouldn't get too excited about Dow Inc stock yet. DOW Stock Is a Complicated InvestmentA cute peculiarity of the DowDuPont breakup is that DOW stock replaced the former in the Dow Jones index. Thus, we have DOW in the Dow.Its inclusion also made sense because the venerable index maintains exposure to the materials sector. Fair enough. But increasingly, it's becoming clear that the markets don't favor big, complicated organizations with broad and disparate reach.We just need to look at the Dow Jones' recent history to confirm this sentiment. Dow Inc stock being listed into the index was the first shakeup since General Electric was kicked out. And what is General Electric but the mother of all complicated organizations?Sure, GE has slimmed down with its own divestments and spinoffs, but it's still confusing relative to modern organizations. I believe that's still the key risk associated with DOW stock.Because let's not overlook what's right in front of our face. Despite the much-covered DowDuPont breakup, Dow Inc stock doesn't provide a clean, linear path. Instead, the underlying company is stretched wide, featuring businesses in consumer products, packaging, industrial materials, large-scale infrastructures and technology.From a topical perspective, the separation into three entities streamlined operations for the individual cogs. Somewhat left out in the equation was that the individual cogs also have non-intuitive structures.Rather than a DOW in the Dow being a positive, it seems like an omen. That's because the Dow Jones has repeatedly kicked out or obstructed these yesteryear organizations. The ones that are still holding on are likely on their last leg.For instance, I thought a jack-of-all-trades company like 3M (NYSE:MMM) offered a contrarian play for its broad industry coverage. I was dead wrong. And I'm concerned the same fate awaits DOW stock: the markets just don't like these types of investments anymore. Don't Hold Your Breath on China or Even MexicoIn order to really see positive sentiment drive Dow Inc stock, speculators must hope for a big news item. A resolution to the U.S.-China trade war, along with normalizing relations with Mexico would do the trick.However, I wouldn't hold my breath on either event. First, I don't think the Chinese are really interested in a trade resolution. From day one, China sought to leapfrog the U.S. as the undisputed technological leader. That's why the Chinese committed brazen acts of corporate espionage. It's the quickest and dirtiest way to accomplish their goals.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Look at it this way: what would a trade deal imply for the Chinese? At the very least, it would mean that they must play by the rules. Ultimately, they'll never go for that because it necessarily means that China plays second fiddle to the U.S.As far as Mexico goes, a truce currently exists: Mexico agreed to impose tighter migrant controls in exchange for a tariff-free relationship with the U.S. But it's a very unsettling one, with Trump able to pull the plug if he doesn't like what he sees. My bet is that he doesn't. That also means we may not have a decisive catalyst for Dow stock for quite some time.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

He concluded that, despite 3M's shrinking profits, MMM stock might be a falling knife worth catching. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBrumley believes the things that ail MMM aren't insurmountable and that MMM stock price has been beaten down due to noise and fear. It's hard to argue with his rationale.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% MMM stock has fallen 25% in the past six weeks since announcing weaker-than-expected Q1 2019 earnings, lower guidance for the remainder of 2019, and the cutting of 2,000 jobs. But since the Q1 earnings were released, there's been little new information to justify the ongoing bloodletting iof 3M stock. MMM now yields 3.61%, a very healthy return for anyone looking for dividend stocks to buy. While I believe 3M stock is an excellent long-term investment, I also think that investors looking for high dividends can find better stocks to buy.Here are two possible ideas. Synovus Financial (NYSE:SNV)Currently yielding 3.66%, the Georgia regional bank has fallen 2.65% in 2019. Recently, Synovus named Jamie Gregory, a Regions Bank (NYSE:RF) executive vice president and head of corporate financial strategy, as its new CFO, replacing Kevin Blair, who was promoted to COO in December. Gregory  has a strong background in corporate finance, which is critical in a highly competitive industry. Not only that, but he brings an understanding of community banking to Synovus. In the first quarter, Synovus's adjusted earnings per share grew by 7.6% sequentially and 15.5% on a year- over-year basis. Its adjusted efficiency ratio, which shows how efficiently the bank operated in the quarter, was 50.24%, 7.18 percentage points lower than a year ago. Lower is always good when it comes to this metric.Thanks to SNV's acquisition of FCB Financial Holdings, the owner of the Florida Community Bank, in January,  Synovus added more than $9 billion in loans to its portfolio, which stood just shy of $36 billion at the end of March. As the south continues to grow, so, too, will Synovus. Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY)Currently yielding 3.51%, the New York-based pharmaceutical company on Apr. 25 released better-than-expected Q1  earnings, which temporarily put some air under BMY stock. But it has since fallen back towards the mid-$40s. Bristol-Myers' first-quarter earnings per share came in at $1.10, 17% higher than a year earlier and one penny better than analysts' average estimate. On the top line, its revenue was $5.92 billion, 14% higher than a year earlier, and $170 million higher than analysts' consensus outlook. On June 5, Bristol-Myers announced the leadership team that will run the company once it completes its $74-billion acquisition of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) later this year. In a key move, its research and development will be divided into an early- phase development team and a late-phase development team, with a Celgene executive handling the early-phase development group and a former Novartis (NYSE:NVS) executive running the late-phase development efforts. Celgene CFO David Elkins will replace Bristol Myer's CFO Charles Bancroft, who is retiring. Current BMY CEO Giovanni Caforio will run the combined business.Look for several of Celgene's drugs that are now in the pipeline to get FDA approval later this year and into 2020.

2019-06-04	2019-06-04 12:12:49	MMM	3M Company	3M Stock May Be a Falling Knife Worth Catching	The past month hasn't been a particularly enjoyable one for the owners of 3M (NYSE:MMM) stock. In the latter part of April, the highly-diversified company cautioned that weakness in China would take a toll on its 2019 bottom line, and just a couple of weeks ago, an analyst warned the dividend that had made MMM stock a hero to income-minded investors was in jeopardy.Source: Shutterstock All told, the 27% dip in the 3M stock price since Apr. 25 makes superficial sense. Under the surface, though, the depth of the selloff of MMM stock may not hold up to scrutiny.  * 6 Big Dividend Stocks to Buy as Yields Plunge Buying 3M stock looks tantamount to catching a falling knife, with no assurance any rebound will take shape now, if at all. For an investor with a little money to play with and a willingness to keep MMM stock on a short leash though, the shares look interesting now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips An Analyst's Take on MMM StockWriting about the dividend of 3M stock in mid-May, J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa stated, &quot;Another leg down in fundamentals would mean they are on watch for a cut, after 37 straight years of increase.&quot;A year ago, such a development would have been unthinkable. Many of the old-guard names have already taken such a step, however. General Electric (NYSE:GE) started to pare back its payout in 2017, and more than a little legitimate-sounding dividend-cut chatter has plagued the likes of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and AT&T (NYSE:T) for awhile now. So a dividend cut by 3M somehow doesn't seem out of the question.It's not just the dividend Tusa is concerned about, however. He's also worried about the bigger picture. He wrote,&quot;While there are clearly some cyclical forces at play, we continue to believe the secular story, while less readily apparent, is challenged. This late in the cycle, defense growth garners an appropriate premium, and here we see neither defense, nor growth.&quot;Tusa concludes of MMM stock that &quot;premium valuation is unjustified by undifferentiated fundamentals.&quot; Numerical RealityIt's entirely possible he's right. But, it's also entirely possible Tusa is overdoing it by giving MMM stock an &quot;underweight&quot; rating.As of the latest look, the analyst community is, on average, modeling earnings of $9.52 per share of 3M stock for the current fiscal year, down decidedly from last year's $10.46 on what should be a very slight drop in revenue. Weakness in China and other overseas markets are taking a bigger bite out of profits than sales, and with no end to the trade war in sight, investors have easily been led to assume the worst.The dividend, however, isn't in the deep jeopardy that's been implied.Over the course of the past four quarters, 3M has dished out total dividends of $5.52 per share. For the next four years, analysts, on average, are calling for a total payout of $5.76 per share of MMM stock. That still leaves a cushion in excess of $3.70 per share between the company's anticipated EPS and its expected dividend in 2019. That spread should widen again in 2020.But the amount of income the company will be able to retain for itself and invest in its future growth will be lower than in the past. Tusa is also worried about growing legal liabilities that may &quot;significantly weigh on capital deployment capabilities - which has historically largely driven EPS growth.&quot;The organization has finally begun cutting costs, though. After releasing last quarter's disappointing results and equally disappointing outlook, 3M announced it would lay 2000 employees off. The Bottom Line on MMM StockNone of this serves as a guarantee that 3M won't cut its dividend. But, given the unlikelihood of that development in addition to the steep, exaggerated selloff MMM stock price has suffered over the course of the past five weeks, MMM stock is an interesting contrarian pickup at this point.Many analysts don't disagree. Despite the spate of bad news and the subsequent streak of downgrades, the professionals still sport a consensus price target on 3M stock of $188. That's 17% better than the  current MMM stock price, which has been beaten down mostly by noise and fear.Nothing ailing 3M right now is insurmountable, and almost all of its problems are finally being addressed.MMM stock may be a knife worth trying to catch.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-29	2019-05-29 16:40:15	MMM	3M Company	7 Stocks to Sell After Earnings Destroyed Their Long-Term Stories	Investors sometimes complain about quarterly earnings. The argument is that the short-term focus on three-month periods forces publicly traded companies to lose their long-term focus. Decision-making is impaired as companies try to beat Wall Street estimates for each quarter instead of taking the long view. This can turn once-solid companies into stocks to sell over time.In this market, the &quot;short-termism&quot; argument falls a bit flat. The likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been rewarded by investors for investing in the near term to increase long-term profits.Still, it's true that investors can overreact to a single quarter. A modest earnings beat or a few million dollars in extra sale don't always change the long-term investment case. At the same time, sometimes a quarter matters. Sometimes, performance over three months can change the story for years to come.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June For these seven companies, recent earnings reports mattered -- and that's not good news. These aren't necessarily the seven stocks that fell the most after earnings. But among mid-caps and large-caps, they're the seven whose stories took the biggest hit and they're the seven stocks to sell now. Each of these stocks fell sharply during earnings season, and each of these stocks may have a difficult time bouncing back any time soon. Stamps.com (STMP)Online postage provider Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) hasn't just seen its story change after earnings. Its story has broken.For some time, short sellers had argued that STMP was due for a precipitous fall once its exclusive contract with the United States Postal Service was inevitably altered. They've been proven absolutely right. STMP lost its contract in February, news which sent the stock down by more than 50%.Three months later, in its first quarter report, Stamps.com slashed full-year EPS guidance from $5.15 to $6.15 to $3.35 to $4.85. STMP dropped another 56%, far and away the worst post-earnings decline of any widely held stock. The stock has continued to fall since. It's now down 86% over the last year, and has lost 78% of its value in 2019 alone. According to data cited by Bloomberg, STMP is the first stock since at least 2001 to fall 50% after earnings following two consecutive quarters.STMP stock does look cheap, at a little over 10x the low end of 2019 EPS guidance. But with the business model in upheaval, profits plunging, and investor confidence shattered, it should be cheap. And it will likely stay that way for some time until it can right the ship. 3M (MMM)Source: Shutterstock 3M (NYSE:MMM) is not the kind of company that makes this list very often, if ever. The diversified industrial manufacturer generally has been a stable grower. It's a Dow Jones component. Economic cycles have their say, but the century-old company has made its way through plenty of booms and busts.But the company's Q1 report does put 3M on this list -- and near the top. MMM stock fell some 13% after missing estimates and cutting its full-year outlook. The decline was so steep it took nearly 200 points off the Dow Jones Index. The response wasn't based just on the fundamentals, either.3M's CEO admitted that &quot;we're behind the curve&quot; in responding to lower volumes. An aggressive layoff plan suggests that management -- looking forward -- might not see demand returning. Meanwhile, weakness was concentrated in two key markets -- automotive and China -- which may not be on the way back soon. (In the case of automotive, there are long-running worries that demand may have peaked for good.)On this site, both Will Healy and Josh Enomoto have recommended that investors buy the dip. Both authors make intriguing cases. But MMM has kept falling after the earnings report: it's now down about 25% from pre-earnings levels. Analysts, including Stephen Tusa, who was dead on in forecasting the long fall of General Electric (NYSE:GE), remain bearish. Trade war impacts could add further pressure. To me, it's a stock to sell, not buy.  * 4 Consumer Staples Stocks for Both Income and Growth This isn't a case of investors reacting to a single quarter. They're reacting to what the quarter means. And what it means is that 3M has fallen behind and has roadblocks in its path toward catching up. Nordstrom (JWN)Source: Shutterstock Retailer Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) only fell about 9% after disappointing Q1 earnings this week. In terms of the one-day decline, JWN is hardly one of the worst performers after earnings.But the Q1 report is more problematic for JWN than the market's single-day response might suggest. First, JWN shares had steadily drifted downward heading into the report. In fact, save for a very brief dip in 2016, the stock already was at an eight-year low. Expectations were modest heading into the report -- and Nordstrom still couldn't deliver.The second, broader, issue is that Nordstrom now looks like a business headed for a decline. Mall stocks in general have had a rough go of it lately, but even by those standards, JWN has underperformed. And once the narrative around a stock turns to whether earnings are done for good, it becomes a stock to sell. We've seen that with retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), Tuesday Morning (NASDAQ:TUES) and Pier 1 Imports (NYSE:PIR).Investors might retort that Nordstrom isn't part of that group -- but that's the point. The bull case for JWN -- and the reason it cleared $65 as recently as early November -- was that its brand kept it immune from some of the challenges facing physical retailers. What's clear at the moment is that investors no longer believe that to be the case. Once that narrative takes hold, in the days of Amazon, it's very difficult for retailers to convince investors otherwise. Lowe's Companies (LOW)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)To be clear, all is not lost for Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW), even after a disappointing first quarter report. A 12% post-earnings decline certainly wasn't welcomed by shareholders. But LOW stock still is positive YTD. Same-store sales still rose 3.5% year-over-year in Q1. The midpoint of fiscal 2019 (ending January 2020) EPS guidance implies adjusted EPS should rise about 9% this year.But the first quarter report is a big hit to the narrative behind LOW. As James Brumley pointed out in early March, LOW had outperformed Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stock over the past year -- a notable reversal from LOW's historic second-place status. A new CEO, new strategies, and a rationalized footprint seemed set to make Lowe's a more viable competitor to its larger rival.Lowe's did take some share from Home Depot in the quarter: its 3.5% comp outpaced HD's 3% print. But a huge compression in gross margin suggests that Lowe's bought some of those extra revenues. And a substantial earnings miss suggests Lowe's paid too much in the process.  * 4 Drug and Health Stocks Pushing Higher  Again, LOW isn't headed to the list of retailers facing bankruptcy risk. But the rally in LOW stock over the past year-plus was based on the idea that it had room for improvement, and the ability to narrow the gap with Home Depot. Q1 numbers and FY19 guidance both undercut that narrative -- which is why Lowe's stock has fallen so hard. Tesla (TSLA)Source: Shutterstock For Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the earnings report itself wasn't really the biggest problem of earnings season. Certainly, the headline numbers missed badly, though CEO Elon Musk already had warned that the quarter would be tough. TSLA stock, however, didn't fall that far after the report, with investors giving the company the benefit of the doubt.The step-down in US tax credits and the demand spike that accompanied the initial launch of the Model 3 both benefited results in the second half of 2018 -- and likely provided headwinds to sales in Q1. Tesla reaffirmed full-year guidance for deliveries, and that seemed to settle investors' nerves.It didn't last, though, for one key reason. Any investor willing to give Tesla a pass for the first quarter had to have some level of trust in the company. Over the last few weeks, that trust has eroded. And what originally looked like a one-quarter problem increasingly looks like a harbinger of permanently lower demand.Analysts have turned sharply negative. Musk's claims that a &quot;robotaxi&quot; service would make Tesla cars worth $250,000 each -- and make Tesla a $500 billion company -- have been dismissed. As Wayne Duggan wrote, investors now are ignoring Elon Musk. In that context, the reaffirmed guidance isn't evidence that demand will return. Instead, it looks more like yet another broken promise.TSLA stocks continue to slide, touching another new low on Friday. The narrative here clearly has reversed dramatically since earnings, and I wouldn't bet on Musk to fix that problem. In fact, I continue to bet that he won't. Even if you don't want to make a bearish bet, Tesla is still one of the stocks to sell now. Overstock.com (OSTK)Source: Shutterstock For Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK), too, the actual earnings report wasn't the biggest reason OSTK is on this list of stocks to sell. In fact, Overstock's Q1 actually wasn't that bad. OSTK stock jumped after revenue beat estimates and the company raised Adjusted EBITDA guidance for its retail business.The gains didn't hold: OSTK sits near a three-year low. And like with TSLA, the problem is clear: trust. As I wrote in early March, Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne had lost the faith of investors. An investment from GSR Capital, announced back in August, was supposed to be $400 million; per the Q1 conference call, GSR is putting in just $5 million. The retail business was going to be sold, so Overstock could focus on its blockchain businesses. That hasn't happened. tZERO tokens issued by Overstock's subsidiary are trading at a fraction of their value.It was Q4 earnings last year that turned me solidly against the bull case for OSTK. Q1 earnings -- while above expectations -- don't change that problem. The retail business still is unprofitable, with little sign for improvement. The blockchain efforts seem to be fizzling out. And on top of it all, Byrne went and sold 500,00 shares of stock at an average price around $13. That sale -- near the lows -- sent OSTK shares down another 15%. The CEO followed up with a somewhat angry statement to shareholders defending his sale and vowing not &quot;to ever give such an explanation again&quot;.  * Marijuana Stocks: Catch the Next Hot Pot Stock Before It 'Jumps' Without Byrne as a visionary, and without progress in blockchain, Overstock.com is just a struggling and unprofitable online retailer. That's not enough, even at a multi-year low. This one is solidly on our list of stocks to sell. Aphria (APHA)Source: Shutterstock Cannabis stocks like Aphria (NYSE:APHA) are going to see quite a bit of volatility, so a bounce back wouldn't be a surprise. Indeed, APHA shares are up 9% in early trading Friday following an upgrade from Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).But Aphria's fiscal Q3 report last month was concerning. APHA shares dropped 12% and kept falling. Before Friday's bounce, they were trading near 2019 lows -- and dramatically underperforming other pot plays like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Hexo (NYSEAMERICAN:HEXO).As I wrote at the time, the declines made some sense. Aphria took a quick writedown of assets in Latin America -- assets a short seller report had said were largely worthless. Aphria has disputed that contention, but admitted that key executives hadn't disclosed conflicts of interest. Growth looked impressive, but came largely from the acquisition of a lower-margin distribution business. The legacy business actually had a disappointing quarter, the key reason why results missed Street estimates.To be sure, there's still a bull case for APHA, as I wrote this week. If new management hits new targets, Aphria stock is going to rise. But like so many stocks on the list, the earnings report broke investors' trust. And in the market, as in life, it's difficult to get that back.As of this writing, Vince Martin has a bearish options position in TSLA. He has no positions in any other securities mentioned.

2019-05-29	2019-05-29 14:45:44	MMM	3M Company	What Do the Charts Say About General Electric Stock?	Shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) have been holding their ground so far in 2019. GE stock, which was suffering from a precipitous decline going into the end of 2018, has drawn interest from retail investors for a long time. That's because for many years GE was an American industrial icon.Source: Shutterstock The power, energy, aerospace and consumer-staples sectors all used products with the well-known &quot;GE&quot; logo. Mismanagement, poor acquisitions, pension obligations and low-quality cash flows ultimately led to GE's demise, though. These issues were slowly (and rather painfully) uncovered as investors began to realize what the cash-flow statements and balance sheet were suggesting.GE stock entered 2017 at almost $30 a share. In December 2018, it hit a low near $6.50 and ultimately fell more than 75% from peak to trough.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June What do the charts of GE stock suggest now? Trading General Electric StockIf investors bought General Electric stock back in December, they're doing quite well. But even that massive rally -- during which GE stock jumped some 70% -- wasn't enough to propel GE out of its downtrend. As you can see on the daily chart above, GE continues to squeeze lower.The 200-day moving average isn't doing GE stock  any favors, and GE  is now below all three major moving averages. We've flagged $9 as support a few times, a level that has now held through two earnings reports. But as GE's highs continue to drop, this $9 level is starting to look suspect.If GE stock can't bounce back over its major moving averages and eventually exceed its downtrend resistance, its support could be in jeopardy. If $9 doesn't hold, sub-$8 prices don't seem unreasonable, particularly if sentiment towards GE stock sours as well.A similar scene is playing out on the weekly chart, as shown below.On this chart, downtrend resistance is much more prominent. A series of purple arrows highlights the &quot;lower highs&quot; theme we've seen playing out for some time now. Like the 200-day moving average, the 50-week moving average is still providing stiff resistance. While the 10-week moving average had been a support level from January through March, it has wavered over the past seven weeks. Last week, it gave way, and a test of $9 would not be surprising now.GE stock has &quot;descending triangle&quot; written all over it. That is, the stock is making continuously lower highs and moving ever closer towards its support level. If GE stock closes below $9, it will deal a big blow to the bulls. If General Electric stock closes over $10.40-$10.50, a lot of the recent damage could be repaired, potentially sparking a rally by GE. The Bottom Line on GE StockJPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa has very closely followed GE stock, and he's made some very good calls on it. He was the first to downgrade GE to &quot;sell&quot; and rode it all the way lower until December. That's when he raised his &quot;sell&quot; rating to a &quot;hold,&quot; but maintained his $6 price target. Tusa questioned where all the optimism was coming from and remains highly skeptical about General Electric stock.In April Tusa went back to a &quot;sell &quot;rating, cutting his price target on GE stock to $5 from $6. On May 1, he said the company's first-quarter earnings results were &quot;far from a disaster,&quot; which may seem encouraging, but he also said they were &quot;far from a blowout.&quot;So where are we now? I've been following the action of GE stock, and it's telling me one thing: General Electric is a &quot;show-me&quot; stock. Meaning,  GE needs to prove that it's got its groove back, and it is not worthy of benefit-of-the-doubt treatment. It doesn't help that Honeywell (NYSE:HON), 3M Co (NYSE:MMM), and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) are all better companies and have been under pressure lately as well.On Wednesday, GE CEO Larry Culp reiterated the company's forecast for up to $2 billion of negative free cash flow (FCF) this year and flat  FCF in 2020. That has done little to instill confidence in GE stock lately, even though that type of outlook has boosted GE stock in the past. The failure of General Electric stock to rally on the guidance reiteration  makes me confident about avoiding the name for now,  even if I miss some gains as a result.Watch how GE handles $9. If it falls below that level,  it's in trouble. But if GE stock overcomes its resistance, it may be worth buying.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-05-22	2019-05-22 18:45:16	MMM	3M Company	3 Stocks to Buy for Safety in the Trade War	Are you looking for stocks to buy, but yearning for protection from the trade war? A trio of long stock positions in Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) and CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), which offer diversity and the common thread of bear-bucking relative strength, may be the answer. Let me explain.To say the least, the trade war between China and the U.S. has been a tiring undercurrent in the realm of investing. And there's no telling what's next between the two countries. Nor do we really know what impact this economic tangle may have on a broad mix of publicly-traded stocks ranging from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to 3M (NYSE:MMM) to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).The good news is there are still many stocks to buy with less risk tied to any future trade deals or even continued escalation between the world's two largest economies. Roku, Chipotle and CyberArk fit this mold.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 7 Best Stocks to Buy From the IPO ETF And of benefit to bullish investors, ROKU, CMG and CYBR are also leading the way higher through the market's daily headline-driven cheers and jeers tied to the trade war. What's more, these 3 stocks are poised for continued success off and on the price charts and look like prime stocks to buy today. Roku (ROKU)  Click to EnlargeROKU is the first of our stocks to buy. Roku is the market's largest over-the-top streaming content provider. And if the company's recent all-around, solid-looking earnings and sales beat and very bullish reaction from Wall Street are any indication, investors haven't seen anything yet.Bottom line, with a market capitalization that's still just under $10 billion, it's not hard to understand the huge upside potential in this market-leading growth stock. Furthermore and on the price chart, it's equally easy to see, in a universe of stocks to buy, why ROKU remains compelling.With shares narrowly breaking out of a small flat base of several days in duration as of Tuesday's close, ROKU is in position for buying right now. I'd set an initial stop-loss at $77. The exit is slightly beneath the congestion pattern and prior highsThere's a bit of trend-line and Fibonacci risk in-between $88 to $95. But with the psychologically appealing $100 level just a stone's throw away and a growth stock known for its volatility, $103 to $105 looks about right for taking initial profits. Chipotle (CMG)  Click to EnlargeThe second of our stocks to buy is CMG. For a company which makes healthy eating fast, easy and affordable, it's amazing how Wall Street continues to pooh-pooh Chipotle's business wherewithal. In fact, the current analyst consensus is a hold on shares with a median target roughly 6% below the current price.But that bearish view may be missing the big picture as CMG stock continues to move successfully past its well-publicized health scares which rocked shares for a couple years. As well, other investors are rightfully buying shares right now.Following a late April earnings beat and seven plus weeks of trading in a constructive, mostly lateral basing pattern, CMG stock broke out Monday.Currently, with shares less than 7% from their 2015 all-time-highs and a period where Chipotle enjoyed a sizzling romance with Wall Street, getting in front of a sell-side community known for changing its tune makes CMG a stock to buy today.For Chipotle positioning I'd recommend investors wait for shares to re-cross the pattern breakout of $721.42. This amounts to a second attempt style entry which allows for an additional layer of price confirmation and reduced chance of buying a false breakout.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Anxious Investors For containing risk, an initial stop-loss within congestion but below the key $700 level which also cuts exposure down to about 3% looks like a smart way to position long in Chipotle stock. CyberArk (CYBR)  Click to EnlargeThe third in our list of stocks to buy is Israel-based CyberArk. The security software outfit has been a top growth stock in 2019 with shares hitting fresh all-time-highs and quickly approaching a double in price.And there's reasons for investors to be excited given the company's standout quarterly results earlier this month and relative insulation from the trade war between China and U.S. Now there's additional evidence on the price chart for making CYBR a stock to buy today.In Wednesday's session shares of CyberArk are trading at fresh highs after breaking out of a short and irregular two-plus week pullback pattern. With today's reaction also pushing above last week's volatile earnings-driven aftermath beset by profit-taking, the move to fresh highs is impressive.Still, CYBR is volatile and those swings shouldn't be discounted after what's been a very friendly trend and admittedly, a stochastics set-up which appears to be cautioning against bullish bets.My recommendation for this sort of situation is to buy shares and hope for the best. That's not to say investors should leave this stock to buy open to increased risks of failure. Instead, when purchasing CYBR make sure to use CyberArk's options market to contain exposure using any number of limited and reduced risk strategies which fit your expectations.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-05-10	2019-05-10 15:16:47	MMM	3M Company	3 Reasons to Take a Gamble on MMM Stock	As a legacy stalwart, 3M (NYSE:MMM) almost appears destined to follow in the footsteps of other Dow Jones losers. Last year, MMM stock crumbled, shedding 17%. Even worse, 3M rarely looked competitive. This year seemed to hold some promise, with shares up nearly 16% in mid-April compared to the January opener. Then, the company released its first quarter of 2019 earnings results.Source: Dean Hochman via Flickr (Modified)To say that 3M stock stunk up the markets would be an understatement. Prior to the disclosure, covering analysts pegged earnings per share at $2.49. Unfortunately for stakeholders, 3M delivered only $2.23. To make matters worse, this was a far cry from the EPS of $2.50 from the year-ago quarter.Neither did MMM stock recover in the revenue front. The underlying company reported $7.86 million in sales, down significantly from the $8.02 billion consensus target. Again pouring salt on open, festering wounds, 3M rang up $8.28 billion in Q1 2018.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith such terrible print, the only saving grace for 3M stock would have been the forward guidance. But even here, management disappointed. They're now expecting full-year EPS to hit between $9.25 to $9.75. That's a sharp drop from the previous guidance of $10.45 to $10.90.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy on Overcast Days No matter how you look at it, this is a risky story. Still, if you're willing to look at the nuances, MMM stock offers some substance to the contrarian trade. Acelity Takeover a Bright Spot for MMM StockWith 3M stock falling and debt levels rising, the last thing you want to see is management spending large for acquisitions. However, that's exactly what happened a few days ago when 3M bought out Acelity for approximately $6.7 billion. For context, that's the biggest deal in the company's history.More than one analyst has questioned the viability of this move. However, I don't view it as such a bad gig. For starters, the Q1 report revealed that every division within 3M's ranks were duds, except for one: healthcare. Mind you, it wasn't great growth, but it was growth nevertheless.While I'm concerned about the spend -- who isn't? -- at least management is investing in proven winners. Acelity bolsters 3M's already strong presence in wound-care. This buyout alone could make things interesting from a sales-growth perspective.Secondly, healthcare is a diverse market. Some segments are straight-up risky, especially if we have a transition in power in 2020. Other segments, like wound-care, offer an almost-guaranteed path to profitability.For example, experts believe that the North American wound-care market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 7% till 2024. In addition, specific wound-care segments, such as chronic and surgical wounds, offer potentially lucrative revenue channels.Like I said, it's not a perfect situation for MMM stock. But at the very least, management is banking on industries that make sense. Asia Headwinds Are a Temporary Problem for 3M StockYou can't blame any one factor for the Q1 disaster. That said, you can't ignore the giant elephant in the room: the U.S.-China standoff negatively impacted 3M's Asian-market sales.The tit-for-tat lasted for far longer than many political observers anticipated. But because the pain on both sides of the Pacific was so intense, the Trump administration appeared willing to negotiate with its Chinese counterparts.Apparently, that was wishful thinking. In a stunning plot twist, President Donald Trump raised tariffs on roughly $200 billion in Chinese goods from 10% to 25%.Still, with a critical election coming up in 2020, Trump must do everything possible to grow the economy. Therefore, look for a substantive deal with the Chinese eventually, which will benefit 3M stock longer-term. 3M Stock has Relevant ProductsI'll never forget a conversation I had with my friend, who formerly worked in the extermination business. In the era of smartphones and GPS navigation, I questioned why he continued to buy Thomas Guide maps.He answered a question with a question: what happens if your smartphone battery suddenly dies or your car conks out? Do you tick off your clients while scrambling for an excuse? In this case, my friend had a back-up plan ready to go.And that's really one of the ironies of this digital age. As we dive further into the Internet of Things, &quot;analog&quot; products become even more relevant, not less. That's because we can't forget a core tenet of technology: it fails, and usually at the worst time possible.You might laugh at archaic innovations like Post-it Notes. But after all these years, I've never worked in a business that didn't have them. And no computer is worth more than a piece of sticky paper if that computer doesn't work. That's why even if it's risky, MMM stock is worthy of your consideration.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The company, which brands include Post-it notes and Scotch tape, had said on its post-earnings call with analysts that results were negatively impacted throughout the quarter by soft end-market trends in China. The stock has lost 4.7% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 12.8%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9afcd5fe-4527-3595-ad38-8b1177f74590/3m%26apos%3Bs-stock-extends.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-03	2019-05-03 13:27:33	MMM	3M Company	$10 Is a Fair Price for General Electric Stock	The stock market tends to overreact to both news and trends. Up until 2016, the market assumed that General Electric's (NYSE:GE) modestly improving operating results would continue, ignoring mounting problems under the hood. In late 2018, the market went too far in the other direction.Source: Shutterstock After GE stock tumbled from $30 to as low as $6.66, the pendulum swung too far the other way. This set up a huge buying opportunity, with some astute knife-catchers netting quick 50% gains from General Electric. At this point, however, I have to start to wonder if sentiment is getting a little bit too bullish again. All in all, $10 seems like a reasonable price for GE stock, but don't expect more huge upside moves from General Electric anytime soon.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy in May, But Don't Go Away  Tusa Rains on the ParadeStephen Tusa has been GE stock owners' worst nightmare over the past few years. The J.P. Morgan analyst famously went negative on GE stock in May 2016, when it was trading for around $30 per share. Over the years, he's kept making prophetic warnings about the state of General Electric's business.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGiven how rare it is for analysts to take a strongly negative position on a stock and stick with it, Tusa has earned a reputation as a credible analyst. He recently further enhanced his standing  with his prescient bearish call on 3M (NYSE:MMM) stock. 3M tumbled more than 10% - its worst one-day plunge in more than a decade - following its miserable earnings report in April. Tusa saw it coming.In any case, Tusa upgraded General Electric from his long-standing &quot;sell&quot; rating up to &quot;neutral&quot; in December. That closely coincided with GE stock's famous $6.66 bottom. While Tusa still had a lot of questions for General Electric, he thought GE could turn itself around, and GE stock consequently rallied.In April, however, Tusa warned that the turnaround was not going according to plan. Not only did he drop General Electric stock back to &quot;underweight,&quot; but he actually trimmed his price target on GE stock from $6 to $5 per share.He wrote: &quot;We believe many investors are underestimating the severity of the challenges and underlying risks at GE while overestimating the value of small positives.&quot; And Tusa makes some fair points. In particular, even most General Electric bulls will admit that the company's 2019 is shaping up to be underwhelming. GE Stock Will Only Drop to $5 If This HappensA key point in Tusa's bearish thesis is that GE stock can get pulverized if another recession hits before the company can clean up its balance sheet. Tusa accurately warns that the company's debt load is persistently high, while its cash flow generation remains weak. Given General Electric's considerable leverage to the economy, a recession could deliver a killer blow to GE at this point.But the owners of GE stock should relax.  The U.S. probably won't enter a recession for at least a year. Despite all the fretting and panicking that occurred in late 2018, the economy held firm and is now looking up. The recently released GDP results came in above 3%, easily surpassing analysts' consensus outlook.Meanwhile, consumer figures look reasonably strong as well. Sure, there are some relatively weak spots, like autos and housing. On the whole, however, the economy is robust. Additionally, there's still a ton of stimulus in the system from Trump's tax cuts. Throw in the news this week that there appears to be bipartisan support for two trillion dollars of new infrastructure funding, and General Electric should find plenty of fresh contracts and opportunities to pursue.Tusa's point, however, is correct in isolation. The clock is ticking quickly for GE. General Electric needs to clean up its business, pay down its debt, and get its cash flow to more reliable levels. If a recession arrives in the back half of 2019, that would be awful news for General Electric. But that's not a likely scenario. General Electric Is Making ProgressIt's important to remember when considering Tusa's bearish view that General Electric is getting stuff done. In particular, it sold its biopharma operations to Danahar (NYSE:DHR) for a cool $21.4 billion.  Another meaningful move was the merger of its transportation business. It also sold a portion of its lighting business to private equity firms earlier this year, and GE is working on other deals.There have been advances in other areas as well. Other analysts have pointed to decreasing uncertainty about the company's insurance liabilities. Furthermore, the rising stock market should have a favorable impact on GE's pension funding issues. The Verdict on GE StockGeneral Electric didn't collapse in a day. It cratered during the financial crisis due to aggressive credit deals. Even then, it bounced back enough to hide the rot of its core industrial businesses for another decade. With an organization as huge as GE, things don't break all at once.Similarly, General Electric can't be completely fixed in a day, either. CEO Larry Culp has been on the job barely six months. He's already accomplished a lot during his tenure. Bears such as Tusa are right to say that much more needs to be done.But it seems harsh to be cutting the stock's price target at this point, especially since economic conditions remain favorable. That said, bulls may become overly exuberant. General Electric still has to make a lot of progress before it can become a steady blu- chip stock again. At $10, GE stock is fairly priced and balances General Electric's risks and rewards equally.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-29	2019-04-29 12:16:28	MMM	3M Company	3M Stock Is Still Attractive After Earnings Miss	3M (NYSE:MMM) stock plunged in Thursday trading on an earnings miss. MMM stock fell by about 13% as the company's first-quarter results missed analysts' consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The 13% plunge was the largest one-day decline for MMM stock since the 1987 stock-market crash.Source: Shutterstock However, after the drop, the valuation of MMM stock has reached lower-than-average levels. Moreover, the company's extensive record of dividend increases and its continuing innovation should bolster it over the long-term. Given MMM's valuable product lines and its financial stability, the question of whether to buy 3M stock does not come down to if investors should do so, but to when they should buy it  * 7 U.S. Shale Oil Stocks to Buy as Prices Rise  MMM Missed Consensus Estimates by Large AmountsIn the first quarter, 3M earned $2.23 per share of MMM stock. That came in well below analysts'  consensus estimate of $2.50 per share and under the $2.49 per share the company made in the same quarter last year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLikewise, MMM's revenue of $7.86 billion came in $160 million below what analysts, on average,  had expected. It also represents a 5.1% decline from the same quarter last year.3M's product lines go well beyond Post-it Notes and the tape found in desk drawers. MMM also sells products for cleaning, personal health care, home improvement, sports, and other items that consumers use every day. Both individuals and businesses utilize 3M 's products.Despite the nominal strength of the economy, the net income of every division of 3M fell in Q1, and the top line of every segment except health care declined.  The health care division's revenue only increased 0.3%. Moreover, the revenue of the company's U.S. and Asia-Pacific regions dropped. In China, growth in Chinese currency, excluding acquisitions, dropped by 3.6%. In the U.S., MMM's growth fell by a more modest 0.4%. MMM Stock Is Cheap and May Become CheaperNonetheless, InvestorPlace columnist Will Ashworth called MMM an equity to &quot;buy and hold forever.&quot; He may have a point. Despite the company's results, it's still faring much better than GE (NYSE:GE). Also,  the company's 60-year streak of annual dividend increases should remain intact. Even though 3M's profits declined, the company can easily afford to maintain and increase its current annual dividend of $5.76 per share.The question is  whether traders  should buy MMM stock now or wait. Although 3M's profit will probably increase very little this year, analysts, on average, predicts its profits will rise 7% in 2020. Furthermore, even after Thursday's drop, the forward price-earnings ratio of MMM stock come in at about 16.8.That is well below the average of MMM stock over the last five years. It also makes MMM much cheaper than Danaher (NYSE:DHR), another industrial conglomerate. As a result, making an initial purchase of MMM stock might make sense at this point.However,MMM's P/E multiple also remains higher than the low and mid-teen P/E ratios at which 3M stock traded immediately following the financial crisis. It might be a good idea to wait for the stock to reach such valuations again before buying a large amount of MMM. Still, the world has and will continue to benefit from 3M's innovations. Consequently, MMM stock should be bought on the post-earnings  pullback. Final Thoughts on MMM StockAlthough the multiples of MMM stock have been lower in the past, it now trades at levels that will benefit new, long-term investors.However, MMM stock has recovered from more significant downturns. It will more than likely recover from this one too. Investors should also not forget that, despite the fluctuations of MMM stock, the company has increased its annual dividend  for 60 straight years.With the demand for 3M's products poised to continue to grow over the long-term, the question is not whether to buy MMM stock, but when to buy MMM.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

Caterpillar's caution could be more boilerplate than it seems on the surface, and China may not be in the dire straits some investors have been led to believe.That's the long way of saying the pullback may ultimately serve as a good entry point into an underestimated and now undervalued Caterpillar stock, if …InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Quarter in FocusThe broad numbers were solid enough. Sales of $13.47 billion just topped expectations of $13.46 billion, but were up 5% year-over-year. Per-share earnings rolled in at $2.94, up two cents from the year-ago's $2.82, and handily topping analyst estimates of $2.86 per share of CAT stock.It was the fine print that failed to thrill investors. Namely, its overseas business was a letdown. Sales to Latin America's construction customers fell 7%, and Europe-Africa-Middle East constriction business slumped 6%.It was China, though, which makes up roughly one-tenth of Caterpillar's business, that spooked investors. Sales of construction equipment to the world's second-largest economy slumped 4% year-over-year, underscoring the impact of largely unpopular U.S. tariffs on China that have stymied trade between the countries.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt Those tariffs have proven to be a two-way challenge. Tariffs on steel imported from China into the U.S. have kept prices high after they nearly doubled between 2016 and 2018. But, Caterpillar must also still account for fees paid to sell goods in China. The rhetoric in the meantime has evolved into chatter that the tariff war itself has hurt China's economy, crimping demand for heavy construction equipment regardless of its cost.The headwind that's proving problematic for Caterpillar though -- or at least owners of CAT stock -- may be more unique to the company than suggested. Stronger Than It SeemsThe tariffs have worked as planned, to be clear. China is seeing measurable slowdowns of its economic engine, which were meant to bring the country to the negotiation table and ultimately prompt it into lowering admittedly steep tariffs on U.S.-made goods shipped there. Last year's economic growth was the slowest China had seen in decades.The country's hardly been brought to its knees, though, and not every segment of its economy is in trouble.China's manufacturing industry, for instance, returned to growth in March after a four-month hiatus. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index improved from 49.9 to 50.8, and now stands at its highest level since the middle of 2018 when the tariff wars had just begun in earnest.It was artificially induced growth, to be clear. China has introduced stimulus and offered bailouts to critical entities. Nevertheless, those efforts appear to be working.China's headwind also delivered a blow to the nation's construction industry, where Caterpillar was vulnerable. Sales of cranes and excavators improved by more than 60% during January and February though, fueled by its government's stimulus package. Sales of heavy trucks grew 4% in March.  * 10 Dow Jones Stocks Holding the Blue Chip Index Back But, those buyers just weren't buying Caterpillar-made equipment as they had in the recent past. Bottom Line for CAT StockCaterpillar isn't completely alone in its struggle to figure out how to handle its China problem. Water heater company A.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) projects sales in China will slump between 3% and 6% this year, largely leaving the company out of whatever construction and replacement business is being mustered by China's stimulus. Dow mainstay 3M (NYSE:MMM) announced on Thursday it would be cutting 2,000 jobs after falling short of last quarter's earnings estimates, mostly thanks to weakness in sales to China.China isn't universally the liability it's being made out to be, though. It's dented and dinged to be sure, but not down for the count, and not yet past the point of renewed growth.To that end, should the political standoff fueling the trade war abate, CAT stock immediately becomes a compelling investment prospect again. China is already/still doing reasonably well enough. It just needs a good enough reason to consider Caterpillar's wares again.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The direction of the market's undertow, if there is one, remains unclear.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)3M (NYSE:MMM) did more damage than any other name, falling nearly 13% after reporting disappointing first-quarter numbers and ultimately deciding to cull 2000 jobs to adjust for a poor outlook. Nokia (NYSE:NOK) wasn't far behind with more than an 8% stumble though, after swinging to a surprising first-quarter loss.There were some winners, though not as many, and no major names made meaningful gains. New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV) jumped more than 5% yesterday on news surrounding its new Marley-branded CBD drink, but NBEV shares gave back more than 2% in yesterday's after-hours trading.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Automation Stocks to Buy for the 21st Century None of them are great trading prospects headed into the final trading day of the week though. Rather, it's the stock charts of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) that have earned closer looks. ConocoPhillips (COP)Back on April 12, ConocoPhillips was put under the trading microscope as a potentially bearish candidate. A major floor was being tested, repeatedly, but more than that COP stock was logging more lower highs thanks to increasing resistance at key moving average lines. Most noteworthy of all was that ConocoPhillips was being left out of a rally most other energy names were enjoying.As of Wednesday, that support line has been snapped. As of Thursday, the bears put some distance between that floor and COP stock.  Click to Enlarge  * The big line in the sand is right at $65, plotted with a red dashed line on both stock charts. Although shares had been lower since that floor was defined, that's the low that has been found the most since the middle of last year.  * Bolstering the bearish tide is the volume behind it. The weekly chart's Chaikin line has already crossed below zero, which tends to be a good signal of a sizeable pullback.  * It's subtle, to the point of being mostly overlooked. But, as of Thursday's action, all four key moving average lines are sloped downward, pointing to the depth of the bearish momentum now in place. MGM Resorts International (MGM)In January, MGM Resorts popped out of a well-defined downtrend. Although the effort continued to get traction for a few more days, that move was ultimately unwound -- and then some -- in February and March.The bulls appear to have regrouped since then, pushing the stock back above all the key moving average lines. It's this second effort, in fact, that largely seals the deal on the bigger rebound effort. The key is the interplay of those moving averages.  * 5 Cheap Energy Stocks to Buy Under $10   Click to Enlarge  * This week's triggering event is the move back above the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts.  * Also, take note of the way the moving average lines are starting to converge again after a big bearish divergence last year. The impending bullish crosses of those moving average lines are buying triggers in and of themselves.  * The clincher for the budding rebound effort would be a break above $27.96, plotted with a red dashed line on the daily chart. That's where MGM has peaked a couple of times since last week.  * Although compelling, the budding renewal of the breakout so far lacks volume. If the volume is still light after any move above $28, close caution remains advised. AbbVie (ABBV)With just a quick glance, AbbVie looks like it's in serious trouble. Shares have been trending steadily lower since April, and are within easy reach of new 52-week lows … again.ABBV stock may be better positioned for a rebound than it seems on the surface, however. While there's still some significant work that needs to be done to snap AbbVie out of its bearish rut, a great deal of the needed hard work has already been done.  Click to Enlarge  * The game-changer here is the horizontal support that has developed around $77 over the course of the past few months. That floor is plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts.  * Curiously, although it has not helped make much forward progress, the past three days have not only been bullish, they've been on above-average volume. The bulls may be testing the waters.  * From here, ABBV will need to hurdle the falling resistance line that tags all the key highs going back to May of last year. That line is plotted in light blue on both stock charts, and currently rests at $85.60.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Industrial investors had seemingly decided worries about a peak in growth and profits were overblown, aided by impressively robust and well-rounded results out of Honeywell International Inc. and United Technologies Corp. Consider that 3M was up about 15 percent year to date heading into its earnings report despite lowering its outlook in January.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-spoils-industrial-growth-party-143246397.html?.tsrc=rss

Last year, 3M stock tumbled almost 17%, including its dividend payout. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors started to wonder if 3M was going to be broken up into smaller, more manageable pieces like General Electric (NYSE:GE) and multiple other industrial conglomerates.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before They Give Back 2019 Gains Wisely, 3M stayed the course, opting to retain all of its divisions. As the company prepares to report its first-quarter earnings tomorrow before the markets open, here's why owners of 3M stock shouldn't worry, regardless of what the results reveal. What's ExpectedI'm only going to summarize the expectations for 3M's earnings because I'm more interested in conveying why the glass is more than half-full for 3M stock in 2019 and beyond. According to Yahoo Finance, analysts on average expect the company's earnings to come in at $2.49 per share  of MMM stock, and the consensus outlook for the top line is $8.02 billion. If the consensus estimates prove to be correct,  its EPS will be flat year-over-year, and its revenue will have fallen 3.1% YoY. While that's not very inspiring growth, the company is expected to generate more than $33 billion of revenue and more than $10 per share of profit. Analysts Are on the Fence on 3M StockAnalysts are on the fence when it comes to 3M stock. Four have a &quot;strong buy&quot; rating on MMM stock, three have a &quot;buy,&quot; seven have a &quot;hold&quot; rating, and four analysts have &quot;underperform&quot; or &quot;sell&quot; ratings on the shares. So, seven analysts believe 3M stock is a buy, and four believe 3M is a sell, while the other seven can't make up their minds. However, analysts on average expect the company's top line to increase 7.9% in 2020. That's 1.31 percentage points higher than the company's average growth rate over the last five years of 6.6%. One more point: When the company last reported its earnings in January, it beat analysts' consensus estimate for both revenues and earnings, the only quarter in 2018 in which it it managed to do so. As a result, I think that 3M could beat expectations again tomorrow. But if it doesn't, I wouldn't worry about it. Here's why.  A Unique ConglomerateMost of the big conglomerates that are breaking themselves up into smaller pieces have done so because their individual businesses are more valuable on their own than as part of a larger company. However, 3M uses its conglomerate structure to share technology, innovation, and research and development. As a result, its large size makes it more valuable because it's able to distribute its resources across its various businesses, enabling it to develop new products. The Wall Street Journal's Austen Hufford recently highlighted the company's uniqueness.&quot;Most of 3M's facilities couldn't be sold as stand-alone operations because they make such an eclectic set of products,&quot; 3M said in its latest annual report, according to Hufford. &quot;One Hutchinson, Minn., plant makes products for more than half of 3M's 23 divisions,&quot; he noted. All of 3M's divisions are very inter-related, which means any CEO who takes the helm at 3M would have a heck of a time selling off the various units. Perhaps that's why the largest divestiture in the company's history was the June 2018 sale of a business that makes copper and fiber wires for the telecom industry. It was sold for just $772 million. That's not a lot for a company with a $126 billion market cap. So, if you're buying MMM stock in hopes that the company will be broken up, you might want to look elsewhere.  The Bottom Line on 3M StockOver the next five years, 3M will spend an average of almost $2 billion annually, or 6% of its  sales, on research and development while also investing 5.5% of its annual revenue in capital projects. Both numbers are higher than what it's allocated over the past five years, showing that it continues to be committed to  producing things rather than using financial engineering to make a buck. Whatever happens Thursday, I know one thing for sure. 3M is a stock to buy and hold forever. Go against the grain, and you'll win over the long term.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-15	2019-04-15 19:04:39	MMM	3M Company	Is Johnson & Johnson Stock a Buy Ahead of Earnings?	Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has become a fan favorite in the investment community. Its strong balance sheet, collection of impressive brands and consistent dividend all give long-term investors a reason to stay with the name. So with earnings on tap Tuesday morning, should investors be nibbling JNJ stock?Source: Shutterstock For the upcoming quarter, analysts currently expect earnings of $2.04 per share on revenue $19.61 billion. Should Johnson & Johnson stock hit these consensus expectations, it will result in a year-over-year (YoY) decline of 4.9% and 2%, respectively.When it comes to the full-year numbers, analysts are looking for revenue to fall 60 basis points YoY to $81.05 billion, but for earnings to grow 4.9%. In both metrics, the ensuing quarters are supposed to get better for JNJ. Better-than-expected first-quarter results could lift the estimates for the rest of the year. Consider the fact that JNJ stock has beat both estimates for six straight quarters and this becomes a real possibility, although management's outlook will certainly be important.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWill this be enough to lift the stock? We'll find out on Tuesday. Valuing Johnson & Johnson StockThe 2019 growth profile isn't all that impressive for Johnson & Johnson stock, although the numbers for 2020 are better. Analysts expect revenue growth to turn positive and expand by 4.3%. Earnings growth is forecast to accelerate from 4.9% to 6.5% in 2020 to $9.14 per share.Based on this year's numbers, JNJ stock trades at just under 16 times earnings. Ordinarily, paying 16 times earnings for negative revenue growth and sub-5% earnings growth is unattractive, to put it kindly. But JNJ is no average name.  * 7 Mid-Cap Stocks to Find the Market's Sweet Spot The company has a strong balance sheet and steady cash flow growth. At the end of fiscal 2018, operating cash flow stood at $22.2 billion while free cash flow stood at more than $18 billion. These are impressive numbers and help explain the strength behind its dividend.Now paying out 2.65%, it's not the largest yield on Wall Street, but it's one of the most dependable. JNJ stock hasn't just paid a dividend for more than five decades, but it has raised its payout for an impressive 56 consecutive years. While this lags other dividend studs like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), it shouldn't be ignored. Further, that dividend should get another boost this month.J&J does have an issue with its talc powder products and ensuing lawsuits. While that may cause bumps along the way, it will not be the iceberg that sinks the ship. JNJ stock will live on, and long-term investors shouldn't be shaken from their position on that worry.On that note, let's look at the charts. Trading JNJ Stock  Click to Enlarge After a strong rebound out of the December lows, JNJ stock has been consolidating under $140 for more than six weeks now. $140 is clearly short-term resistance, while $135 appears to be support. Worth mentioning is that the 61.8% retracement for the 52-week range is just under $136, a level JNJ stock had been struggling with over the past few sessions.On Monday the stock jumped over this mark, although it's still below both the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. This sets up an interesting situation for JNJ stock now.Will the earnings results be strong enough to justify a move over the 20-day and 50-day moving averages? If so, I want to see how it handles $140. If JNJ gets over this mark, I want to see $140 act as support going forward.Should JNJ stock pull back instead, I want to see how it does against the 200-day moving average and possibly lower at $130. Between $130 and $140 and shares can stay rangebound, while a move outside of that range can create a change in character in JNJ stock. In short, it can create either a breakout or a breakdown.We'll know more on Tuesday. Traders should wait to see the results from earnings, while some long-term investors may feel comfortable adding to the name ahead of time.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-04-09	2019-04-09 14:42:18	MMM	3M Company	Here’s Where You Buy 3M Stock for Capital Gains	It might not be an official Dog of the Dow, but 3M (NYSE:MMM) looks ready to learn a new trick on the price chart -- and pay out big-time dividends of another sort for investors buying MMM stock today. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock 3M stock failed to make the Dow Industrials' Dogs of 2019 list. But income investors have little reason to cry. Outside of the widely followed dividend investing strategy, MMM stock is a dividend aristocrat.The company's 60-year history of increasing its dividend payout makes it a standout in the world of income investors. And right now for that consistency, 3M is willing to give you 2.72% for your participation as a shareholder. Nice, right?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStill, as someone looking at MMM stock as an investment in today's market, as much as dividends can be a testament to a company's financial wherewithal, I'd gladly forfeit that payout in favor of some overdue capital gains on the price chart. MMM Stock Weekly Chart   Like much of the market and most large cap blue-chips, 3M's gain from the ubiquitous late-December bottom is nothing to sneeze at. But my observation is MMM stock isn't nearly finished. In fact, shares appear due for a period of relative and absolute out-performance.  * 8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off As the provided weekly chart shows, MMM stock has also woefully underperformed the market over the past 15 or so months. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average has clawed its way back near its all-time highs, shares of 3M still have a good amount of ground to cover before enjoying that same feat. But if I'm correct, MMM stock is close to making that move.Bottom line -- or more aptly, the squiggly price line -- MMM put in a good deal more consolidation work preceding the broader market's own V-shaped bottom by establishing a more durable double-bottom pattern backed by key Fibonacci and moving average support. That's bullish. And now shares look nearly ready for a nice-size capital gains payout. Trading MMM StockFor like-minded investors bullish on 3M's price chart, I'd suggest waiting for shares to reclaim last week's high of $216.49. That's 10 cents above the high of the double-bottom base set back in September and offers investors a second opportunity at buying a pattern breakout. I'm anticipating that would definitely be bullish. But that's not all either.With 3M's pattern high set against the 50% retracement level from 2018's year-long correction, buying shares as they clear pattern resistance looks all the more compelling for some upside momentum and relative strength to work their way into MMM stock.For containing risk, I'd use a stop beneath last week's low of $209.26. That keeps exposure in MMM stock to 3.3%. That's manageable and avoids a possible failed breakout which could lead to a much larger price drop in 3M shares.If things go as planned, upon a breakout, a rally to test the 62% level might be considered for taking initial profits. But don't forget, we're interested in 3M's potential for outsized relative and absolute performance. As such, use a Post-It if needed, and remind yourself to be patient and get ready to ride the trend in MMM stock back to $255 and beyond!Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-04-08	2019-04-08 18:43:11	MMM	3M Company	8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off	Earnings season always brings up tremendous anticipation and more than a little anxiety. Although we've enjoyed a decade-long bull market, individual names still must deliver the goods. Moreover, we're witnessing increased pressure on well-known blue chips to keep the party going. However, these stocks to watch face unusual difficulties.First, many big corporations have already warned investors not to expect too much this earnings season. According to The Wall Street Journal, many powerhouses such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) have cut full-year profit forecasts due to a challenging environment. Therefore, executives will likely need a better-than-usual performance to keep investors satisfied.Second, several stocks to watch must contend with heightened -- and perhaps unrealistic -- expectations. As mentioned on the top, this bull is ten-years-old, a record-breaking number. However, this legacy is also a liability. Investors need extra motivation to justify risking their money. If they're not convinced, we could see a noticeable pullback in the major indices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFinally, a good chunk of the companies set to release their earnings results shortly are bellwether firms. These institutions typically speak for their target industry, or in the case of big banks, the domestic economy. You couldn't ask for a more pressure-filled environment. Hence, the overriding anxiety on the Street.  * 7 Cheap Energy Stocks to Buy Now No matter what your perspective on the markets, you should buckle up for a possible wild ride. Here are eight stocks to watch as we head toward a critical earnings showdown: Delta (DAL)Source: via DeltaAirliners represent a vital segment of the economy's pulse. If conditions are good, sector players like Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) will benefit from a double dosage of revenue: first from the leisure travelers, and more importantly, from corporate clients. If DAL stock is any indication, the airliners should put forward solid performances.In particular, Delta raised its earnings per share guidance to 85 cents to 95 cents. That's a strong leap from the prior guidance of 70 cents to 90 cents. As a result, Delta stock took off on the boosted optimism, and shares haven't looked back since.Still, Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 Max jet imposes a dark cloud on the industry. With the Max grounded due to a possibly faulty software, DAL stock may lose on domestic-flight revenues. Despite some positives, I'd still put Delta on your list of stocks to watch carefully. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrAs the e-commerce revolution made brick-and-mortar retailers increasingly irrelevant, names like Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) felt the heat. But despite many investors leaving BBBY stock for dead, it's actually one of the top performers this year. Since January's opening price, Bed Bath & Beyond shares are up 65%.But will investors want to speculate on this resurgent retailer? That's the $64,000 question. On one hand, its consensus EPS target for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 is reasonably attainable at $1.11. Further bolstering the argument for BBBY stock is that most covering analysts expect management to at least hit this metric.  * 7 Cheap Energy Stocks to Buy Now However, Q4 earnings have consistently fallen since at least FY 2016. For prospective buyers to remain interested, they'll require a combination of results and a viable narrative. With so much competition, this is one of the stocks to watch that could get ugly. Rite Aid (RAD)Source: Shutterstock This is do or die for Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD). If we're basing our assessment just on the charts, chances are, you're looking at dead money. RAD stock has severely disappointed speculators, and even this year, shares are down 17%.Still, the company appeals to risk-takers because it's a well-known entity. In addition, management is throwing its full weight toward growth and expansionary efforts. In the past RAD stock experienced significant spikes in market value due to the underlying firm's pharmacy benefit manager business, as well as its enhancement of clinical services.Unfortunately, effort alone doesn't attract investor dollars. At some point, management must deliver the results, and this is where Rite Aid lacks. For instance, the company rang up $5.45 billion in Q3, which was less than 2% growth year-over-year.Certainly, RAD is one of the stocks to watch. However, I'm afraid it's not for the right reasons. JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Source: via WikimediaIf you have any interest at all in the markets, you'll drop everything this coming Friday. That's because JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) will release their Q1 2019 earnings results before the opening bell. Indeed, it's fortuitous that America's bank is releasing on Friday: if the numbers don't quite stack up, at least people will be happy for the weekend.In all seriousness, JPM stock is the ultimate bellwether among the stocks to watch this week. Consensus estimates peg EPS at $2.35. This is very much near the higher end of the estimate spectrum, which ranges between $2.12 and $2.44. In theory, everything is set up for a typical beat.However, JPM produced an EPS of $2.37 in the year-ago Q1. Therefore, anything less than that could disappoint Wall Street. Additionally, we've recently witnessed cracks in the armor of JPM stock. In Q4 2018, the big bank suffered an uncharacteristic miss.  * 5 Data Center Buys That Deliver Sizable Income Needless to say, JPM must fire on all cylinders. Otherwise, most other stocks to watch are likely headed downhill. Wells Fargo (WFC)Source: Shutterstock Another big bank that's set for a severe earnings test is Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Historically one of the most respected names in finance, WFC stock absorbed massive hits due to multiple scandals. The biggest involved Wells Fargo employees creating millions of fake accounts to meet ambitious sales targets.Obviously, this didn't sit well with clients and the general public. Last year, the big bank faced additional accusations, including imposing hostile work environments and mortgage discrimination. However, WFC stock has surprisingly kept pace with its brethren. This year, shares are up 8%.But will this positive momentum continue? This question is the reason why I'm putting WFC on my list of stocks to watch. Specifically, I'm looking to see if management echoes JPMorgan's thoughts about the economy and the broader markets. If both big banks disappoint in their earnings disclosures for the same reason, that's a clear sign to go defensive. First Republic Bank (FRC)Source: Ken Teegardin via FlickrAlso releasing its earnings result for Q1 this Friday is First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC). I don't necessarily mean to lean heavily toward financial institutions for this list of stocks to watch. However, banks really are where the rubber meets the road for all kinds of businesses.But I'm really interested in FRC stock because I think in some ways it's a better indicator for economic health. Unlike stalwarts such as JPMorgan or Wells Fargo, First Republic Bank is a regional institution. However, it has a heavy presence in California and New York, the heart and soul of the American economic machinery.Therefore, you should pay close attention to the financials for FRC stock. Specifically, I'd like to see substantial growth in First Republic's non-interest income. This is the portion of revenue that deals with commerce-related activities, such as lending, advising and consulting.  * Check Out These 5 Fast-Growing Stocks to Buy Today Do well here, and I can see a case for the ten-year bull turning eleven. If not, it's time to cash out. J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT)Source: cloakedghost via FlickrI made a mistake in my earlier metaphor: transportation specialists such as J.B. Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT) is truly where the rubber meets the road. After all, if the economy isn't healthy, you wouldn't expect JBHT stock to perform well in the markets.Fortunately, J.B. Hunt has forwarded a solid showing in 2019, gaining nearly 15% since the beginning of January. However, the company releases its Q1 earnings results next week, and this is where things will get interesting.Consensus estimates peg EPS at $1.29. This target is near the higher end of estimates, which range from $1.14 to $1.37. So far, so good. However, J.B. Hunt's business appears to be getting more expensive, with net income trending sharply down YOY in Q4 2018.Obviously, this is one of the more important stocks to watch. Impressive results combined with a strong narrative could lift JBHT stock and others. However, rising expenses present a challenging headwind. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source:  Dawn Via FlickrJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is easily one of the most intriguing stocks to watch over the next several days. As a pharmaceutical and household-products name, JNJ stock enjoys two lucrative revenue channels. Moreover, the renowned organization pays out a 2.6% dividend, providing some shelter from volatility.Unfortunately, that shelter is necessary to protect against its own turmoil. Late last year, JNJ stock absorbed an uncharacteristic body blow. Allegations erupted that management knew the possibility that the company's baby products could be contaminated with asbestos. Because so many families trust Johnson & Johnson, the horrible optics hemorrhaged shares.  * 3 Food Stocks Hungry for More Gains However, our own Chris Lau views JNJ as undervalued, and set for a possible rebound. He's right so far. But the real test comes in the form of Q1 results. I'm interested in the sales of household products. If consumers are starting to skimp out on essential goods, that's not a great sign for the economy.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Summary  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is neutral   * Bearish sentiment is low Bearish sentimentShort interest | PositiveShort interest is low for MMM with fewer than 5% of shares on loan. The last change in the short interest score occurred more than 1 month ago and implies that there has been little change in sentiment among investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices. Money flowETF/Index ownership | NeutralETF activity is neutral. ETFs that hold MMM had net inflows of $6.67 billion over the last one-month. While these are not among the highest inflows of the last year, the rate of inflow is increasing. Economic sentimentPMI by IHS Markit | NeutralAccording to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Industrials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however. Credit worthinessCredit default swap | NeutralThe current level displays a neutral indicator. MMM credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels of the last 3 years, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.Please send all inquiries related to the report to score@ihsmarkit.com.Charts and report PDFs will only be available for 30 days after publishing.This document has been produced for information purposes only and is not to be relied upon or as construed as investment advice.

2019-04-02	2019-04-02 13:18:32	MMM	3M Company	MMM Might Head Lower, But it Has Support at $198	To receive further updates on this 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) trade as well as an alert when it's time to take profits, sign up for a risk-free trial of Maximum Options today.This morning I am recommending a bullish trade on 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Last week I said it was unclear whether the market would head higher or lower. My indicators gave sell signals, but personally, I was leaning toward the bullish side.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWe have a Federal Reserve that is dovish and willing to keep the federal funds rate steady for the rest of 2019, market breadth (the ratio of advancing stocks to declining stocks) is healthy and the major indices remain above their major moving averages.Yesterday, the S&P 500 moved higher, which is a good sign. I still don't know where we're headed in the near term, but MMM looks like a good target for a bullish put credit spread. A Bearish Outlook?An analyst from J.P. Morgan (NYSE:JPM) has reiterated his bearish view of MMM, saying he sees evidence of &quot;structurally lower profit growth.&quot; The stock did miss earnings per share estimates in its past two earnings reports, which is cause for concern.And the state of New Jersey is suing MMM, among other companies, to pay for cleanup costs from industrial contamination, which definitely isn't good news.Still, even after that bad news last week, the stock is retesting its recent highs at around the $212 level. And MMM is an attractive stock in the current market environment because it pays out a dividend.I also like the technical picture. MMM has support that should keep it above our strike prices in the short term. Support at $198I've already mentioned that MMM is retesting resistance at around the $212 level. If it is rejected at that level, it will likely head lower, and I think it has enough support to keep our trade profitable.Daily Chart of 3M Company (MMM) -- Chart Source: TradingViewThe last time MMM bounced off the $212 level, it dropped back down to $198 before turning back to the upside. I expect that support level to hold this time as well, which is why I'm recommending a put credit spread on MMM.Using a spread order, sell to open the MMM April 26th $185 put and buy to open the MMM April 26th $165 put for a net credit of about $0.45.Note: There are several April expirations available for MMM options. Be sure you are opening the weekly options that expire on Friday, April 26, 2019. About Ratio Call Debit SpreadsA put credit spread is a bullish position that involves writing (selling to open) an option and simultaneously purchasing (buying to open) an option at a different strike price in the same underlying security. The position, or leg, of the spread trade that you sell gives you a cash credit to your trading account. The option you buy limits your risk and lowers your margin requirement for the trade.This is a bullish trade in which you want the underlying share price to stay above the upper strike price of the spread. In this case, we want MMM to stay above $185 through the April 26 expiration.I recommend that you close this position and limit losses if MMM trades below $188 prior to the April 26 options expiration. For the sake of illustration, I marked that level on the daily chart above.Follow our Facebook page to receive each Trade of the Day direct to your News Feed -- and join the conversation.Ken Trester is editor of the popular Maximum Options program.

2019-04-01	2019-04-01 13:36:45	MMM	3M Company	Is Johnson & Johnson the Best Stock to Hold Forever?	InvestorPlace feature writer James Brumley recently named the 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever. Included in the group was Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). While owners of JNJ stock have been handsomely rewarded over the past decade, I wonder where it ranks among the other nine companies on Brumley's list.Source: Shutterstock I have nothing against Johnson & Johnson. I use a number of its products, including Band-Aid, Aveeno, Listerine, Reactine and Tylenol. Part of Brumley's argument for owning JNJ stock for the long haul is that the company is so much more than these products.  In fiscal 2018, JNJ's consumer division, which includes all of the brands listed above, had $13.9 billion in revenue and $2.3 billion in pre-tax income. That seems like a lot, but it accounted for just 16.7% of the company's overall revenue and 12% of its pre-tax income. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile we recognize so many of its consumer brands, that's not where the growth is; it's in pharmaceuticals. But that's a subject for another day.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business In February, I wrote an article discussing how JNJ stock owners have paid a big price in the seven years that Alex Gorsky has been CEO. Sure, Gorsky's delivered above-average shareholder returns during his tenure as CEO, but given the strength of the markets over this period, it's safe to assume that other's in the healthcare industry could have done just as well at a much lower rate of compensation. Perhaps shareholders have become lackadaisical because it's hard to fathom someone making more than $400 million (that's only on JNJ stock) over seven years without expecting the world from him or her.  A Little ContestThere are many ways to determine if a stock is worth holding forever. For this article, I'm not going to use any of these metrics. Instead, I'm going to look at the total compensation of the ten CEO's on Brumley's list over the past three years. Along with that, I'll compare the three-year annualized total return of all ten stocks. I expect it will tell me all I need to know about JNJ stock and the other nine companies.

(NYSE:SO) $34.4M 4.9% Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) $1.4M 12.4% Waste Management (NYSE:WM) $23.3M* 22.3% American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) $13.5M* 17.6% Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) $41.6M 1.1% The ResultsThe average annualized total return of these ten companies over the past three years is 10.9%. Six are over that return, and four are under it. Johnson & Johnson was mediocre, just three basis points higher than the average, yet its CEO was the second-highest paid of the bunch behind Randall Stephenson of AT&T, another overpaid chief executive. Is it interesting that the two lowest-paid CEOs -- excluding Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Larry Page of Alphabet who are founders -- had the two highest-performing stocks of the bunch?I don't think so. Neither James C. Fish, CEO of Waste Management, or Susan Story of American Water Works, is going to be living on the streets anytime soon. Yet, if you own either of these stocks, you should be pleased with the balance between CEO compensation and shareholder returns. The Bottom Line on JNJ StockNothing anyone says will convince me that JNJ shareholders aren't getting a bad deal from their CEO. So, the next time you consider buying a stock, why not check on the CEO's three-year compensation relative to its three-year annualized total return. If it's not to your liking, take a pass and look elsewhere. JNJ stock might be one to hold forever, but it's not because Alex Gorsky is CEO. It's because of the all the hardworking people behind the scenes who never make it anywhere near the C-suite. As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-21	2019-03-21 11:29:18	MMM	3M Company	3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Freeport-McMoRan, 3M and Marathon Oil	Although it spent most of the day in the black, when push came to shove at the end of the day, the S&P 500 ended Wednesday in the red. It was the second straight day of modest losses, but underscored by rising bearish volume.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) set the tone, if not the pace, falling 3.4% largely thanks to news that the Federal Reserve was dialing back its plans to raise interest rates this year. Lower interest rates general translate into modest bank profits. Rivals Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) booked oversized losses too, however.At the other end of the spectrum, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) jumped 4.6% on bullish comments from RBC analyst Mark Mahaney. Mahaney cites, among other things, continued positive perceptions from its customers and the fact that new competition underscores the further legitimization of the alternative to traditional cable television.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNone of those tickers make for particularly great trading today, however. Rather, it's the stock charts of Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) of the most interest. Here's why. 3M (NYSE:MMM)It's not over the final hump just yet, but 3M stock is knocking on that door. And, it's doing so with the most bullish of backdrops.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly If MMM can muster one more big thrust, it could set off a chain reaction of buying that may well reclaim much of what was lost in 2018.  Click to Enlarge • The &quot;final hump&quot; is $211.80, where 3M stock peaked in December and again in February. It peeled back from the February effort, but is moving back within striking distance.• As of today, the purple 50-day moving average line is above the white 200-day moving average line. This so-called &quot;golden cross&quot; generally portends more bullishness.• It was the February setback and rebound that got the breakout effort renewed in perfect form. The gray 100-day and the 50-day moving average lines both acted as the support they needed to be … something neither had done in some time. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Back on Feb. 20, Freeport-McMoRan was highlighted as a breakout candidate. Shares had then-recently pushed through a couple of technical resistance levels, and were acting as if they were ready and willing to keep trucking.They didn't. After hitting their 200-day line that very day, the profit-takers came out of the woodwork. The bigger-picture bullish effort has been renewed though, exactly where and how it needed to. The next dance with the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts, could prove a bullish catalyst.  Click to Enlarge • The reversal back into a bullish trend took shape right at the purple 50-day moving average line. This is precisely where one would want to see the bulls take a stand.• Although the volume is still below average, notice that the selling volume was waning on the way down, while the bullish volume has been building on the way up this week.• The white 200-day moving average line near $13.40 is still likely to act as resistance, but if it yields to the uptrend, there's little left that stands in the way. The next line in the sand is around $14.50, which lines up with the major peaks hit in the first half of last year. Marathon Oil (MRO)Finally, Marathon Oil is at an inflection point. Most oil and energy names are, prodded by rising oil and gas prices in an environment that suggests the slow uptrend is built to last. More than most other tickers from the energy sector though, MRO is well-positioned for a sizeable move higher.  Click to Enlarge • The inflection point is $17.90, plotted with a white line on the daily chart. That level was a floor in October, but became a ceiling in November.• Like many other stocks, MRO is pushing up and off of support offered by the purple 50-day moving average line early this month.• Zooming out to the weekly chart of Marathon, we find that the December low is also a push up and off the same support line that has guided shares higher since 2016's bottom. Assuming the upper boundary of the range remains in play, MRO could rally back to at least $24 before hitting its ultimate resistance.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-18	2019-03-18 13:11:00	MMM	3M Company	Cisco Stock Is a Great Equity Buy and a Great Growth Buy	Despite its long history, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) may have only just begun. Cisco stock once flew so high that it briefly attained the largest market cap. After the end of the dot-com boom, CSCO languished for years.Source: Shutterstock However, CSCO stock has taken on a new identity as a dividend-paying stock focused more on software and security. As a result, it appears positioned to benefit from the growth of 5G wireless technology.Between the dividend and the emergence of 5G, CSCO appears set to become one of the essential growth and income stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs  Cisco: The Income StockI once had quite a history with Cisco stock. I bought shares in 1997, and I was thrilled when they had risen eightfold in just over two years thanks to the dot-com boom. Depressingly, I then watched most of my gains melt away over the next year and a half before I finally sold for a more modest profit.Much like I have become a different investor, Cisco has become a different company. The old Cisco focused on hardware. Today, the emphasis has shifted to software and security. Moreover, the Cisco of old focused on investments, buying companies, and inspiring a higher stock price. Today's Cisco trades 36% below its record high of 19 years ago and emphasizes its rising dividend.As for the payout, the company will pay out $1.40 to shareholders this year. This places the current yield at almost 2.7%. Moreover, CSCO has hiked the payout every year since the stock began paying dividends in 2011. Those who have held since 2011 earn a double-digit percentage yield. It would surprise me if CSCO stock did not become attain dividend aristocrat status (meaning 25-plus years of dividend hikes) in 17 years. Poised for More GrowthThis does not mean I advocate writing off Cisco stock as a stodgy Dow 30 equity. CSCO will produce necessary products and generate dividends. That said, I do not think Cisco will become more like Dow peers Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) than growth stocks such as Square (NYSE:SQ) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).However, I expect Cisco's products to generate more investor enthusiasm, and with that, more growth to add to the income stream. Wall Street forecasts profit increases of 18.1% this year and 10.1% the next. Moreover, CSCO has attained something unimaginable with the old Cisco stock--a low price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. Today, CSCO stock maintains a forward multiple of about 15.4.That appears cheap when considering the role Cisco will play in the 5G space. CSCO has created a &quot;Cloud-to-Client&quot; solution for 5G. This will affect the network at every level. It offers a seamless 5G solution end-to-end that will enhance security while optimizing speed and performance. This should drive profit increases as Cisco stock moves into the next decade--and the next quantum leap in wireless tech. Concluding Thoughts on Cisco StockExpect 5G to turn Cisco into the quintessential growth and income stock. Put simply, this is not the dot-com boom CSCO. This one-time growth stock has morphed into a more conservative, dividend-oriented company. Payouts have increased every year since 2011. With these rising payouts, it could eventually become a dividend aristocrat. Moreover, with its move into 5G, double-digit profit increases have returned.However, the real benefit may come as 5G represents the next great quantum leap in wireless technology. We already know 5G will probably equip every appliance, light fixture, and meter with wireless technology. However, the real power could come from what we do not imagine.Few could have imagined all of the apps that would come about when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the iPhone in 2007. Investors should expect the same, surprising level of innovation as 5G becomes more prevalent.I do not know what products will emerge. However, regardless of what creation comes about CSCO could serve as the backbone to that technology. Even beyond the financials, that function could become reason enough to buy Cisco stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-03-12	2019-03-12 18:07:13	MMM	3M Company	9 Great Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy	Dividend growth rarely goes out of style, but sometimes investors need a little reminder about the importance of stocks that consistently and generously raise their payouts.The most recent refresher was the near-bear market in the fourth quarter of 2018. Stocks took a sharp turn for the worst beginning in October. The market rolled over, and each time it looked like stocks might finally start to recover, they managed to find their way to lower lows.They didn't stay there, of course. Equities have been firmly rallying since the Christmas break, and they very well remain on their bullish path.Regardless of how things may take shape going forward, however, stocks exposed their vulnerability. Safety and reliability became priorities here in the latter stage of an economic expansion. Consistent (and rising) income suddenly were appreciated once more.Here's a rundown of nine great dividend growth stocks to buy. They don't just offer nice yields; they also have a history of upping the ante on their payouts as well. That'll come in handy if interest rates begin rising again, ratcheting up the pressure on dividend stocks that can't beef up their payouts quite as quickly as others can.

Indeed, as Barron's pointed out, the S&P 500 Industrial Sector Index lost 16% in 2018 -- erasing some $350 billion in market value. So far, however, 2019 has been better. The index is up over 9% already YTD, as cyclical concerns have faded.

Those concerns may rear their head again -- and investors still need to be cautious with the sector. But for those investors who are looking for the best industrial stocks, these five all fit the bill.

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



And with some help from the broad market and the economy as a whole, this time around they could be big winners for the rest of the year -- and beyond.

Source: Shutterstock 

### 3M (MMM)

The case for 3M (NYSE:MMM) is pretty simple. The diversified manufacturer has been one of the best buy-and-hold industrial stocks in the market for years now. 3M isn't immune to the economic cycle, to be sure, but over its 117-year history, it has seen all sorts of economic environments.

No matter what has come, over most multiyear periods, MMM stock has delivered market-beating, double-digit annual returns. Of late, however, that hasn't been the case. MMM has pulled back from early 2018 highs -- and actually is down about 22% over the past year.

But after a solid Q4 report on Tuesday morning, 3M looks to be on track. And under $200, the stock trades at a reasonable 18.5x the midpoint of 2019 EPS guidance. A 2.8% dividend adds income as well.

MMM isn't going to be a torrid grower. But I've recommended it in the past as one of the best stocks to buy for young retirees -- and at this price, investors of all ages at least should take a long look.

### GMS (GMS)

Drywall and building products distributor GMS (NYSE:GMS) was hammered in 2018, as were many housing-related plays. But GMS stock, along with the sector as the whole, has started to recover in 2019. And there's more room to run, one reason GMS is one of my largest personal positions.

There are risks here. GMS has a heavily indebted balance sheet. It has exposure to new residential construction -- which already has slowed noticeably -- and commercial construction -- which could slow if the economy turns.

But there are real rewards here, too. I highlighted GMS last year as a small-cap stock that could double, and at $19, that's still the case. The stock trades at less than 6x forward EPS estimates, and growth and margin expansion have continued of late. GMS is looking to pay down debt, which should further de-risk the story and help the equity value going forward.

  * 7 High-Dividend Stocks Yielding More Than 5% (Plus a Bonus) 



Again, caution needs to be exercised here: this is a high-risk play. But the valuation and the opportunity for further growth, multiple expansion and deleveraging mean that GMS could be one of the best stocks in the market, particularly if investors get more aggressive in 2019.

### United Parcel Service (UPS)

Investors simply don't trust United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) anymore, and with some reason. UPS stock basically has been &quot;dead money&quot; for five years now. Long-running worries remain that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) eventually will compete with both UPS and rival FedEx (NYSE:FDX).

But it seems too early to write UPS off just yet. Earnings still are growing. A massive capital spending boost catalyzed by tax reform should drive savings in the future. And a 3.6% dividend yield should continue to rise for at least the next few years.

Here, too, there are risks. A macro downturn wouldn't help the cause, and Amazon is a worthy competitor should it more aggressively enter the space. But at around 13x earnings, at least some of those risks are priced in. And there's reason to think UPS, near the lower end of its multiyear range, should have at least one more rally in it.

### DowDuPont (DWDP)

In December, I called DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP) one of 15 2018 losers that would be among the best stocks for 2019. And indeed, DWDP has bounced nicely, rising almost 20% off December lows and almost 12% so far in 2019.

At $58, the gains likely aren't over. DowDuPont still has value to unlock as it breaks itself up into three companies in the coming years. Index moves and investor impatience likely led to at least some of the selling pressure in 2018 (though cyclical worries about the chemical sector didn't help), which should further ease in 2019-2020 as the process plays out.

  * 7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019 



It's worth remembering that investors cheered the initial plans, only to forget about their benefits amid growing concerns about macro growth. As investors are reminded of the opportunity -- and perhaps become less worried about the risks -- DWDP should continue to climb.

### Honeywell (HON)

Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) executed a pair of spinoffs itself last year, distributing shares of Resideo Technologies (NYSE:REZI) and Garrett Motion (NYSE:GTX). Since the spins, and amid the saga at rival General Electric (NYSE:GE), HON stock seems almost forgotten.

It shouldn't be. Even the slimmer Honeywell looks like one of the premier industrial stocks in the market. Valuation isn't compelling perhaps, with HON trading at 18x forward EPS and yielding 2.3%. But Honeywell continues to grow nicely, and its diversified portfolio (both in terms of products and geographies) provides some protection to upheaval in individual markets.

Like 3M, Honeywell is going to trade with the cycle -- and that's a risk. But like MMM, HON stock has been a long-term outperformer. For investors who still trust the cycle and are looking for a set-it-and-forget-it type of play, Honeywell stock might be the right choice.

As of this writing, Vince Martin is long shares of GMS Inc. He has no positions in any other securities mentioned.

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is negative 
  * ETFs holding this stock have seen outflows over the last one-month 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is low for MMM with fewer than 5% of shares on loan. The last change in the short interest score occurred more than 1 month ago and implies that there has been little change in sentiment among investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Negative

ETF activity is negative. Over the last one-month, outflows of investor capital in ETFs holding MMM totaled $4.05 billion. Additionally, the rate of outflows appears to be accelerating.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Negative

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Industrials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Negative

The current level displays a negative indicator. MMM credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels for the past 1 year, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

The biggest drag on the Dow&apos;s price is Boeing Co.  as the stock fell $8.75, or 2.4%, to shave about 59 points off the Dow&apos;s price. Among the other biggest drags, shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  shed $5.66, or 2.8%; Caterpillar Inc.  declined $4.86, or 3.6%; 3M Co.  dropped $4.60, or 2.4%; and Apple Inc.  gave up $3.72, or 2.4%. Combined, the stocks&apos; price declines cut about 187 points off the Dow&apos;s price. The Dow is a price-weighted average, meaning stocks with the highest prices have the most influence, while indexes like the S&P 500  and the Nasdaq Composite  are market-capitalization weighted, meaning the most valuable companies carry the most weight.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/eb1e7a8f-e412-334c-80ea-3559b419951a/5-stocks-account-for-nearly.html?.tsrc=rss

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Morgan Stanley-One of most bearish S&P 500 target

Morgan Stanley’s (MS) chief equity strategist, Michael Wilson, is the most bearish on Wall Street regarding the projection for the S&P 500’s (SPY) target for the end of 2019. He thinks that stocks (VTI) (QQQ) will continue to struggle in 2019. Wilson kept his target for 2019 unchanged from 2018, which doesn’t imply any growth. According to CNBC, Wilson said he “sees more of the same” stagnant performance from major stock indexes in 2019.

## Rolling bear market

Wilson said, “After a roller coaster ride in 2018 driven by tighter financial conditions and peaking growth, we expect another range-bound year driven by disappointing earnings and a Fed that pauses.” Wilson has repeatedly characterized this market as a “rolling bear market.” He expects the S&P 500 to trade within a range of 2,400–3,000.

## Earnings deceleration

Investors have been concerned about the coming earnings cliff. For most of 2018, US equities have outperformed the rest of the world. However, the momentum seems to be stalling. According to FactSet, the earnings growth is expected to cool off from 20.1% in 2018 to 6.9% in 2019.

The S&P 500’s (SPY) net profit margin reached 12.0% in the third quarter. The margin expanded by 1.6 percentage points year-over-year and marked a record since FactSet started recording the data in 2008.

As pressure increases with higher raw material, energy, and labor costs and we see the impact from tariffs, the margins are expected to come off. The sugar high from the tax impact could wear off going into 2019. Several companies including Caterpillar (CAT), Ford (F), and 3M (MMM) have cited trade tariffs and China’s slowdown as headwinds for 2019 in addition to margin pressure in 2018.

### NYSE:MMM

View full report here!

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is negative 
  * ETFs holding this stock are seeing positive inflows 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is low for MMM with fewer than 5% of shares on loan. The last change in the short interest score occurred more than 1 month ago and implies that there has been little change in sentiment among investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Positive

ETF activity is positive. Over the last month, growth of ETFs holding MMM is favorable, with net inflows of $25.57 billion. This is among the highest net inflows seen over the last one-year and the rate of additional inflows appears to be increasing.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Negative

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Industrials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Negative

The current level displays a negative indicator. MMM credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels for the past 1 year, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

2019-01-07	2019-01-07 17:55:10	MMM	3M Company	The 9 Best Dividend Growth Stocks in the Dow Jones	"The Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the oldest and hallowed stock market indices in the world. Created in 1896, the Dow consists of 30 large-cap American companies, many of which pay dividends.

While many companies in the Dow are considered blue chips, they certainly aren't created equal, nor are all the industrial average's dividend stocks necessarily safe bets for dependable income. In June 2018, for example, General Electric (GE) was booted from the index after having been a member for more than a century.

GE's share price had slumped more than 50% in the year leading up to the firm's removal from the Dow, and management also had cut the dividend for just the second time since the Great Depression.

To help identify the best dividend growth stocks in the Dow and avoid the GEs of the world, research firm Simply Safe Dividends utilizes a Dividend Safety Score system that has caught more than 98% of dividend cuts in advance.

We'll use that system to take a closer look at nine Dow dividend growth stocks that appear positioned to reward shareholders with safe and solid payout expansion in the years ahead.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Attractive valuation

Last year’s ~57% plunge in General Electric (GE) stock has made its valuation attractive in the industrial sector. At current market prices, GE trades at a PE ratio of 9.96x, a significant discount to the industrial sector’s (XLI) PE ratio of 24.32x.

The stock also trades at a lower PE multiple to its top peers. The company’s main competitors such as Honeywell International (HON), 3M Company (MMM), and United Technologies (UTX) are trading at PE multiples of 16.77x, 19.50x, and 14.65x, respectively.

Furthermore, based on analysts’ next-12-month earnings projections, GE is trading at a discount to competitors. Forward PE ratios for GE, HON, MMM, and UTX are pegged at 8.91x, 16.70x, 17.68x, and 13.71x, respectively.

The PE valuation multiple is used widely because of its simplicity, but the measurement has some flaws. For example, earnings of a company can be easily manipulated, thus making the ratio meaningless. Therefore, we’ll compare these companies based on EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) multiple.

Currently, GE has an EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 31.54x, which is higher than HON, MMM, and UTX’s EV-to-EBITDA multiple of 10.87x 15.10x, and 10.87x, respectively. However, based on analysts’ next-12-month EBITDA estimates, GE is trading at a discounted EV-to-EBITDA multiple against HON and MMM, while at a premium to UTX. Forward EV-to-EBITDA ratios of GE, HON, MMM, and UTX are pegged at 9.40x, 11.85x, 12.38x, and 8.71x, respectively.

## Analysts’ rating and target price

GE has received a consensus “hold” recommendation from analysts polled by Reuters. Of the 20 analysts tracking the stock, four recommended a “strong buy,” five recommended a “buy,” nine recommended a “hold,” and the remaining two recommended a “strong sell.”

Analysts have lowered their target price and EPS estimates for General Electric since its third-quarter results. The stock’s current 12-month consensus target price of $12.37 is ~20% lower than its target price of $15.50 on October 30, the day it reported its third-quarter results.

The mean estimate for GE’s 2018 EPS fell to $0.71 from $0.83 on October 30. The company’s 2019 EPS estimate has been revised downward to $0.85 from $0.93.

2018-10-23	2018-10-23 20:50:00	MMM	3M Company	Dow ends down 125 points, but downbeat finish belies a significant turnaround for stocks	U.S. stocks on Tuesday finished in negative territory, albeit off the worst levels of the session, as worries about global economic growth and downbeat earnings outlooks from blue-chip companies sank equities following a rout in China&apos;s stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 125.98 points, or 0.5%, at 25,191.43, but had been down by as many as 548 points at its low of the session. The S&P 500 index  lost 0.6% at 2,740.69, led by losses in energy stocks  and industrials. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index  ended the day down 0.4% at 7,437.54 but enjoyed a brief stint in positive territory in a frightful and volatile day for U.S. stocks. Notably in corporate news, shares of Caterpillar Inc.  closed off 7.6%, leading Dow decliners, after the industrial giant reported profits and revenue ahead of analysts expectations but offered guidance that was below consensus. Another Dow component, 3M Co.&apos;s stock  finished off 4.4% after issuing downbeat 2018 guidance. 3M and Caterpillar combined to account for nearly half the Dow&apos;s loss at Tuesday&apos;s open at one point during the session. On big bright spot, shares of McDonald&apos;s Corp jumped 6.3% for its best day in about three years after its quarterly results on Tuesday. Markets headed lower out of the gate following the Shanghai Composite Index&apos;s  2.3% loss, giving back part of a two-day rally, and reigniting fears of a slowdown in the second-largest economy which rippled through markets. Still, some investors describe Tuesday&apos;s trade action as orderly and constructive despite the negative finish for stocks.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5fde5f37-5902-38e4-b822-dda20fa32209/dow-ends-down-125-points%2C-but.html?.tsrc=rss

While earnings growth is still high at 22 percent so far this quarter, the amount by which S&P 500 index companies are beating analyst estimates is nearly half of what it was during the first quarter, according to Refinitiv data.  Along with rising interest rates which are making bonds more attractive, slower earnings growth is eroding investor sentiment and contributed to Tuesday's sharp sell in equities globally.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tariffs-begin-bite-u-corporate-201157954.html?.tsrc=rss

Peak earnings woes  have dogged industrial companies as President Donald Trump's trade war with China exacerbates the cost pressures that are typical later in an economic cycle.  To mitigate the extra expenses, companies are raising prices and doing so with success: at 3M, the spread between price increases and raw-material costs was a positive 30 basis points, while Caterpillar gave partial credit to higher prices for its third-quarter operating-profit improvement.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/caterpillar-3m-show-peak-earnings-150202245.html?.tsrc=rss

The Dow closed up 123 points, or 0.5%, to close at 26,773, moving within range of a breach above a psychological milestone at 27,000. powered by gains in industrial components Boeing Co.  3M Co.  and Caterpillar Inc. . The climb represented the blue-chip index&apos;s 14th all-time high of the year. However, the S&P 500 index  ended the session flat at 2,923, but not far from a record of its own as a sharp decline in consumer-discretionary shares  pressured the index lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index  finished off 0.5% at 7,999. The moves come a day after the revamped North American Free Trade Agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico helped to underpin a mostly upbeat atmosphere on Wall Street, which outweighed worries about Italy, which has clashed with the European Union after EU officials claimed that the third-largest member of the trade bloc has violated fiscal rules with its recent budget plan.

Representatives of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He have been speaking privately as they seek to restart negotiations and avoid a full-scale trade war, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.  The White House, the Treasury and the U.S. Trade Representative’s office declined to comment but Mnuchin has repeatedly said in recent weeks he was ready to restart talks if China was prepared to make “meaningful changes” to its trade and technology transfer policies.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-shares-slip-tech-rout-004207749.html?.tsrc=rss
