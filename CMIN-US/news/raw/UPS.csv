2021-05-05	2021-05-05 10:00:11	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Work Rules Govern Tweets, Body Odor of Contract Drivers	(Bloomberg) -- The thousands of people driving those ubiquitous Amazon-branded blue vans aren’t employed by the Seattle leviathan. They work for small, independent businesses with contracts to transport packages for Amazon. But that hasn’t stopped the company from dictating the state of their fingernails—and a whole lot more.“Personal grooming must be maintained at an acceptable level, including but not limited to prevention of unpleasant breath or body odor, modest perfume/cologne, and clean teeth, face/ears, fingernails and hair,” Amazon.com Inc. says in a recent version of its policies governing these small delivery companies, or what the company calls Delivery Service Partners. The document, reviewed by Bloomberg, also requires that drivers refrain from “obscene” social-media posts, undergo training programs approved by Amazon, follow instructions from Amazon’s delivery app and be drug tested whenever Amazon representatives ask.The DSPs are required to adhere to Amazon’s policies, which the company can unilaterally change whenever it wants, according to a recent contract also seen by Bloomberg. They also have to provide Amazon physical access to their premises and all sorts of data the retailer wants, such as geo-locations, speed and movement of drivers—information the company says it has the power to use however it wants. For several years, Amazon has sought to bring order to its farflung delivery operations, which were plagued by accidents, complaints about thrown packages and infamous incidents such as the time a contract driver relieved herself in a customer’s driveway. But in exerting more control over these workers, legal experts say, the company has created legal risks for itself. Amazon has chosen not to directly employ DSP drivers, an arrangement that shields it from costs and liabilities the work incurs. Amazon’s growing sway over its delivery partners, however, could convince courts and government agencies that the company is actually a “joint employer” or “vicariously liable” party.“Amazon seems to want to have its cake and eat it too—to have all the control of an employment relationship, without bearing the costs,” said University of Miami law professor Andrew Elmore, who investigated employment cases as a section chief in the New York Attorney General’s Office. “These documents provide an important signal to courts and to government agencies that this is a relationship to look at.”Amazon is hardly the only company to use such a “fissured” labor model: Franchised, sub-contracted or ostensible contract workers staff most McDonald’s restaurants, have become the majority of Google parent Alphabet’s workforce, are a linchpin of FedEx’s business model and powered Uber’s rise from startup to corporate giant and verb.But the labor model—and Amazon’s in particular—is expected to get a closer look in President Joe Biden’s Washington. Critics have long argued that the company’s stringent delivery standards exacerbate the risk of accidents that can hurt or kill people. Under their agreement with Amazon, DSPs are obligated to “defend and indemnify” the company in cases involving acts by their drivers, including those involving “death or injury” to any human being. David Weil, the Obama administration’s top wage regulator and the author of a landmark book on the dangers of “fissured” work arrangements, is in line to be nominated for his former post at the U.S. Labor Department, Bloomberg Law reported, citing multiple sources familiar with the process.Amazon’s labor arrangements have already been challenged in court, both by drivers seeking to hold the company responsible for unpaid wages, and by victims of collisions who charge that Amazon is responsible for their injuries. Earlier this year, the company agreed to pay $8.2 million in a class-action settlement to resolve Seattle-area DSP employees’ claims of missed breaks and overtime pay without admitting wrongdoing. Amazon is facing similar complaints in a handful of other states. In March, California's Labor Commissioner fined Amazon and Green Messengers Inc., a Southern California DSP, $6.4 million for wage theft. The companies have appealed.Company spokesperson Rena Lunak said in an email that “the suggestion Amazon is seeking to avoid responsibility for delivery drivers is wrong.” She went on to commend the DSPs for their ability to tap into local communities and hire great drivers while taking advantage of Amazon’s logistics experience, technology and support services. “We’re proud that our program has empowered thousands of small businesses to create tens of thousands of jobs with competitive wages of at least $15 an hour and comprehensive benefits,” Lunak said. Amazon became the world’s largest online retailer, in part, by promising shoppers quick delivery, handing off items stored at warehouses to United Parcel Service Inc. and the U.S. Postal Service for the trip to customer doorsteps. The company about a decade ago started building its own capacity to move goods in an effort to accommodate its frantic growth and reduce its reliance on other companies. Today, Amazon is its own largest mailman, delivering more than half of its own shipments. To meet the task, Amazon turns to two groups of drivers: Amazon Flex workers, who like their Uber or Instacart counterparts are classified as independent contractors exempt from U.S. employment laws; and DSP drivers, who are classified as employees of local logistics companies. Amazon started the DSP program in 2018, pitching it as a way to support small entrepreneurs. Previously, the company relied on regional logistics providers, who transported packages with their own fleet of mostly generic delivery trucks. As the new, branded DSP program rolled out, the company cut ties with the regional firms in favor of these new startups that worked almost exclusively for Amazon. The company last year said there were more than 1,300 DSPs across North America and Europe, employing 85,000 people. “This kind of arrangement basically locks in place a low-wage economy, even as Amazon is incredibly profitable,” said Temple University law professor Brishen Rogers.Lawmakers have repeatedly expressed concern about Amazon’s delivery operation. In 2019, three Democratic U.S. senators unsuccessfully asked Amazon to disclose the names of companies it contracts with, citing Buzzfeed News, ProPublica and New York Times reports suggesting that Amazon’s pressure on DSPs leads to unsafe driving with potential deadly consequences. In March, more senators contacted Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos voicing concerns about CNBC and The Verge reports on Amazon’s installation of surveillance cameras in vehicles, which they said could “place unsafe pressure on drivers, and infringe on individuals’ privacy rights.” Amazon has said the video cameras improved drivers’ safety performance.As part of an aggressive social-media response to allegations that the company treats its workers poorly, Amazon's @amazonnews Twitter account in March denied that workers lacked time for bathroom breaks. “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you?” the company said, responding to a tweet from Representative Mark Pocan, Democrat from Wisconsin. The post brought quick rebuttals from drivers on social media and in news articles, with many describing having to relieve themselves in the back of trucks or clean up after others who did. Amazon later walked back the statement and apologized to Pocan, saying the tweet was incorrect and “did not contemplate our large driver population.”Amazon’s recent DSP contract, and the policy it requires those companies to follow, includes several provisions shielding the retailer from liability or further embarrassment. DSPs are required to have policies on “employment at-will,” the discretion of management to fire workers for almost any reason or with no stated reason at all. DSPs can’t issue press releases about their Amazon work without the company’s permission. DSPs must handle any disputes with Amazon through individual arbitration hearings rather than class-action lawsuits and must require their drivers to do the same. If DSPs get sued, Amazon has a veto over legal settlements and the option to commandeer the companies’ defense. Amazon is specifically indemnified from liability for death or injury. DSPs must make their employees sign non-disclosure agreements and are also obligated to safeguard Amazon’s information. (The DSPs are required to keep the contract itself confidential too.)The retailer, on the other hand, is contractually guaranteed the data it wants from DSPs and retains the right to physically inspect their premises or make them hand over data—not just while servicing Amazon, but also for another three years after parting ways. DSPs’ data gets used in part to score their performance on metrics such as employee retention and successful deliveries, which Amazon can use to reward some DSPs with bonuses and terminate underperformers. Amazon can also punish DSPs with cancellation fees that it determines and restricts them from terminating their relationship during its busy months of November or December.The Obama administration adopted broader interpretations of a “joint employer,” a company with sufficient control over a group of workers to be legally liable for their treatment, despite not signing their paychecks. Obama’s National Labor Relations Board general counsel prosecuted McDonald’s as a joint employer in a years-long case about alleged retaliation against “Fight For $15” activists at franchised stores, which Trump appointees later voted to settle without finding the burger chain itself liable. (McDonald’s denied wrongdoing.)Trump appointees at both the labor board, which enforces organizing rights, and the U.S. Labor Department, which enforces wage laws, issued regulations taking a more business-friendly view, saying that having authority over workers doesn’t make a company a joint employer unless it meets narrower criteria such as setting their specific pay rates. Biden’s Labor Department has already started the process of rescinding Trump’s rule—which was also rejected by a federal district court—and by the fall Democrats are slated to have a majority on the labor board, where they could do the same.Legal experts said the terms in Amazon’s DSP contract and policies would give plaintiffs and prosecutors a strong case for holding the company responsible under laws governing when a company is “vicariously liable” for harms such as auto accidents as well as deeming the retailer a joint employer under state and federal laws—especially if Biden appointees enact tougher rules.“The degree of control that Amazon is exerting rivals—if it doesn’t exceed—the degree of control that led to the general counsel under the Obama board issuing a complaint against McDonald’s,” said University of California Berkeley law professor Catherine Fisk.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-rules-govern-tweets-body-100011934.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-03	2021-05-03 10:00:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Kroger Joins Drone Delivery Race With Pilot From Ohio Store	(Bloomberg) -- Kroger Co. is diving into drone delivery, starting a pilot at a store near its Cincinnati headquarters.The supermarket chain is partnering with Drone Express, a unit of Telegrid Technologies, to deliver groceries from a store in Centerville, Ohio, later this spring, the companies said in a statement Monday. The technology allows for deliveries of up to five pounds to customers’ homes or wherever they may be, enabling cookout supplies to be sent directly to a park in as little as 15 minutes, the companies said.They plan to expand the test to an additional store in California this summer.“We can enable Kroger customers to send chicken soup to a sick friend or get fast delivery of olive oil if they run out while cooking dinner,” Beth Flippo, Telegrid’s chief technology officer, said in the statement.Kroger follows rival Walmart Inc., which has several drone tests underway. Last September, the world’s biggest retailer announced plans to use drones from Israeli startup Flytrex to make deliveries in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Walmart is also testing using drones to drop Covid-19 diagnostic kits to customers in two markets, and has teamed with a company called Zipline to deliver health and wellness products to shoppers near its Arkansas headquarters.While drone delivery promises to reduce labor and fuel costs to make e-commerce fulfillment more profitable, hurdles such as weather, privacy and insurance remain sticking points. To date, United Parcel Service Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Wing and Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Air remain the only Federal Aviation Administration-sanctioned drone delivery operators.Drone Express’s robots are part of a program by the FAA called Beyond, which aims to bring private companies and state and local governments together to develop drone use in areas like small-package delivery and infrastructure inspection.Drug chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., which has partnered with Kroger on merchandising and purchasing initiatives, began testing deliveries using Wing drones in 2019.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kroger-joins-drone-delivery-race-100000277.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-28	2021-04-28 18:27:13	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Thin Mints Via Drone Help Girl Scouts Leapfrog Over Covid Limits	(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus pandemic has put a significant dent in annual Girl Scout cookie drives this year, but Alphabet Inc.’s Wing unit is offering to deliver thousands of packages via drone to a Virginia community.Wing’s 14-propeller, custom-built drone has in recent weeks begun dropping boxes of Samoas, Thin Mints and other varieties to customers’ homes in a contactless transaction that bypasses the traditional booths and door-to-door sales.“It’s exciting for the industry,” said Nikki Williams, chief executive officer of the Virginia Skyline Council Girl Scouts. “It’s exciting for us. But really what it’s most exciting for is the girls, to really see innovation and participate.”The company has agreed to purchase 3,000 boxes of cookies as the scouts’ fund-raising drive winds down this year, helping the 16 troops in the Christiansburg area of southwestern Virginia limit the losses they expect, Williams said. They expect sales to be 40% below last year, she said.Wing’s drone delivery service -- which has some operations in the U.S., Australia and Finland -- grew by more than 500% in 2020, at least partly because Covid-19 restrictions led to greater demand, the company said in a statement.The growth has continued this year. Wing has made more deliveries in the first three months of this year than in the last six months of 2020, the company said.Wing is one of a number of large and small companies, including Amazon.com Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc., that are racing to master drone technology and obtain government permission for the novel technology of using small, remote-controlled aircraft to deliver goods to people’s homes.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed limited tests of various delivery models, but is still wrestling with how to create a new regulatory framework that ensures safety for routine robotic flights.As part of its help on the cookie drive, Wing has promised to give girls in the Christiansburg area access to its drone operations to help with science and technology education.Limits in Virginia on large gatherings during the pandemic have meant that only a handful of the girls have been able to participate so far, but Williams said they plan to have larger field trips as restrictions are lifted.A promotional video released by Wing shows two girls watching a drone hover over a lawn and lower a box holding cookies.“We are the first council to deliver cookies by drone and that is pretty awesome,” said 11-year-old Gracie, wearing a badge-festooned vest.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thin-mints-via-drone-help-182713322.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-27	2021-04-27 16:08:25	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Surges Most Since July as Rebound Drives a Profit Beat	(Bloomberg) -- United Parcel Service Inc. soared the most in almost nine months after profit rose far beyond what Wall Street expected, buoyed by strong, broad sales growth as the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines helped stimulate the economy.First-quarter adjusted earnings reached $2.77 a share, UPS said in a statement Tuesday, rising from $1.15 a year earlier when the first coronavirus wave began closing businesses. Analysts had predicted a profit of $1.73 a share for the latest quarter, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Sales climbed 27% to $22.9 billion while analysts anticipated $20.6 billion.“The significant across-the-board beat is almost too big to be true,” Brian Ossenbeck, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note to clients. “Concerns of peak pricing and tougher comps will linger, but the U.S. domestic operations are clearly operating at a higher level of profitability.”Chief Executive Officer Carol Tome has taken advantage of strong sales to push a “better not bigger” strategy, moving to boost margins by paring e-commerce business from less profitable large retailers rather than adding capacity to meet all demand. The company instead has focused on smaller customers and health-care deliveries, which helped drive up first-quarter revenue per package by 10% for the international and U.S. operations.UPS jumped 11% to $194.76 at 11:44 a.m. in New York to easily top the S&P 500. The stock earlier advanced 12%, the most intraday since July 30. UPS had climbed 4.4% this year through Monday, while the index advanced 11%The courier’s results have climbed as the Covid-19 pandemic drove consumers to purchase more goods online. A steep drop in airline flights, which typically carry some international air freight, meanwhile allowed the courier to raise prices. The only major drag during the pandemic has been a decline in commercial service. But recent economic growth is reviving that traffic, which is more profitable than residential shipping.Commercial package volume in March finally turned positive from a year earlier after being depressed by lockdowns, UPS said.“We look forward to the economy continuing to recover and our commercial business coming back as well,” Tome said on a conference call with analysts.UPS’s results followed a similarly robust earnings report by rival FedEx Corp. last month. FedEx rose 4.5% to $289.37 Tuesday.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Revenue, margin and earnings expectations for UPS need to be recalibrated higher, in our view, as the company’s 1Q results illustrate that it’s hitting its stride. UPS’s adjusted EPS of $2.77 was 60% above consensus on revenue that was 11% ahead of analysts’ forecasts.”Lee Klaskow, Senior Transportation and Logistics AnalystClick here to read the research.UPS’S adjusted operating margin rose to 12.9% from 6.2% a year earlier, reaching its highest level since the second quarter of 2016. Tome in February said the company had passed a “turning point” for improving margins.The revenue gain was led by the international unit, which was hit first last year by China’s lockdowns, jumping 36% to $4.6 billion. Sales jumped 22% to $14 billion at the Atlanta-based company’s main U.S. business, driven by small and midsize businesses.Chart: UPS’s Package Revenue Surges 10% From Shopping BingeThe company declined to provide forecasts for 2021 revenue and profit, citing “continued economic uncertainty” and saying it would provide more detail at its June 9 investor meeting.(Updates with CEO’s comment in ninth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-surges-profit-tops-estimates-134955778.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-27	2021-04-27 14:04:45	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Tuesday's Market Minute: UPS Earnings Breakdown	UPS (NYSE: UPS) beat on first-quarter earnings before the bell this morning with earnings per share of $2.77 and revenue of $22.91 billion. The company is not providing 2021 guidance. Right now, Americans are depending on package deliveries more than ever as e-commerce spikes during the pandemic and ordering online becomes more integrated into daily life. UPS benefits from the heightened demand and must expand to meet it. But what happens to UPS as giant companies like Amazon or Target (NYSE: TGT) begin to bring more delivery in-house? Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) subcontracts fleets of branded vans to deliver its packages, bypassing UPS. Target announced recently that it would expand the use of Shipt from same-day grocery delivery to more packages – the first step towards its own logistics chain. And, as more Americans are vaccinated and the end of lockdowns is in sight, will people return to old habits and UPS see less demand? The company may have to weather another sea change soon.

These 2 Stocks Could Be the Key to Stock Market Gains in 2021	The stock market looked poised for a positive open on Tuesday morning, as investors continued to hope for an economic rebound motivated by COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and pent-up demand from consumers.  Before the open as of 8 a.m. EDT, stock market futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) were up about 13 points, or 0.05%.

Net income was $4.79 billion, as earnings per share climbed 393% from the year-ago period to $547.

""During the quarter, we continued to execute our strategy under the better not bigger framework, which enabled us to win the best opportunities in the market and drove record financial results,"" said Chief Executive Carol Tomé. UPS said it wasn't providing full-year EPS or revenue guidance given continued economic uncertainty.

2021-04-27	2021-04-27 10:00:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Releases 1Q 2021 Earnings	"Consolidated Revenue Increased 27%; Growth Across All SegmentsConsolidated Operating Profit Up 158% to $2.8B, Up 164% on an Adjusted* BasisDiluted EPS of $5.47; Adjusted Diluted EPS Up 141% to $2.77 ATLANTA, April 27, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UPS (NYSE:UPS) today announced first-quarter 2021 consolidated revenue of $22.9 billion, a 27% increase over the first quarter of 2020. Consolidated average daily volume increased 14.3% year over year. Consolidated operating profit was $2.8 billion, up 158% compared to the first quarter of 2020, and up 164% on an adjusted basis. Diluted earnings per share were $5.47 for the quarter, 393% above the same period in 2020, and up 141% on an adjusted basis. For the first-quarter of 2021, GAAP results include a net benefit of $2.4 billion, or $2.70 per diluted share, comprised of an after-tax mark-to-market (MTM) pension benefit of $2.5 billion and after-tax transformation and other charges of $140 million. The MTM benefit was primarily driven by the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA). The ARPA, which was signed into law on March 11, 2021, protects certain multi-employer pension plans from becoming insolvent through 2051, thereby eliminating the Company’s liability for potential coordinating benefits related to the Central States Pension Fund. Enactment of the ARPA required the Company to remeasure its UPS IBT Pension plan at current discount rates, which have increased since the previous measurement date. The overall result was a reduction in the pension liability of $6.4 billion. “I want to thank all UPSers for delivering what matters, including COVID-19 vaccines,” said Carol Tomé, UPS chief executive officer. “During the quarter, we continued to execute our strategy under the better not bigger framework, which enabled us to win the best opportunities in the market and drove record financial results.” U.S. Domestic Segment 1Q 2021Adjusted1Q 20211Q 2020Adjusted1Q 2020Revenue$14,010 M $11,456 M Operating profit$1,359 M$1,463 M$364 M$401 M Revenue increased 22.3%, led by growth from small and medium-sized businesses.Revenue per piece increased 10.2%, driven by Ground products.Operating margin was 9.7%; adjusted operating margin was 10.4%.

Forward-Looking Statements This release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission contain and in the future may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements other than those of current or historical fact, and all statements accompanied by terms such as “will,” “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “estimate,” “assume,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “target,” “plan,” and similar terms, are intended to be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made subject to the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws pursuant to Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. From time to time, we also include written or oral forward-looking statements in other publicly disclosed materials. Such statements may relate to our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results, and give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties, include, but are not limited to: continued uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, financial performance and liquidity, our customers and suppliers, and on the global economy; changes in general economic conditions, in the U.S. or internationally; significant competition on a local, regional, national and international basis; changes in our relationships with our significant customers; changes in the regulatory environment in the U.S. or internationally; increased or more complex physical or data security requirements; legal, regulatory or market responses to global climate change; results of negotiations and ratifications of labor contracts; strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns by our employees; the effects of changing prices of energy, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and interruptions in supplies of these commodities; changes in exchange rates or interest rates; uncertainty from the expected discontinuance of LIBOR and transition to any other interest rate benchmark; our ability to maintain our brand image; our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; breaches in data security; disruptions to the Internet or our technology infrastructure; interruptions in or impacts on our business from natural or man-made events or disasters including terrorist attacks, epidemics or pandemics; our ability to accurately forecast our future capital investment needs; exposure to changing economic, political and social developments in international and emerging markets; changes in business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions that may result in impairment of our assets; increases in our expenses or funding obligations relating to employee health, retiree health and/or pension benefits; potential additional U.S. or international tax liabilities; potential claims or litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures or strategic alliances; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our transformation initiatives; cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results; our ability to manage insurance and claims expenses; and other risks discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and subsequently filed reports. You should consider the limitations on, and risks associated with, forward-looking statements and not unduly rely on the accuracy of predictions contained in such forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances, changes in expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events after the date of those statements. Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP Financial Measures We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including ""adjusted"" compensation and benefits, operating expenses, operating profit, operating margin, other income and (expense), income before income taxes, income tax expense, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share. We supplement the reporting of revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit with adjusted measures that exclude the period over period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities, and we disclose free cash flow. The equivalent measures determined in accordance with GAAP are also referred to as ""reported"" or ""unadjusted.” We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide additional meaningful information to assist users of our financial statements in understanding our financial results and cash flows and assessing our ongoing performance, because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying operations and may provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. These non-GAAP measures are used internally by management for business unit operating performance analysis, business unit resource allocation and in connection with incentive compensation award determinations. Restructuring and Other Charges Adjusted operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share exclude the impact of charges related to restructuring programs, including Transformation strategy costs and asset impairments. Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Hedging Activities Currency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit. The derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period (including the period over period impact of foreign currency hedging activities). The difference between the current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations. Mark-To-Market Pension and Postretirement Adjustments We recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of other pension income (expense). We supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of gains and losses recognized in excess of the 10% corridor and the related income tax effects. We believe excluding these mark-to-market impacts provides important supplemental information by removing the volatility associated with short-term changes in market interest rates, equity values, and similar factors. The deferred income tax effects of mark-to-market pension and postretirement adjustments are calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction, including the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various U.S. state and non-U.S. jurisdictions, by the adjustments. Free Cash Flow We calculate free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, and plus or minus the net changes in finance receivables and other investing activities. We believe free cash flow is an important indicator of how much cash is generated by regular business operations and we use this as a measure of incremental cash available to invest in our business, meet our debt obligations and return cash to shareowners. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our adjusted financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our adjusted financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled information reported by other companies.

Alphabet’s Wing Seeks Expanded U.S. Drone Flight Permissions	(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Wing Aviation LLC is asking U.S. regulators to allow it to expand drone operations as a way to make more efficient deliveries controlled from a central command post.Wing wants to control its drone flights at a “central hub” from which the remote pilots can oversee operations without being in the aircraft’s operating area, the Federal Aviation Administration said Friday in a filing in the Federal Register.The company also wants to launch drones from multiple locations within an operating area, and get FAA permission to receive less frequent checks from the regulator, the filing said. The agency posted the requests without saying whether it will approve them.Wing is one of several companies, including Amazon.com Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc., hoping that automated drone deliveries will become a common way for people to receive their purchases. Wing has been testing its system in Christianburg, Virginia.The company’s request was earlier reported by Reuters.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-wing-seeks-expanded-u-150458317.html?.tsrc=rss

UPS Plans To Acquire Beta Technologies’ Aircraft To Enhance Air Delivery Services	"United Parcel Service, Inc. plans to acquire electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft from Beta Technologies as it looks to enhance its air delivery services in select markets across the US. UPS (UPS) will be able to plan a “series of short routes, or one long route, on a single charge to meet customers’ needs.” The aircraft comes with a 250-mile range and a 1,400-pound cargo capacity ideally suited for time-sensitive deliveries.

The shipping company is already drawing in daily revenues from drone flights. Juan Perez, Chief Information and Engineering Officer of UPS said, “These new aircraft will create operational efficiencies in our business, open possibilities for new services, and serve as a foundation for future solutions to reduce the emissions profile of our air and ground operation.” After gaining more than 40% in 2020, UPS stock has continued its upward journey in 2021.

2021-04-07	2021-04-07 12:00:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Bets on Electric Aircraft to Get Packages to the Hinterlands	(Bloomberg) -- United Parcel Service Inc. is buying 10 small electric-powered aircraft that take off like helicopters and fly like planes, aiming to reduce its costs from contracting with small air freighters to reach far-flung areas.The first delivery of the ALIA-250 from Stone Point Capital-backed Beta Technologies is expected in 2024, UPS said in a statement Wednesday, and the courier has an option to acquire as many as 150. While the vehicles will be piloted, UPS already envisions drone versions that could fly on their own and would be less costly to operate.For all the hype surrounding potential passenger-carrying air taxis, UPS’s foray into electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft signals that freight delivery is likely to be one of the first industries to take advantage of the technology. FedEx Corp. is experimenting with pilotless Cessna 208 cargo aircraft and Slovenia-based Pipistrel, which makes light propeller planes, expects to start delivering cargo drones in two years.Still, there are big hurdles for eVTOLs, even for freight, including a limited range and heavy batteries. The business case for the next-generation technology is in its early stages, spurring caution among analysts such as Richard Aboulafia.February’s $3.8 billion merger of air-taxi startup Archer Aviation with a blank-check company backed by investment banker Ken Moelis and United Airlines Holdings Inc., is a red flag that the eVTOL market is too frothy, said Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant for Teal Group.Investment pouring into the industry reminds him of the early 2000s, when startups rushed to develop so-called personal jets. That industry dissolved with the 2008 financial crisis and all the investment turned to dust, Aboulafia said.“There’s now the same combination of lots of cash looking for a home and a high degree of techno-utopia,” he said.Cost EstimatesBeta’s aircraft has four rotors on top and a propeller in the back. The company says it can travel 250 nautical miles (290 miles, 460 kilometers) on a charge and can tote as much as 1,400 pounds (635 kilograms) of cargo. That will limit the vehicle’s use since the typical small freighter UPS uses can carry about 3,500 pounds and has a range of roughly 1,200 nautical miles.While UPS didn’t disclose the price, Beta’s ALIA-250 lists for $4 million each, though large purchases bring a discount, said Kyle Clark, chief executive officer of the South Burlington, Vermont-based manufacturer.Clark, a plane and helicopter pilot, estimated that the operating cost of an eVTOL is about half that of a small cargo plane, mostly because of fuel and maintenance savings.It costs about $380,000 to overhaul a Cessna 208 engine, which is needed after about 3,000 flight hours. Overhauling the ALIA-250’s electric motors is expected to cost a third less and wouldn’t be necessary until 10,000 hours, he said in an interview.Skirting TrafficUPS could also save by reducing the need for trucks and -- at some point -- pilots.Juan Perez, chief information and engineering officer at the Atlanta-based courier, said the aircraft will be nimble enough to land at a sorting center’s parking lot, allowing the courier to avoid using small air-freight contractors and trucks to get packages from its main hubs to facilities in remote areas, such as North Dakota.“It will allow us to bypass a lot of the handoffs that take place today with using the typical small airplanes,” Perez said in an interview.UPS expects to use the eVTOL in more populated areas as the aircraft’s safety is established. Perez envisions flying packages in bulk, for example, to downtown Atlanta from the city’s airport, skirting metropolitan area traffic.If the aircraft can be operated as a drone, it promises to be even more cost-effective. Autonomous flights would be on routes currently served by contractors, so they wouldn’t affect UPS’s union pilots, who fly large cargo jets, Perez said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-bets-electric-aircraft-packages-120000667.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-04-07	2021-04-07 12:00:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Flight Forward Adds Innovative New Aircraft, Enhancing Capabilities and Network Sustainability	ATLANTA, April 07, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beta Technologies’ electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft to land on-property at UPS facilities in small and mid-size markets.Enhances UPS network flexibility, benefits healthcare providers and small and medium-sized businesses.Flexible, sustainable solution to reduce air network emissions; recharging station can also be used with electric-powered ground vehicles. UPS (NYSE:UPS), together with its UPS Flight Forward subsidiary, plans to purchase electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft from Beta Technologies (BETA) to augment its air service for select small and mid-size markets. These aircraft will take off and land on-property at UPS facilities in a whisper-quiet fashion, reducing time-in-transit, vehicle emissions, and operating cost. The BETA aircraft’s 1,400-pound cargo capacity is ideally suited to more quickly and sustainably transport time-sensitive deliveries that would otherwise fly on small fixed-wing aircraft. UPS’s use of the aircraft will benefit healthcare providers, thousands of small and medium-sized businesses, and other companies in smaller communities. With a 250-mile range and cruising speed of up to 170 miles per hour, UPS will be able to plan a series of short routes, or one long route, on a single charge to meet customers’ needs. “This is all about innovation with a focus on returns for our business, our customers, and the environment,” said UPS Chief Information and Engineering Officer Juan Perez. “These new aircraft will create operational efficiencies in our business, open possibilities for new services, and serve as a foundation for future solutions to reduce the emissions profile of our air and ground operation.” The aviation industry is focusing on small aircraft, which UPS uses to serve many small and medium-sized communities, to develop groundbreaking, sustainable electric-powered aircraft. BETA’s aircraft has four fixed vertical lift propellers and one pusher propeller for forward flight. It can charge in an hour or less, and produces zero operational emissions. “We’re combining simple, elegant design and advanced technology to create a reliable aircraft with zero operational emissions that will revolutionize how cargo moves,” said BETA founder and CEO Kyle Clark. “By utilizing vertical takeoffs and landings, we can turn relatively small spaces at existing UPS facilities into a micro air feeder network without the noise or operating emissions of traditional aircraft.” UPS has also reserved BETA's recharging station for a seamless and fully integrated electric aviation system. The BETA charging station helps ensure safe and rapid charging of the aircraft in under one hour, and facilitates a quick turn for the loading and unloading of cargo. The charging station also offers the aircraft’s batteries a second life cycle. After the batteries’ first life cycle in the aircraft concludes, they can be fitted to the charging stations to recharge the aircraft’s onboard batteries as well as UPS’s fleet of electric ground vehicles. UPS currently operates more than 12,000 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles, and announced a commitment to purchase up to 10,000 Arrival electric vehicles. BETA’s aircraft are designed to someday operate autonomously as technologies and regulations are established. UPS Flight Forward received the first U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 135 Standard air carrier certification to operate a drone airline, and is operating daily revenue-generating flights with drones. The FAA certification also enables UPS Flight Forward to fly payloads of up to 7,500 lbs. either with an operator or autonomously. Last month, BETA advanced to the next phase of flight testing, completing an interstate flight from its Plattsburgh, NY test facility to its Burlington, Vt. headquarters. In accordance with FAA protocols for experimental aircraft to fly beyond its home airport, BETA had to complete rigorous testing to ensure reliable and predictable behavior of the aircraft. In the same week, the company set a new personal-best in range while also reaching 8,000 feet in altitude. The first ten BETA aircraft are scheduled to begin arriving in 2024, with an option to purchase up to 150 of the aircraft. Editor’s note: Multimedia assets are available on UPS Brand Central.

2021-04-06	2021-04-06 12:00:10	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	KKR-backed OneStream Software Raises $200 Million at $6 Billion Valuation	(Bloomberg) -- KKR-backed OneStream Software, a maker of programs for chief financial officers, raised $200 million in a funding round that values the company at $6 billion.The round was led by D1 Capital Partners and included investments by Tiger Global and Investment Group of Santa Barbara. OneStream plans to be ready for a public share sale next year, although actual timing may vary based on market conditions, Chief Financial Officer Bill Koefoed said in an interview. The Rochester, Michigan-based software maker had sales of $130 million in 2019 and hasn’t disclosed more recent revenue. It has been shifting customers to subscriptions that generate a regular sales stream — annual recurring revenue has doubled in the quarter that just ended and totals about $150 million, Koefoed said. The company sells software that helps a CFO’s office report financial information to regulators and investors, as well as manage financial and operational planning. Customers include United Parcel Service Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Capital One Financial Corp. It competes with Oracle Corp., SAP SE, Anaplan Inc. and Blackline Inc.The company, which was founded in 2010, is trying to help CFOs have a more up-to-date view of their numbers, moving from an earlier world where figures got tallied once a month to today’s goal of real-time information. The pandemic has made companies realize they can’t rely on planning that’s rapidly obsolete, OneStream Chief Executive Officer Tom Shea said. In the most recent quarter, bookings rose 200%, the company said. “What happened when the pandemic hit is anybody that was running a business realized their plans were pretty much garbage,” Shea said. “You had no idea what demand looked like, you didn't know if someone was going to pay you. The first thing that happened on, let’s call it March 9 of last year, is everybody started to realize that those that had invested in tools and had the information they needed to understand where they were at that moment — they were OK, and those that didn’t realized that they needed to invest.”The company, which KKR took a majority stake in two years ago, plans to use the funds to fuel research and development in the product and its expansion into the Asia Pacific region, Shea said.

2021-03-29	2021-03-29 13:03:37	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	What Does United Parcel Service's Debt Look Like?	Over the past three months, shares of United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) fell by 0.83%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt United Parcel Service has. United Parcel Service's Debt According to the United Parcel Service's most recent balance sheet as reported on February 22, 2021, total debt is at $24.65 billion, with $22.03 billion in long-term debt and $2.62 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $5.91 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $18.74 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering United Parcel Service's $62.41 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.4. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

2021-03-25	2021-03-25 16:16:27	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Russian tycoon behind UK electric vehicle firm Arrival nets nearly $10bn	The Russian founder of British electric vehicle start-up Arrival has seen his wealth soar by almost $10bn (£7.2bn) after his firm went public in the largest ever UK company listing in history. Arrival, which is based in Banbury in Oxfordshire, listed on the Nasdaq on Thursday through a SPAC merger with CIIC Merger Corp that valued the business at over $13bn. The deal netted 43-year-old Denis Sverdlov, Arrival's chief executive, $9.8bn. Mr Sverdlov is a telecoms tycoon and a former Russian minister. Documents relating to the listing, which were made public on Thursday, showed that Mr Sverdlov will own 76pc of the stock in the new public company. It also means Arrival has had the largest listing by a UK company despite the fact that it has technically yet to sell a vehicle. Arrival’s new valuation represents a significant increase from last year when it was pegged at around €3bn (£2.58bn) in January. It has raised around $660m through its merger with CIIG. The company claims its first vehicles are due to be made in the fourth quarter of this year. Mr Sverdlov said he believes “all vehicles will soon be electric” as it is better for the planet, people, and businesses. “Going public is an opportunity that will allow us to continue to scale globally, bringing these products to more and more cities and people,” he said. “We also understand that this comes with responsibility. Arrival has a remarkable company culture, which attracts great talent and enables us to be truly creative.” Peter Cuneo, a former head of personal care brand Remington and comic book giant Marvel, created the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). SPACs have become an increasingly popular method of going public with investors looking to pour money into exciting start-ups in the global low-interest environment. The company aims to build low-cost electric vans and commercial vehicles like buses. It differs to that of many other EV firms in that it aims to construct its vehicles in so-called micro-factories. It claims it can gain an advantage over the likes of Tesla by being able to constantly change how it builds its vehicles in order to produce them in the most-efficient way possible.

2021-03-21	2021-03-21 21:41:42	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Carter Worth And Mike Khouw's United Parcel Service Trade	"Mike Khouw spoke on CNBC's ""Options Action"" about United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS). He said it is trading at a relative discount to the market because margins in the B2C business are not as good as they are in the B2B business. People are also looking beyond the pandemic and are concerned that the tailwind is going to start turning into a headwind. But Khouw is not expecting a big drawback in earnings as people go back to shopping, and he sees an opportunity in UPS. He wants to buy the June $165 call and sell the April $170 call for a net debit of $5.70. He is hoping to collect the premium from the faster decaying April expiration call option. If it expires worthless, he can sell another call to collect more premium or he can just continue to hold the June expiration call. Carter Worth sees a bullish technical setup in the name. He showed on a chart that the stock has been consolidating after a sharp move higher and that is typically a setup for the next directional move. He expects the stock to come to life and move higher, just like FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX).

2021-03-08	2021-03-08 17:29:39	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Spends $131 Million for Stake in Cargo Airline ATSG	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. has scooped up a minority stake in a cargo airline that operates a portion of its fast-growing air-cargo division, the latest sign of the retailer’s long-term ambitions to expand its air-freight operations.Amazon spent $131 million to acquire about 13.5 million shares of Air Transport Services Group Inc., the air cargo operator said in a securities filing on Monday, exercising warrants Amazon had previously acquired. Amazon also acquired roughly 865,000 additional shares through an agreement in which no cash changed hands. The purchases are contingent upon approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation, ATSG said.Following that approval, Amazon will own about 19.5% of ATSG, said Quint Turner, chief financial officer of the Wilmington, Ohio, company, a stake that gives Amazon the right to appoint one member of ATSG’s board of directors. If Amazon leases more aircraft and exercises all its warrants, the company could own as much as 39.9% of the cargo carrier, ATSG said in its annual report.ATSG shares rose almost 5% at 12:21 p.m. in New York. Amazon was mostly unchanged.The online retail giant first received warrants to purchase ATSG shares in 2016, as part of an agreement that saw ATSG begin flying aircraft for Amazon’s then-new air cargo unit.Earlier this year, Amazon announced its first aircraft purchases, buying 11 Boeing Co. 767-300 jets to join a fleet of leased planes. The company is also set to complete work later this year on an air-cargo hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Amazon uses the air operation to speed goods from its warehouses to shoppers, reducing its reliance on logistics partners like United Parcel Service Inc.Amazon has also acquired warrants to purchase shares in Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. and Sun Country Airlines Holdings Inc., two other carriers that operate Amazon Air jets.ATSG Chief Executive Officer Rich Corrado said on a conference call last month that the company anticipated operating 46 aircraft for Amazon by the end of this year, up from 33 at the end of 2020.“I think it’s an acknowledgment that we have a very strategic relationship with them,” Turner said of Amazon’s decision to exercise the warrants. “It’s clearly a very important relationship for both companies.”(Updates with Amazon stake, CFO comment, beginning in the third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-spends-131-million-stake-164603325.html?.tsrc=rss

UPS Healthcare and The UPS Foundation make financial and in-kind commitment to facilitate equitable worldwide vaccine deliveries	Initial commitment for delivery of 20 million doses to countries in need across four continentsKey support for equitable vaccine distribution through COVAX, Gavi, the vaccine alliance and CARE’s Fast + Fair initiative Working with countries across Africa, Asia, Europe and South America to accelerate global vaccination efforts Cold chain, additional freezer capacity is yet another element of UPS Healthcare’s continued expansion of worldwide capabilities ATLANTA, March 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UPS (NYSE: UPS), The UPS Foundation and UPS Healthcare are moving quickly to support an equitable delivery program and sustainable global supply chain of COVID-19 vaccines. UPS, in collaboration with COVAX, Gavi, the vaccine alliance and CARE will initially facilitate the delivery of 20 million doses for countries that have not had sufficient access to vaccines, including top priority groups like healthcare workers. “We believe we have the ability – and responsibility – to facilitate and accelerate equitable COVID-19 vaccine delivery around the world,” said Scott Price, President UPS International. “UPS continues to build and inspire action across a network of global public-private partnerships that will ensure vaccines move more efficiently and equitably. Our work focuses on countries with limited resources and constrained supply chains and infrastructures. The goal is simple and our commitment is unwavering – moving our world forward by delivering what matters.” The latest global vaccination rate is approximately six million doses per day. According to several studies, at that rate it would take an estimated 5.4 years to cover 75 percent of the global population with a two-dose vaccine. The role of public-private partnerships is a vital component in building global solutions for global challenges, such as the pandemic, and the needed access to vaccines to fight it. Building partnerships Global success hinges upon bringing together and mobilizing the right partnerships. Helping to establish and fuel these efforts, UPS Healthcare and The UPS Foundation will: Provide transportation solutions that leverage UPS cold-chain technologyDedicate ultra-low temperature freezer donations necessary to maintain vaccine dose viability at the correct temperature in varying environmentsCommit UPS loaned executives to provide logistics expertise and coordination with vaccine manufacturers and NGO partners to manage and streamline deliveries This initial level of support from The UPS Foundation is more than $3 million in contributions to our global partners. This capacity building effort is made up of a $2 million grant directed to Gavi who is matching the grant to bring it to $4 million. With the addition of $1 million of in-kind support, The UPS Foundation is providing transportation, donating cold-chain capacity in the form of freezers and lending technical expertise to partners in need. This comprehensive level of support amounts to more than $5 million in support of equitable vaccine distribution and health systems strengthening efforts across Gavi-supported countries. “With supply limited for the foreseeable future, COVID-19 vaccines are arguably the world’s most precious commodity this year,” said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi. “With every dose being so important, it is critical to ensure that our partner countries have the necessary support and tools to deliver vaccines effectively and efficiently to those who need them. This new support builds on the long-standing partnership between Gavi and the UPS Foundation, which is focused on ensuring that every child in Gavi-supported countries receives lifesaving vaccines.” The UPS Foundation is also providing support for CARE’s Fast + Fair initiative, which is focused on equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to at-risk groups including healthcare workers, caregivers and refugees in 11 initial countries including Bangladesh, Benin, Democratic Republic of Congo, India and South Sudan. “We are interdependent as a global community – no one is safe until everyone is safe,” said Nikki Clifton, President of The UPS Foundation. “Now is the time to link our arms around the world. Now is the time to deliver vaccines – and hope – to everyone, regardless of wealth or location.” Collectively, these public-private efforts, such as the one in Ghana, are designed to ensure COVID-19 vaccines begin flowing quickly to countries in dire need. Through UPS and partner support, more than 10 million people in countries across Africa, Asia, Europe and South America will receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the first wave of vaccine distribution.

2021-03-02	2021-03-02 14:03:59	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Workhorse Electric Delivery Van Builds Lag As Backlog Swells	"Workhorse Group (NASDAQ: WKHS) built just seven trucks in the fourth quarter as its underdeveloped production systems and supply chain issues continued to hold down the electric maker's progress even as orders have grown sevenfold compared with a year ago. ""We are facing various supply chain challenges, both internal and external,"" CEO Duane Hughes said on the company's Q4 earnings call Monday. ""Given our backlog, we cannot sacrifice future build volume for current-year production. Scaling up manufacturing properly has to take precedence."" So, Workhorse will continue to take it slow, striving to build three of its composite-body battery-electric trucks a day in March with a plan to reach 10 trucks a day by the end of June. The full-year goal of producing 1,800 trucks is a stretch, Hughes said. The negligible volume also means Workhorse is paying more for parts and for delivery to the plant. ""We have completed the setup of the initial assembly operation and are using roughly 33% of the plant capacity,"" he said. ""We have new hires in place to support the growing volume of daily vehicle production. And we have upgraded the assembly equipment on the line to make the manufacturing process even more efficient."" A new Truck Talk in your mailbox every Friday. Subscribe here Investors bid up Workhorse shares 7.24% to $17.34 Monday. The company lost more than half its value after OshKosh Truck Co. (NYSE: OSK) won a 10-year contract to build the next-generation mail trucks for the U.S. Postal Service Supply chain and COVID setbacks Shortages persist for battery packs and microchips for steering racks and body control modules. Workhorse has added a second supplier for battery packs and expects those to be validated this quarter. ""The real key here is making sure that we have all the appropriate production systems in place as well as equipment, that allow us to make jumps from three to 10 [trucks a day] and 10 and more going into the future,"" Hughes said. After a November COVID outbreak that further slowed progress at its plant in Union City, Indiana, Workhorse accelerated installation of production systems following an efficiency assessment by Hitachi. Those systems replace the ""brute force method of getting trucks out the door,"" Hughes said. Timing breaks on growing backlog Workhorse has more than doubled its headcount from 90 last November to more than 200, including contractors. The order book of 8,000 trucks compares to 1,100 a year ago. Commercial vehicle distributor Pritchard Cos. is leading a 20-city tour with two C-1000 vans to gain exposure and more orders. A 6,320-unit order from Canada's Pride Group in January is structured so Workhorse only needs to deliver 20 trucks in the second half of the year followed by 600 each in 2022 and 2023 and 5,000 in the last three years of the contract. View more earnings on WKHS Hughes declined specifics on when United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) would receive the 900 vans it ordered in 2018. UPS has charging infrastructure in San Diego to handle electric trucks, he said. UPS is waiting for California incentives. The state Air Resources Board set aside $25 million under its HVIP program for 2021. But the program is not expected to be funded until the second half of the year. Workhorse vans qualify for a $45,000 voucher off the sale price. Workhorse wants non-incentive-dependent customers, which it hopes to identify through the roadshow, Hughes said. By the numbers Mostly due to a $320 million valuation of its 10% stake in startup electric pickup truck maker Lordstown Motors Corp. (LMC) (NASDAQ: RIDE), Workhorse posted a Q4 profit of $322 million compared with $15.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Workhorse licensed to LMC the technology that underpins its Class 1 battery-electric vehicle. Workhorse sales were $652,000 compared to $3,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase resulted from building and delivering more trucks. Expenses are rising as production ramps up. Workhorse will have negative gross margins this year and for the foreseeable future, Chief Financial Officer Steve Schrader said. Break-even is 200 trucks a month. Its profitability target will be met at 300-400 trucks monthly.

2021-03-01	2021-03-01 13:13:44	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Union Is a Tough Sell in Town Where $15 an Hour Goes a Long Way	(Bloomberg) -- On a rainy Saturday afternoon in early February, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union held a rally in a grassy lot a five-minute drive from Amazon.com Inc.’s fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama. Organizers handed out pizzas supplied by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a long-time Amazon critic. Members of the Teamsters had traveled to Bessemer to lend their support, some from as far away as Boston. Workers and activists brandished signs with such slogans as “Don’t Back Down” and “Our Community Supports Amazon Workers.”Inclement weather aside, the event seemed to have all the ingredients needed to fire up workers keen to take on Amazon. Yet the crowd that day numbered about 50, including activists, out-of-towners and media, and many of Bernie’s pizzas were uneaten when the rally ended about an hour later.The campaign in Bessemer has drawn national attention and is widely considered a once-in-a-generation opportunity to breach the defenses of the world’s largest online retailer, which has managed to keep unions out of its U.S. operations for a quarter-century. To prevail, the union needs to win over a majority of the votes cast at Amazon’s BHM1 fulfillment center from among a pool of some 5,800 workers. The RWDSU still has time to win workers’ hearts and minds because mail-in balloting, which started in early February, runs through March 29.But even workers who support joining the union acknowledge victory is by no means assured. Many of their colleagues see a big employer investing in their impoverished town and offering more than double the minimum wage, with benefits, for entry-level jobs. Fifteen dollars an hour doesn’t go far in cities like New York and San Francisco. But in Bessemer, where a fixer-upper house costs less than a new car, it beats working the cash register at the local Dollar Tree.On the warehouse floor, according to 16 workers interviewed for this story, opinions are sharply divided, with anti-union sentiment running at least as hot as pro-union passions. Cori Jennings, a 39-year-old mother of five, goes out of her way to avoid union activists staking out the Amazon parking lot. “God forbid you make eye contact,” she says. “You can’t rid of them.” Jennings worries that the RWDSU will chase Amazon out of town and derail her plans of becoming a manager.Union officials say the company is sowing such fears by flooding the airwaves with anti-union messages and indoctrinating workers during mandatory information sessions. “The challenge is not Alabama. The challenge isn’t Bessemer,” says RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum. “The challenge is the most aggressive anti-union campaign anyone has seen in decades, with unlimited resources and unlimited access to workers.”Amazon officials say they’re simply providing information about unions so workers understand what membership would mean for them and their day-to-day working lives. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “We don’t believe the RWDSU represents the majority of our employees’ views. Our employees choose to work at Amazon because we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our total compensation package, health benefits, and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs.”President Joe Biden indirectly edged into the fray with a video in which he said workers should be free from company pressure in weighing whether to organize. While not an explicit endorsement of the effort at Amazon, he clearly signaled his preference, saying: “There should be no intimidation, no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda.”Bessemer, located about 16 miles (26 km) southwest of Birmingham, was once a thriving steel town and manufacturing center. For much of the 20th century, U.S. Steel and train-car maker Pullman-Standard employed thousands of locals, catapulting them into the middle class. Then, like many U.S. cities, Bessemer began shedding manufacturing jobs in the 1970s and 1980s. When Pullman-Standard closed its factory in 1981, local officials say, unemployment spiked to 35%. Most everyone knew a family that was affected, and many residents packed up and left.Today, Bessemer is a quiet place, the stillness broken by the occasional freight train passing through. The 41-square-mile town is dotted with simple single-family homes, many in need of repair. There is a church on every other block, ministering to the city’s 27,000 residents, most of whom are Black. It’s the kind of place where people say hello on the street—even during a pandemic—and tack a “ma’am” or “sir” onto the end of their sentences. In 2010, Bessemer elected Kenneth Gulley mayor. A transplant who moved to the city from Forkland, Alabama, 25 years ago, Gulley won 73% of the vote with a pledge to create jobs. The town was on the verge of bankruptcy, so his first task was restructuring the debt.Once Bessemer was on a more solid financial footing, Gulley began selling prospective employers on the city’s attributes—its manufacturing DNA, airport and access to a railroad and three major interstates. Dollar General Corp., the discount retail chain, opened a distribution center; Flex-N-Gate, which manufactures metal and welded components, operates a facility. Blox, a construction firm that builds modular units for hospitals, set up shop in the old Pullman-Standard plant.Then Gulley landed the big one—persuading Amazon to open a fulfillment center on acreage once owned by U.S. Steel off Powder Plant Road. The 855,000-square-foot facility, the first of its kind in Alabama, put Amazon on the doorstep of Birmingham, the state’s largest city, and meshed with the company’s efforts to speed up delivery to smaller metro areas around the U.S.For many Bessemer residents, Amazon’s arrival was affirmation that their town had finally entered the 21st century. Yes, the jobs were mostly unskilled, but Amazon was one of the world’s most powerful tech companies. If the criticism of Amazon’s labor practices leveled in recent years by Sanders and employee activists gave some Bessemer residents pause, most focused on the $15-an-hour starting wage and health benefits.As Gulley hoped, local businesses are already benefiting from Amazon’s presence. A worker at the Waffle House, a two-minute drive from the warehouse, says a steady flow of Amazon employees stop by for hash brown scrambles and grilled cheeses—paying customers who have helped the restaurant survive the pandemic. Gulley, who is 52 and now in his third term, says that while he supports workers’ right to organize, he hopes the union drive doesn’t scare off Amazon and other companies. The BHM1 fulfillment center opened on March 29, 2020, instantly making Amazon Bessemer’s biggest employer. The company had no difficulty filling the slots, but workers say many new hires quit within weeks of starting because they found the pace arduous or were worried about catching Covid-19, which had started spreading around the U.S. and infected dozens of Amazon workers.A 26-year-old woman who worked at the facility and requested anonymity to speak freely says she was upset after being reprimanded for not working quickly enough. Over time, her feelings about the job evolved from “just work harder and things will get better” to “this is a sinking ship and, no matter how many holes I plug every night, there are going to be new ones the next day.” She quit in January.High turnover is typical at Amazon warehouses, so Bessemer was no exception. But in the late summer, a group of workers contacted a union organizer to say they wanted to discuss unionizing. The RWDSU’s Appelbaum says some workers were concerned about the pandemic but mostly were agitating about the expectation that they handle hundreds of products an hour. “I think people want to be treated with dignity,” he says. “They’re not saying it’s about the wages.”It’s highly unusual for worker activism to take root in one of Amazon’s U.S. warehouses so soon after it has opened. Many recruits are happy with the pay and benefits, and it can take years—not months—for their appreciation to curdle into disappointment. And even then most quit; they don’t approach a union for help. Appelbaum says workers at the Bessemer warehouse, who are mostly African-American, were inspired in part by the Black Lives Matter protests and the growing acceptance that systemic racism has hurt the economic prospects of people of color.The question, of course, is whether the people who contacted the RWDSU are aligned with a majority of their colleagues. In interviews, many workers acknowledge that the work is hard and the hours long, but they point out that few other local employers offer similar pay and benefits. The minimum wage in Alabama is $7.25 and median pay for unskilled work is paltry: $12.14 for retail salespeople; $11.37 for cashiers and $13.36 for restaurant cooks. The e-commerce giant’s benefits also stand out in Alabama, where health care gobbles up 13.2% of household income, compared with 11.2% nationally, according to a QuoteWizard report.Many of the new hires hailed from retail or food services, including a cohort who worked at the University of Alabama in Birmingham. Eric Jones, 51, worked as a cook at the university hospital. In August he joined Amazon as a picker, which involves grabbing items from a robot. The commute from Birmingham requires taking two buses about two hours each way, he’s making only $2 an hour more than his previous job, and at first Jones struggled to pick the prescribed 300 items per hour. But he doesn’t have to pay to see a doctor, likes the flexible hours and recently learned that Amazon will help him get a deal on a car.While Jones thinks Amazon should do a better job of providing information about confirmed Covid-19 cases, he’s skeptical of how much the union could help. “I know malarkey when I hear it,” he says. “It could benefit us or it could hurt us.”J.C. Thompson, 43, has been working at Amazon since April and loves it. The job provides affordable medical, dental and vision benefits for his family, which saves him $800 a month and helped pay for his two sons’ braces. Thompson is saving as much as he can for retirement, taking advantage of Amazon’s 401(k) match. He voted no and mailed back the ballot same day he received it. “I think unions are for people who don’t like rules,” says Thompson, who soured on them during 10 years at United Parcel Service Inc.No one is counting out the union, and workers say there is plenty of support for the RWDSU in the warehouse. Jennifer Bates, who works in the receiving department and trains other employees, says she initially found working at Amazon exciting. But before long she says managers began pushing breaks back further in her shift so she and her colleagues sometimes went as long as five hours without stopping. Bates, 48, believes the union would give workers a bigger voice and is trying to persuade colleagues to vote yes.Darryl Richardson, an Amazon worker who also supports joining the RWDSU, says it’s hard selling younger workers on the benefits of union membership. “You’ve got a lot of not educated and young people, and they don’t know about the union,” he says. “Sometimes we can convince them and sometimes we can’t.”The RWDSU is trying to tap into Bessemer’s union history during its manufacturing heyday. But those jobs started going away a half-century ago, and the unions could do nothing to stop that. Organizers have recruited unionized workers from local poultry plants to proselytize on their behalf. But what sells in wealthier cities resonates less in right-to-work Alabama. Big public rallies are impossible during a pandemic, so the RWDSU is sometimes reduced to posting activists outside the warehouse and trying to grab workers’ attention. Inside, meanwhile, managers are selling Amazon’s position to people paid to be there.“If the RWDSU loses the campaign, you can always find some strategic missteps, but those will be dwarfed by the size of Amazon’s wealth and its ability to mount an anti-organizing campaign,” says Janice Fine, a labor studies professor at Rutgers University. “They’ve picked a huge fight, and it’s going to be really hard to win.”—With Matt Day (Updates with Biden comment.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-union-tough-sell-town-131344589.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-19	2021-02-19 21:09:26	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Exclusive: UPS Pilots Try Rapid COVID Test To Avoid Hong Kong Quarantines	"UPS (NYSE: UPS) Airlines pilots are testing themselves for COVID midflight, using a novel rapid antigen device that has yet to be approved by the U.S., and sending the results ahead to Hong Kong in an effort to avoid lengthy government quarantines on arrival, FreightWaves has learned. The express carrier is participating in a trial of the Covi-Stix detection kit manufactured by Sorrento Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SRNE) to support Food and Drug Administration authorization and prevent pilots flying from the company's Anchorage hub from being isolated against their will in Hong Kong, according to an internal email shared with FreightWaves. A second source with knowledge of UPS' operations confirmed the existence of the voluntary program for crew members on direct flights from Anchorage to Hong Kong. UPS spokesman Mike Mangeot said he had no details to provide. Sorrento Therapeutics didn't respond to a request for information. Hong Kong recently began requiring airline flight crews to quarantine for 14 days in the latest effort to contain any spread of the coronavirus. FedEx Express, in response, offered to relocate Hong Kong-domiciled pilots and their families to San Francisco and Cathay Pacific said it wouldn't have enough pilots to maintain its already limited flight schedule. The Independent Pilots Association, which represents UPS flight officers, has previously asked UPS to provide more testing resources and do more to protect members from contracting the virus. Mangeot reiterated that the airline has ""gone to great lengths throughout the pandemic to protect our pilots."" Steps taken include providing crews with N-95 masks, hand sanitizer and thermometers; enhanced cleaning of aircraft and facilities; education on proper public health practices and how to navigate COVID-19 hot spots; advocacy with government health officials around the world to ensure the safe transit of crew members; and testing for international pilots, although the IPA says testing is limited to certain airports. ""And we continue to examine ways to make our safety program even stronger,"" he said in an email. Sorrento Therapeutics applied Dec. 22 to the FDA to receive emergency use authorization for Covi-Stix. The company said the test uses a shallow nasal swab that can provide results in 15 minutes and that its technology is 100 times more sensitive than conventional rapid antigen tests, which have shown limited reliability. The Covi-Stix testing program is voluntary for UPS crews and is only available to individuals who have tested negative prior to departure with an Abbott Labs ID Now COVID-19 test, with questions still remaining about its false negativity rate. ""The test should be conducted approximately one hour prior to top of descent,"" the internal email said. ""A ‘presumptive positive' test at the top of descent is intended to allow UPS to coordinate turning the affected crew member (and any contact-traced crew member in the aircraft) directly back to ANC (Anchorage) on the next outbound flight without processing through Hong Kong and being subject to quarantine."" Data from the self-administered test is being collected to help secure FDA certification and prove the viability of the testing methodology. Prior to the antigen test, the process was for pilots to get a rapid test in Anchorage so they could fly in with a negative test. In Hong Kong, officials would conduct a more aggressive nasal test, which takes several hours to return results. Anyone who tests positive on their tests is taken to quarantine at the convention center until their body starts to produce enough antibodies to be considered no longer susceptible to contracting COVID.

2021-02-19	2021-02-19 16:21:55	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Despite Risks, Star Peak Energy Looks Poised to Be a Long-Term Winner	Star Peak Energy (NYSE:STPK) is a SPAC that has agreed to merge with Stem, a “smart energy” company which looks to be very well-positioned for the ongoing energy revolution. Given Stem’s outlook, I recommend buying STPK stock at its current levels. Source: Shutterstock As my headline indicates, however, I do think that Stem faces significant risks, including potentially strong competition. A Positive Macro Outlook Using artificial intelligence (AI), Stem says it provides enterprises with “integrated battery storage systems, network integration and battery optimization.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of Additionally, the combination of renewable energy systems and batteries rapidly proliferating, Stem appears to be well-positioned to exploit that trend. Moreover, the company correctly points out that the hugely increased popularity of renewable energy has made managing electricity flow much more 0complex for large businesses, while greatly increasing the difficulty of running grids for utilities. Spurred by increased pressure to become “green,” many more companies and governments will increase their utilization of renewable energy. This is also likely to make batteries and grid management more important is the “electrification of transportation,” which in all probability will make electricity even more important and meaningfully more expensive over the longer term. Importantly, given the latter points, Stem says that it reduces its customers’ “energy costs” by 10%-30%, using its AI. And by “lowering energy costs, stabilizing the grid, alleviating intermittency and reducing carbon emissions, Stem makes itself and STPK stock very appealing. Also, another company which has benefited significantly from these trends is American Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC). The company says that its Grid business, featuring products that help companies and utilities regulate electricity flow and the grid, is delivering consistent growth. American Superconductor refers to these products as “new energy systems.” In Q3, the Grid unit’s sales increased 12% year-over-year. The company noted that the revenue of its “new energy systems” was “driven by… renewable projects in the United States, along with chip factories overseas. “ AMSC stock has surged over 200% in the last 12 months. Stem Has Many Top-Notch Customers Among Stem’s customers are the following very large customers: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), WalMart (NYSE:WMT), UPS (NYSE:UPS), Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), Raytheon (NYSE:RTX), Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP), and InterContinental Hotels (NYSE:ICE). Stem reported that it had helped InterContinental Hotels “halt rising energy costs” in California. Harry Hobbs, an Area Director of Engineering for the company, said that Stem’s “real-time data..is the real differentiator” that allowed him to triple his return on investment, according to Stem. Tough Competition and High Valuation In addition to American Superconductor, Itron (NASDAQ:ITRI) and ESCO Technologies (NYSE:ESE) offer similar solutions to those of Stem. As the sector becomes more lucrative, much larger companies, such as General Electric (NYSE:GE) and NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), could very well enter the sector. At this time, Star Peak Energy is trading at a post-merger valuation, based on certain assumptions, of $5.5 billion. The company’s revenue came in at just $33 million last year, although it says that it expects its sales to jump to $147 million in 2021 and $347 million in 2022. Still, based on the 2022 figure, STPK stock is trading at a pro-forma price-sales ratio of 16, which is quite expensive. Nevertheless, it’s less expensive than many of its SPAC peers, and the company, unlike most other SPAC names, expects its EBITDA to turn positive in 2022. On the other hand, as I pointed out in a recent, previous column, the sentiment towards SPAC stocks has soured somewhat recently, increasing the risk facing Star Point Energy. The Bottom Line on STPK Stock Stem’s huge opportunity and its very impressive customer list outweigh the risk facing the shares at this point. Consequently, I advise growth-oriented, risk-tolerant investors to buy the stock. On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in AMSC and GE.

2021-02-12	2021-02-12 20:08:39	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Hyliion’s New Battery Will Shake HYLN Stock From Its Bearish Slumber	Once upon a time, electric trucking company Hyliion (NYSE:HYLN) was a Wall Street darling. Investors were wowed by the company’s breakthrough renewable natural gas (or RNG) technology, and its potential to address the shortcomings of electric and hydrogen technology in long-haul trucking. From June to September 2020, HYLN stock soared from $10 to $55. Source: Hyliion.com Then the hype faded. Over the past five months, HYLN stock has crashed back to $15. Why?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Mostly because there has been a notable lack of announcements from the company, at the same time that huge advancements have been made in both plug-in battery and hydrogen technology. This combination has caused investors to second-think RNG’s place in the clean energy future, and whether Hyliion will be a big player in electrifying trucking fleets. Hyliion just announced a next-generation battery module, however, which broadly implies that its RNG technology is making progress. Further, it implies Hyliion’s electric powertrains have significant advantages over legacy EV powertrains. This big announcement could be exactly what Hyliion’s sleepy stock needs to “wake up” and rebound back to $50-plus highs. Claim Your Spot in Line for Luke’s Next 10X Recommendation (Plus Free Hypergrowth newsletter) Here’s a deeper look. HYLN Stock: Traditional Renewables Not Up to Par in Trucking First, let’s understand the core bull thesis on Hyliion’s stock. It all starts with talking about the shortcomings of plug-in battery and hydrogen technology in long-haul transportation. Battery-electric trucks have range, cost and infrastructure problems. They can only travel a few hundred miles on one charge, they run at about $7 per diesel gallon equivalent (versus $3 per gallon for diesel trucks) and there are less than 10 Class 6-8 electric truck recharging stations across North America (PDF, page 10). Hydrogen trucks do better on the range part. Because hydrogen is super light, hydrogen fuel cells can be super dense. And therefore, hydrogen trucks can drive much farther on a single “charge.” But hydrogen truck still have the cost and infrastructure problems. There are also less than 10 Class 6-8 hydrogen truck refueling stations across North America, and hydrogen costs about $12 per diesel gallon equivalent. Thus, while the trucking industry needs to go green, traditional renewable energy sources are not ready to viably decarbonize the industry just yet. Fortunately, there’s another, entirely overlooked and ostensibly counterintuitive renewable energy source which is ready to immediately and cost-effectively decarbonize the trucking industry — and it’s the one that differentiate Hyliion from other players in this space. Is Renewable Natural Gas the Next Big Thing? When it comes to Hyliion’s bull case, it’s all about RNG. RNG is natural gas, just sourced from animal, industrial and food waste as opposed to fossil fuels. Sure, that means RNG still emits CO2 during the natural gas combustion process (not good for the environment). But it also means that RNG captures and uses methane in traditionally methane-rich waste, and therefore, prevents that methane for being emitted (really good for the environment). Methane is considered much, much worse in terms of global climate change than CO2, mostly because the former is better at absorbing heat. Therefore, as a process that boosts CO2 emissions, yet simultaneously reduces methane emissions, RNG is considered net carbon-negative and ultimately a big “win” for the environment … much like plug-in batteries and hydrogen. The cool thing about RNG is that it solves plug-in battery and hydrogen technology shortcomings in long-haul trucking. Range? A typical RNG truck will give you the same mileage as a diesel truck. Infrastructure? Unlike wind, hydro and solar, RNG can is a plug-and-play solution with existing natural gas infrastructure, and therefore, doesn’t require huge capital spending to work at scale. After all, there are 729 Class 6-8 natural gas refueling stations across North America. RNG can be pumped through all of those stations. Costs? Current RNG prices hover around $1 per diesel gallon equivalent, while hydrogen and electricity prices — though steadily falling — still sit staunchly north of $5. Thus, by being a clean energy source with best range, the lowest costs and an already established infrastructure, RNG is the only immediately usable technology to decarbonize trucking fleets. That’s why Deloitte projects that, by 2026, about 80% of all alternative drive systems in heavy duty trucks will be based on natural gas (PDF, pg. 4). Hyliion Comes to Market With Best-in-Breed RNG Solution Hyliion is positioned with a best-in-breed RNG truck powertrain platform — dubbed the Hypertruck ERX — that is due to start deliveries in 2021/2022. This platform will materially disrupt the trucking industry, and over the next decade, you could see a lot of UPS (NYSE:UPS), DHL, FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) trucks be built on the Hypertruck ERX powertrain. Just look at the numbers here. Hyliion consistently outperforms rivals Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The Hypertruck ERX sports the following: Driving range of 1,300 miles, ~70% more than Nikola’s hydrogen truck (750 miles) and about 160% more than Tesla’s semi-truck (500 miles). A payload capacity of 53,000 pounds, ~10% more than Nikola (48,000 pounds) and ~20% more than Tesla (43,000 pounds). A full recharge time of just 10 minutes, the same as Nikola’s hydrogen truck and one-third that of Tesla’s semi-truck. A 0-to-60 miles-per-hour pick-up time of 20 seconds, on par with Tesla’s semitruck and 10 seconds shorter than Nikola’s hydrogen truck. In other words, Hyliion’s Hypertruck ERX is the best clean energy long-haul truck technology platform in the market … meaning it is ready to lead the clean-energy disruption of the Class 8 trucking market. For a while, Wall Street forgot about Hyliion’s potential amid a noticeable absence in updates from the company. But HYLN is perking up once again because of a critical business update, which implies that the company has been busy at work fine-tuning this disruptive technology. A Breakthrough Next-Gen Battery Module This past week, Hyliion unveiled its next-generation battery module that has long battery life, higher recharging rates and improved safety. Specifically, this improved battery module is capable of up to 5X as much cycle life as a conventional EV battery, can be recharged in under 8 minutes, and allows for more than a 40% improvement in cooling compared to previous systems (which allows for higher charge and longer sustained power output). It’s a powerful solution that could be the key to waking up investor interest in Hyliion stock. Before this announcement, Hyliion had been publicly quiet for months about any technological improvements or advancements. This silence dated back to the company’s third-quarter earnings report back in early October. Not surprisingly, amid a lack of catalysts, Hyliion stock has been weak. But this is a big catalyst, and it could be exactly why Hyliion’s stock needs to wake up from its slumber and get back on a winning trajectory. Long-Term Upside Potential Is Compelling Globally, about 1.7 million heavy-duty commercial vehicles (HCVs) are sold annually. Let’s say this market follows the passenger car electrification arc, and that by 2030, more than 30% of new HCVs sold are built on alternative drive systems. That implies 500,000-plus alternative-drive HCVs sold in 2030. There will be a lot of competition fighting for those 500,000 deliveries. Tesla will win some market share with its branding power and leading electric battery technology. Nikola will win some share with its disruptive hydrogen fuel cell technology. And, yes, Hyliion will some share with its immediately usable and exceptionally cost-effective RNG powertrains. Let’s say Hyliion wins about 20% market share, implying ~100,000 units sold in 2030. The company’s internal financials imply average annual revenue per powertrain of over $60,000, while EBITDA margins at scale should rise toward 35%. Under those assumptions, Hyliion should clear $2 billion in EBITDA in 2030. High quality truck components suppliers can fetch a 15X EBITDA multiple. That implies a potential future enterprise value for Hyliion of $30-plus billion, versus a market cap of ~$3 billion today. Bottom Line on HYLN Stock Hyliion still projects as a long-term winner thanks to its unique RNG solution which is presently the best solution for decarbonizing the long-haul trucking industry. Hylion’s stock just went to sleep for a few months, amid an unusually prolonged silence from the company with respect to technological and business progress. That silence is now broken. And with it broken, HYLN looks ready to charge back into an uptrend. P.S. Have you noticed the trend lately? The stock-picking trend has made a comeback in 2021… But with all these stocks going parabolic only to come crashing down, it’s impossible to tell up from down. It may seem like the smartest thing to do is sit on the sidelines… it’s not.

2021-02-11	2021-02-11 10:30:03	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon-Backed Rivian Plans Electric-Vehicle Plant in Europe	(Bloomberg) -- Rivian Automotive Inc., the electric-vehicle maker backed by Amazon.com Inc., is scouting locations in Europe to build a new factory, according to people familiar with the matter.The site likely would first produce a delivery van for Amazon and soon after build Rivian models for consumers, the people said. While no site has been selected yet, several countries are under consideration, including the U.K., Germany and Hungary, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing private information. Other sites outside the European Union also are under consideration.Rivian has hired the commercial real estate services firm JLL for the search. The carmaker hopes to start van production as soon as next year, some of the people said. It also has solicited pitches from real-estate advisers for retail space in Europe where it will exhibit its vehicles.Representatives for Rivian, Amazon and JLL declined to comment.Rivian is seen as a potential automotive disruptor akin to Tesla Inc., the world’s largest maker of purely battery-powered vehicles. The Irvine, California-based company is due to start production and U.S. deliveries of a pickup model in June, followed by an SUV in August. Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that it’s looking to go public as soon as September, potentially at a valuation of more than $50 billion.Rivian has an order for 100,000 electric delivery vans from Amazon, which has invested in the company. Amazon has said it expects 10,000 of the vans to be on roads making deliveries globally by 2022, and the rest of the order is due by the end of the decade. Production of the vans is expected to start at Rivian’s plant in Normal, Illinois, by the fourth quarter.Electric vehicles are a cornerstone of Amazon’s goal to deliver half its shipments without producing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It has bought tens of thousands of conventionally fueled vans in recent years and is increasingly delivering packages using bespoke contractors in Amazon-branded vehicles instead of relying on partners such as United Parcel Service Inc.Three variants of the Rivian-built van are planned with different cab styles and sizes tailored to different types of cargo. The vans will be capable of driving around 150 miles (241 kilometers) between charges.Rivian has raised more than $8 billion to date from high-profile companies and investors including Amazon, Ford Motor Co., T. Rowe Price and BlackRock. The carmaker was valued at $27.6 billion in its latest round, a person familiar with the matter said last month. It has more than 3,600 employees across sites in Michigan, California and the plant in Illinois, which was formerly owned by Mitsubishi Motors Corp.The startup was founded in 2009 by R.J. Scaringe, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate with a doctorate in mechanical engineering who is chief executive officer.(Updates with search for retail space in the third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-backed-rivian-plans-europe-194940246.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-05	2021-02-05 14:36:18	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	EV Manufacturer Arrival Talks SPAC Deal, Benefits Of Business Model	"United Kingdom-based Arrival, a maker of electric trucks and buses with a unique business model, is the latest SPAC attracting investor interest. On Thursday, Arrival President Avinash Rugoobur was a guest on Benzinga's ""SPACs Attack"" show to talk about the upcoming public launch. About Arrival: Arrival has been working on its EV technology since 2015 and boasts 1,500 employees, 90% of whom are engineers, Rugoobur told ""SPACs Attack"" co-host Chris Katje. The company's most notable breakthrough in the competitive EV space is its vertical integration business model that relies on in-house components, materials and software to keep costs as low as possible, he said. The company's technology and infrastructure can be leveraged to expand into new categories, such as working on autonomous vehicles or partnering with an EV software maker, Rugoobur said. ""There are multiple layers I think to the growth story of Arrival that we will be talking about more in the coming years,"" he said. ""But for now it's about the bus, van and microfactory."" Related Link: 2 Electric Vehicle SPACs To Watch On Apple-Hyundai Rumors SPAC Over IPO: Arrival has successfully raised capital from Blackrock, Hyundai and Kia, as well as an investment and order from United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS), Rugoobur said. The company is now in a position where it is ready to not only start bringing its vehicles to the market, but to scale its business to ramp production. Arrival is set to become a public company by combining with SPAC company CIIG Merger Corp (NASDAQ: CIIC). The Arrival team came to the conclusion that a SPAC is a superior way of going public after realizing that CIIG Merger shares a similar long-term vision, Rugoobur said. UPS Deal: Arrival inked a deal in late 2020 to supply UPS with 10,000 of its electric delivery vans, and the company's president said the deal showcases the true strength of Arrival's business model. Arrival's microfactory and vertically integrated model allow it to manufacture the type of vehicle UPS requires at a price that is competitive with traditional fossil fuel rivals, but much lower than comparable EVs, he said. The concept of manufacturing 10,000 custom vehicles for one client was previously deemed impossible, Rugoobur said. Traditionally, companies would need to produce hundreds of thousands of vehicles to generate a profit. ""So when UPS or any of the large or small customers needs very specific products for themselves, the traditional approach just can't do it,"" he said. Timeline Update: Arrival has said it expects to start production of its electric buses by the fourth quarter of 2021, and electric vans are slated to launch in the second quarter of 2022. The exec said there is no change to this timeline, adding that pre-production vehicles are already being built and will soon enter the testing phase. CIIC Price Action: CIIG Merger shares were trading slightly positive at $28.34 off the open Friday. Courtesy photo.

2021-02-04	2021-02-04 15:43:14	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Jeff Bezos' Logistics Legacy	"There are many chapters that could fill the book of what is becoming a most remarkable American business story. Yet a chapter that some might skim over is the one describing how Jeff Bezos came to transportation and logistics — and may end up dominating it — from behind. The trailblazers before him — Leland Stanford, whose money built the transcontinental railroad; Jim Casey, whose United Parcel Service created the package delivery business as we've come to know it; Malcom McLean, whose containerization model revolutionized international trade and transport; and Fred Smith, who took a traditional hub-and-spoke model, applied it to the urgent air shipping of high-value cargo and named it Federal Express — all put transportation front and center. Not Bezos. He launched Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) by selling books and music online. Obviously, the orders needed to be shipped. But that wasn't his main concern; the stuff would get there when it got there. Only after 2005, when he rolled out his category-killing Prime subscription service which, among other things, promised unlimited two-day deliveries with money-back guarantees, did Bezos recognize the need to backfill his retail model with shipping. And not until the 2013 peak shipping season, when millions of holiday packages arrived late due to bad weather and operational snafus on multiple fronts, did Bezos realize he could no longer put all of his trust in the hands of others. What emerged from the combination of vision, resources and execution was lightning in a bottle: the ability of a retailer to sell in-house and third-party goods from one website, and then fulfill and ship those orders, measured in the billions of packages, to consumers using its own transport and logistics network. In 2020, Amazon shipped 6 billion parcels, about 4 billion of them in its own network, according to data from The Colography Group Inc., a consultancy. If Amazon's shipping plans come to fruition — and there's little to question its commitment given its $61 billion in shipping spend last year — the world's largest e-commerce retailer will eventually become the world's largest delivery company. It closed in on, if not exceeded, FedEx Corp.'s (NYSE: FDX) calendar year 2020 U.S. air and ground volumes. (Amazon reports on a calendar year, while FedEx reports on a fiscal year that runs from June 1 to the following May 31.) Just as astounding as the development of Amazon's blueprint has been the traction to it from merchants and consumers alike. On Tuesday, when Bezos said he would step down as CEO during the third quarter to become executive chairman, Amazon reported fourth-quarter net sales of $125 billion. Amazon, which has been in business since 1994, generated $386 billion in 2020 revenue. It took Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), the retail weapon of mass destruction of a prior era, 58 years to get to $524 billion. If there is a company that hits the holy grail of $1 trillion in annual revenue before anyone else, it will likely be Amazon. Bezos departs around the time the first phase of the company's 3 million-square-foot, $1.5 billion global air hub in Cincinnati opens for business. Amazon will have around 75 freighters in its air fleet by the end of the year and will be over 80 planes in 2022, according to current estimates, which are subject to change. It has an ever-growing armada of vans, tractor-trailers and box trucks with sizable space. It is constructing fulfillment, sortation and in particular, local delivery centers as fast as foundation can be poured, the idea being to neutralize FedEx's and UPS Inc.'s (NYSE: UPS) dominance in ground delivery networks. Late last year, Amazon announced in one day the opening of eight logistics facilities in Arizona alone. Today, Amazon operates 815 U.S. facilities, with 262 additional planned, according to MWPVL International, a consultancy that follows Amazon's distribution network strategy. Bezos also steps away before the launch of what could be Amazon's most ambitious and disruptive program ever: a stand-alone transport and distribution network to pursue shippers of all sizes that don't sell on Amazon's website. This puts Amazon directly into FedEx's and UPS' kitchens, not to mention the many companies in other modes with customers that don't currently sell on Amazon. The tactic, at least to the extent that it has been reported, is to soak up off-peak shipping capacity. The long game is to take customers from UPS and FedEx, and co-opt them into the broad Amazon network. That has been happening for years. Merchants who sell on Amazon's site use Amazon Logistics for distribution and deliveries. At one point, a good chunk of those merchants were FedEx or UPS shipping customers. The program, which was in the pilot stage until it was tabled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will likely be revived in full force once the virus fades from the scene. It has already put Amazon in the crosshairs of FedEx's Smith, who at 76 is determined to blast Amazon out of the water and has assembled an anti-Amazon coalition from multiple slices of the supply chain to do it. ""I think Fred believes that they can take down Amazon,"" said Mark S. Schoeman, The Colography Group's president. However, Amazon has the wherewithal to withstand the onslaught, Schoeman said. ""Amazon isn't worried about FedEx,"" Schoeman added. ""If it thinks it will be beneficial to build out its network, it will do it."" UPS, meanwhile, has a delicate tightrope to walk. Amazon is its largest customer, accounting for 13.3% of UPS' $84 billion in 2020 annual revenue. UPS CEO Carol Tomé has served notice on large customers that the days of receiving low rates in exchange for high volumes are over. That could hasten what had been expected to be a gradual, multiyear dissolution of the relationship, as Amazon gets as good a deal as any UPS customer. Multiple people interviewed for this and other stories about Amazon in recent years said the company will accomplish whatever it sets out to do, and that it has well-laid plans that will survive even the most historic personnel changes. Marc Wulfraat, who runs MWPVL International, said there's no chance the shift at the top will alter the company's well-entrenched delivery and distribution strategy. ""That train has left the station,"" he said. The new CEO, Andrew R. Jassy, heads up Amazon Web Services, its hugely profitable, $40 billion-a-year cloud-based business. Dave Clark, who effectively built Amazon Logistics from scratch after the disastrous 2013 peak season, has been promoted to run the company's Worldwide Consumer unit. However, Clark remains the ""progenitor and champion of Amazon Logistics,"" said David Glick, who worked with Clark for three years at Amazon and is now chief technology officer at Flexe, an on-demand warehousing firm. ""With Clark going stronger than ever, Amazon Logistics will continue to grow and expand,"" Glick said. James Thomson, chief strategy officer at Buy Box Experts, a consultancy that helps clients do business with Amazon, said the company should run like clockwork in a post-Bezos era. Not that Bezos is leaving the scene of his $1.6 trillion company. ""Amazon is a long-term-focused firm, and the board is supposed to work on the long-term focus for the firm,"" Thompson said. As the executive chair, Bezos will ""still have his fingers very much on long-term strategy,"" he said.

It’s all part of new Chief Executive Officer Carol Tome’s strategy to “sweat the assets” by increasing efficiency while reducing investment.The 52 Airbus A300-600 jets were purchased beginning in 2000 and the flight computer has such limited memory that it can’t store full navigational maps, forcing UPS to divide the U.S. into five regions to hold the information. Each update takes 45 minutes and has to be done each time a plan needs to fly to a different area.“This is a huge productivity improvement for us,” said Ed Walton, director of engineering for UPS’s aircraft maintenance unit. “We had a 1970s-generation flight management system that only had 200K of memory. It’s kind of shocking that we were able to stretch it out this long.”The upgrades use a Honeywell International Inc. system and are a less-expensive alternative to purchasing replacement cargo jets. One drawback is that keeping old planes in service means burning more fuel. But Tome is under pressure to bolster profit margins and reduce capital spending, which will drop to $4 billion this year from $5.6 billion last year and more than $6 billion in each of the previous two years as UPS invested heavily to boost efficiency.UPS declined to detail how much it’s spending, or saving, on the avionic overhauls. The A300 is no longer in production, but a new Boeing Co. 767 Freighter, a slightly larger plane that UPS has bought recently, has a market value of $80.8 million, according to aviation consulting firm Avitas.The new Honeywell system will hold worldwide navigational maps and take about two minutes for updates. It also will have larger displays than the old screens and tools such as a central maintenance system and improved weather radar that enables pilots to avoid storms.The Atlanta-based courier plans to purchase 11 new aircraft this year, down from 16 in 2020, as air-cargo volume surges during the pandemic because of growth in online retail and Covid-19 vaccine distribution. Couriers are also hauling some freight that would have been carried by passenger jets had the pandemic not forced airlines to slash their schedules.Airbus completed the upgrade and flight testing of the first A300. UPS is looking to choose two companies to do the modifications, which take about three weeks, on the remaining 51 aircraft. The company expects to have them all retrofitted and flying by next year.For Honeywell, the contract is its first complete avionics replacement on a cargo plane, said Mike Madsen, chief executive officer of the company’s aerospace unit. Doing such work for freight companies is a huge potential market.“Most of them operate the older aircraft because it’s economically attractive,” Madsen said. “There are easily a thousand aircraft that could take advantage of this system.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-gives-old-jets-life-100000599.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-02	2021-02-02 14:50:24	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Beats 4Q Revenue Estimates; Shares Jump 4.2%	UPS shares gained 4.2% in US morning trading as the logistics giant outperformed quarterly earnings driven by pandemic-led by demand for delivery services. In the fourth quarter, UPS (UPS) reported adjusted earnings of $2.66 per share, beating analysts’ estimates of $2.14 per share. Revenues rose 21% year-on-year and came in at $24.9 billion, exceeding consensus estimates of $22.8 billion. The company said that revenue was fueled by growth across all of its business segments. In FY20, sales grew 14.2% year-on-year to $84.6 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings rose to $8.23 per share versus $7.53 in FY19. This marked a record for the company’s revenues and adjusted diluted EPS. UPS CEO Carol Tomé said, “Our financial performance in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, and I thank all UPSers for their extraordinary efforts to deliver industry-leading service through the holidays. As we look past 2020 into the new year, we are optimistic. During the fourth quarter, we began transporting COVID-19 vaccines.” For FY21, UPS expects capital spending of about $4 billion and growth in dividends subject to Board approval. The company plans to re-pay long-term debt maturities of $2.5 billion when they come due in FY21. For now, it has no plans to initiate a share repurchase program or raise new debt in FY21. The company did not provide 2021 guidance due to the economic uncertainty. (See UPS stock analysis on TipRanks) Last week, Robert W. Baird analyst Garrett Holland reiterated a Hold rating on the stock and a price target of $178. Holland said in a note to investors that while investors had moderated their expectations before the earnings release, still the market will continue to focus on the company’s detailed plans for cost savings, operating margins, and ROIC (Return on invested capital) potential. The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 3 analysts recommending a Buy, 2 analysts suggesting a Hold, and 1 analyst has a Sell. The average analyst price target of $182.17 implies 16.6% upside potential to current levels.

Forward-Looking Statements This release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission contain and in the future may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements other than those of current or historical fact, and all statements accompanied by terms such as “will,” “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “estimate,” “assume,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “target,” “plan,” and similar terms, are intended to be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made subject to the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws pursuant to Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. From time to time, we also include written or oral forward-looking statements in other publicly disclosed materials. Such statements may relate to our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results, and give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties, include, but are not limited to: continued uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, financial performance and liquidity, our customers and suppliers, and on the global economy; changes in general economic conditions, in the U.S. or internationally; significant competition on a local, regional, national and international basis; changes in our relationships with our significant customers; changes in the regulatory environment in the U.S. or internationally; increased or more complex physical or data security requirements; legal, regulatory or market responses to global climate change; results of negotiations and ratifications of labor contracts; strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns by our employees; the effects of changing prices of energy, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and interruptions in supplies of these commodities; changes in exchange rates or interest rates; uncertainty from the expected discontinuance of LIBOR and transition to any other interest rate benchmark; our ability to maintain our brand image; our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; breaches in data security; disruptions to the Internet or our technology infrastructure; interruptions in or impacts on our business from natural or man-made events or disasters including terrorist attacks, epidemics or pandemics; our ability to accurately forecast our future capital investment needs; exposure to changing economic, political and social developments in international and emerging markets; changes in business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions that may result in impairment of our assets; increases in our expenses or funding obligations relating to employee health, retiree health and/or pension benefits; potential additional U.S. or international tax liabilities; potential claims or litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures or strategic alliances; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our transformation initiatives; cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results; our ability to manage insurance and claims expenses; and other risks discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and subsequently filed reports. You should consider the limitations on, and risks associated with, forward-looking statements and not unduly rely on the accuracy of predictions contained in such forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances, changes in expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events after the date of those statements. Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP Financial Measures We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including ""adjusted"" compensation and benefits, operating expense, operating profit, operating margin, other income and (expense), income before income taxes, income tax expense, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share. We also supplement the reporting of revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit with non-GAAP measures that exclude the period over period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, pension discount rate changes and hedging activities. Additionally, we periodically disclose free cash flow, free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions, and capital expenditures including principal repayments of finance lease obligations. The equivalent measures determined in accordance with GAAP are also referred to as ""reported"" or ""unadjusted.” We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide additional meaningful information to assist users of our financial statements in understanding our financial results and cash flows and assessing our ongoing performance, because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying operations and may provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. These non-GAAP measures are used internally by management for business unit operating performance analysis, business unit resource allocation and in connection with incentive compensation award determinations. Restructuring and Other Charges Adjusted operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share exclude the impact of charges related to restructuring programs, including Transformation strategy costs and asset impairments. Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Hedging Activities Currency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit. The derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period (including the period over period impact of foreign currency hedging activities). The difference between the current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations. Impact of Changes in Pension Discount Rates Non-GAAP pension discount rate-neutral operating profit excludes the period over period impact of discount rate changes on pension service cost. Pension discount rate-neutral operating profit is calculated by discounting the value of benefits attributable to employee service in the current period utilizing the prior year discount rate applicable to each of our company-sponsored defined benefit plans. The difference between this derived amount and the current period reported service cost is the period over period impact of pension discount rate movements on operating profit. Mark-To-Market Pension and Postretirement Adjustments We recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of other pension income (expense). We supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of gains and losses recognized in excess of the 10% corridor and the related income tax effects. We believe excluding these mark-to-market impacts provides important supplemental information by removing the volatility associated with short-term changes in market interest rates, equity values, and similar factors. This adjusted net periodic benefit cost ($641 million in 2020 and $754 million in 2019) is comparable to the accounting for our defined benefit plans in our quarterly reporting under U.S. GAAP, utilizing the expected return on plan assets (7.70% in 2020 and 7.68% in 2019) and the discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost (3.55% in 2020 and 4.45% in 2019). The unadjusted net periodic benefit cost reflects the actual return on plan assets (12.54% in 2020 and 17.57% in 2019) and the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the December 31 measurement date (2.87% in 2020 and 3.55% in 2019). The deferred income tax effects of these mark-to-market pension and postretirement adjustments are calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction, including the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various U.S. state and non-U.S. jurisdictions, by the adjustments. The blended average of the applicable statutory tax rates in 2020 and 2019 was 24.0% and 23.9%, respectively. Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Capital Expenditures We calculate free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, and plus or minus the net changes in finance receivables and other investing activities. Free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions adds back any discretionary pension contributions made during the period. We believe free cash flow, free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions and free cash flow adjusted for principal repayments of finance lease obligations are important indicators of how much cash is generated by regular business operations and we use them as a measure of incremental cash available to invest in our business, meet our debt obligations and return cash to shareowners. Additionally, we believe that adjusting capital expenditures for principal repayments of finance lease obligations more appropriately reflects the overall cash that we have invested in capital assets. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

2021-01-28	2021-01-28 16:26:24	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Can TFI Avoid Picking Up Where UPS Left Off?	"Can TFI International Inc. succeed when UPS Inc. could not? Beginning July 1 or thereabouts, the rubber will hit the road. UPS' (NYSE: UPS) decision to sell its troubled less-than-truckload (LTL) carrier, UPS Freight, to Montreal-based TFI International (NYSE: TFII) puts the LTL industry, for the most part, in Big Brown's rearview mirror. UPS will no longer spend millions of dollars a year to prop up a noncore business whose margins and operating ratio — the ratio of expenses to revenues — have become embarrassments to a company renowned for its operating efficiency. It will end dealings with 11,500 Teamster workers, an aggressive group who forced UPS to shut down the unit's operations in 2018 over a contract dispute, and whose costs made UPS Freight uncompetitive in a largely nonunion industry. The $800 million in TFI cash for the unit will provide UPS with significant capital to be used to pay down debt or re-invest into faster-growing segments of delivery. In selling, UPS will cut its losses from buying Overnite Transportation Co., the forerunner to UPS Freight, for $1.25 billion in 2005. For TFI, as savvy an operator as there is in trucking, the deal presents opportunities and risks. In terms of geographic reach, the TFI unit, TForce Freight, becomes arguably North America's premier LTL carrier. It adds a sizable U.S. network and Mexican connections to its intra-Canadian and northern border operations. TFI acquires 197 well-maintained North American terminals and 6,340 tractors and trailers. It also gains a little-noticed but well-run dedicated truckload business, which accounts for about 9% of UPS Freight's $3.1 billion in annual revenue. The truckload unit will be embedded with the old Contract Freighters operation that was acquired in 2016 from XPO Logistics Inc. (NYSE: XPO) and that is now headed by Greg Orr, a highly regarded truckload executive. When the deal closes by the end of the second quarter, the TFI unit will be a $4 billion enterprise with the former UPS Freight merged with TFI's existing business. Neither UPS nor TFI would comment for this story. UPS releases its full-year and fourth-quarter 2020 results next Tuesday, and it's almost certain the sale will be a topic of conversation on the subsequent analyst call. TFI has a long-held reputation for maximizing value from its costing and pricing initiatives. It will clearly make some changes at UPS Freight. A small part of a massive parcel-delivery business, UPS Freight was positioned from the start as a loss leader. UPS bundled the unit's services with its higher-margin small-package portfolio, and priced the LTL business below the market with the idea that shippers would send it more parcel business along with the cut-rate LTL traffic. It is unclear whether the strategy was effective in pulling in more parcel business. However, the low rates, combined with labor costs that are 10% to 11% above the industry average and an inability to command premium rates charged by elite rivals Old Dominion Freight Line Inc., (NASDAQ: ODFL), Saia Inc. (NASDAQ: SAIA) and XPO were too heavy a rock for UPS Freight to continue pushing uphill. Based on data that UPS disclosed on Monday, UPS Freight currently has an operating ratio (OR) of 98%, meaning it spends 98 cents for every dollar in revenue. By contrast, Old Dominion, the gold standard for LTL, reported a stunning 74.5% OR in its third quarter. TFI has vowed to drive down TForce Freight's OR to 90% within three years. TFI will also have to contend with a collective bargaining agreement that expires in 2023, and the possible static from a formidable group of Teamsters. TFI, which has said it will honor all existing contracts, has a unionized unit in its portfolio. However, dealing with trucking Teamsters, especially a group that fought a bitter but futile war to organize Overnite from 1999 to 2002, may be different than working with Canadian labor. ""It's like letting a bear in the room,"" said an LTL industry executive. TFI's ability to sustain solid margins may depend on what savings and efficiencies it gleans from the next contract. TFI does not have skin in the parcel game — though it operates a decent-sized last-mile delivery business — and has no motivation to maintain bundles and tolerate cut-rate LTL yields as does UPS. TFI will either raise rates on existing customers or cut them loose entirely, said Jason Seidl, analyst for Cowen & Co. Even with higher rates, TFI may retain more business than expected because former UPS Freight shippers will be hard-pressed to find attractive alternatives in a sector where pricing is firm and carriers have stayed disciplined, Seidl said in a note on Monday. The UPS Freight acquisition is an ""exceptionally rare opportunity (for TFI) to grab nationwide scale in a market that has good secular tailwinds from e-commerce and rail-like pricing,"" Seidl said. TFI is Cowen's top trucking pick, and Seidl significantly raised his 2021 and 2022 estimates in the wake of the acquisition and bullish macro trends. He also raised TFI's 12-month target to $82 a share from $53. Lance Healy, co-founder of Banyan Technology, an IT provider to the LTL sector, said the TFI unit will be free to ""review and realign pricing agreements, especially those that may have been influenced to attract a higher parcel spend."" This ""liberation from outside influences"" augurs positively for TFI as long as it pursues opportunities with a steady hand, Healy said. For its part, TFI is bullish on the prospects of managing such a vast LTL network. In a 15-page presentation posted on its website, TFI said the transaction is expected to be accretive to diluted earnings-per-share results in 2021, and will be ""substantially accretive over time."" The company has made 90 acquisitions in the past 12 years, and its shares have risen, on a cumulative basis, 9,604% in the past 20 years. That blows away comparable returns from its peer group, the S&P 500, and the Toronto Stock Exchange's TSX. Although UPS is shedding LTL ownership, it is far from exiting the segment. Under the terms of a ""transition services agreement,"" UPS will, for at least the next five years, resell a UPS Freight offering for TFI known as Ground Freight Pricing, where a grouping of parcels weighing more than 150 pounds and not requiring palletization moves through UPS' parcel processing network but is priced as cheaper LTL consignments. The program, considered the only one of its kind in LTL, generates about 12% of UPS Freight's $3.1 billion in annual revenue. The reselling agreement puts UPS in the unusual role of acting like a general sales agent on behalf of another company. UPS' involvement with TFI won't stop there. For the next three years, it will provide unspecified back-office support to the new operation. UPS will also retain all assets and liabilities relating to pension, retirement and other benefits for the unit's 14,500 former employees until the deal closes. For now, left unanswered is what benefits UPS will receive from TFI for reselling and for back-office services, and why it remains involved with the TFI operation at all. One theory is that UPS does not want to dismantle the bundled relationships where it has access to the small-package traffic that is its bread and butter.

2021-01-26	2021-01-26 14:42:03	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS To Divest Freight Business For $800M; Shares Rise 3%	United Parcel Service has agreed to sell its freight business to TFI International in a deal worth $800 million. Shares advanced almost 3% in Monday’s afternoon trading. UPS (UPS) said that the decision to divest its freight business was taken following the evaluation of its business portfolio and its strategic positioning of “better not bigger.” The logistics giant expects to incur a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $500 million related to the UPS Freight sale on its consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020. The transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of this year. Additionally, UPS has also entered into a separate agreement with TFI that will allow UPS Freight to continue to deploy UPS’ domestic package network for five years. “We’re excited about the future and the opportunities this creates for both UPS and UPS Freight as part of TFI International Inc.,” UPS CEO Carol Tomé stated. “The agreement allows UPS to be even more laser-focused on the core parts of our business that drive the greatest value for our customers.” UPS Freight generated estimated revenue of $3.1 billion in FY20 on an operating loss of $463 million. The logistics company expects to announce its 4Q20 results on Feb. 2. (See UPS stock analysis on TipRanks) Earlier this month, Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski reiterated a Sell rating on the stock but raised the price target from $145 to $155. Oglenski noted that, “solid peak fundamentals point to upside for Q4, but investors will be more focused on profitability.” Overall, analysts are cautiously optimistic about the stock and the consensus is a Moderate Buy with 9 analysts recommending a Buy, 2 analysts suggesting a Hold, and 3 analysts recommending a Sell. The average price target of $180.15 implies 11.7% upside potential to current levels.

2021-01-25	2021-01-25 17:20:54	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Sells Trucking Unit Under CEO’s ‘Better-Not-Bigger’ Vow	(Bloomberg) -- United Parcel Service Inc. agreed to sell its short-haul trucking business for $800 million, the first substantial move in the “better-not-bigger” strategy that Carol Tome developed since taking over as chief executive officer in June.Canada’s TFI International Inc. will acquire the unit, one of the largest less-than-truckload carriers in the U.S., UPS said in a statement Monday. The eight-decades-old operation, separate from the package deliveries for which UPS is known, is primarily a business-to-business enterprise hauling large industrial cargo in big trucks.Tome’s plan to get lean is a change from 2005, when UPS paid about $1.25 billion for the trucking unit in an effort to become a one-stop shop for transportation services. She has pledged to increase return on capital investment by focusing on the core parcel business, brand and culture while maintaining UPS’s dividend and investment-grade credit rating. Everything else is under review, Tome said in July.TFI expects the acquisition will add to earnings this year and will increase profit as the company improves efficiency. “This is the most strategic acquisition that TFI has ever done,” CEO Alain Bedard said on a conference call with analysts.Its stock surged 24% to C$80.74 at 11:49 a.m. in Toronto after climbing 30%, the most intraday since December 1999. TFI had advanced 45% in the 12 months through Jan. 22, while the S&P/TSX benchmark index gained 1.4%. UPS rose 1.5% to $161.40 in New York on Monday.Core BusinessMonday’s “agreement allows UPS to be even more laser-focused on the core parts of our business that drive the greatest value for our customers,” Tome said in the statement. The Atlanta-based company will take a $500 million charge related to the sale, which is expected to close in the second quarter.The unit had sales of about $3.1 billion and 14,500 workers last year, according to a UPS presentation. It operated 6,340 tractors and 23,400 trailers in 197 facilities.The business, whose customers include Best Buy Co., Honda Motor Co. and Home Depot Inc., has a “roughly break-even” operating margin, according to TFI. The unit moved cargo at below market rates and was a loss leader for UPS so the courier could offer a bundle of services to customers, Bedard said. He intends to increase prices while retaining customers.Bedard plans to reduce costs by purchasing new vehicles that are more efficient and by streamlining cross-border freight between the U.S. and Canada, among other things. The St Laurent, Quebec, company, which had a market value of C$7.54 billion ($5.91 billion) from Monday’s stock surge, expects to increase sales in Mexico as well.“This opens a lot of opportunity for us,” said Bedard, whose company has made more than 90 acquisitions since 2008. The unit will continue to provide service to UPS under a five-year agreement.The sale won’t affect UPS’s package-delivery business’s operations and will raise the company’s operating margin by 0.2 percentage point, the courier said.(Updates with TFI chief executive’s comment in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-sell-trucking-unit-under-145842951.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-01-25	2021-01-25 13:30:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	TFI International to Acquire US$3 Billion Revenue LTL Carrier UPS Freight in Approximately US$800 Million Enterprise Value Transaction	– Combined LTL networks in the United States and Canada projected to provide most extensive North American coverage, accelerating industrial and e-commerce growth opportunities – – TFI expects the transaction to be accretive to diluted EPS in 2021 – – Transaction expected to close in the second quarter of 2021 – MONTREAL, Jan. 25, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TFI International Inc. (NYSE and TSX: TFII), a North American leader in the transportation and logistics industry, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire UPS Freight, the less-than-truckload (LTL) and dedicated truckload (TL) divisions of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS), for US$800 million on a cash-free, debt-free basis before working capital and other adjustments. Approximately 90% of the acquired business will operate independently within TFI International’s LTL business segment under its new name, “TForce Freight”, while acquired dedicated TL assets will join TFI’s TL business segment. The transaction is subject to usual and customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Alain Bédard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of TFI International, commented on the transaction, “We are pleased to announce this highly strategic transaction that will strengthen our service offerings to customers as well as our ongoing relationship with UPS. Our strategy of operating independent business units with a high degree of accountability is well-suited for building on UPS Freight’s strengths and improving margins over time. TForce Freight will continue to serve UPS’ ongoing LTL distribution needs, and UPS will continue to provide freight volumes and other services to TForce Freight after the transaction for a base term of five years. We also look forward to offering expanded strategic network opportunities to UPS in Canada. This transaction is a ‘win-win’, allowing TFI to continue our strategic expansion across the US and aligning with UPS’ ‘Better not Bigger’ strategic positioning.” Mr. Bedard continued, “We’re excited by this very attractive opportunity to extend our longstanding record of successful growth through acquisition, which will vault TFI International to one of the largest North American LTL carriers. The assets acquired include a network of 197 facilities (147 of which are owned), and combined with TFI’s Canadian LTL operations, will create what we believe to be North America’s single most comprehensive LTL network, especially as we continue our expansion into Mexico leveraging our existing LTL brokerage operations there. Given our soon to be expanded, comprehensive and highly efficient network, we’re eager to work with our new colleagues to optimize performance and are very pleased to welcome the entire UPS Freight family to TFI International.” “In particular, we see compelling opportunities to improve TForce Freight’s efficiency and productivity and apply our proven business model to drive long-term value creation. We look forward to the new TForce Freight thriving in the years ahead under the TFI International umbrella,” Mr. Bedard concluded. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTSUPS Freight generated approximately US$3 billion in revenue in 2020 and was approximately breakeven from an operating income perspective. The transaction is expected to be accretive to diluted EPS in 2021. Going forward, TFI International expects to realize significant near- and long-term opportunities to improve TForce Freight’s operating margin through separate management of LTL and dedicated TL businesses, operating efficiencies and providing superior products to our customers. The base enterprise value of the transaction is US$800 million on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to closing adjustments and customary post-closing true-ups. UPS will retain responsibility for all pre-closing pension obligations, taxes, and accident and workers’ compensation liability claims and costs. TFI intends to make targeted investments in the LTL fleet in the first 12 months following the transaction, lowering maintenance costs, improving both efficiency and safety, and enhancing customer service and driver satisfaction. TIMING AND APPROVALSThe transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of both TFI and UPS and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021 subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals.

2021-01-15	2021-01-15 10:00:17	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Keeps Buying Pricey Jets After Promising a Drone Fleet	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is opening warehouses and shipping hubs in the U.S. at the rate of about one every 24 hours. The ultimate aim is to ensure that virtually every product the company sells is a van ride—and eventually a drone flight—away from customers’ homes. And yet, last week Amazon announced it was buying 11 Boeing 767-300 jets for its air-cargo division, mostly to get products to Prime subscribers.Despite creating algorithms to anticipate shoppers’ needs and opening all those warehouses, Amazon can’t meet its one- and two-day shipping pledge to customers without an ever-expanding fleet of pricey jets. That reality has become clearer since the pandemic fueled a surge in online shopping that has strained the resources of United Parcel Service Inc., FedEx Corp. and the U.S. Postal Service—forcing Amazon to pick up the slack. Inside the company, Amazon Air is sometimes considered more of an expensive necessity than an asset. An organization bent on delivering orders quickly and efficiently would rather move products by truck than plane, which costs as much as seven times more. Employees have internalized this fact with a typically Amazonian mantra: “Air is a defect.” It doesn’t help that many of the planes Amazon flies are older models that spew more greenhouse gases than newer, more fuel-efficient planes, undermining a newfound commitment to battling climate change. The same day it announced the 767 order, Amazon flew 153 flights—the equivalent of one takeoff every nine minutes—among 40 airports stretching from Germany to southern California, according to data from Plane Finder, a flight tracker. When the 11 newly purchased jets have entered service by the end of next year, Amazon Air will have a fleet of 85 planes.The expanded air-cargo operation will add billions of dollars to already hefty shipping costs that amounted to $52 billion in the 12 months ended in September. Though Amazon is one of the wealthiest and most valuable companies in the world, it has historically operated on razor-thin margins and plowed cash back into the business, sometimes to the consternation of investors who’d rather see the company focus on profitability.Maju Kuruvilla, a former Amazon logistics executive and now chief technology officer of e-commerce startup Bolt Financial Inc., says his former employer has no choice in the matter. “The entire UPS, FedEx network was jammed” during the peak of the 2020 holiday season, he says. “So imagine if 50% of Amazon’s packages got added to this existing network? It would have been a disaster for everyone. Everyone should be glad Amazon built this network.”Amazon, typically tight-lipped about its future plans, shared background information on its investments and fleet, but a spokesperson declined requests for on-the-record interviews.Veil of SecrecyFor many years, Amazon was a kind of logistical middleman, receiving bottles of shampoo or crates of books from suppliers, storing them and, when a customer clicked Buy Now, handing the packages off to UPS, the USPS or FedEx. Then in December 2013, a combination of foul weather and logistical bottlenecks derailed holiday deliveries and forced Amazon to issue refunds to irate shoppers. It was an unprecedented setback for a company that puts customers at the center of everything. Not long after, Amazon began expanding its supply chain and building its own transportation network.A handful of warehouses grew to hundreds, and Amazon established relationships with small trucking firms and air-cargo operators. In 2015, the company began chartering its own regular cargo flights, under a veil of secrecy that featured code names and packages wrapped in black plastic to obscure Amazon’s identity, from a little used airport in southern Ohio. Called Prime Air when the company introduced its first branded jet in 2016, then renamed to avoid confusion with the yet-to-launch drone fleet, Amazon Air is led by Sarah Rhoads. She’s a former U.S. Navy F-18 pilot who flew combat missions during the Iraq War before starting a second career managing workers who pack and ship items in one of Amazon's warehouses. Rhoads went on to oversee Amazon's warehouse network in the U.K., before being tapped to lead Amazon Air a year after its formal  launch.The budding air cargo operations quickly began flying dozens of planes, a build-out that coincided with the hiring of contractors to drive tens of thousands of branded blue delivery vans. In 2019, FedEx and Amazon parted ways, declining to renew both air- and ground-delivery contracts. At the time, FedEx said Amazon accounted for less than 1.3% of its revenue, making the break less painful.That increased the stakes for UPS. Soon after the split, the company reported a 30% jump in next-day air volume. In 2019, the courier outlined the magnitude of its relationship with Amazon for the first time, saying in a filing that Amazon accounted for almost a fifth of its U.S. sales, making the internet retailer by far UPS’s largest customer.The spike in orders during the pandemic put enormous pressure on UPS and forced it to raise prices. During this year’s peak holiday season, UPS and FedEx also imposed volume quotas on large retailers to prevent their networks from being overwhelmed. In some cases, UPS stopped picking up packages immediately, delaying shipments until it had sufficient capacity.  Last month, both UPS and FedEx said they would keep levying the surcharges indefinitely. Weeks later, Amazon announced the jet order. UPS-Like ServiceAmazon Air is much smaller than the air-cargo divisions operated by UPS, which had about 260 jets at the end of 2019, and FedEx, which operated 398 at the end of May. Unlike those companies, Amazon doesn’t operate its planes, relying on contractors to fly and maintain them and negotiate with the pilots’ unions, a task that union-averse Amazon would likely prefer to avoid. Amazon started a UPS-like parcel service in the U.K. last year, but abandoned a similar effort in the U.S. amid the surge in online orders. Much of Wall Street believes Amazon will eventually fly packages for other companies to defray investments in Amazon Air  and generate new revenue streams, much the way it did with other logistics services and its cloud-computing division.“I absolutely expect them to pick that up again,’’ says Ravi Shanker, a Morgan Stanley logistics and transportation analyst.But for now, Amazon Air ships items already in its warehouses, typically bound for customers. The shoppers on the receiving end likely ordered the items using one of Amazon’s quick-delivery options, but not same-day delivery. (If an item appears on Amazon’s website as eligible for same-day or one-day delivery, Amazon says, there’s a good chance it’s already stored in a nearby warehouse.)Say a shopper in Los Angeles orders a limited-edition stuffed giraffe for a child’s birthday and requests free two-day shipping. Amazon only stocks the rare item in a Chicago warehouse but is prepared to fly it across half the country. Workers in Chicago put the toy in a box and have it trucked to Amazon’s air hub at Rockford International Airport, where it’s added to a pallet in the hold of a waiting plane. After the flight to Ontario, in southern California, a truck takes the package to an Amazon sorting center, where it’s piled with other packages bound for a single zip code and delivered, likely by an Amazon contractor driving a blue van.It’s a complicated and pricey choreography, but customers get what they want.“We have to make sure we have the ability to satisfy one, two-day delivery,” David Bozeman, a vice president who leads Amazon’s transportation services group, said in an August interview, describing Amazon Air’s mission. “This is one mode and method of helping us to do that. It certainly is a big part.”The fleet operates almost exclusively in the U.S. But Amazon, which has operated charter flights between European cities for years, started building its own network on the continent last year with leased planes flown by ASL Airlines, and a hub at Leipzig/Halle airport in Germany.Jet Buyer’s MarketBesides pushing millions of shoppers online, the pandemic crushed travel and prompted airlines to move up the retirement of their older and less efficient jets. Suddenly the used plane business was a buyer’s market.  Amazon in June announced a lease for 12 planes from Air Transport Services Group Inc. A couple of months later, plane spotters noticed that Amazon had registered in its name four Boeing 767s previously owned by WestJet Airlines Ltd., though the company declined at the time to confirm it had purchased the planes. Another seven of the wide-body aircraft, owned by Delta Air Lines Inc., were sitting in desert aircraft storage in Arizona and California when Amazon came calling.New 767 freighters carry a list price of about $200 million, though airlines typically receive discounts. Aviation consultants estimate Amazon may have paid as little as $10 million apiece for its latest planes. Converting them to cargo use—ripping out the seats, reinforcing the flooring, installing cargo doors—costs about $14 million per plane, according to Laurent Rouaud, co-founder of Avworks Partners, an aviation consulting firm. Amazon, Delta and WestJet declined to disclose the purchase prices.If it wasn’t clear before, Amazon’s decision to purchase planes indicates the company’s long-term commitment to operating its fleet. Another milestone arrives later this year, when Amazon’s $1.5 billion cargo terminal at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky airport comes online, giving the company the means to support more than 100 planes at a hub that sits a day’s ride on a truck, or a much shorter flight, from most people in the U.S. (The new facility is also close to major air hubs for UPS and DHL).That gives Amazon more options, which employees say is a recurring strategic goal in everything from office space and temp firms to suppliers of essential products. The logic explains why Amazon’s delivery depots are served by several bespoke contractors and why the company runs its cargo airline through a handful of airline partners, in most of which Amazon has the option of buying minority stakes.Even as Amazon expands its air-cargo division, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos remains fixated on his ultimate dream: building a network so sophisticated it can get just about anything to a customer’s doorstep in 30 minutes or less. One day his vision will bring another air carrier to life, the Prime Now drone fleet, that along with autonomous vehicles and electric vans could make it less necessary to fly stuffed giraffes across the country. For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-keeps-buying-pricey-jets-100017064.html?.tsrc=rss

Some companies have specifically said they would no longer be financially supporting Republican politicians who protested the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's November victory.The Republican Party has long been known as the party of big business, but some businesses appear to be growing increasingly leery of the direction in which the GOP is headed.Prior to the Capitol riots, some Republican politicians have adopted increasingly populist stances on issues such as international trade and immigration that aren't necessarily aligned with the best interests of their corporate donors.Related Link: Twitter Boots Trump, Stock Falls: What Investors Need To KnowCutting Off The Cash Flow: In the 2020 election season, corporate PACs donated an estimated $205 million to Republican candidates and committees compared to $155 million for Democratic candidates.Telecom giant AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) is so far the largest political donor to change or suspend its political contributions. AT&T donated $2.65 million in the 2020 election cycle but recently announced changes to its political donation strategy in the wake of the riots.""Employees on our Federal PAC board convened a call today and decided to suspend contributions to members of Congress who voted to object to the certification of Electoral College votes last week,"" AT&T said in a statement.Other companies, like United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS), are temporarily scrapping political donations altogether, at least until the political climate calms down. UPS reportedly donated $1.7 million to PACs in 2020.""We are appalled by the lawlessness and violence that unfolded at the U.S. Capitol and strongly condemn the actions of those individuals who participated in the illegal activities that destroyed property and cost lives,"" UPS said.Companies Taking A Stand: Here is a list of some of the other companies that have adjusted their political donation strategy following the riots -- along with an annotation of whether they have suspended political donations entirely or are simply withholding donations to election certification objectors. * AT&T: objectors only. * UPS: all donations. * Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA): objectors only. * Deloitte: all donations. * Verizon Communications Inc.

2021-01-05	2021-01-05 15:30:41	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Makes First Aircraft Purchase to Expand Cargo Network	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is buying 11 used Boeing 767-300 planes, the first time the online retail giant has purchased, rather than leased, aircraft for its fast-growing air cargo operation.The company on Tuesday said it was buying seven aircraft from Delta Air Lines Inc. and four from WestJet Airlines Ltd. The WestJet aircraft are currently being converted from passenger to cargo use and will join Amazon’s fleet this year. The Delta jets will start flying routes in 2022. By the end of next year, Amazon expects to have more than 85 planes in service, a spokesperson said.Seattle-based Amazon has rapidly expanded its air cargo operations in recent years, part of an effort to speed up delivery of packages to customers and supplement capacity from such carriers as United Parcel Service Inc.As Amazon has built up its own delivery operation, which includes tens of thousands of cargo vans, the company has gone out of its way to highlight its continued reliance on other cargo companies. But Amazon already handles most of its own deliveries and has emerged as competitor to partners that only a few years ago delivered almost all of the company’s goods. FedEx Corp. in 2019 said it wouldn’t renew its air-delivery contract with Amazon.A report last year estimated that Amazon’s fleet would likely grow to 200 aircraft in the coming years, rivaling UPS in size. Amazon operates mostly from smaller, regional airports close to its warehouses, routing packages between locations to accommodate quick delivery.The deals announced Tuesday mark the second time Amazon has taken advantage of the depressed market for aircraft since the Covid-19 pandemic crippled air travel and sent many aircraft into storage. In June, Amazon said it was leasing an additional 12 planes. As with the leased planes, the newly purchased aircraft will be operated by contractors.“Our goal is to continue delivering for customers across the U.S. in the way that they expect from Amazon, and purchasing our own aircraft is a natural next step toward that goal,” Sarah Rhoads, the vice president who runs Amazon’s air fleet, said in a statement. “Having a mix of both leased and owned aircraft in our growing fleet allows us to better manage our operations, which in turn helps us to keep pace in meeting our customer promises.”(Updates with Amazon fleet size and background, starting in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-makes-first-aircraft-purchase-153041446.html?.tsrc=rss

Given that they having the same transportation end markets and comparable revenues, it's striking that UPS has a valuation that's slightly more than twice that of FedEx.

2020-12-30	2020-12-30 14:12:36	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	How COVID Vaccine Transport Will Reshape Freight Tech	"* The coronavirus pandemic has boosted demand for digital freight solutions.   * COVID-19 vaccine transport may do the same for pharmaceutical logistics software and hardware.The massive undertaking that is COVID-19 vaccine transport raises questions about how the historic event might impact freight-tech companies that have already pivoted and rebranded in response to the pandemic and other disruptions that have shaped the goods movement markets over the past few years.But don't start writing code for new temperature-monitoring algorithms just yet, experts caution.While there are ""huge opportunities"" in vaccine distribution, few of those opportunities will fall in the laps of new companies built to solve that problem, said Jake Medwell, founding partner of 8VC a venture capital firm that invests in new technologies, including digital freight platforms. (Disclosure: 8VC is a FreightWaves investor.)That is not to say that the vaccine won't hasten innovation in freight tech. Building on emerging cold chain solutions and burgeoning interest in pharmaceutical logistics, new and existing players are ramping up GPS and temperature-tracking technologies to deploy in vaccine transport and beyond.""You can't just spin up a company like that overnight,"" Medwell said. ""What you're going to have is a lot of companies that already provide temperature monitoring on a certain scale now figure out how to do it on a much larger scale.""Among the key legacy players is UPS (NYSE: UPS). Charged with transporting millions of vaccine shipments, the logistics giant is monitoring the doses in a newly dedicated 24/7 Healthcare Command Center that collects data from all sources, a spokesperson told FreightWaves.These include tracking sensors and temperature sensors on the exterior and interior of the vaccine packages, each of which carries a UPS-exclusive active tag, according to the spokesperson, providing visibility in the network.The tag, part of the UPS Premier solution launched a little over a year ago to improve smart tech for health care and life science customers, uses RFID technology to provide location information to the Command Center. Internally UPS has designed software that can detect network disruptions before they occur and recommend countermeasures in real time, the spokesperson added. (He declined to provide the name of the company supporting the RFID solution.)IoT providers see opportunityFor some time now, IoT companies have been providing visibility and tracking solutions to fleets, starting with ELDs and expanding to applications including GPS tracking, trailer tracking, video, fuel efficiency — and cold chain.One of the more established new IoT entrants, Samsara, has been creating cold chain solutions for more than four years, and its technology is currently being used by customers for vaccine distribution as well as industries like food and beverage, Neel Sheth, Samsara's director of product management, told FreightWaves in an email.The system consists of environmental monitors that detect temperatures from minus 55 to 100 degrees Celsius in real time, and integrations with companies like Thermo King, where Samsara technology allows for remote reefer monitoring and control.Since COVID struck last spring, Samsara has seen an increase in interest for a variety of remote monitoring solutions, Sheth noted.He said he expects temperature monitoring to ""follow a similar pattern,"" as demand for vaccine delivery expands ""and delivery networks need to start reaching further out from cities to more remote locations.""Sheth added that for customers involved in vaccine distribution, temperature monitoring is just one part of the solution. Other factors that need to be accounted for include planning and handoffs between pickups and drop-offs to ensure on-time delivery under time and temperature constraints, and being able to log historical temperature data to ensure quality and compliance.""For this reason, customers are looking for full platform solutions that can keep up with the increasing demand and pressure,"" said Sheth.Biopharmaceutical shipments: The next big thingThe pharmaceutical drugs and biologics logistics market reached a value of nearly $69 billion in 2019, and is expected to is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3% from 2020 to 2027. In addition to the COVID-19 crisis, factors fueling the booming market include demand for prescription home delivery and other vaccines and blood products that require cold chain shipment.So while there may be limited opportunities for new startups to tap into the  COVID vaccine-specific transport market, pharmaceutical transport writ large is another story. Medwell, for one, is bullish. ""It's one of the spaces I'm most excited about,"" he said, noting that while the logistics industry as a whole is ""very low margin and very large,"" health care and cold supply chain are much more detail oriented and much higher-margin areas.""That's where entrepreneurs should probably be focusing,"" he commented. ""Higher margin means more to work with, more to capture.""Small but determinedWhile the established players may have certain advantages in this space, some early-stage startups appear to be moving in that direction nonetheless, with COVID vaccine transport as a catalyst.Two years ago, a couple of ex-Walmart veterans founded a digital freight matching platform, Hwy Haul, for fresh produce that connects shippers (farmers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers) directly with truckers. The platform also provides real-time load tracking, temperature and humidity monitoring.Now the team sees another possible application.Temperature control monitoring is going to be the most important aspect of vaccine logistics across the world depending upon each vaccine's temperature threshold, Hwy Haul co-founder Syed Aman said in an email. (Notably, the first vaccine to be shipped, the Pfizer vaccine, needs to be stored at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit.)Moreover, Aman added, the vaccines are transported in specialized containers designed to maintain low temperatures. Those containers get transported from trucks to planes and then back to trucks before they reach distribution centers.""We see an opportunity to create an integrated solution to report temperatures not only from trailers,"" Aman commented, ""but also from the containers to be shown to all the parties involved on a real-time basis.""Krenar Komoni, CEO of Tive, a supply chain visibility platform that closed a $12 million seed round this month, said its current line of tracking devices can measure temperatures down to minus 40 Celsius, but the startup is now investing in a new product that will measure temperatures down to minus 100 Celsius.Two global logistics companies that will be engaged in vaccine distribution are testing Tive devices, according to Komoni.Wide open marketThey and other players large and small may  — for now at least — find the room they need to maneuver.Unlike many freight-tech sectors, the pharmaceutical logistics space is not particularly crowded right now, according to Medwell, reiterating the attention to detail needed to execute in this area.Plus, the pandemic has compressed the timelines pharmaceutical companies are working with, opening up opportunities for innovation in transporting therapeutics.""For the first time these corporations are partnering for innovation as they don't have the bandwidth, expertise, or capability in-house to meet demand,"" said Medwell, noting that he has spent the past couple of years in conversation with pharmaceutical firms to understand their internal processes.""

2020-12-22	2020-12-22 17:54:25	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Delays Hike in Fees It Charges Merchants Until June	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. says it will delay raising fees it charges independent sellers to store and ship items until June, a gesture to merchants who have sometimes bristled at the rising costs of doing business with the company.In a blog post to sellers, Jeff Wilke, the outgoing chief executive officer of Amazon’s retail unit, noted that other logistics companies have already announced fee increases. “In a normal year we’d be doing the same,” he wrote. “But this isn’t a normal year and we’ve made the decision to postpone our annual fulfillment fee adjustments and continue to absorb the costs we are incurring on your behalf.”Many merchants are encouraged to use the company’s Fulfillment by Amazon service, which stores, packs and ships products to customers’ homes. Amazon says the expansion of its delivery network and services has been good for sellers because they can reach more customers more easily.But merchants have complained to regulators in the U.S. and the European Union that they have a one-sided relationship with the world’s largest online retailer. Besides paying Amazon to handle shipping, many sellers feel compelled to buy advertising to make their products stand out on Amazon.com. Bloomberg reported last year that, all told, their costs can sometimes account for as much as 40% of each sale.Amazon typically announces changes to its fees in December, to take effect early the next year. In each of the last four years, that’s meant increased costs for many U.S. sellers who use the Seattle-based company’s storage and delivery services. Amazon also occasionally reduces fees for some services, a spokesman said.In early 2020, Amazon raised fees to ship items by 2.9% to 6.1% for the most common small items. Monthly rent to store items in Amazon’s warehouses for most of the year climbed 8.7%. (Storage costs during the holiday season were unchanged.) The current pause in changes to the fees runs through June 1 and applies to sellers in the U.S., Europe and Japan.United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. both announced a 4.9% general rate increase for 2021 on package deliveries, in line with previous hikes. On top of that, both couriers plan to apply surcharges indefinitely on some package categories beginning in mid-January as the pandemic-induced swell of residential deliveries continues into 2021.The couriers are counting on higher fees to make up for a market shift toward more residential rather than commercial deliveries, which are more profitable because business customers tend to be clustered closer together and receive more boxes at each stop.Amazon’s Wilke said the company would share more details on its plans for fees in the spring. “We are doing this because we want to provide stability and support for you during what will likely remain a challenging winter as vaccine distribution gets underway,” he said.

2020-12-22	2020-12-22 14:07:55	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	COVID Vaccine Delivery Drivers May Be Busy Christmas Day	"FedEx and UPS are delivering COVID-19 vaccines to many more locations this week as the logistics campaign behind the nationwide immunization program continues to scale up and settle into a predictable rhythm.And they may not stop for Christmas. The recently approved Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) vaccine is going to 3,400 locations on Monday and Tuesday, with an additional 1,000 administration sites receiving Pfizer Inc.'s (NYSE: PFE) vaccine, said U.S. Army General Gus Perna, who heads the Operation Warp Speed task force orchestrating the outbound supply chain, during a press briefing Monday.The number of drop sites is more than the 3,285 previously mentioned for the Moderna shipments, and the total number of locations is much more than the 636 sites that received the Pfizer vaccine during the first half of last week. At least 1,300 long-term care facilities are on tap to receive the drugs after officials mostly targeted health care facilities and medical workers during week one.Trucks began picking up the Moderna shipments on Sunday at distribution centers operated by health care specialist McKesson Corp. (NYSE: MCK). Warehouse workers packed insulated containers holding the vials and special cold packs into boxes and loaded them on FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and UPS (NYSE: UPS) vehicles.Subcontractors, such as Boyle Transportation and XPO Logistics (NYSE: XPO) for UPS, are also helping transport the vaccines to airports and other transfer points. Perna said he isn't involved with them, letting the prime contractors coordinate and hold their partners  accountable.The plan is to keep delivering through Thursday, but if states ask for shipments to meet a need, ""industry is ready to go with delivery on Christmas Day to make sure everyone has access to the vaccine,"" Perna said.He praised the ""Herculean effort"" of the manufacturers, McKesson and the express carriers.""This weekend when most of America tried to take a couple days off, these industry partners worked to make sure vaccines were properly stored, packed, labeled and moved into distribution places so that we can deliver on a regular basis as orders occur,"" Perna said. Officials expressed confidence that they will have allocated 20 million doses to states by the end of the year, with deliveries completed during the first week of January.Up to 50 million are likely to get their first vaccine dose by the end of January, with 100 million shots, including a follow-on booster, administered by March.Operation Warp Speed's goal is to establish a regular rhythm of deliveries, with increased quantities each week, Perna stressed.The command center will notify states on Tuesdays of their individual allocations from the available stocks so they can prepare designated sites to receive and administer the vaccine. The orders are locked on Thursdays and late orders will get shipped after the first wave the following week.Quality controls protect cold chainPerna stressed that open communication between all industry partners and the government was critical to ironing out any kinks and making accurate, on-time deliveries.""We want to make sure from the strategic, to the operational, to the tactical level everybody is synched and nested, and that we get stronger on that every day,"" Perna said.""It's been powerful to watch the collaboration between Pfizer, Moderna and McKesson, and UPS and FedEx,"" he added. ""It's really spectacular to see the senior leaders of these organizations personally be involved in this effort. So what I have a lot of confidence in is the quality control that is being executed by these companies to ensure that the vaccine arrives safely and ready to administer.""Those quality controls became apparent last week when four trays of the Pfizer vaccine drifted out of their optimal temperature range of minus 70 degrees Celsius. As previously reported, when logisticians noticed temperature probes wirelessly sending readings of minus 92 degrees C, they immediately alerted the delivery-van drivers to return the shipments and sent replacement doses.Perna said Monday and over the weekend that Pfizer analyzed the vaccines and determined the colder temperature had no effect on the product, but the decision to reroute was made as a precaution. He theorized the temperature anomaly could have resulted from dry ice shifting in the box during transport and creating colder pockets in certain areas.""The key to this is the diligence and the professionalism and the immediacy which Pfizer reacted in combination with FedEx and UPS. They have a remarkable ability to [view their networks]. Take control. Quarantine. Return and replace the vaccine. It was just spectacular. And I applaud everybody involved with that,"" Perna said.Click here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.RELATED NEWS:McKesson distribution centers ship first Moderna COVID-19 vaccinesFedEx, UPS mobilize to deliver Moderna COVID vaccineXPO Logistics provides truck transport for Pfizer vaccineMore than 3,000 sites to receive Moderna COVID vaccineFedEx, UPS trucks depart with first Pfizer COVID vaccinesDelta Air Lines moves Pfizer vaccine on passenger flightsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * AIT Worldwide Logistics Buys German Forwarder Fiege  * Global Visibility Platform project44 Raises 0M(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

UPS Continues Support of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution	UPS partners with McKesson to transport and deliver the Moderna COVID-19 vaccineATLANTA, Dec. 18, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UPS (NYSE:UPS) continues its involvement with COVID-19 vaccine delivery efforts through a partnership with global pharmaceutical and medical supply distributor McKesson. Through contracts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response to support Operation Warp Speed, McKesson is the centralized distributor for non-ultra-frozen COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits.

2020-12-18	2020-12-18 13:30:19	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Retailers Should Brace for a Tidal Wave of Returns	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Americans are in the final sprint of a record year of e-commerce spending, filling their digital carts with holiday gifts and decor in a year when public health concerns are keeping them away from stores. That online haul, though, foreshadows an unfortunate aftershock for retailers: A potentially unprecedented deluge of merchandise returns.Online purchases have long had higher rates of returns than those for goods bought in stores, for obvious reasons: When you don’t try on or test a product before buying, you’re more likely to make a regrettable purchase.(1) With e-commerce spending expected to grow 35.8% in the U.S. this holiday season, the safe bet is that returns will surge, too. Optoro, a so-called reverse logistics company that helps retailers manage returns, estimates $115 billion of merchandise will be returned between Thanksgiving and the end of January, compared with an estimate of $100 billion last year.  This creates fresh challenges for stores whose supply chains and in-stock positions have been strained for the better part of a year by greater demand in their e-commerce channels. The ones that adapted to higher return volumes early in the pandemic and have worked to make the experience more seamless for shoppers are better positioned to weather the onslaught. Even before the pandemic, managing returns was a feat of logistical acrobatics, given that some items can be put back on shelves, some must be refurbished, and others go to landfills. Now, though, the choreography has new twists. Consumers are returning bigger items such as furniture and appliances. Sender Shamiss, the chief executive officer of reverse logistics provider goTRG, said the size of items returned is up more than 200% since the pandemic began. That’s just one cause of a space crunch: Tobin Moore, CEO of Optoro, said his company has been working to help retailers find temporary space to house and process returns because they have had to reconfigure areas normally used for this purpose to fulfill outgoing online orders. Meanwhile, when e-commerce becomes a larger share of a retailer’s business, there’s a chance that more inventory that could otherwise be sold is being trapped temporarily in the returns process. This is especially true with clothing, a category where shoppers frequently engage in a practice known as “bracketing,” or ordering multiple sizes and colors with the intention of keeping only one. Each day a returned Christmas sweater sits in a truck or warehouse before being restocked, the chance of a retailer selling it at full price dwindles.Finally, before the pandemic, shoppers often preferred making e-commerce returns at brick-and-mortar stores, which are open at convenient hours and offer instant refunds. But now that they are consolidating store visits to avoid potential exposure to the coronavirus, some are most likely taking different paths, including mailing returns or bringing them to a neighborhood pickup point.  Such changes could result in higher shipping costs for chains that offer free returns or deprive them of a chance to sell customers something else when they set foot in the brick-and-mortar shop.Together, these dynamics create the potential for big headaches for retailers, including higher costs and lower sales. So it’s a good thing that many are rolling out changes to their systems for returns that can help make the operation more efficient while also helping ease some key consumer frustrations. If you have returned an online purchase this holiday season, perhaps you’ve done so with a QR code by dropping off your goods at a UPS Store or other location, having the code scanned and walking out. (Depending on the retailer, you may or may not have had to box up the goods before dropping them off.) This format is becoming used more widely; Narvar, a company whose technology helps retailers manage returns, said in a report it has seen a 60% increase in use of QR code returns since the onset of the pandemic.  In part, the move to embrace QR code returns is about pleasing customers, who say packaging up boxes and printing labels are frustrating parts of returning online orders. But it’s not all about keeping shoppers happy. With QR code returns, retailers don’t have to pay to print return labels for every order. With box-less returns, the jeans a customer just brought back can be bundled with the scarf somebody else just dropped off, creating fewer individual boxes to unpack at a warehouse and allowing returned goods to be packed more tightly on a truck. No wonder Amazon.com Inc. gives customers this option, as does Cole Haan. Retailers have other good reasons to ditch the printed return labels and instead direct shoppers to a more digital-centric returns process. Some chains have moved to a system in which customers must first go online and answer questions about why they’re making the return. This gives them data that is helpful in myriad ways, such as alerting them that a certain style of jeans runs big or a set of towels isn’t meeting quality expectations. But these questionnaires can also help them make returns more efficient. If a shopper tells a retailer, for example, that she’s returning a jacket because she didn’t like it, the retailer might route it somewhere different than if the jacket has a defective zipper — a detail that means it probably can’t be resold. Gap Inc. and Macy’s Inc. are among the chains now embedding such questions in the returns process, and others should rush to join them.  These returns innovations would have been needed even without the pandemic-fueled rush toward online shopping. But they look even more essential now. Urgently revamping these processes is a worthwhile investment for big-name chains, especially those in the clothing business.   (1) I, for one, have made a bunch of failed online holiday purchases this year, including tree-shaped candles that looked green on screen but looked blue in real life; boots that made my feet look like Ronald McDonald's; and a set of pocket-sized books that I mistook for larger ones.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-12-17	2020-12-17 10:00:29	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Has Turned a Middle-Class Warehouse Career Into a McJob	"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. job ads are everywhere. Plastered on city buses, displayed on career web sites, slotted between songs on classic rock stations. They promise a quick start, $15 an hour and health insurance. In recent weeks, America’s second-largest employer has rolled out videos featuring happy package handlers wearing masks, a pandemic-era twist on its annual holiday season hiring spree.Amazon’s object is to persuade potential recruits that there’s no better place to work.The reality is less rosy. Many Amazon warehouse employees struggle to pay the bills, and more than 4,000 employees are on food stamps in nine states studied by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Only Walmart, McDonald’s and two dollar-store chains have more workers requiring such assistance, according to the report, which said 70% of recipients work full-time. As Amazon opens U.S. warehouses at the rate of about one a day, it’s transforming the logistics industry from a career destination with the promise of middle-class wages into entry-level work that’s just a notch above being a burger flipper or convenience store cashier. Union workers who make comfortable livelihoods driving delivery trucks and packing boxes consider Amazon an existential threat. While labor tensions have simmered for years, the stakes have risen sharply amid the pandemic, which prompted Amazon to hire more than 250,000 people to keep up with surging demand from home-bound shoppers. Risking infection while toiling in a crowded warehouse for $15 an hour has many Amazon workers asking if they’re getting shortchanged.A Bloomberg analysis of government labor statistics reveals that in community after community where Amazon sets up shop, warehouse wages tend to fall.  In 68 counties where Amazon has opened one of its largest facilities, average industry compensation slips by more than 6% during the facility’s first two years, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In many cases, Amazon quickly becomes the largest logistics player in these counties, so its size and lower pay likely pull down the average. Among economists, there’s a debate about whether the company is creating a kind of monopsony, where there’s only one buyer—or in this case one employer.While Amazon’s arrival coincides with rising pay in some southern and low-wage precincts, the opposite is true in wealthier parts of the country, including the northeast and Midwest. Six years ago, before the company opened a giant fulfillment center in Robbinsville, New Jersey, warehouse workers made $24 an hour on average, according to BLS data. Last year the average hourly wage slipped to $17.50.Wages often tick higher in subsequent years, but don’t reach their pre-Amazon level till five years after a new facility opens—meaning that industry workers, on average, find themselves no better off half a decade after Amazon’s arrival.“Bloomberg's conclusion is false—it violates over 50 years of economic thought, and suspends the law of supply and demand,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Hiring more, by paying less, simply does not work. Many of our employees join Amazon from other jobs in retail which tend to be predominantly part-time, reduced benefit jobs with substantially less than our $15 minimum wage. These employees see a big increase in pay per hour, total take-home pay, and overall benefits versus their previous jobs. What surprises us is that we are the focus of a story like this when some of the country’s largest employers, including the largest retailer, have yet to join us in raising the minimum wage to $15.”Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, whose wealth grew about 65% this year as his company posted record sales and profits, has so far managed to keep unions out of his U.S. operations. Now that’s being challenged. In November, representatives of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union quietly filed paperwork with the National Labor Relations Board, proposing to form a union on behalf of 1,500 workers at Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama, fulfillment center. On Wednesday, the NLRB gave workers the greenlight to put the proposal to a vote, which promises to be the biggest referendum to date on the retail giant’s fraught relationship with its frontline workers.“The concern isn’t so much ‘the robots are coming, and they’re going to put everybody out of work,’” says Ben Zipperer, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. “It’s more that the jobs being created by extremely profitable companies have either poor pay or poor working conditions, or are not the kind of jobs that you would expect an extremely rich country, and rich company, to be able to provide.”Breaking down pallets or hauling cartons of lettuce is hardly the stuff of American business mythology. Warehouses, featureless rectangles located in exurbs and commercial districts, are far from the plant-filled orbs and office perks of Amazon’s Seattle headquarters. But for many Americans, the logistics industry has long provided a path into the middle class, particularly for those who didn’t attend college.Warehouses have typically paid less than factories but more than retailers. These haven’t been highly skilled jobs, but do require a certain level of ability—whether managing inventory or driving a forklift without damaging goods and hurting anyone. As recently as the early aughts, municipal officials in southern California looking to replace vanishing aerospace manufacturing jobs settled on the logistics industry, believing it would give lower-skilled workers the opportunity to move up. Since then, industry wages have come under pressure amid a push to carry less inventory and to subcontract work to lower-cost middlemen. But logistics really started to change with the rapid acceleration of e-commerce. And no company has done more to reshape how products are warehoused, packed and shipped than Amazon, with its strong focus on customer service.Shipping orders directly to consumers from an inventory of millions of products required redesigning not just the physical buildings but the jobs of the people working inside. After 20 years of trial and error, Amazon has turned its fulfillment centers into finely tuned assembly lines, often grueling workplaces that have been the subject of frequent media reports over the years, including investigations probing injury rates and pay practices. Most of the labor in Amazon’s largest fulfillment centers is divided into simple, repetitive tasks: receiving goods arriving in trucks, placing items into mesh shelving, or retrieving and speeding them along a conveyor belt in yellow plastic bins to be boxed and shipped. Most jobs are marketed to high-school graduates—no resume required, start as soon as next week—who spend 10-hour shifts standing at a single station, cogs in a giant machine built for speed and efficiency. Workers receive about one day of training and are put on the line to see if they have what it takes.Matt Giannini, who spent five years at a warehouse in New Jersey, says Amazon’s genius lies in simplifying most tasks to the point but where anybody can do it. “They’ve gotten it to such a science,” he says. “Every single process is very simple.” But job satisfaction can be elusive when most workers are interchangeable cogs. Quality of life in the warehouse, Giannini says, often breaks along a very simple divide: people who spend their days standing by a computer terminal that tracks their every move, and those with less scrutiny and more freedom.Bloomberg interviewed 42 employees in 20 states. Some enjoy the work and say news reports of workplace travails can be overblown. Many joined to get health insurance, a rare perk for entry-level jobs, and came to Amazon from lower-wage employment in retail or logistics. But most say there’s little opportunity to move up in a highly automated environment where a handful of people per shift oversee an entire facility. One worker in the Midwest was hoping to rise quickly because he had previous management experience. “It’s the greatest company in the world right now,” he recalls thinking. “I’m going to be able to get in there and move up.” Three years later he’s still at the entry level, picking items.Amazon touts a training program for promising workers and says it issued more than 35,000 promotions in its logistics operation this year. Ron Delosreyes, who joined Amazon in 2018, says the first step up added responsibility and no raise. But today he’s a salaried supervisor at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse.  “I’d like to stay and keep advancing my career,” he says. “Up and up.”While 35,000 promotions sounds like a lot, it represents 3.5% of the more than 1 million people who worked in Amazon’s logistics group this year. That’s well below the 9% promotion rate for the industry, as calculated by the payroll processing firm ADP. Many Amazon workers quit or are fired for safety and productivity infractions within a year or two of starting—a high rate of turnover even in an industry where people change jobs frequently. Studies have shown worker churn rises when Amazon moves to town. And workers say the company does little to encourage long tenure.The relative few who do last more than a year or two often struggle economically.Courtenay Brown was hired at an Amazon grocery distribution hub in Avenel, New Jersey, three years ago. For several months after joining Amazon, she and her sister, who also works there, were homeless, bouncing from one motel to another while trying to save a deposit for an apartment. They found places they could afford, but landlords denied their applications because they didn't make enough, she says. With motel rooms eating up about $600 a week, the sisters missed meals and slurped down free coffee and cocoa at work. Eventually, a charity paid their first month’s rent and security to get them established in their current apartment. Brown, 30, was excited to have a washing machine to rid her clothes of the cigarette smell that often permeated the motels.About half of her take-home pay covers her share of the rent. The balance mostly covers food, utilities and the cost of commuting, which includes frequent $50 Uber rides when she has to work late and misses the final van shuttle home. Brown pays about $200 a month for the van shuttle. She usually arrives at work at 5:30 am and works until close to 6 pm. She spends her vacation time doing errands or resting at home in her pajamas because she can’t afford to go anywhere.Brown finally got the promotion she’d been hoping for in the fall and a $2 hourly raise, but it will last only through the holiday season while she helps train new workers and open facilities. She’ll find out in January if she goes back to her old job and previous pay rate of about $17 per hour or if Amazon has a permanent promotion for her.“Me and my sister, the last thing we want to do is lose our job because we’ll go back to being homeless and having nothing,” says Brown, who joined community groups advocating for Amazon workers despite colleagues’ warnings she could be fired for speaking out.  “We’re in a tough situation, and this is all we can find that's stable. Amazon comes to places when people are desperate.” Similar jobs at unionized logistics companies typically pay twice as much—enough for workers to pay the bills and save. Joey Alvarado, 42, makes almost $30 an hour moving boxes filled with pet food, shampoo, canned goods and other items sold by Stater Bros. Markets, a southern California supermarket chain. His wife stays home with their three children, and the family eats out twice a week, has a boat called Penny Lane and a travel trailer. They vacation on Lake Havasu and the Colorado River. They’re buying a 2,000-square-foot home on half an acre about 30 minutes from the San Bernardino warehouse where he works. Down the street is an Amazon warehouse where people earn far less. “I don't see how a big company like Amazon can be so greedy,” he says. “The CEO is already a billionaire. What does he want to be a trillionaire? It’s just greed.""Alvarado belongs to the Teamsters Local 63, which he sees as the difference between what he is paid and what Amazon workers are paid.  He has been on the job 19 years and plans to remain. He doesn’t pay any premiums for medical benefits for himself and his family members and has a pension. “This job, you bust your butt, but you get paid,” he says. “No one leaves. You’d be stupid to leave.”Jeff Fretz, 49, was working part time for United Parcel Service Inc. and attending community college to pursue a career in law enforcement. A full-time UPS truck driving job opened up, and he picked that over becoming a cop. Now he spends his days maneuvering trailers around a UPS warehouse in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania, and looks forward to retiring and moving south in seven or eight years with a Teamster’s pension. The job gave him a stable income and good life. He owns a home in Easton and took vacations with his wife and son in Cape May.Fretz gets disgusted hearing about working conditions at Amazon because UPS pays its workers so much more and is still a profitable company. “A human body is not a machine,” he says. “I can't do now what I did when I was 25. Working in a union shop protects you for a career.”Now the unions fear that Amazon will do to the delivery business what it did with warehousing. The number of Americans employed as delivery drivers and couriers, outside of U.S. Postal Service work, has surged by 22% in the last two years, driven partly by the expansion of Amazon’s nationwide network of contract delivery firms and partly by the advent of new grocery delivery services. Wages in the industry fell last year by half a percentage point, the biggest decline in more than 20 years, according to BLS data.Amazon, which has long sought to reduce its dependence on UPS, Federal Express and the U.S. Postal Service, now ships most of its own customer orders. Many of those deliveries are handled by Amazon’s network of delivery service partners, contract firms that work exclusively for Amazon and lease the trademark blue delivery vans. Driver salaries average $16 an hour, according to recruiting sites, a couple bucks an hour less than the national average for frontline delivery service workers, and roughly half the pay package of an experienced UPS driver.  Amazon also borrowed the gig-economy tactics pioneered by Uber with Flex, a service that relies on people making deliveries in their own vehicles. The idea was to boost delivery capacity without having to buy thousands of vehicles and hire people. Drivers download the Amazon Flex app and can accept assignments that typically pay about $50 for three hours. Once they factor in the cost of a vehicle and fuel, drivers say, the pay is closer to minimum wage.UPS started a similar service for seasonal work a year after Amazon. But the drivers are employees, get 57 cents per mile, a $5 daily smartphone stipend and belong to the Teamsters union. One driver says he can easily earn $1,800 a month working part time, about 80% more than he ever made doing Flex routes. He can also count on regular work rather than competing against other Flex drivers, who spend hours watching their phones in the hopes of getting work that sometimes never materializes. The seasonal UPS job is a step up for Amazon Flex drivers. UPS’s full-time drivers see it as a step down, depriving them of overtime and potentially undermining their wages.They have reason to be worried. Amazon’s growth in the logistics industry is undermining union clout. Union membership in transportation and warehousing dropped to 16.1% in 2019 from 21.3% a decade earlier, by far the biggest decline of any industry, according to BLS data. The slide was driven by the rapid growth of non-union jobs at places like Amazon, not a loss of union work.Now, the RWDSU, an activist unit of the United Food and Commercial Workers union, is campaigning to organize the Alabama facility, which opened in March. A website for the union drive says employees are seeking safer working conditions and protections from arbitrary dismissal, among other things. “I thought Amazon was more like a Google,” one employee says in a video posted to the site. “The bigger the company, the more benefits, the more loyalty to the worker. But nah, it didn’t go like that.”Now that the federal labor regulator has approved the union’s proposal, a vote is likely some time next year.  For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-turned-middle-class-warehouse-100029845.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-12-17	2020-12-17 07:07:26	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	As FedEx, UPS Limit Package Pickups For Holiday Season, Small Retailers Most Affected	"Online shopping has soared during the pandemic as lockdowns force shoppers to stay indoors. The skewed demand is overwhelming for carriers like United Parcel Service, Inc (NYSE: UPS), and FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX), which are forcing retailers for volume-based agreements, Barron's reported earlier this week.What Happened: Carriers are placing volume limits on some businesses as their shipping network face capacity issues during the pandemic-fueled rise in online holiday shopping.Small businesses are the most affected due to no leverage to negotiate for better prices or quotas, Business Insider reports.It is not the first time carriers have placed shipping limits during the holiday season, but small businesses are crying foul for lack of transparency from FedEx.In many cases, small retailers were affected with limits as low as 75 packages per day right before Black Friday and Cyber Monday.""We had been pretty loyal to FedEx, probably 75% of our shipping business has gone through them, the balance going through USPS, and so we didn't really have any contingency plans,"" the owner of Letterfolk, a small retailer, told BI. Why It Matters: On-time deliveries are a key metric for logistics companies. It would want to hit targets despite the pandemic year's challenges but limiting package pickups poses a problem for retailers who depend on them.Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) has tried to stay ahead of the curve by taking control of its delivery, leading to faster shipping times -- but it has also capped the number of orders third-party sellers can ship to its warehouses, as reported by CNBC last week.Bix-box retailers like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST), Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), and Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) have warnings on their website for shipping delays but they have an advantage of a huge network of brick-and-mortar stores and curbside pickup option.See Also: Want To Send Christmas Packages, Treats To Loved Ones?

2020-12-16	2020-12-16 15:16:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	No Dry Ice Shortage, FedEx And UPS Say	"Concerns that there would be a shortage of dry ice to support new coronavirus vaccines that require storage at ultra-cold temperatures have receded in recent weeks, logistics executives involved in pharmaceutical supply chains say.Experts as recently as last month said there already is a shortage of dry ice  — a solid form of carbon dioxide — to meet global demand for vaccine protection as well as increased food shipments, compounded by inadequate amounts of liquid CO2 because refiners are producing less ethanol and a byproduct of gasoline since fewer people are driving. Liquid nitrogen for cryogenic freezers is also in short supply. FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX), part of the historic shipping campaign that began this week along with rival UPS (NYSE: UPS) to deliver Pfizer Inc.'s (NYSE: PFE) COVID-19 vaccine around the U.S., is confident there will be enough dry ice to meet demand.""Talking to all these vendors, they don't believe that all this talk of a dry ice shortage is real. They think there is plenty of dry ice out there,"" Richard Smith, regional president of the Americas for FedEx Express, told a Senate subcommittee.Many health care and freight transportation organizations lack expensive deep freezers that can store Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine at minus 70 degrees Celsius to maintain its integrity. Other vaccines in the pipeline also need to be kept frozen or chilled, but the temperature requirements are less severe.Pfizer developed a special thermal cooler that is packed with about 40 to 50 pounds of dry ice and can be used as temporary storage units by refilling with dry ice every five days for up to 30 days.Each insulated box has dry ice on the bottom, five ""pizza trays"" with a total of 975 vials in the middle, more dry ice packed around it and a tracking device on top.""I've never seen packaging quite that complicated. I'm pretty confident we'll have a lot less spoilage [than some may think],"" UPS Healthcare President Wes Wheeler testified. FedEx and UPS even invested in dry ice manufacturing capacity at their respective Memphis, Tennessee, and Louisville, Kentucky, package hubs. UPS officials say they can produce more than 24,000 pounds of dry ice per day.Much of the dry ice will be packed and shipped to customers that need it for storing deep-frozen vaccines.Smith even downplayed the need to top off boxes of dry ice moving through FedEx's system, saying that would only be necessary in case of long delays for an international shipment. ""We're not being asked in this instance to do that while it's in transit. Post-delivery there may be some dry ice top-off.

2020-12-14	2020-12-14 21:16:21	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Want To Send Christmas Packages, Treats To Loved Ones? Uber Could Have The Secret Santa Solution	"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in online purchasing -- and the need to use logistics companies to ship COVID-19 vaccines during the holiday season and the surge in online orders is causing a perfect storm.What Happened: Logistics companies United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) and FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) are both part of the U.S. operation to deliver the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ: BNTX).UPS will deliver to the western states and UPS to the eastern states, according to FreightWaves.Rideshare company Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) is now seeking to be part of the holiday shopping surge by offering package delivery for its users.Uber rolled out its Uber Connect platform to more than 2,400 cities, after a test that started in April.Related Link: How UPS Could Be Winner In COVID-19 Vaccine Logistics Why It's Important: The surge in online shopping caused UPS to delay package pickup for several prominent retailers on Cyber Monday.Users on the Uber platform can use the company as a cost-effective option for same-day options like package delivery.In the same manner of hailing for a ride, a user can get on the app and request a package pickup. The Uber driver then picks up the item with a contactless experience and delivers to the recipient. The delivery can be tracked on the App.Uber is calling the end-to-end experience a ""seamless Secret Santa gifting"" option.Benzinga's Take: It could become likely that FedEx and UPS set hard deadlines for shipping items in time for Christmas delivery.Uber could see strong demand for this service in the two weeks leading up to Christmas.The third quarter from Uber saw overall revenue fall 18% year-over-year. Delivery revenue up 125% year-over-year was not enough to make up for the mobility segment that fell 53% year-over-year.Uber has continued to expand into areas like grocery delivery and package delivery to offset its declining ride-hailing service during the pandemic.This could become a positive for Uber during the fourth quarter and also help some people in the United States get packages to loved ones that may not have arrived before Christmas otherwise.Photo courtesy of Uber.

UPS To Support Distribution Of Approved Vaccine As Part Of Operation Warp Speed	ATLANTA, Dec. 12, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --   * Deployments began after federal mandate to distribute therapies within 24 hours of emergency use authorization.  * UPS to help transport the initial Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine doses to support vaccinations of healthcare workers.UPS (NYSE:UPS) today announced its involvement and full support of distribution efforts for Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine as part of Operation Warp Speed. Pfizer’s and BioNTech’s vaccine, approved through a U.S. Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization (EUA), is the first to be deployed in a months-long global race to develop safe vaccines to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus. “Vaccine distribution is a key part of moving our world forward by delivering what matters,” says Carol Tomé, CEO of UPS. “We have dedicated and hardworking people around the world who have been trained to store, handle, transport and deliver vaccines. We’re pleased to support our healthcare partners with smart, efficient logistics for these vaccines that will protect communities and save lives.”UPS will move the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine within the first days to states designated by Pfizer, Inc. based on orders received by Operation Warp Speed and CDC officials. “This is the moment of truth we’ve been waiting for at UPS,” says Wes Wheeler, president of UPS Healthcare. “We have spent months strategizing with Operation Warp Speed officials and our healthcare customers on efficient vaccine logistics, and the time has arrived to put the plan into action.”Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines will originate from storage sites in Michigan and Wisconsin. The vaccines will be transported to UPS Worldport facilities in Louisville, where they will be expedited Next Day Air to select destinations, including hospitals, clinics and other medical facilities, to inoculate healthcare workers.  “This is undoubtedly a historic feat not only for vaccine development but also expedient deployment,” says Mike McDermott, President, Pfizer Global Supply. “We know that agile, world-class logistics is critical to get our products where they are needed, and we’re happy to partner with UPS in this historic effort to save lives and create healthier communities right now and well into the future.”About UPS HealthcareUPS Healthcare operates 128 facilities in 32 countries which are regulated under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).

2020-12-11	2020-12-11 15:07:16	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Unusual Options Activity Insight: United Parcel Service	"United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) shares experienced unusual options activity on Friday. The stock price moved up to $165.92 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-15  * Strike Price: $185.00  * Volume: 479  * Open Interest: 3347Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 10 Industrials Stocks Showing Unusual Options Activity In Today's Session  * United Parcel Service's Debt Overview(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Gus Perna said during a press briefing. ""We'll begin that today. Distribution will be completed by Friday.""Health care distributor McKesson Corp. (NYSE: MCK) the U.S. government's central third-party logistics provider, is building the kits, which are then shipped by UPS (NYSE: UPS) to marry up with vaccine shipments at destination sites identified by states. FedEx Express (NYSE: FDX) and UPS will both deliver the ultracold Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) vaccine, but UPS is in charge of delivering the auxiliary kits.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is being reviewed by a Food and Drug Administration validation panel Thursday, and the agency is expected to quickly issue an emergency use authorization after clinical trials showed the drug to be 95% effective, with minimal side effects. Deliveries could commence within days, with Operation Warp Speed officials previously targeting next Tuesday as the tentative launch date.Vaccines and supplies are being dispatched to 636 locations across 64 state and regional jurisdictions, officials said.Perna said detailed plans for distribution of the Pfizer vaccine were completed Friday, based on the allocations for each jurisdiction. On Tuesday, OWS locked in the final allocations to states for the vaccine developed by Moderna Inc., which the FDA is scheduled to review next week. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both require two doses, although the Moderna product is somewhat easier to transport because it only needs to be frozen at minus 20 degrees Celsius, not at ultra-cold temperatures.  * New UPS freezer farm in Louisville, Kentucky. (Photo: UPS)States will submit their desired delivery locations and quantities Thursday and Friday so planning is completed before FDA approval, Perna said. Vaccinating the militaryMeanwhile, Defense Department officials said they expect to receive their first allotment of vaccines, about 44,000 doses, as early as next week, pending FDA authorization. The Pentagon will administer the first batch to health care providers and then to personnel in long-term care facilities and those in high-risk populations and in critical national security positions, in accordance with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.That first batch of vaccines will be distributed to 16 locations, including three overseas in what Thomas McCaffery, the assistant secretary for health affairs, termed a ""control pilot.""The 16 sites were selected based on a sizable DOD population of high-priority personnel, cold storage capability, and sufficient medical personnel to administer the vaccines and monitor recipients after they receive the vaccines, he said.RELATED NEWS:Rehearsal exposes gaps in COVID vaccine deliveryUS fine-tunes plans for COVID vaccine distributionSolving the dry ice challenge for COVID vaccineBig 3 US airlines gear up to transport COVID-19 vaccineDoD planning ‘every statistical detail' of COVID vaccine distributionCOVID vaccine distribution to start as sprint, turn into marathonSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Rehearsal Exposes Gaps In COVID Vaccine Delivery  * FedEx Shares Pierce 0 Level For First Time Ever(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-12-08	2020-12-08 15:10:23	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	3 COVID Stocks Not To Neglect	There are now over 60 million COVID-19 cases worldwide, and they're continuing to rise. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) gave the world hope as their candidates showed 90% efficacy. But, besides these pharma stars, there are many other COVID-19 stocks that shouldn't be neglected.Uncovering a new opportunityThe impending release of the above vaccines has created an abundant opportunity for companies that supply ultra-low temperature freezers as well as those which will ship them across the globe. Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) are up to the task.Freezers Demand for freezers could be through the roof as Pfizer's vaccine needs to be stored at negative 70 degrees Celsius, which is South Pole-like temperature, unlike Moderna's vaccine that requires a regular freezer at 20 degrees Celsius. Thermo Fisher's ULT freezers can accommodate both, as they can reach temperatures as low as negative 80 degrees Celsius. The created demand for these freezers will likely result into an improved top and bottom line for the healthcare company which is already a solid investment on its own merits. Besides consistently delivering a profit over the ten previous quarters, sales from lab products and services rose 11.1% YoY to $8.6 billion during the first nine months of the year, whereas total sales this year increased 15.8% from the same period last year, amounting $21.7 billion.Shipment UPS will also keep being busy with the vaccine after already being engaged with a rise in online shopping and deliveries during the pandemic. On November 24th, the company stated it has the capability to make up to 1,200 pounds of dry ice per hour. Moreover, by partnering with Stirling Ultracold, it will help supply ULT freezers so it can provide more than just a temporary storage solution. However, given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, the company did not provide any guidance or estimates pertaining to revenue for the fourth quarter.  Year to date, UPS stock has climbed 44%.Don't dismiss J&J just yet Despite dismissals from sceptical investors who associate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) with baby powder and tear-free shampoo rather than cutting-edge medicines, there's a solid chance that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate will make billions. Don't let the delay in getting J&J's results fool you: Its coronavirus vaccine will have several advantages over others, if successful. Its vaccine will be stable for three months at refrigerator temperature, and it will require only one dose to do the job. The cost per dose will be around $10, which is quite cheaper than both Pfizer's $19.50 and Moderna's $32. AstraZeneca does plan to price its candidate $3 per dose but its trial is surrounded with confusion and recent controversy due to its partner in China. But the bottom line is that Johnson & Johnson doesn't even need its coronavirus vaccine to remain a profitable company that is in shareholder's good graces.Even without vaccine, healthcare is essentialEverybody needs healthcare at some point in life. And when there's something that everyone needs, there's always a huge opportunity for investors. But as the pandemic has put the things we matter most to a halt such as hanging out with friends and hugging loved ones, this is literally big pharma's time to shine as the vaccine is what will allow us to return to normal and everything we hold dear.This article is not a press release and is contributed by  IAMNewswire.

2020-12-04	2020-12-04 20:17:03	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Vaccine Supply Chains Bend But Don't Break	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s been one terrible year, but it’s worth taking a moment to appreciate how corporate America has risen to the challenges of the moment — especially when it comes to manufacturing and transporting essentials like vaccines. Supply chains have been tested in ways they never have been before and, yes, there have been pileups, shortages and other snafus. By and large, though, companies have figured it out and kept moving, at times under impossible circumstances. Shares of Pfizer Inc. fell on Thursday after the Wall Street Journal reported the company would deliver only 50 million doses of its vaccine this year, half as many as initially targeted, because of supply-chain logjams. It took longer than expected to source the necessary raw materials in large quantities, Pfizer said, while also noting that its clinical trial of the vaccine concluded later than first planned. The company has been indicating for weeks that the initial rollout would be scaled back, based on November news releases, but given current anxiety levels and the consequences of each passing day of the pandemic, this headline understandably put people on edge. I actually found it encouraging in a way. Obviously, we would all like to see a vaccine distributed in as many doses as possible, as quickly as possible. But considering pharmaceutical companies typically wait to set up supply chains and factory lines until after a vaccine is approved, the fact that Pfizer was able to cobble together the infrastructure to deliver any vaccines at all this year is an incredible feat. Not to mention, neither Pfizer nor any other drugmaker has ever developed a vaccine on this scale using messenger RNA technology that instructs the body’s cells to create virus proteins. On Friday, BioNTech SE, Pfizer’s partner on the vaccine, said the companies had already made most of the 50 million doses, a testament to the manufacturing prowess of its supply chain. The companies expect to make up this year’s shortfall — relative to initial targets — as production of the vaccine ramps up, and are on track to distribute at least 1.3 billion doses in 2021. The government is aiming for Pfizer to begin shipping the vaccine within 24 hours of receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, Vice President Mike Pence and Health Secretary Alex Azar said at a press conference this week. Pfizer will do so directly with FedEx Corp. as part of the Operation Warp Speed program to accelerate distribution of vaccines. FedEx rival United Parcel Service Inc., which historically has operated a bigger pharmaceutical shipping business, will also play a key role in the rollout. The news this week that UPS is limiting pickups at certain retailers to ease congestion should be viewed in that context.Logistics data-analytics company ShipMatrix estimates a surplus of 7 million packages per day this peak season relative to the actual capacity of the parcel-delivery industry. That’s before factoring in vaccine shipments, which will inevitably displace some e-commerce orders. UPS’s efforts to meter the flow of boxes into its network therefore isn't a flaw in the system; it’s a feature and a reflection of the company’s billions of dollars of investments in automation and software to help it more profitably handle the deluge of e-commerce shipments. Even with all of the demands on their networks right now from the pandemic-fueled surge in e-commerce orders, UPS and FedEx are handling this peak season amazingly well so far. For the third week of November, FedEx delivered 96.6% of its packages on time, while UPS delivered 96.9%, according to Satish Jindel, president and founder of ShipMatrix. That should instill some confidence in their ability to get vaccines from point A to point B. UPS and FedEx are only one part of the logistics equation, though. Much of the final legwork will fall to pharmacies, whose trained medical professionals will be responsible for poking millions of arms with the vaccine, including the first wave of recipients at long-term care facilities. Thankfully, this is something they have experience with. So far this year, CVS Health Corp. has held flu-shot clinics at more than 8,000 long-term care facilities across the country, Chris Cox, a senior vice president at the company and its liaison to Warp Speed, said in an interview. There are unique features to the coronavirus vaccines under development, but CVS is drawing on this know-how.The company will ultimately administer shots at more than 30,000 elder-care facilities as part of a program coordinated by the U.S. government. CVS has selected about 1,000 of its existing pharmacies (which were chosen based on their geographical proximity to long-term care facilities) to serve as hubs for vaccine warehousing, Cox said. CVS’s past experience with administering vaccinations means it already has certain cold-storage infrastructure in place, a must for the leading coronavirus candidates. CVS will transport the shots from the hubs using specially-made cooling containers manufactured by AeroSafe Global.Once the vaccine is more widely available, CVS will link its vaccine inventory management system with its software that tracks patient appointments to ensure that each individual gets two doses of the same vaccine, he said. You wouldn’t want to get one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and a second of Moderna Inc.’s, for example. CVS will use the same messaging system it deploys for prescription pick-up reminders to prompt customers to come back for their second shot. These are the kinds of things the average person isn’t thinking about right now, but these little logistical details matter a great deal. This is not to say the back-end preparation for a vaccine rollout has been an easy process. Raw-material suppliers, logistics companies and pharmacies have had to come up with comprehensive plans despite a myriad of uncertainties, including but not limited to: knowing which, if any, of the vaccines under consideration might ultimately be approved; adjusting to shifting perspectives on who should receive inoculations first; managing through a patchwork of different plans, budgets and launch dates by the 50 individual states; and ensuring their own workers are protected during this process. There may yet be hiccups and snags, but I for one am comforted by the degree to which the private sector is on top of this process. These companies have a plan and in many ways are playing to their strengths and existing infrastructure.Stuck on the RunwayOne group that's eagerly cheering on the vaccine news is the aerospace sector. Ryanair Holdings Plc is so optimistic that mass inoculations will drive a travel rebound that it was willing to order 75 more of Boeing Co.’s embattled 737 Max jets. It’s the largest firm order for the Max since December of 2018, according to Bloomberg News. Earlier that year, the Max suffered the first of two fatal crashes that would eventually prompt a 20-month grounding. While Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary has a reputation as a hard bargainer and likely got the Max at a significant discount given its woes, he chose to characterize the price reduction as “modest” and focused on the fuel-efficiency benefits. If nothing else, it was a major PR victory for Boeing, which has been dogged with questions about the future profitability of the Max program.However confident aerospace executives are about the post-vaccine future, they still have to deal with the worsening pandemic now. Boeing itself offered a stark reminder of that this week, with Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith telling a Credit Suisse Group AG conference on Friday that the company is planning to further trim output of its 787 Dreamliner and is considering an equity sale to help mitigate the heavy debt load it took on during the crisis. While Boeing would love the Ryanair order to be the first of many, even the strongest U.S. airlines are facing fresh turmoil. Delta Air Lines Inc. this week warned it could burn more cash than previously expected this quarter (as much as $14 million per day) and said demand had taken a hit amid the rising coronavirus case count across the U.S. Southwest Airlines Co. sharply expanded the number of employees that may be affected by its first-ever forced furlough. In total, more than 7,000 jobs are at risk if the carrier and labor unions can’t agree on a plan to cut $500 million of costs. On the bright side, a bipartisan stimulus bill that includes fresh aid for the airline sector appears to be gaining traction. Deals, Activists and Corporate GovernanceFedEx Corp. agreed to buy ShopRunner, a member-based e-commerce service that provides free shipping and returns for more than 100 brands including Neiman Marcus and American Eagle. The deal will help further embed FedEx into the e-commerce process and is a particularly notable tie-up in the wake of the company’s falling-out with Amazon.com Inc. FedEx has tried to position itself as an anti-Amazon ally for other e-commerce retailers, including Walmart Inc. Terms weren’t released, but FedEx says the purchase should close by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. Elsewhere in e-commerce deals, private equity firms continue to gobble up warehouse real estate. Blackstone Group Inc., a big player in this corner of the market, acquired 13 properties located mainly in California, northern New Jersey and Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley from Iron Mountain Inc. The price tag was $358 million. KKR & Co., meanwhile, is reportedly nearing an $800 million purchase of a portfolio of warehouses in markets including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Baltimore. General Motors Co. announced this week that it was downgrading its lofty partnership agreement with electrical-vehicle startup Nikola Corp. to what is essentially a glorified supplier contract. GM will supply the Hydrotec fuel-cell system to Nikola’s commercial semi-trucks at “cost plus” — meaning the startup will reimburse it for costs incurred as well as a specified profit. Gone is the production agreement for Nikola’s Badger pickup truck, a program that now appears to be defunct. Also gone is GM’s willingness to be compensated for its services in Nikola stock. After a rough few months for Nikola that included accusations of deception by a short-seller (denied by the company) and the departure of founder Trevor Milton as executive chairman, GM would prefer cold hard cash. The obvious question is, if GM doesn’t want Nikola stock, why would anyone else? The shares fell more than 30% this week. My colleague Tim O’Brien calls for more explanation from GM on how the company could so misjudge Nikola’s prospects. Personally, I continue to believe that GM didn’t misjudge Nikola, but rather the stock market. Investors are much less willing to award companies that lack revenue or proven technology with premium valuations than they were just a few short months ago. And hey, GM still got out while the getting was good. Elsewhere in bad news for electrical-vehicle startups, shares of Workhorse Group Inc. also plummeted this week after reports that the U.S. Postal Service further delayed a key contract for new mail trucks. XPO Logistics Inc. is moving ahead with a breakup. The $11 billion company will spin off its contract logistics businesses, leaving behind a provider of services for shippers who don't need a full truck to carry their freight. This completes the strategic review process XPO announced in January; an attempted sale of its European supply-chain business reportedly stalled after Blackstone dropped out of the bidding over valuation disagreements. XPO says the split will help each business hone its customer and technology focus, attract better talent and operate with lower debt profiles. If there was a generic “breakup logic” you could buy right off the shelf, that would be it. The split marks a turning point for a company that was built via consolidation of a fragmented industry. That being said, the market is happy: XPO shares climbed on the news to a fresh record. “It is hard to argue that thesis creep has not occurred, but one thing has not changed and that is the company’s commitment to maximize shareholder value,” Cowen analyst Jason Seidl wrote in a note. He also questions whether this breakup might offer an eventual exit strategy for XPO CEO Brad Jacobs, a serial entrepreneur. Elsewhere in logistics, Transfix, a startup that operates a freight marketplace, is reportedly in talks to go public through a merger with a blank-check firm, Tuscan Holdings Corp. II. Eaton Corp. has lured away W.W. Grainger Inc. CFO Thomas Okray, who will join the electrical equipment company in the same role starting in April. Current Eaton CFO Rick Fearon will leave big shoes to fill upon his retirement, and this job will bring unique challenges to Okray, RBC analyst Deane Dray wrote in a report. He points out that Eaton’s Irish domicile gives it a different tax profile than what Okray is used to at Grainger, while the company’s more global business and appetite for M&A will also be a change. That being said, Dray thinks Okray is up for the job. Grab Bag. It appears dealmakers and regulators were busy over the holiday weekend. GardaWorld increased its hostile offer for British security provider G4S Plc to 235 pence-a-share ($4.9 billion) and lowered the investor acceptance threshold to 50% plus one share. Garda says this is its final offer, unless G4S gets a bid from someone else, which feels like a possibility as G4S said Thursday that it continues to hold talks with Allied Universal. My colleague Chris Hughes writes that Garda squandered an opportunity by not raising its bid more significantly earlier. CSX Corp. inked an agreement to buy New England carrier Pan Am Railways. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lee Klaskow says CSX should be able to lower Pan Am’s operating ratio to around 60% from an estimated 80% to 85% currently (a lower number here is good). And lastly, Alstom SA said it had finally received all regulatory approvals to acquire Bombardier Inc.’s rail business. This is somewhat ironic because Bombardier also this week named Bart Demosky its new CFO and Demosky has had a long career in … the rail industry. Bonus Reading Rusty Pilots Making Flying Errors Is Next Aviation Headache Exxon Is Now the Thing It Wasn't Supposed to Be: Liam DenningCovid-19 Vaccines Start a Frenzy for Dry Ice; 'It's Like a Herd of Mustangs' Hydrogen Is a Trillion Dollar Bet on the Future: David Fickling Women Take the Lead in Covid Vaccine Development: Tyler Cowen As Stimulus Debate Rages, Senators Agree on Tax Cuts for BeerThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-12-02	2020-12-02 20:49:33	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Give UPS a Pass for Christmas Package Pileups	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Is the Christmas gift you ordered online delayed? Too bad; you’ll just have to live with it.United Parcel Service Inc. told its drivers to stop picking up packages this week from certain retailers who had exceeded their volume agreements as the logistics company works to keep its network from being overwhelmed, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. A UPS spokesman told the Journal that the company will pick up surplus packages once more capacity becomes available. This may mean that orders of Nike Inc. shoes, L.L. Bean Inc. coats and Macy’s Inc. sweaters placed over the Black Friday period will show up a few days later than expected. In normal times, such pileups would be a catastrophe for logistics companies, which have faced immense pressure to keep up with retailers' increasingly aggressive promises on fast delivery. But there's nothing normal about 2020. Parcel-delivery firms have been operating under peak-season-like conditions for months now as the pandemic has driven more consumers to online shopping for everyday goods. With a surge of Black Friday-related orders beginning to hit already loaded-down trucks and planes, it’s not surprising that capacity is being stretched. The carriers have staffed up: UPS and rival FedEx Corp. have hired 170,000 additional seasonal workers between them. They have imposed surcharges on higher-volume shippers. Retailers, meanwhile, started their holiday promotional specials especially early this year in an effort to space out the flow of packages. They have also ramped up their curbside-delivery capabilities to provide shoppers with a convenient (and timely) alternative. Target Corp. alone has added 8,000 parking spots dedicated to drive-up services since the summer. It still may not be enough.Demand during the peak season between Thanksgiving and Christmas is expected to exceed 86 million packages per day, but there’s only capacity for 79.1 million, Satish Jindel, founder of parcel-industry research firm SJ Consulting Group Inc. and its sister shipping-data analytics company SjipMatrix, said in an interview. That leaves a gap of 7 million packages per day. And that's before you factor in distribution of a coronavirus vaccine, which will likely become available in the U.S. in the coming weeks — right in the middle of the holiday season. Given how tight capacity is in cargo markets, it’s inevitable that boxes of vaccines will take space away from e-commerce and other shipments, Jindel said. That’s as it should be given the importance of a vaccine to human well-being and the economy.  For all the stress that’s being put on UPS’s and FedEx’s networks, they are actually handling things surprisingly well so far. For the third week of November, FedEx delivered 96.6% of its packages on time, while UPS delivered 96.9%, Jindel says. Some of the capacity shortfall can be made up through other services. But as the onslaught of e-commerce orders continues, there may be other pileups like those reportedly happening at Nike and other retailers this week. Of all of the years, this feels like the one to give a pass to UPS and FedEx for any delays that might arise. Orders will make their way to doorsteps eventually. If “eventually” happens to be two days after Christmas, who really cares? Millions of people are still out of work and more than 250,000 are dead. If your biggest problem is a delayed Christmas gift, count yourself lucky and spare a thought for the delivery employees at UPS and FedEx. These drivers and warehouse workers have borne the brunt of this year’s e-commerce deluge and have repeatedly risked their own health to allow many of us to order essentials from the comforts of our home. A federal advisory panel on Tuesday recommended health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities receive first priority for the coronavirus vaccine, meaning it may still be a while before essential workers like UPS and FedEx drivers are inoculated. Logistics companies and retailers have been warning of a possible delivery crunch for months now and encouraging shoppers to buy early. Those holiday gifts ordered from Nike and Macy’s over Black Friday should arrive in plenty of time, even with UPS’s reported shipping limitations. But if you needed another reminder to get your holiday shopping done sooner rather than later, this is it. \--With assistance from Sarah HalzackThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

Expands Shipment Insurance Options  for Logistics Businesses through AscendTMS Software	"ATLANTA, Nov. 30, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UPS Capital Insurance Agency, Inc., a subsidiary of UPS (NYSE:UPS), announced today that it will make additional shipping insurance coverage options available to small and mid-size companies using AscendTMS, a product of InMotion Global.This enhancement to the already popular shipping platform will provide shipping protection to AscendTMS® users allowing them to tailor coverage based on their needs. ""We are offering a better option – a true insurance solution to cover the full value of goods,” said Mark Robinson, president of UPS Capital. “Our goal in working with AscendTMS is to provide businesses a frictionless, digital way to protect their shipments against loss and damage.”This customized approach is achieved by giving users four different options based on their preferred deductible. The options mimic “gap coverage” where the user tailors coverage so they only buy what they need. In return, they get a best-in-class claims experience that has been highly rated in customer reviews. Benefits include:  * Coverage that pays on the occurrence of a loss regardless of carrier fault   * Limits and coverages tailored for SMBs  * A best-in-class claims settlement process, highly rated by other SMBsThe typical AscendTMS user is booking large loads, with a big percentage of transactions moving via full truck load at higher total values. Until now the only option was to purchase excess liability from the carrier, which can often be more expensive, or from their insurance agent which can take time.“We have given customers multiple options depending on their risk appetite and the coverage they desire or need,” said Tim Higham, president and CEO of InMotion Global. “If the carrier has provided them with $100,000 of coverage and they need more, we can now offer options to fill the gap if the load is valued higher.”The transportation management system (TMS) market is expected to grow 4 times larger than the current size, reaching $4.9B in sales by 2025.1 “With the exponential growth in these platforms as well as ecommerce platforms, UPS Capital is looking to meet shippers where they transact,” said Robinson.  This integrated solution enables SMBs to digitally procure insurance on a shipment-by-shipment basis with a few key strokes, paying only for what they need. Users can then provide a better post-sales experience knowing they are dealing with a true insurance partner that focuses on paying claims.The AcsendTMS customer can obtain a quote, review the terms and conditions of coverage and get coverage confirmation through the TMS software--all in a matter of minutes.To learn more about this solution and the importance of in-transit shipment insurance, join AscendTMS and UPS Capital experts for a free webinar on December 2, 2020, at 2 p.m. ET.  To register, go to http://bit.ly/AscendTMS-UPSC-Register.About UPS CapitalNobody understands transportation and logistics like UPS.

2020-11-27	2020-11-27 12:57:20	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	United Parcel Service's Debt Overview	Over the past three months, shares of United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) rose by 5.69%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt United Parcel Service has.United Parcel Service's Debt Based on United Parcel Service's balance sheet as of November 2, 2020, long-term debt is at $23.34 billion and current debt is at $2.38 billion, amounting to $25.72 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $8.84 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $16.88 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering United Parcel Service's $62.41 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.41. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

CIIC Stock Is Now Overvalued Before Its Merger With Arrival	"CIIG Merger Corp (NASDAQ:CIIC) announced on Nov. 18 that it had reached a merger agreement with a prominent electric vehicle (EV) company. That EV company, Arrival Group, is based in the U.K. and already has two factories, including one in South Carolina. My view is that CIIC stock is worth now overvalued, as it is not worth more than $20.66. That puts it at least 26% overvalued.

CIIG is a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) that is going to use its own cash and equity raised from a PIPE (private investment in public equity) round to complete the business combination. At the close of the transaction CIIC stock will change its name to Arrival and the new symbol on Nasdaq composite will be ARVL.
Arrival specializes in making electric buses and vans. It also has a unique, almost fully automated manufacturing process in what it calls “microfactories.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Arrival already has two microfactories, with one in the U.K. and the other in Rock Hill, South Carolina. The company is in the process of making electric buses there and will go into full production mode once the deal closes. The company shows pictures of its two microfactories in a very interesting slide presentation that accompanied the announcement.
10 Best Stocks to Buy for Investors Under 30
Moreover, Arrival already has $1.2 billion in orders, including 10,000 EV vans for UPS (NYSE:UPS). Once the deal closes Arrival will receive $669 million in net cash and will have no debt. This is all that it needs to become profitable by 2023.
The Deal and Its Value
Once the merger closes, CIIC stock (ARVL stock) will have 606.179 million shares outstanding. This can be seen on page 42 of the slide presentation.
Therefore, since CIIC stock has risen to $25.91 since the announcement, it now has a pro forma market capitalization of $15.706 billion (i.e., $25.91 times 606.179 million pro forma shares outstanding). Now to get the pro forma enterprise value we subtract the $669 million in cash, for an EV of $15.037 billion.
This is 178% higher than the $5.392 billion enterprise value used in the public announcement or the slide presentation on page 41. However, I believe that CIIC stock is now overvalued by at least 26%.
Here is why. On page 41 of the presentation, the company estimates that it will make $14.1 billion in revenue by the end of 2024. That implies that Arrival’s EV-sales multiple will be more than 1x.
For example, $15.037 billion in EV (its present pro forma enterprise value) divided by $14.1 billion in pro forma sales by 2024, a ratio of 107%.

What CIIC Stock Is Worth Today
We can compare Arrival with its peers. For example, on page 44 of the deck, the average EV-sales multiple of its peers is 1.3x sales. The EV value for CIIC stock (ARVL stock) should be $18.99 billion (i.e., 1.3 x $14.1 billion).
In addition, we have to deduct the $669 million. Why? On the one hand, one can assume that the $669 million will be used up by 2024. On the other hand, it highly likely that the company will be profitable and/or it may have raised additional cash by then.
Therefore, the pro forma market value should be $18.33 billion ($18.99 billion minus $669 million). This puts its per-share value at $30.24 (i.e., $18.33 billion / 606.179 million shares.
That represents a potential gain of 16.7% above today’s price of $25.91. But is it really worth this on a present value basis?

Discounting To the Present
The year 2024 is a long time in the future to compare Arrival’s theoretical revenue and value with today’s CIIC stock price. We have to discount the 2024 forecast value to the present.
For example, using a 15% annual discount rate the present value factor compounds out to 57.175%. Therefore, the $18.33 billion market value is worth $10.48 billion today. That works out to $17.29 per share.
However, using a more typical 10% discount rate, the PV factor is 68.3% and its value is $12.52 billion. That works out to $20.66 per share.
Using a 10% discount rate is OK since Arrival’s enterprise value by 2024 will be likely higher than forecast, well above $19 billion. This is true especially since Arrival is likely to have taken on more debt by then.
The bottom line is that CIIC stock, at $25.91 is 26% higher than the company’s implied calculation of its own value.

2020-11-25	2020-11-25 16:53:23	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Merchants Say Deliveries of Some Products Are Delayed	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. merchants around the U.S. say some products that normally reach customers in one or two days are now taking a week or longer just as the world’s largest online retailer heads into what’s expected to be a record-busting holiday shopping season.Seven merchants and consultants from California, Texas, Wisconsin and Florida said they had to ship products ordinarily handled by Amazon’s logistics service -- which is typically faster and cheaper. To the sellers, that suggests the company’s warehouses and delivery stations are at full capacity.The development, which began over the weekend and continued this week, worries the merchants because web shopping will peak in the five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, the biggest online spending day of the year. Their experience was echoed by more than a dozen additional sellers in merchant chat rooms viewed by Bloomberg.Amazon continues to deliver most products in one or two days through its logistics service, the merchants said. But because the company has issued no warning or explanation, they said it’s hard to figure out if any specific product categories are being affected or whether the shift is happening more in some regions than others.One seller said Amazon seems to be prioritizing best-selling products for its own delivery system and letting merchants handle less popular items, echoing what happened earlier this year when Amazon was overwhelmed by panicked shoppers stuck at home when Covid-19 first swept the country.In an emailed statement, an Amazon spokesman said a few anecdotes from merchants don’t necessarily add up to a broader problem. “We have not changed how offers are presented to customers to shift volume from Amazon fulfillment to seller fulfillment,” he said. “As always, product offers continue to compete to be the featured offer based on a variety of factors, including lowest price, availability, fastest delivery speed and best seller performance.”U.S. shoppers will spend $189 billion in November and December, up 33% from a year earlier and more than double the usual pace of growth, according to Adobe Inc. Amazon captures about 40 cents of every dollar spent online in the U.S., meaning the company is under enormous pressure to keep customers happy. Amazon shipping times averaged a little more than two days during the week of Nov. 2, when consumers took a break from shopping for the election, according to the most recent data from Rakuten Intelligence.Amazon has rushed to increase capacity since the pandemic hit -- hiring 250,000 workers and spending billions on new warehouses and delivery stations. To ensure it has enough people to pick, pack and ship orders, the company has been offering signing bonuses of as much as $3,000 to new hires.Even so, the merchants said, it appears Amazon is struggling to keep up.Molson Hart, who sells stuffed animals and games on Amazon, said about 70% of his inventory is being delayed as much as one week. Amazon is prioritizing the most in-demand products for fast delivery while slower-selling products are subject to delays, he said.“We can expect even longer delays and delivery disruptions come next week, when shipping volumes rise as much as five times,” Hart said. “The past couple of years, consumers grew accustomed to ordering products as late as December 20th and having them delivered before Christmas. That is not likely to happen this year.”One Amazon merchant said Amazon typically packs and ships almost all of his orders. But over the weekend, he was required to ship two types of product himself, including a power tool, even though Amazon had the merchandise in its warehouses. Another seller in Wisconsin, who sells flasks and tumblers, said he had to ship orders to customers in Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Georgia over the past few days. The two sellers spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution from Amazon.“There’s no rhyme or reason to the geography of the customer,” the Wisconsin merchant said. “If Amazon has any weaknesses, this weekend will show them more than any other.”Online shoppers have come roaring back after an Election Day lull. Spending from Nov. 21 to Nov. 23 surged 49%, according to Adobe, putting a strain on delivery capacity. In recent weeks, Amazon’s marketing team has been exhorting customers to shop early in an effort to prevent a deluge of orders from overwhelming the company’s delivery operations.Chad Rubin, whose software company Skubana helps merchants sell products on multiple platforms, said Amazon shifting sales outside of its own network has a positive side. Too many Amazon merchants were too dependent on the company, he said, and were caught flat-footed in the early days of the pandemic when Amazon delayed delivery of their products. That prompted many merchants to develop their own delivery capacity, which will help Amazon get through the first pandemic holiday, he said.”Amazon is going to be just fine,” he said. “Their biggest merchants can let Amazon handle delivery or do it themselves, so it’s diversified. Not everything will arrive in two days. That’s the only downside.”Shoppers will tolerate delivery delays over the Thanksgiving weekend, which will give Amazon flexibility, but the pressure will intensify in the week before Christmas when other delivery carriers like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. no longer guarantee delivery by Dec. 25, said James Thomson, a former Amazonian who helps merchants sell products on the site through his consulting firm Buy Box Experts.“We expect sales to be insane December 15 to 24,” Thomson said, adding that customers will flock to Amazon because they’ve come to see it as the online retailer that can reliably ensure delivery in time for Christmas.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-merchants-deliveries-products-delayed-165323293.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-11-25	2020-11-25 16:35:34	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Postal Delay Adds to Problems at Workhorse	"The U.S. Postal Service, now best known for suspicious pre-election mail delays, also is delaying decisions to upgrade its aging delivery fleet. This puts nascent electric-vehicle maker Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) and WKHS stock in precarious spot.
Source: Photo from WorkHorse.com
	
It’s obvious that many investors bought WKHS stock because it is a finalist for the postal fleet contract. This is no small matter, as the contract is estimated to be worth $6 billion. Even part of the contract will be meaningful for this relatively new company. Remember, Workhorse has not produced very many vehicles aside from a tryout order of about 1,400 vans for postal competitor United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS).
Workhorse’s vans look cool and the promise of battery-powered vehicles replacing pollution-belching delivery vans makes one take a deep breath of contentment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
But Workhorse’s struggles to ramp up serious production aren’t reassuring.
Workhorse and the USPS Contract
If the postal service truly adopted a long-term commitment to mail delays, then not updating its fleet certainly fits the script. Most of its last-mile vehicles are 25 to 32 years old, which means they have rolled many miles of stop-and-go driving. And it’s hard to think of a better way to impede mail delivery than sticking with a broken fleet.


					10 Best Stocks to Buy for Investors Under 30				

Nevertheless, officials at Workhorse and investment observers are keeping this prospective contract front and center. They are betting on potential.
However, only the most ardent optimists expect Workhorse to win the entire contract. Why? Look at this from the perspective of a fleet manager. Giving the contract to an as-yet unproven company would be foolish – even for the current postmaster general. (Unless it’s part of his evil plan.)
But seriously, it is sensible to expect a fleet buyer to consider the contractor’s ability to deliver the vehicles. Not only that, but its track record of quality and durability are also vitally important. In other words, will the next fleet last three or four decades? This is not an easy determination, even if the contender is an established manufacturer. I suspect it is going to be difficult for Workhorse to adequately answer this question. In addition, as attractive as the idea is, if Workhorse won the contract tomorrow, the company would be hard-pressed to fulfill the order.
Note that the company’s 2021 goal is to make 1,800 vehicles.

A Look at WKHS Stock
Until the middle of summer, WKHS stock was a tenant in the community of penny stocks. Since July, though, shares traded mostly in the 20s.
The stocks’ range in the last year bottomed at a measly $1.32 per share, while the top – reached in September – was $30.99. Currently, WKHS is trading around $28. The stock dipped in October as the third quarter ended, but shares rebounded from about $15 as November began.
Speaking of that third-quarter report, Workhorse said its revenue totaled $565,000. Second-quarter revenue was $92,000. It is interesting to see that revenue in Q3 last year was only $4,000.
Workhorse is losing money – a trait it shares with many other electric-vehicle firms. The company posted a net loss for the quarter of about $84 million. The net loss for the same period a year was much less, about $11.5 million. Per share, the loss was 78 cents, which was vastly more than the 10 cents analysts expected.
In September, I wrote in InvestorPlace that Workhorse was on the right path. The path, it seems, is getting tougher.
The Bottom Line
An investment in WKHS stock is speculation that the company will prosper and that the shares bought at this stage will grow in value like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
It looks to be a tough trip. For example, efforts by Workhorse to meet its production target of 300 to 400 vehicles by the end of 2020 were derailed by supply-chain problems and the novel coronavirus, which hit the company’s workforce hard. The virus outbreak prompted managers to modify assembly work and delay hiring.
A long-term investor who is comfortable with risk can look beyond short-term problems and look at potential. But waiting on WKHS stock may be best for now.

Right now, we are willing to go along with the consensus view that growth will catch up with valuations, but we recommend remaining flexible because the economic costs of the pandemic could continue to worsen.
Some investors may also be concerned that the weekly jobless claims total was higher than expected, coming in at 778,000 when the estimate was 733,000. We don’t pay much attention to these numbers because before the pandemic, the data was considered “noisy.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Instead, we would wait for the monthly unemployment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tends to be a little less shifty.
Still, that early unemployment claims release – remember the market is closed all-day on Thursday, and it closes early on Friday – has soured sentiment a little this morning.
Because we want to be cautious about our exposure to consumer stocks right now – especially with employment suffering – we are looking to take advantage of the dip with a bullish trade on United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS).
A Retail Slowdown Might Not Hurt UPS
As we mentioned last week, we’re concerned about retail sales despite the fact that the holidays are approaching.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) reported earnings last week. Both companies exceeded expectations, but warned about future demand. The U.S. Census Bureau also reported month-over-month retail spending for October last Tuesday, which missed growth estimates by 40%.
Despite the fact that FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS are preparing for “shipageddon” thanks to the holiday rush, there is still money “missing” from the retail sector.

Advance Real Retail and Food Service Sales — Chart Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
The advance retail spending numbers from last week show that the U.S. economy is still down $51.3 billion in spending that would have otherwise happened.
The pandemic created a deficit of a little over $75 billion, to put this in perspective.
But shippers like UPS are still positioned very well to take advantage of increases in online spending as businesses and consumers further shift their buying habits.
UPS and FDX are clearly experiencing a rush given how many packages they are dealing with now, and as NBC reports:
According to consulting company Accenture, 75 percent of consumers say they’ll do at least some of their holiday shopping online this year — up 65 percent from last year — and 43 percent plan to do so exclusively.
This additional shopping will put strain on UPS, but it will also put revenue in the coffers.
The UPS Advantage
When UPS reported earnings in October it beat expectations largely due to increase demand from Asia and small to medium sized businesses.
That’s one reason we aren’t concerned about the effect of a vaccine on the stock actually. If there is a vaccine sooner than expected, we don’t think investors will discount UPS as quickly because business activity would pick up, helping UPS make up for revenue lost from individual consumers shopping.
And we don’t feel that UPS has the same risks of falling demand if the pandemic is resolved more quickly than expected. An increase in economic activity should offset any issues the company might experience when consumers and businesses are willing to travel more freely.

Daily Chart of United Parcel Service (UPS) – Chart Source: TradingView
We closed our last trade in UPS before earnings on Oct. 28, which turned out to be the right call. However, since then sentiment has improved, and we think the stock has established enough support between $160-$165 to justify selling a put against the stock.
We would recommend looking farther into December for an expiration date because we think the stock will continue to perform well as we near the end of the year. We also think its worth selling puts with a strike price at the upper end of UPS’ support range.
The stock has a lot going for it this time of year, and it’s time to take advantage of that strength.

ATLANTA, Nov. 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UPS (NYSE:UPS) today announced service enhancements to aid in the massive distribution efforts for COVID-19 vaccines in the coming months. As part of these enhancements, UPS Healthcare now can produce up to 1,200 lbs. of dry ice per hour in its U.S. facilities to support the storage and transportation of cold chain products, such as frozen vaccines, in accordance with manufacturer storage requirements. The increased production also allows UPS to make dry ice available for U.S. and Canadian hospitals, clinics and other points of care requiring dry ice to store vaccines locally.  Dry ice will be sourced at UPS Worldport® and can be available next day.A major spike in demand is causing logistics providers to plan for what some analysts fear may be a dry ice shortage, as pharmaceutical companies strategize getting hundreds of millions of their vaccine doses safely to communities around the U.S. and internationally. “Enhancing our dry ice production capabilities increases our supply chain agility and reliability immensely when it comes to handling complex vaccines for our customers,” says Wes Wheeler, president of UPS Healthcare. “Healthcare facilities in Louisville, Dallas and Ontario will ensure we have the capability to produce dry ice to sufficiently pack and replenish shipments as needed to keep products viable and effective.”In addition to dry ice production, UPS will also launch, in collaboration with Stirling Ultracold, a joint effort to provide portable ultra-low temperature (ULT) freezers. These portable freezers will be distributed and used in smaller point of care facilities requiring a more permanent solution for longer term freezer storage. UPS will be working with Stirling to offer the Stirling ULT25 and Undercounter Model SU105 to thermally protect critical vaccines requiring ultra-low temperatures ranging anywhere from -20°C to -80°C.“We are truly proud to partner with UPS in this critical effort.  As the leading manufacturer of small and portable ULT devices, Stirling Ultracold freezers integrate well with UPS Healthcare logistics to provide complete cold-chain of custody for COVID-19 vaccines from the drug manufacturers to medical facilities,” says Dusty Tenney, CEO of Stirling. “This program will help ensure vaccines remain effective next year, and for years to come, as future vaccines and biologics are developed to keep the world healthy and safe.”About UPS HealthcareUPS Healthcare operates 128 facilities in 32 countries which are regulated under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).

2020-11-13	2020-11-13 18:14:26	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	DoorDash Is Trouncing Its Rivals, and That’s Just the Start	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The financial details for DoorDash Inc. — one of the biggest beneficiaries from the pandemic and one of the year’s most anticipated initial public offerings — are now out and they are stunning. Even more important for would-be investors, they signal that the food-delivery leader has a good chance of thriving in another larger industry: the last-mile delivery of anything.Early Friday, DoorDash filed to go public with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, revealing in its prospectus that revenue more than tripled in the first nine months of 2020 to $1.9 billion from $587 million year earlier. At the same time, its net loss shrank in the period to $149 million from $533 million last year, showing the company’s ability to improve profitability as it reaches bigger scale. The sales results also point to how DoorDash is rapidly extending its lead over its main competitors. To illustrate the disparity, Uber Eats and Grubhub increased sales by roughly 125% and 53%, respectively, in their latest reported quarters. Impressive for sure, but not DoorDash impressive.DoorDash has thrived in the Covid-19 world. With many restaurants forced to either shut down physical locations or limit in-person dining, more business has moved to online orders, driving traffic to the food-delivery platforms. The growing opportunity has sparked a recent wave of consolidation. In June, Just Eat Takeaway.com NV agreed to buy Grubhub for $7.3 billion. And then a month later, Uber Technologies Inc. announced a deal to purchase Postmates for $2.65 billion. But even after these deals, DoorDash will remain the preeminent leader.With its No. 1 position in food delivery, DoorDash says it will go after the larger prize of local commerce. The company plans to use its platform to eventually provide on-demand delivery for any product. “While food itself is a category that has a long runway for growth, we believe the network we have built ideally positions us to fulfill our vision of empowering all local businesses to compete in the convenience economy,” the company said. Notably, Uber is looking into this kind of expansion as well.Read more: Uber Eats + Postmates Offers Amazon-Sized Opportunity: Tae KimCan DoorDash muscle into other categories outside of food? On the one hand, it is hard to see how it could ever be as efficient for a network of gig workers with sedans and other small vehicles to do last-mile delivery the way FedEx Corp. or United Parcel Service Inc. do. But some recent experiments show that the pandemic might have increased retailer appetite for having a non-traditional last-mile delivery partner. Sephora and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. have recently collaborated with Instacart to offer same-day delivery from their stores. If those efforts are successful this holiday season, it could help DoorDash and its rivals make the case that they can play a bigger role in the on-demand economy.In any logistics-centric business, achieving density of deliveries is typically thought of as the holy grail because it is an essential component of reaching profitability. That would seem to make major metropolitan areas the most attractive place for a food-delivery company to focus its efforts. DoorDash, perhaps counterintuitively, has not taken that approach. It has emphasized blanketing suburban and smaller metropolitan areas, theorizing that these places are especially fertile ground because they are underserved when it comes to food-delivery options.The filing also included other unexpected details about why the suburbs have been a good target for DoorDash: Parking and traffic are less nightmarish, making it easier to serve customers, and the high proportion of families makes for larger average orders. The company says it has 58% market share in the suburbs, a greater share than it has of the category overall. That focus should serve it well amid the pandemic and beyond. While consumers will certainly return to in-restaurant dining in greater numbers when the public health crisis abates, many who tried digital delivery for the first time this year will stick with it, even if they don’t do it as frequently.It won’t be easy for any of the food-delivery insurgents to expand beyond their core businesses. But DoorDash’s booming growth and commanding market share show it is attempting the transition from solid footing. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-11-10	2020-11-10 10:08:06	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	DHL, FedEx and UPS Are Ready to Save the World	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In normal times, globe-spanning logistics groups such as Deutsche Post AG, FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. quietly keep the economy humming.Covid-19 has recast that unassuming role in a more heroic light. When the pandemic history is written, the logistics industry will deserve a volume. “UPS-ers are essential workers,” the U.S. company’s boss Carol Tome told investors recently.Their most important task — quickly and safely delivering billions of doses of a coronavirus vaccine worldwide — still lies ahead. The massive demand and the ultra-cold temperatures required to store some promising vaccine candidates (including the one developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE) will provide an unprecedented logistical challenge.Thanks to early preparation and heavy investment, the companies think they’re in good shape to tackle it. Happily for shareholders, the vaccine effort could further juice the industry’s strong recent earnings and share price performance.The logistics groups have been under immense strain, so it’s hard to begrudge them their good fortune. Bulk deliveries were hit early in the pandemic when businesses and factories were closed, so couriers suddenly had to deliver more to residential addresses, which is more expensive. When land borders closed and passenger planes were grounded, the industry was also called upon to get personal protective clothing and ventilators where they were needed.Right now, the companies are focused on saving Christmas. An unprecedented volume of holiday gifts will be purchased online this year. Deutsche Post’s DHL express-delivery unit expects holiday season volumes to be more than 50% higher than in 2019.As housebound populations “buy more stuff,” the big parcel networks have pounced on the golden opportunity, hiring tens of thousands of workers. Most businesses have imposed surcharges on customers to reflect the difficulty of delivering during a pandemic.Because of their large fixed costs, express-delivery networks make more money when more packages flow through them. Deutsche Post’s operating profit jumped by almost half year-on-year in the July to September quarter. The German company expects full-year free cash flow to exceed 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) and operating profit of up to 4.4 billion euros, a record. Since a March low, its shares have doubled. FedEx’s have almost trebled.Airfreight has become particularly lucrative. Much of the world’s air cargo normally travels in the bellies of passenger jets, which have been grounded. Deutsche Post and FedEx benefit from their absence because each company owns hundreds of dedicated airfreighters.  Shipping an estimated 10 billion doses of the vaccine will make yet more demands of airfreight, requiring some 15,000 flights over the next two years, Deutsche Post estimated in a recent study.(1)Some potential vaccines will need to be stored at very low temperatures, which plays to the strengths of big logistics providers. UPS has invested in two giant “freezer farms” in Kentucky and the Netherlands, capable of storing millions of doses at temperature as low as -80 Celsius. FedEx has more than 90 cold chain facilities worldwide and plans more.Coupled with the existing shortage of airfreight capacity, the exacting handling requirements could inflate shipping costs. Detlef Trefzger, chief executive officer of Kuehne + Nagel International AG, a big freight forwarder, said recently that his company wasn’t a government body and therefore the market rate “will be applicable.” Berenberg analysts say vaccine delivery could create a period of “supernormal” profits in logistics.  In theory, once a vaccine is widely available, the favorable pricing dynamics supporting the industry will normalize somewhat. Deutsche Post, FedEx and UPS shares fell on Monday, even as the stock market surged.However, the e-commerce shift is likely to be permanent, and analysts say airfreight markets could remain tight for at least a couple more years. If a vaccine leads to increased trade flows, the logistics groups will benefit.As with Amazon.com Inc., the delivery industry risks a backlash if it’s seen to profit excessively from the pandemic. But if vaccines are delivered safely and our holiday gifts arrive on time, the companies will have earned our gratitude, and a commensurate reward.(1) The 10 billion dose estimate is based on 70% of the global population requiring vaccination to achieve herd immunity, and an average of 1.8 doses per recipient.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.

UPS Reaches Accord With Canadian Trade Union; Stock Up 43% YTD	"United Parcel Service announced on Saturday that it has reached a five-year collective agreement with the majority of its employees in Canada after signing a deal with the Canada Council of Teamsters.

The sector is still 10.6% below its prior 2020 highs. Those were set in the first quarter of the year, before the novel coronavirus rattled the market. 
For what it’s worth, that’s about average vs. the other industries and the overall market. The S&P 500 is down 7.3% from its highs, although it was able to set new highs even after the pandemic selloff. 
When considering the other 10 S&P 500 sectors, the industrial sector is in the top six when it comes to how far off its highs it is. With five sectors below it, the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLI) is in the middle of the pack. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When it comes to performance though, it’s in the bottom half. 
Over the past year, industrial stocks have lost over 4%. That’s better than three other groups. However, it lags seven other sectors, three of which have generated double-digit returns in that time.


					7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy for the Second Wave				

In the end, though, that doesn’t matter. Industrial stocks have been around for centuries and they will be around for centuries more. Let’s look at seven industrial stocks that are worth buying now. 
Honeywell (NYSE:HON)
United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS)
FedEx (NYSE:FDX)
Boeing (NYSE:BA)
3M Co (NYSE:MMM)
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)

Industrial Stocks to Buy: Honeywell (HON)

Considered by many to be a best-in-breed industrial name, it’s hard to lead off a list of industrial stocks and not include Honeywell. Unfortunately, though, HON stock has kept pace with the sector’s performance. 
Yet, despite a massive selloff in the markets lately, HON stock is only down 7% on the year. Considering that so much of the industrial sector’s business is tied to the economy, things could look a lot worse.
In any regard, Honeywell has its feelers in all the right places. 
The company has made its living dominating areas such as aerospace and control panels. The latter are used for a lot of things, from machinery to thermostats. Over the years though, Honeywell has built on its offerings. 
It includes safety equipment, healthcare, pharma, manufacturing and supply chain management. For its buildings and city unit, the company states, “From skyscrapers to stadiums to shopping centers, drive connectivity, productivity and security for everyone in them.”
Further, Honeywell is expanding into the internet of things, or more specifically, the Industrial Internet of Things. For many investors, they like that HON stock is capitalizing on its legacy businesses, while also expanding into new frontiers. 
Plus, Honeywell pays out a 2.3% dividend yield.

Is there an industrial company better prepared to handle an influx in demand than UPS? Because of the pandemic, this logistics operator is now benefiting from a sharp rise in e-commerce sales. 
That’s right — it’s not just Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reaping revenue from our current situation. Big-box retailers, e-commerce venders and others have all seen an explosion in online sales. If you haven’t had the time to go through last quarter’s earnings results, just look at information from the St. Louis Federal Reserve. It shows that online sales have made up a growing percentage of overall retail sales for years. But in 2020, that figure has exploded.
In any case, that has resulted in big-time business for UPS. Revenue is forecast to climb over 9% this year, but that may be conservative. In Q3, revenue ballooned 15.9% year over year to $21.2 billion. That smashed expectations by over $1 billion.

Unless you expect online sales to slow, UPS doesn’t seem like a name to bet against. It’s currently one of the stronger industrial stocks on the market.

The only reason some investors interested in industrial stocks may skip over UPS is to take a closer look at FedEx. 
What I love about FDX stock is the same thing I like about UPS: demand is simply overpowering the two companies. When customers can’t get enough of a companies’ goods and services, that’s a great problem to have. 
Of course, one day, Amazon’s own delivery services may create a problem for FedEx and UPS. However, that problem is not one we’re seeing right now. FedEx is forecast to grow revenue by a similar amount to UPS this quarter, up 10.7%. 
Moreover, it’s the company’s explosion in earnings that we should take notice of. Last quarter, earnings of $4.87 per share beat estimates by more than $2 a share. 
Consensus expectations — which may now prove conservative — call for 67% earnings growth this year. That’s not a one-year gain, followed by a reversion year, either. Analysts expect almost 10% growth next year, too. 
At the end of the day, shares trade at over 17.6 times this year’s forward earnings. At the very least that’s reasonable. One could even make the case that it’s cheap, given the secular trend in e-commerce sales and the earnings boom at FedEx. 

Boeing (BA)

Boeing is a bit of a controversial pick down here, isn’t it? Of all the industrial stocks, this one has so many negative catalysts working against it that it’s hard to be excited. 
To be frank, shares are down 55% this year and down 67% from the all-time highs made in February 2019. That’s when Boeing’s second 737 MAX jet crashed, sending the company into a rabbit hole of headaches, controversy and losses. 
Throw in the fact that the aerospace industry has been ravished by the novel coronavirus, too, and many are wondering why Boeing would be a buy. 
So, why is it?
Boeing is one half of a duopoly on plane manufacturing. Between Boeing and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY), virtually all large jets are made by the two companies. And while BA stock may take a while to regain its crown, it can’t go much lower from here. At least, from a business perspective. 
Add in that the U.S. government has a national interest in seeing Boeing survive (and really, thrive) as a defense contractor, and there’s even less reason to worry about the company’s liquidity. 
Further, the 737 MAX is making progress toward getting back into flight — although whether or not consumers accept the plane is another story. European regulators just gave it the green light. Boeing now waits on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). But by and large, the negatives are starting to fade away for Boeing, and its future is looking brighter.

Perhaps this one is still too risky for investors who want it at a lower price. But, to me, this looks like a buy-and-throw-it-in-the-bottom-drawer kind of situation — with a multi-year outlook. 

3M Co (MMM)

When it comes to industrial stocks with dependable dividends, 3M is near the top of the list. The company kicks out a 3.7% yield. That’s more than four times the yield one will get with the 10-year Treasury bond. 
Better yet, MMM stock is also consistent in how often the dividend gets raised. 3M has not only paid, but has raised its annual payout for 61 consecutive years. Anytime a company has accomplished such a feat, it’s worth a look. 
On the downside, 3M is starved for growth. On the plus side, it’s not seeing its revenue take a big hit from the novel coronavirus. In fact, the company is doing considerable business in the healthcare and PPE fields. That has helped offset the slower growth its seeing in its other businesses. 
Revenue is forecast to fall less than 1% this year, while earnings are forecast to fall a little under 8%. However, in 2021, expectations call for 10% earnings growth, erasing 2020’s drop. 
Even as the pandemic rages on, the economy is moving in the right direction. And that will bode well for the company in 2021, particularly if its strong business units stay strong. 

Lockheed Martin (LMT)

Lockheed Martin is not among the quintessential industrial stocks. That’s because investors consider it more of a defense stock, which is true by industry but not by sector. 
In any regard, LMT stock seems to be presenting an opportunity. In mid-October, Lockheed reported earnings, delivering a top-line and bottom-line beat for Q3. In the third quarter, the company grew revenue by 10.2% and its earnings by 8.7%. Further, management upped its guidance. 
The company now expects earnings of roughly $24.45 a share vs. its prior outlook range of $23.75 to $24.05 per share. For revenue, management forecasts sales of $65.25 billion vs. a previous outlook range of $63.5 billion to $65 billion. 
Despite all that, on Oct. 20 shares fell 3% on earnings and another 1.4% in the following session. 
That leaves the stock trading at about 13.2 times this year’s forward earnings. Lockheed is forecast to grow earnings by more than 11% this year and 6.7% next year and just reported a solid quarterly result. On top of that, it pays out a nearly 3% dividend yield.

To me, that sounds more like an opportunity than a red flag. 

Caterpillar (CAT)

Last but not least, it would be hard to leave Caterpillar off the list of top industrial stocks. 
While CAT stock is highly levered to the economy, we’re not seeing the type of breakdown typically associated with a deep global recession. In fact, shares are higher, up 5% in the past month after its rally. 
Why? Because it’s likely that some sort of infrastructure deal will eventually come to fruition. Whether it’s a Democrat or Republican-occupied White House, both sides have an incentive to put people to work with a big infrastructure bill. 
On top of that, most of the world is looking to get back to regular life. In some cases, that’s merely a hope and not a plan. For others, though, construction, road work and other tasks needing heavy machinery will start back up. That makes 2021 a rebound year. 
These two catalysts should be a boon for Caterpillar — or at least, that’s what the stock price is reflecting amid the current rally.

2020-10-29	2020-10-29 08:48:22	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Beats Q3 Estimates; Shares Plunge 9% On Margin Concerns	Shares of United Parcel Service fell 8.8% on Wednesday though the logistics company beat the Streets’ expectations for the third quarter on strong pandemic-induced demand for e-commerce deliveries.United Parcel's (UPS) revenue surged 15.9% Y/Y to $21.24 billion and beat analysts’ estimate of $20.19 billion. The company attributed the strong top-line growth to continued outbound demand from Asia and growth from small and medium-sized businesses. It experienced a 13.8% rise in average daily volume due to continued elevated residential demand in the domestic market as people are increasingly making online purchases amid the pandemic.The company’s adjusted EPS grew 10.1% to $2.28 driven by increased revenue partially offset by pressure on the company’s margins. UPS' earnings came ahead of analysts’ EPS forecast of $1.90. The adjusted operating margin fell to 11.3% in 3Q20 from 12% in 3Q19 as expenses to support higher volumes weighed on profitability.Notably, the adjusted operating margin of the Domestic Package segment shrunk 220 basis points Y/Y to 8.6% due to a spike in residential deliveries while the International Package segment's adjusted operating margin expanded 400 basis points to 23.8%.On the conference call, the company stated that its commercial business continued to be under pressure in 3Q due to the economic downturn. However, UPS optimized its network and captured share in small and medium-sized businesses.Also, UPS believes that penetration of e-commerce retail sales will not decline even after the pandemic. The company highlighted that e-commerce sales are now projected to account for over 20% of all US retail sales this year. UPS did not provide any guidance for 4Q or full-year citing “uncertainty around the timing and pace of the economic recovery.” (See UPS stock analysis on TipRanks)Cowen analyst Helane Becker reiterated her Hold rating for UPS following the results, as she acknowledged in a research note to investors that the company continues to have trouble “bending the cost curve” in its US business.Meanwhile, the Street is cautiously optimistic about UPS with 11 Buys, 3 Holds and 4 Sells adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus. With shares already advancing 33.3% year-to-date, the average analyst price target of $164.87 suggests an upside potential of about 6% in the coming months.Related News:  Visa 4Q Sales Sink 17% As Travel Freeze Hurts Payment Volumes  Ford Sees 2020 Profit As Truck Demand Picks Up; Shares Gain 5%  Amazon Hires 100,000 Seasonal Workers Ahead Of Peak Holiday Period More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Penumbra's 3Q Revenues Beat The Street; Stock Rises 6.6%   * Wyndham’s 3Q Sales Plunge 40%; Street Says Buy   * Eli Lilly Strikes $375M Covid-19 Antibody Supply Deal With US Government   * Bed Bath & Beyond Down 12% As 3-Year Plan Fails To Impress Investors	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-beats-q3-estimates-shares-084822001.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-28	2020-10-28 23:37:14	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	EBay Growth Ebbs, Sparking Concern Pandemic Boost Is Over	(Bloomberg) -- EBay Inc.’s marketplace growth slowed in the third quarter, worrying investors that an online shopping boost from the Covid-19 pandemic isn’t sustainable.Gross merchandise volume, the value of all goods sold on the site, rose 22% in the third quarter, down from 26% growth in the second quarter. International GMV increased 16%, a smaller gain than the previous period.“If you look at EBay prior to Covid, they were under-performing other e-commerce companies, and that’s the concern,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co. “Do we go back to that lackluster performance after Covid?”The shares dropped 4% in extended trading after closing at $53.25 in New York.Fourth-quarter sales will be $2.64 billion to $2.71 billion, the San Jose, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. That compares with $2.8 billion in revenue during last year’s fourth quarter. The new forecast partly reflects recent asset sales.Pandemic-wary shoppers have turned to online marketplaces like EBay and Amazon.com Inc. to avoid stores in the era of social distancing. The company said it ended the quarter with 183 million active buyers. That was less than analysts’ average prediction for almost 184 million, raising fears about customer growth.Investors may be concerned that EBay’s growth is lagging behind e-commerce growth overall, which is more than 30%, said Ron Josey, an analyst at JMP Securities. “You could argue they are still losing share here,” he added.Chief Executive Officer Jamie Iannone, who took the helm in April, is still trying to show that a slimmed-down EBay can lure customers and get them to spend more on the site. Under pressure from activist investors, EBay in February completed the sale of its event-tickets marketplace StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion. In July, EBay sold the classifieds business to Norway’s Adevinta ASA in a cash and stock deal worth $9.2 billion that leaves EBay with a 44.4% stake in the company.Iannone said he is focusing on refurbished products with two-year warranties from brands like DeLonghi and Makita. The market for refurbished brand goods is in the tens of billions of dollars and is a good fit for EBay deal-seekers, he said. The company is also developing authentication services for luxury watches and second-hand sneakers to attract more high-value products to the site and increase average order sizes, the CEO added.EBay has deals with United Parcel Service Inc. and other carriers to protect sellers from shipping capacity issues and surcharges over the busy holiday period, he noted.“We’re well positioned to help sellers reach buyers this holiday season,” Iannone said.In the fourth quarter, profit, excluding some items, will be 78 to 84 cents a share, EBay said, compared with analysts’ estimates of 80 cents. Third-quarter revenue rose 25% to $2.6 billion. Analysts estimated $2.58 billion. Profit before certain items in the recent period was 85 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 80 cents.(Updates with analyst comment in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ebay-gives-disappointing-sales-forecast-205215797.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-28	2020-10-28 18:33:02	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: UPS	"Benzinga's PreMarket Prep airs every morning from 8-9 a.m. ET. During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.There are good and bad days to report earnings. On many occasions, the overall mood of the broad market can have an impact on how the Street reacts to a report.Today happens to be a day that started out bad and got worse. It just so happens that United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) announced good numbers before the open, but is trading deep in the red.2020 Price Action: UPS had a mind of its own in warmly 2020. After ending 2019 at $117.05, it went in the opposite direction of the broad market in January, falling to $103.52. It participated in the February and March swoon finding a bottom ahead of the S&P 500 index on March 12 at $82.That coincided nicely with its March 2013 ($82.28) and April 2013 ($81.95) lows. It benefitted from being a ""stay-at-home"" issue and surpassed its former all-time high from January 2018 ($135.53()in July and kept going. In fact, it made its all-time high last week at $178.01 and posted its all-time closing high on Oct. 20 at $174.88.Some Profit-Taking Ahead Of The Report: Since making its all-time high last week, sellers came into the issue instigating a string of lower highs, lows and closes. That streak ended on Tuesday as it made a higher high and low from Tuesday and finished green for the day by nearly $3 (159 to $170.84).Unfortunately for shareholders, even today's high for the session ($163.67) is still $2 from the low of the recent decline, which was made on Monday at $166.18.View more earnings on UPSBlowout Numbers: Before the open, the company reported a third-quarter EPS beat of 42 cents along with a sales beat of $1.2 billion. What may have alarmed shareholders of the issue, along with the steep decline in the broad market, was that the company did not provide guidance due to the uncertainty around the timing and pace of the economic recovery.PreMarket Prep's Take: In after-hours trading on Tuesday, at least a few traders were anticipating a good report. Also, the issue was talked up on CNBC's ""Fast Money,"" with the mention of some bullish call activity taking place during Tuesday's session. In fact, super-aggressive buyers took the issue over $5 above its closing price to $176 on significant volume.For Dennis Dick, this was too good of a shorting opportunity and he initiated a short position last night ahead of the report.""They had it up $5 because someone thought they saw a big call buyer,"" he said. ""A lot of the good news may be priced into the issue with its incredible run off the March low.""When the issue was being discussed on the show, it was trading at the $167 area. The author of this article suggested the issue may have a date with $160, but did not anticipate it happening today.After a lower open, it continued lower, easily breaching $160, falling all the way to $158.17 as of 2 p.m. ET and is attempting to rebound. The current low coincides with its Sept. 24 low of $157.99.The full discussion on the issue from today's show can be found here:See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Shopify  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: SAP(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Statements other than those of current or historical fact, and all statements accompanied by terms such as “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “estimate,” “assume,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “target,” “plan,” and variations thereof, and similar terms, are intended to be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made subject to the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws pursuant to Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.From time to time, we also include forward-looking statements in other publicly disclosed materials. Such statements may relate to our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results, and give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made.Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience, present expectations or anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, include, but are not limited to: continued uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, financial condition, financial results and financial position, our customers and suppliers, and on the global economy; changes in general economic conditions, in the U.S. or internationally; significant competition on a local, regional, national and international basis; changes in our relationships with our significant customers; changes in the complex and stringent regulation in the U.S. and internationally (including tax laws and regulations); increased or more complex physical or data security requirements; legal, regulatory or market responses to global climate change; results of negotiations and ratifications of labor contracts; strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns by our employees; the effects of changing prices of energy, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and interruptions in supplies of these commodities; changes in exchange rates or interest rates; uncertainty from the expected discontinuance of LIBOR and transition to any other interest rate benchmark; our ability to maintain our brand image; breaches in data security; disruptions to the Internet or our technology infrastructure; interruptions in or impacts on our business from natural or man-made events or disasters including terrorist attacks, epidemics or pandemics; our ability to accurately forecast our future capital investment needs; exposure to changing economic, political and social developments in international and emerging markets; changes in business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions that may result in impairment of our assets; increases in our expenses or funding obligations relating to employee health, retiree health and/or pension benefits; potential additional U.S. or international tax liabilities; potential claims or litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our transformation initiatives; cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results; our ability to manage insurance and claims expenses; and other risks discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and subsequently filed reports. You should consider the limitations on, and risks associated with, forward-looking statements and not unduly rely on the accuracy of information contained in such forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances, changes in expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events after the date of those statements, except as required by law.Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles (&quot;GAAP&quot;) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including &quot;adjusted&quot; compensation and benefits, operating profit, operating margin, other income (expense), income before income taxes, income tax expense, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share. We also supplement the reporting of revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit with non-GAAP measures that exclude the period-over-period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities.  Additionally, we periodically disclose free cash flow, free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions, and capital expenditures including principal repayments of capital lease obligations. The equivalent measures determined in accordance with GAAP are also referred to as &quot;reported&quot; or &quot;unadjusted.”We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide additional meaningful information to assist users of our financial statements in understanding our financial results and cash flows and assessing our ongoing performance, because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying operations and may provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses.  These non-GAAP measures are used internally by management for business unit operating performance analysis, business unit resource allocation and in connection with incentive compensation award determinations.Costs Related to Restructuring Programs; Transformation Strategy CostsAdjusted operating profit, operating margin, pre-tax income, net income and earnings per share exclude the impact of costs related to restructuring programs, including Transformation strategy costs. Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Hedging ActivitiesCurrency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit. The derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period (including the period over period impact of foreign currency hedging activities). The difference between the current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations.Impact of Changes in Pension Discount RatesNon-GAAP pension discount rate-neutral operating profit excludes the period over period impact of discount rate changes on pension service cost. Effective January 1, 2020, we began evaluating our segments using pension discount rate-neutral operating profit in addition to our current segment operating profit measure.Pension discount rate-neutral operating profit is calculated by discounting the value of benefits attributable to employee service in the current period utilizing the prior year discount rate applicable to each of our company-sponsored defined benefit plans. The difference between this derived amount and the current period reported service cost is the period over period impact of pension discount rate movements on operating profit.Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Capital ExpendituresWe calculate free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, and plus or minus the net changes in finance receivables and other investing activities. Free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions adds back any discretionary pension contributions made during the period. We believe free cash flow, free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions and free cash flow adjusted for principal repayments of finance lease obligations are important indicators of how much cash is generated by regular business operations and we use them as a measure of incremental cash available to invest in our business, meet our debt obligations and return cash to shareowners. Additionally, we believe that adjusting capital expenditures for principal repayments of finance lease obligations more appropriately reflects the overall cash that we have invested in capital assets.Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Josh Brown Shares His Thoughts On UPS	On CNBC's &quot;Fast Money Halftime Report,&quot; Josh Brown spoke about UBS's bullish call on United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS). UBS upgraded the stock to Buy with a price target of $214.Brown doesn't own the stock, but he kind of likes it. He likes the fundamentals better than the technicals. He said the last couple of days were not kind to UPS, but the buyers stepped in when the stock reached its rising 50-day moving average, at $165. Brown explained that it's important that stocks respect their uptrends, even in a volatile market.The negative is that the momentum is rolling over, said Brown. He is concerned because the RSI 14 index is around 40, which is a no man's land. He sees that as a sign that enthusiasm has started to decline.From the investment perspective, Brown really likes the stock and he would own it, but he warned viewers that they have to be able to get past whatever might happen in the next month or two.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 'Fast Money Halftime Report' Picks For October 27  * Cramer Gives His Opinion On Nordstrom, American Airlines And More(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

UPS Aims To Sign Up 50,000 At ‘UPS Brown Friday’ Hiring Events Nationwide	ATLANTA, Oct. 27, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --   * One-day hiring blitz on October 30 is part of UPS’s larger effort to hire over 100,000 seasonal employees  * Nearly 250 virtual and in-person job fairs will be held in company locations nationwideUPS (NYSE: UPS) announced today that it expects to sign-up at least 50,000 seasonal employees this Friday, October 30, in its annual one-day ‘UPS Brown Friday’ hiring blitz at company locations across the country. Nearly a month before Black Friday and Cyber Monday officially kick off the holiday shopping season, UPS Brown Friday brings nearly 250 virtual and in-person hiring fairs. The company will hire thousands of candidates on the spot – part of its broader effort, announced last month, to hire more than 100,000 seasonal workers to support its annual holiday shipping rush. “UPS Brown Friday has become an annual tradition,” said Chief Human Resources Officer Charlene Thomas. “For tens of thousands of Americans, it’s an opportunity to land one of the country’s best seasonal jobs, with the potential to turn into a career. Many of those who attend one of our job fairs this Friday will be hired by Monday, and many of those hired will be offered permanent jobs when the holidays are over.”A list of local hiring events is available here. Most of this year’s hiring events will be virtual. Applicants will check into a virtual lobby, then do online interviews with UPS Human Resources representatives. Some company locations will hold in-person events, where allowed by local health authorities. Those events will strictly adhere to safety restrictions including requiring masks and social distancing, with applicants waiting outside the building before being called in for an interview. All in-person hiring events will include a virtual option.Those who are unable to attend a hiring fair can still apply easily online, at UPSjobs.com. Videos featuring employees describing their work experience at UPS are also available at that UPS jobs website. The full- and part-time seasonal positions – primarily package handlers, drivers,  and driver-helpers – have long been an entry point for permanent employment at UPS. Over the last three years, about 35% of people hired by UPS for seasonal package handler jobs were later hired in a permanent position when the holidays were over, and about 123,000 UPS employees – nearly a third of the company’s U.S. workforce – started in seasonal positions.Through the company’s Earn and Learn program, eligible seasonal employees who are students can earn up to $1,300 towards college expenses, in addition to their hourly pay, for three months of continuous employment. UPS has invested nearly $670 million in tuition assistance – nearly $30 million a year since the program was established in 1997 – helping over 300,000 employees pay for their college education.Visual assets can be found here.About UPS UPS (NYSE: UPS) is one of the world’s largest package delivery companies with 2019 revenue of $74 billion, and provides a broad range of integrated logistics solutions for customers in more than 220 countries and territories.

2020-10-21	2020-10-21 15:30:07	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Holiday ‘Shipageddon’ Need Not Mean Doomsday for Retail	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- After months of extreme disruption and challenge, retailers badly need their holiday season to go right. Unfortunately, they might find themselves confounded by a thorny problem borne of pandemic-related safety concerns: A crush of e-commerce orders on a scale the industry has never seen, putting stress on their supply chains and those of their shipping partners. The result could be a multitude of late packages and frustrated customers, a potential mess that has been dubbed Shipageddon.Package carriers FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. say they’re prepared for the onslaught. They may not have envisioned the pandemic, but they’ve spent billions over the past few years preparing for a more e-commerce heavy world, including adding expanded weekend service and investing in automation tools. They’re also bulking up their staff: FedEx and UPS plan to hire a combined 170,000 seasonal workers this year. Even so, e-commerce growth is expected to be explosive this holiday season, and it will be especially difficult to predict purchasing rhythms this time around. The surge in online demand may result in an extra 7 million packages flowing through delivery channels each day, predicts Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix. That extra load will pressure the system: ShipMatrix estimates that on-time performance during peak season will drop to 90% for FedEx and 92% for UPS. That is lower than their on-time performances in both September 2020 and last year’s peak season. So retailers must take pains to ensure they’re not left in a lurch if logistics networks become strained. One way retailers are girding for this is by starting holiday deals earlier than usual, with some offering Black Friday-like sales in October. If they succeed at getting people to buy gifts early, it could have the dual benefit of spreading out orders over a longer stretch while allowing sellers to avoid some of the surcharges that carriers have put in place for the peak period. That will only take them so far because many consumers aren’t ready to get into Santa-mode just yet. But there are other things they can do.Throughout the season, but especially in the final weeks before Christmas, retailers would do well to steer customers to their curbside and in-store pickup options, in which the shopper effectively does last-mile delivery themselves. That means highlighting it in their marketing, an especially important step for chains that have added curbside pickup only since the pandemic, such as Macy’s Inc. or Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. They should also nudge people to choose this format at checkout by emphasizing it is often the fastest option. Shoppers should be receptive: Deloitte’s survey found that the reasons consumers are opting for pickup have shifted somewhat since the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak, with the perceived speed and convenience becoming more of a factor. Many retailers are fulfilling an increasing amount of online orders from stores amid the Covid-19-related drops in foot traffic. For these sellers, teaming up with a delivery partner — the way restaurants and grocery stores do — could be a good way to get purchases through that last mile. Sephora, for example, has started a partnership with Instacart for same-day delivery, while Uber Technologies Inc. has said it’s keen to expand Uber Eats beyond food to other local businesses. Such a setup might not be economical or practical for some chains year-round, but could make sense during the busy season.There are also behind-the-scenes tactics retailers can employ to keep networks from getting strained while also potentially helping with their own profitability. Scot Wingo — who introduced the term Shipageddon to my lexicon and is a board member at ChannelAdvisor, a company that helps merchants with online sales — says retailers can plan their deals and promotions with an eye toward consolidating orders. For instance, a store could offer a $10 gift card to shoppers who spend $100, instead of a blanket “10% off” discount, because that format would incentivize building a bigger shopping cart and result in potentially fewer shipments. Retailers also can use inventory analytics and management systems to make sure orders go out in as few boxes as possible, including trying to bundle together multiple orders from the same household that have come in a short time window. Smart retailers will prioritize communication. Customers will want to be kept informed about expected package arrival times from the time an order is placed through the delivery process, and they’re not going to be thrilled if they don’t get their items on time. But, at least if they have a reliable heads-up about a delivery date, they can make contingency plans — and maybe end up with a little less customer service animus toward either the store or the carrier. Some retailers will have a harder time than others in adapting to the seasonal boom in e-commerce. It will be difficult for those situated inside enclosed malls to get customers to embrace pickup options when they don’t have their own entrances for easy retrieval. That stands in contrast to chains such as Old Navy or Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc., which tend to be in strip centers and can offer these services with relative ease. The effort to get packages on doorsteps is going to be nothing short of Herculean this year. Retailers that use all the options at their disposal will be the ones that customers stick with when this is all over. \--With assistance from Brooke Sutherland.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

Workhorse Stock Could Skyrocket on a U.S. Postal Service Contract	"Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) stock has been trading for the past decade or so. But it did not get much attention until this year. Consider that WKHS stock has soared from $1.32 to a high of $30.99. That is an impressive run!

However, investors should note that shares have backed off. They are now at $22.
Workhorse is the developer of electric vehicles for last-mile delivery. The company got its start back in 2007 and was called AMP Electric Vehicles. At first, the focus was on developing EVs for two-seat roadsters. But the company would eventually pivot to create trucks and vans for commercial purposes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
A big part of this involved a merger with Workhorse Custom Chassis, which was founded in 1998. The company was the developer of General Motors’ (NYSE:GM) chasses. As a result, the merger allowed for the new entity — Workhorse — to become a full-blown manufacturer.
WKHS Stock: All About the Vehicles
Workhorse’s C650 and C1000 step vans have a modular battery pack system, which has 35 to 70 kilowatt hours of power and 100-mile ranges. There is also a proprietary telematics system to track and monitor the performance and optimize the routes. Workhorse estimates that its vehicles have 60% less maintenance expense versus fossil-fueled trucks. This could translate into $170,000 in savings over a 20-year period. Because of the strong return on investment, the company has taken a premium pricing model.
So far, there are over Workhorse 400 vehicles on the road. But there is likely to be significant growth in the coming years.
One of the catalysts is the U.S. Postal Service, which is in the process of upgrading its fleet of 165,000 vehicles and the contract could be worth over $6 billion. As for Workhorse, it is among the three bidders left.
It’s far from clear how things may turn out. Let’s face it, the federal government can be slow and there will be considerable lobbying. But given the ROI of Workhorse vehicles, it does seem reasonable that the company has a decent chance of being the winner — or at least having some role in the contract.
If so, this would certainly be a game changer. It would likely encourage other large customers, like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX), to consider Workhorse vehicles for large deployments.
The Lordstown Motors Catalyst
But this is not the only major catalyst for WKHS stock. Keep in mind that the company has a 10% equity stake in Lordstown Motors. The company develops EV pick-up trucks at a former GM factory. Next year, Lordstown Motors plans to begin the rollout of its vehicles — and there are already orders for $2 billion.
Oh, and the company is coming public through a special purpose acquisition company. This is a corporation that raises money through an IPO and then merges with an operating company.
As for Lordstown Motors, it is looking to merge with the DiamondPeak Holdings (NASDAQ:DPHC) SPAC. In other words, this could represent a valuable asset for Workhorse’s balance sheet.

Bottom Line on WKHS Stock
What if the company does not win the U.S. Post Office contract? Yes, it would be a major setback. This is perhaps the biggest near-term risk. Yet it would not be existential for the company.
With the surge in the growth of e-commerce, there is a need for more cost-effective last-mile delivery vehicles. And yes, Workhorse is a pretty good option. It is also important that the company’s vehicles are not just a concept. Workhorse does have contracts — albeit relatively small — with companies like Ryder (NYSE:R).
Although for now, when it comes to WKHS stock, it still does look like a speculation, given the U.S. Postal Service contract and its high valuation. Thus, if you do make an investment, it’s probably best to not get too aggressive. After all, if things pan out, the return should be substantial anyway.

A new report by a short-selling firm includes damaging information about Workhorse. Moreover, the shares are likely to be hurt in the short- and medium-term by the delay of an important U.S. Post Office contract.
Finally, despite all of these issues, the valuation remains very high.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
A Damaging Report
On Oct. 8, short-seller Fuzzy Panda Research issued a report in which it stated that it believes that Workhorse has no chance of winning a huge deal to provide USPS with new vehicles. Workhorse bid on the $6 billion deal along with its partner, VT Hackney.
According to Fuzzy Panda, which is shorting WKHS stock, VT Hackney pulled out of the competition for the contract last year. That’s because VT Hackney decided that any contract that the pair obtained from USPS “would not be material,” Fuzzy Panda reported.


					7 Value Stocks To Buy in an Overvalued Market				

And furthering my previously expressed worries about Workhouse’s technical capabilities, the report also stated that the company’s vehicles have malfunctioned on multiple occasions.
For example, the parking brake on a prototype vehicle that it made for the USPS failed to work, while the company’s “EV prototype ran out of range and got stranded… [its] suspension broke when hitting railroad tracks; {and it had} chassis performance problems,” the firm stated. Fuzzy Panda does not believe that Workhorse has the ability to meet the Post Office’s requirements.

In a past column, I noted that UPS (NYSE:UPS) had only acquired 350 of the 1,000 trucks that it had ordered from Workhorse in 2018. Further, I wrote that the owners of WKHS stock “should be worried about that issue and concerned by the fact that the company does not appear interested in ordering anymore vehicles from Workhorse at this point.”
Fuzzy Panda contends that UPS has “already moved on from  Workhorse,” and is primarily relying on Workhorse’s competitor, Arrival, to supply the rest of the EVs it was seeking.
Finally, the short seller quotes unnamed Workhorse employees as saying that the automaker is not working on filling any purchase orders.
More Issues With the USPS Deal
On Oct. 13, research firm Roth Capital reported that USPS decided not to award its contract for about two-and-a-half months. The Post Office was originally supposed to declare the winner or winners of the bidding process that day.
The delay is likely to keep a lid on Workhorse’s shares for the next six weeks or so. Additionally, Workhorse bulls had reportedly theorized that the Trump administration would give the company a contract in order to help the swing state of Ohio where Workhorse’s partner, Lordstown, has a plant. Now that the contract will not be awarded until after the election, that theory is obviously no longer valid.
Valuation and the Bottom Line on WKHS Stock
Although a ton of red flags about Workhorse has arisen, WKHS stock still has a fairly high market capitalization of $2.425 billion, and the company is trading at a price-sales ratio of over 10,000 times.
So Workhorse’s technical abilities are questionable, UPS seems to be dissatisfied with its vehicles, there’s a good chance that Workhorse will not win a USPS contract, and it may not be able to make a profit off the contract if it does win a deal. Given all these points, along with the sky-high valuation of WKHS stock, it’s clear that the stock’s risk-reward ratio is quite unfavorable.

UK Electric Vehicle Maker Arrival Raises $118M From BlackRock As It Gears For US Factory Launch	BlackRock, Inc (NYSE: BLK) has invested $118 million in the United Kingdom-based electric vehicle startup Arrival, which will enable the automaker to open a manufacturing facility in the United States, the latter said in a statement on Wednesday.What Happened: The investment puts the valuation of the London-based EV company at approximately $3.53 billion, the Financial Times reported.Korea's Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) and Kia Motors Corporation earlier invested nearly $117.49 million alongside BlackRock in the company in January.Arrival said it builds microfactories to help place smaller production facilities close to its buyers. The company has research sites in the U.K. at Reading and Banbury and a Microfactory at Bicester, FT noted. Why It Matters: The EV firm is building a microfactory at Rock Hill, South Carolina that can manufacture 1,000 battery-powered buses each year, Forbes reported.Arrival will reportedly invest $46 million in the microfactory, which would employ 240 workers and begin operations late next year.United Parcel Service, Inc (NYSE: UPS), which is also an investor in the startup, has placed an order of up to 10,000 electric vans with Arrival worth an estimated $500 million, as per Forbes.UPS has an option to buy another 10,000 vehicles on top of its order, FT reported.Arrival CEO Denis Sverdlov told FT that the market for EVs is predicted to reach 8 million commercial and passenger fleets by 2030 in the United States.EV maker Rivian has already secured an order for 100,000 electric vans from Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN). The Jeff Bezos-led retail giant invested $700 million in the Michigan-based startup in February. Elon Musk-led Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ: TSLA) foray into heavy vehicles seems to be nearer as well as a Tesla Semi was spotted delivering vehicles to customers at the end of last month.Price Action: BlackRock shares closed 0.14% higher at $639.85 on Wednesday.Photo courtesy: ArrivalSee more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * EV Maker Canoo To Go Public Via SPAC Merger At .4B Valuation By Year-End(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-09	2020-10-09 20:35:14	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Apple Starts Shipping Devices From Stores to Speed Up Deliveries	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is starting to use its network of retail stores as distribution centers for shipping products to consumers, joining a trend popularized by other retailers.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant has typically shipped devices like iPhones, Macs, iPads, and accessories from warehouses located across a customer’s region or directly from China. Now items that are in stock can be shipped directly to consumers from a network of almost 300 retail stores spread across the U.S. and Canada, according to people familiar with the matter.Apple told staff the shift will mean faster delivery times for customers who live further from distribution centers than from stores, according to the people who asked not to be identified discussing internal policies. The products will be shipped through United Parcel Service Inc. in Canada and FedEx Corp. in the U.S. via ground shipping and may be delivered as early as the day after a customer’s order, Apple told its staff. The program will apply to customers who live within 100 miles from a store, the people said.The change in delivery operations at Apple retail locations comes as the company prepares to launch a slew of new products soon, including four new 5G iPhones, a new iPad Air, over-ear headphones, a smaller HomePod and the first Macs with Apple’s own processors.Apple started testing the program with a small number of stores after locations started re-opening from Covid-19-related closures in June and July. It has rolled out to more, but not all retail sites across the U.S. and Canada, the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.The move to shipping from stores has been popularized by some grocery stores in recent years and has expanded to other retailers. The practice reduces costs, potentially improving product margins, and is beneficial to the environment, Apple told its staff.Customers won’t be able to choose to have their orders shipped from a store nor will they be aware when it happens. The decision on where to ship an item from is decided by Apple’s operations team, the people said.The shift in delivery operations ensures that stores that remain shuttered or limited due to Covid-19 restrictions can still operate in a way that assists Apple in selling devices. The company also has discussed converting select stores into online support or sales call centers in the event that locations need to be closed again due to the pandemic. Some back rooms at stores have already started serving as small call centers.For months, some retail employees have been working from home as online sales and support staff.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-starts-shipping-devices-stores-203514688.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-25	2020-09-25 18:59:37	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	10 Companies With Top-Notch Women CEOs	"To give you an idea of how vital women CEOs are to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment strategies, former Bank of England and Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney was appointed in late August as Brookfield Asset Management's (NYSE:BAM) head of ESG investing.What does this have to do with women as CEOs and the companies that employ them? Plenty. More than one study has proven that companies who hire women as CEOs do better for their shareholders. As S&P Global's Daniel Sandberg wrote:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips""Firms with female CEOs and CFOs have produced superior stock price performance, compared to the market average. In the 24 months post-appointment, female CEOs saw a 20% increase in stock price momentum and female CFOs saw a 6% increase in profitability and 8% larger stock returns. These results are economically and statistically significant."" Brookfield hired Carney to represent the alternative asset manager as it moves to capture a more significant chunk of this burgeoning market. If it didn't feel women were a big part of ESG investing, it likely wouldn't have made such a high-profile hire.ESG investing is a big deal, and Mark Carney knows it. The man could have had almost any job he wanted after leaving the Bank of England. He took this one.  * Citigroup (NYSE:C)  * General Motors (NYSE:GM)  * Coty (NYSE:COTY)  * United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS)  * Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)  * Hershey (NYSE:HSY)  * Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ)  * Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN)  * Clorox (NYSE:CLX)  * Best Buy (NYSE:BBY)Who are the women CEOs leading the charge? Here are 10 companies I believe are at the top of the list. ESG Investing Leaders:  Jane Fraser, Citigroup (C)Source: TungCheung / Shutterstock.com Could Jane Fraser be the Ruth Bader Ginsburg of U.S. banking? I believe she could. On Sept. 10, Citigroup named Jane Fraser to be its next CEO. She will replace current CEO Michael Corbat when he retires in February. Fraser, who heads the bank's consumer unit, will be the first woman to hold the top job at a major U.S. bank. Corbat, who has worked at the bank for 37 years and the last eight as CEO, clearly believed she had the right stuff for the job, or he wouldn't have promoted her to bank president in 2019.""I have worked with Jane for many years and am proud to have her succeed me,"" Corbat said. ""With her leadership, experience and values, I know she will make an outstanding CEO.""Catalyst, the non-profit group that works to make workplaces friendlier for women, believes Fraser's promotion shatters the glass ceiling in the banking industry. ""It demonstrates that it is not that women aren't there or available and ready,"" Tanya van Biesen, Catalyst's senior vice president of global corporate engagement, said. ""It's just taken us time to realize that leadership can come in a woman's body.""Indeed it can. It's just one more reason why owning Citigroup stock in the future is a smart move. Mary Barra, General Motors (GM)Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com When Mary Barra became CEO of General Motors in December 2013, the 33-year veteran engineer broke an equally important barrier for women, becoming the first female head of a U.S. automaker. Barra's hiring was a huge deal. Why? Women make up such a small part of the auto industry. ""Women represent a minority presence in the auto industry, comprising 21% of the total workforce. According to federal data, 39,000 of the industry's 185,200 employees were women. And women hold about 3.3 million of 12 million jobs in the broader manufacturing sector, or about 27%,"" reported CNN Business at the time.Another reason why her appointment matters is that women make the majority of vehicle purchasing decisions. Having a woman like Barra in charge of the automaker leverages that reality.It has not been easy for Barra in the last seven years. GM stock has lost approximately 16% of its value through Sept. 22.And while Barra believes electric vehicles are the future for General Motors, her engineering hat also tells her that it's not going to happen overnight. Perhaps not until 2040 will we see our roads filled with electric cars. I doubt she'll still be CEO in 2040. However, another woman could follow in her footsteps. ESG Investing Leaders: Sue Nabi, Coty (COTY)Source: Konektus Photo / Shutterstock.com In Coty's fiscal fourth quarter, the cosmetics company lost almost $800 million. Fortunately for long-suffering shareholders, Executive Chairman Peter Harf has a plan up his sleeve to turn the business around. Coty started by announcing the hiring of industry veteran Sue Nabi as its CEO. Nabi, who has more than 20 years of beauty experience at some of the top names, took over in September. ""Coty will become a product-centric organization, entirely focused on our customers and our brands. Our best-in-class teams will operate in a safe environment, where everyone will be empowered and encouraged to express themselves and bring new ideas and concepts to the table,"" Nabi stated in a message to employees. Between Coty's 51% interest in Kylie Cosmetics and a 20% stake in Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty, Nabi will have lots of tools to work with as she attempts to return Coty to the top of the beauty world. Down 75% year to date, Coty's got nowhere to go but up. With a woman of Nabi's talent in charge, shareholders can expect the culture shift at the company to make a big difference.  Carol Tome, United Parcel Service (UPS)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com UPS announced in March that Carol Tome would become the 12th CEO in its history. Tome, who retired from Home Depot (NYSE:HD) in August 2019 after 24 years with the home improvement retailer, was not exactly a stranger to the delivery business. She'd been a director of UPS since 2003 and was the chairperson of its audit committee. In 2018, Tome was one of the highest-paid female executives in Georgia, where both Home Depot and UPS are based. Only two other women earned more compensation. You'll read a lot about glass-ceiling breaking in my article about women CEOs. Tome is no exception. ""I am the first outsider CEO (at UPS), the first woman CEO and the first woman CEO in the industry,"" Tome wrote in a March 12 text to the Saporta Report. She added that she will be one of only three women running a Fortune 50 company. ""So, lots of glass was broken today.""Her leadership skills will be on display as she continues to position UPS for further growth.   ESG Investing Leaders: Lisa Su, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Source: Joseph GTK / Shutterstock.com If there is a CEO that's made a greater difference to their company than Lisa Su, I'd like to know who it is. Since Su became CEO in October 2014, owners of AMD stock have seen their shares appreciate more than 2,000%. Right on the chip maker's website is a quote that encapsulates Su's determination to build a better business.""AMD is at our best when we are taking bold, calculated risks and aggressively pursuing the leading-edge technologies that change the world.""As InvestorPlace's David Moadel said in November 2019, Lisa Su might be the best reason for confidence in AMD stock. Earlier last year, rumors circulated that Su was being pursued by International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) as a possible replacement for then-CEO Ginni Rometty. At the time, I argued that it would be a big loss for Advanced Micro Devices, but a massive boost to IBM's stock price.""[T]he thought of Su taking the reins at IBM should have Big Blue's shareholders praying the rumor's not a dud,"" I wrote on Aug. 22, 2019. ""I've been fairly negative about IBM in recent times so a move to hire someone of Su's caliber to replace Ginni Rometty as CEO would absolutely be the tonic it needs to reignite its growth on both the top and bottom line.""It never happened. In the year since, IBM has a total return of 10.7%, compared to 70% for AMD. Who says women CEOs can't deliver the goods for shareholders? Not AMD. Michele Buck, Hershey (HSY)Source: George Sheldon / Shutterstock.com Michele Buck took the reins of the iconic chocolate company in March 2017 after 12 years of climbing the ranks. Buck was chosen from a list of candidates, both external and internal. Before Hershey, she spent 17 years at Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC). The executive has been quick to make changes at Hershey to ensure it continues to innovate and grow. ""She comes in on day one announcing changes that she thought were necessary in the business and then in very short order after, refocusing on the core [and then] knocking off a handful of acquisitions, some of which were sizable,"" Erin Lash, director of consumer equity research at Morningstar, told Food Dive. Interestingly, Buck doesn't feel being a woman slowed her progress to CEO. ""Buck downplays the fact that she is the lone female CEO at a major food or beverage company, as well as the first woman to lead Hershey -- choosing instead to focus attention on her past successes and the results she has delivered running the confectioner,"" Food Dive reported. ""Buck said she hasn't been 'disadvantaged' during her career because she is a woman, but in a business community where females are not heavily represented in upper management, it remains an occasional topic of discussion with other executives.""Hershey is lucky to have Buck as its leader.  ESG Investing Leaders: Adena Friedman, Nasdaq (NDAQ)Source: Shutterstock In November 2016 Adena Friedman became CEO of Nasdaq. At age 47, Friedman became the first woman to run a major U.S. stock exchange.""Naming Adena CEO represents the successful conclusion of a rigorous, multiyear succession planning process,"" said Nasdaq Chairman Borje Ekholm. ""Adena is uniquely qualified for this role. For nearly two decades she has steadily risen through the leadership ranks, beginning as a Nasdaq intern.""Long before Jane Fraser was promoted to the top job at Citigroup, Friedman was a big believer in female leadership in corporate America. ""You see so many fewer women in the recruitment pool, so therefore it makes it harder to reach parity,"" Friedman said in a CNN Business article from May 2018. ""That's why we've got to get more women to go into finance, to get more women to go into tech, and to take advantage of the education available to them because that will then get them into the industry.""As you can imagine, Friedman was thrilled by Fraser's promotion. ""Jane is an outstanding executive who is respected throughout the financial industry, and she is a superb choice to be the next CEO of Citi,"" Friedman wrote in an email to Bloomberg. ""Her appointment as CEO also represents another significant milestone for women in the financial industry and across corporate America, and it sends an important message to all professional women -- there are no limits to our capabilities and our potential.""Friedman continues to transform Nasdaq into a technology company that happens to offer financial services. In the 45 months she has been CEO, NDAQ stock is up 575%.That's not too shabby. Jennifer Johnson, Franklin Resources (BEN)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com In November 2019 Jennifer Johnson became the new CEO of Franklin Resources, the parent company of investment manager Franklin Templeton. She took over from her brother, Greg Johnson, who became executive chairman. Before you think this is an example of nepotism -- the Johnson family controls more than 40% of BEN stock -- Johnson has been working at the family business since she was 14. Most recently, she was president and chief operating officer, roles she held since 2016. As for specific accomplishments over her 30-year tenure at the company, Johnson's development of its ETF business is probably her finest hour. Shortly after taking the top job, Franklin announced it would buy Legg Mason for $4.5 billion in cash, adding more than $800 billion in assets under management. As Jennifer Johnson stated shortly after her appointment, big responsibility comes with running a multi-generational family business. ""When your family name is tied to a company, you take that responsibility for that legacy, it's part of your DNA. You're really thinking in terms of what's right in the long-term. [If] you make short-term decisions that are bad for your client, you're going to be tarnished forever. It's not like you can leave and get a job somewhere else and leave it behind you. It is part of who you are,"" Johnson stated. BEN stock has seriously underperformed in recent years, with an annualized total loss of 1.1% over the past decade. It's time a woman took control of the company. Perhaps the results will be a marked improvement from her brother. ESG Investing Leaders: Linda Rendle, Clorox (CLX)Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com Linda Rendle is the newest addition to the list of 32 S&P 500 companies with a woman CEO. Rendle nabbed the top job in early August, although she did not officially start until mid-September.    Former CEO Benno Dorer, who stepped aside after slightly less than six years as chief executive, remains with the company as executive chairman. Fourteen years his junior, Rendle has run several of the company's various operations in her 17-year career with Clorox. ""Linda will be an excellent CEO, building on her track record of outstanding business results, her strong oversight of the development of the company's IGNITE strategy and her values-led leadership,"" said Pamela Thomas-Graham, lead independent director of the board. Talk about taking the helm at a perfect time. On the same day as Rendle's appointment, Clorox announced its fourth-quarter results. Thanks to the novel coronavirus, they were magnificent. On the top line, sales increased by 22% in the quarter, while earnings per share rose by 28%. Sales across all four of its operating segments experienced double-digit increases during the quarter. Investors have grown accustomed to a healthy appreciation of its stock in recent years. In the past three years, CLX stock has had an annualized total return of 18.7%, 730 basis points higher than the U.S. markets as a whole. Shareholders needn't worry. She's the right woman for the job.  Corie Barry, Best Buy (BBY)Source: Shutterstock They say life 10% of life is what happens to you and the remaining 90% is how you react to it. If that's true, Corie Barry ought to have a glorious career as CEO of the electronics retailer. In June 2019, Barry became CEO after Hubert Joly stepped down to become executive chairman. Barry, who has been with Best Buy since 1999, is the company's first female CEO.Six months into her tenure as CEO, the company received an anonymous letter alleging she had an affair with former Vice President Karl Sanft. Both executives denied the allegation. An external law firm found that nothing inappropriate happened between the two executives. Best Buy endorsed her ongoing leadership.It would be easy after such a difficult start to lose your focus. However, Barry has done nothing of the sort. Instead, the CEO has carried on building a better mousetrap. In August, Best Buy announced that it would hire 1,000 technology employees over the next two years, with 30% of the hires either women or people of color. Based in Minneapolis, where George Floyd lost his life at the hands of police, it was a meaningful gesture to the community.Barry had big shoes to fill when she took the top job in 2019, but its second-quarter results, which included a 242% increase in digital sales, shows that she's more than up to the task.

In our view, the most likely outcome is sideways trading, which is where our outlook continues to be focused on the short term.Source: Shutterstock Volatility since last Wednesday has been high, but there haven't been any significant support levels broken and the underlying fundamentals remain stable.Part of the reason we continue to feel confident is based on the reaction to the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments to Congress on Tuesday. Although full of dire warnings, Powell's statement is being interpreted as putting pressure on lawmakers to get another big round of stimulus passed. Whether that comes to fruition or not is uncertain, but investors see that as a positive.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBecause we are in between earnings reporting seasons and there isn't a lot of additional economic data due this week, investors will likely continue to push stock prices back and forth in a fairly wide range. This is a good time to evaluate intra- and intermarket data to see if we can detect any signs of positive (or negative) momentum. TechWe can't let a weekly update go by without taking a look at the tech sector, which has been one of our favorites this year. The selling earlier this week was largely focused on tech, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which makes sense when valuations are considered.  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy on Robinhood Now While it is true that tech is a little overvalued, the proportion of profits from that sector, compared to the S&P 500 as a whole, helps justify those values. In fact, tech has the largest positive difference between its profit margins and the average profit margin in the S&P 500 -- 19.2% vs. 10.8%, respectively -- which is a metric we monitor for signs of weakness. TransportationAs we have mentioned many times in the past, transportation stocks are an important confirming indicator for the market. If transports are hitting new highs, we see that as a sign of strength for the major indexes.As you can see in the following chart, although transports have pulled back this week, the Dow Jones Transportation Average has broken resistance and new highs, which should be seen as confirmation that retail and business spending is still relatively stable.Daily Chart of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DTX) -- Chart Source: TradingViewAlthough it is good to see the sector performing so well, we have to temper our enthusiasm a little because of the amount the index is influenced by United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX), which make up a large portion of the gains for the group.We have to assume that demand for this kind of shipping could shift very quickly if consumer incomes (or unemployment benefits) drop. Small CapsAs a rule, investors look at small-cap stocks (companies worth less than $2 billion) in a similar way to transportation stocks. If small caps are gaining (and even outperforming) on large caps (stocks worth more than $10 billion), then it is solid confirmation of bullish momentum because small stocks are riskier so investors must be more confident.This has been a weak spot for the market over the last several weeks. As you can see in the following chart, not only have small caps -- as represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM) -- been underperforming, but as of Tuesday's close, they are trading under June's highs.Daily Chart of iShares Russell 2000 Versus the Rydex Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index -- Chart Source: TradingViewThe underperformance of small caps can be partially explained by the concentration of the biggest and most profitable tech stocks in the large-cap indexes. If we neutralize stocks like AAPL and MSFT with an equal-weight version of the S&P 500 then the comparison starts to look a bit more normal. In the chart, we have used the Rydex Equal-Weight S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:RSP) with the IWM ETF to make this comparison.We have to be careful when making a comparison like this; it can lead to cherry-picking the data that supports our bias and ignoring data that doesn't. In this case, we think this is a fair comparison because of the unusual impact the big tech stocks have had on the major large-cap indexes this year. Safe HavensIf the bulls are truly gaining control (or are already in control) we would expect safe-haven investments to be moving lower. This includes U.S. Treasury bonds, Gold and safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen.As you can see in the following comparison, this is probably the biggest ""yellow flag"" we have in the market. Demand for U.S. stocks has been good, but global demand for safe-havens remains relatively stable without giving up many of the gains over the summer.Daily Chart of Treasury Bonds Versus the Japanese Yen and the Swiss Franc -- Chart Source: TradingViewAlthough this isn't a new development, strong safe havens are the best technical justification for maintaining a cautious outlook.In fact, this week we have scaled back a little on our bullish positions by taking profits on Target (NYSE:TGT) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) and increased our bearish exposure a little with a new short position on Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES). We don't plan to shift to an entirely bearish portfolio this month, but right now we think the timing is good to increase the balance in the current list of recommendations. Bottom Line on This Week's VolatilityAs we already mentioned, there aren't many economic reports this week that we expect to move the market very much. There is a small trickle of early earnings reports, but the biggest X-factor is likely to be progress (or the lack thereof) for more stimulus.Despite Powell's urging, we feel that the fight over President Trump's ability to appoint a new justice to the U.S. Supreme Court, following the sad passing of Justice Ginsburg, will harden the negotiating position of both sides.If we are correct about gridlock in Washington, then there is a good chance the market is overpricing the potential for stimulus and could be setting itself up for a negative surprise to the downside.This particular source of uncertainty is unlikely to be resolved in September, which should keep stocks range-bound and volatile as we head into October. While that isn't the ideal outcome for us, the bright side is that option premiums are higher than normal, so our income potential has been increased.On the date of publication, John Jagerson & Wade Hansen did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.John Jagerson & Wade Hansen are just two guys with a passion for helping investors gain confidence -- and make bigger profits with options.

2020-09-24	2020-09-24 20:29:58	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Workhorse Stock Is Hot, Hot, Hot!	Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) has been absolutely on fire in 2020, with WKHS stock skyrocketing 825% higher this year on the back of abundant investor optimism with respect to the company's ability to disrupt the last-mile delivery market with a next-gen electric delivery van.Source: Photo from WorkHorse.com This optimism is not misplaced.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAll transportation is getting electrified. The last-mile delivery market represents a very big and highly attractive disruption opportunity in this electrification wave. Workhorse is pioneering a best-in-breed solution to lead this disruption.And, while WKHS has run up a ton in 2020, there's plenty of upside left in this name over the next few years because the last-mile delivery market is huge (~$18 billion) and Workhorse is still a small company (~$2.7 billion).So buy WKHS stock and hold it for the long haul.Here's a deeper look. Electrification Is the FutureThere's no doubt about it. The electrification wave has arrived, and over the next decade, it will proliferate across all transportation verticals, from passenger cars to commercial trucks to last mile delivery vans, and everything in between.  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy on Robinhood Now There are few trends driving this disruption. All of them are here to stay.First, consumer demand is shifting.Young consumers -- who were raised to be hyper-aware of the environment and educated on how to reduce carbon emissions -- want EVs. A 2018 survey from HPI found that 91% of Millennials are considering buying an electric car for their next vehicle purchase. These young consumers are just now starting to come into jobs and a ton of purchasing power. Over the next decade, they will increasingly drive auto market demand -- and if all of them want EVs, then it's easy to see how EVs take over the passenger car market from a demand perspective in the 2020s.Second, the technology is getting better.Because demand is shifting, more and more resources and talent are being thrown into the EV space. This is resulting in huge advancements in EV technology, specifically on the battery front, where companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are increasingly making smaller and better batteries that last longer, charge faster and take up less space -- allowing for more efficient vehicles. Such technological advancements will only persist over the next few years, with a potential jump to solid-state batteries being a huge upward catalyst.Third, the cars are getting cheaper.Thanks to better technology, more streamlined manufacturing processes and increased scale, the cost to produce EVs is dropping dramatically, resulting in huge drops in EV prices. Since 2013, average EV battery pack prices have fallen 76%, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. This is resulting in falling EV list prices (the median sales price of a new EV dropped 70% between 2010 and 2016), to a point where these vehicles are now affordable to many Millennial car buyers.Fourth, the need is getting bigger.I live in California. All I have to do right now to be reminded that global warming is getting worse is just look outside, where the sky has been ashy for over a week. The need for us to reduce carbon emissions is only growing every single year, and EVs give everyone a mainstream way to help fix this problem.All in all, then, the electrification of transportation has started… and it's only going to get bigger and bigger over the next 10 years.  To that end, buying Workhorse and other EV stocks offers investors a great way to play this electrification megatrend. Last Mile Delivery Represents a Huge OpportunityThe last mile delivery market represents a huge opportunity for electrification disruption over the next 10 years.Last mile delivery is the last leg of delivering goods via trucks from warehouses to homes. As such, these vans don't go very far. About 80% of freight in the U.S is transported less than 250 miles, whereas your average EV has about a 300-mile driving range.So EV technology is already good enough to almost fully replace legacy vans in the last mile delivery market.Even further, these vans are run by companies -- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), UPS (NYSE:UPS), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), so on and so forth -- that are feeling increasing sociopolitical pressure to go green. Indeed, all of these companies have made it a priority to cut carbon emissions over the next few years.Thus, demand is shifting, and the supply is already good enough to be a viable replacement. Connecting the dots, it seems clear as day that by the end of the decade, most of the last mile delivery vans that drive up and down your street will be electric.That's a huge deal.In the U.S. alone, more than 350,000 last-mile delivery vans are sold every year at an average sales price of $50,000, implying an annual addressable market here of $18+ billion.Workhorse is set to disrupt this $18 billion market, and as the company does, WKHS stock will soar. Workhorse Is Pioneering a Best-in-Breed SolutionThere are lots of EV players out there.Very few of them are targeting their efforts at the last-mile delivery market.None of them have a created a last-mile EV delivery solution that is as robust as Workhorse's solution.Workhorse's C-Series electric delivery vans are already more fuel efficient than diesel trucks, with 40 miles per gallon gas-equivalent versus 6 miles per gallon for a traditional UPS truck. They are also already much cheaper, with 65% lower operating costs per mile.I say &quot;already&quot; because diesel trucks aren't going to get more efficient or cheaper anytime soon. But Workhorse's C-Series trucks will, as EV battery technology improves over the next few years. Indeed, over the past few years, Workhorse's trucks have increased efficiency by 25%, reduced operating costs, increased driving range, reduced charging times and reduced weight.So, by 2025, Workhorse's C-Series electric delivery vans will be miles ahead in terms of efficiency, performance and affordability than diesel trucks and other electric vans.At the same time, Workhorse's vans are the only medium duty electric van permitted to sell and deliver vehicles in all 50 states. They are also equipped with a wide-reaching distribution deal with Ryder - one of North America's largest delivery van retailers - and have already scored huge partnership deals with UPS and USPS.Plus, Workhorse is developing drone delivery technology - dubbed HorseFly - to be integrated with its delivery vans. Once fully fleshed out, this tech should only extend Workhorse's early leadership in this market.Overall, Workhorse is pioneering a best-in-breed EV solution in the last mile delivery market which has high visibility to seeing widespread adoption over the next 5 to 10 years. Huge Upside for Workhorse StockTo be sure, WKHS has rallied in a huge way in 2020 as investors have bought into the long-term bull thesis.But there's still plenty of upside left.Given that the last-mile delivery market is an oligopoly and that all of the major players will electrify sooner rather than later, it is quite likely that nearly 100% of the 350,000 delivery van market in the U.S. is electric by 2030.If Workhorse nabs just 10% of that market at $75,000 average prices and 15% operating margins, then my modeling suggests that net profits should round out to ~$300 million by 2030. A 20X multiple on that implies a potential future valuation of $6 billion -- more than double today's market cap of $2.7 billion.But, let's say Workhorse nabs 20% market share. Then we are talking $600 million in 2030 net profits, and a future valuation of $12 billion -- up more than four-fold from the WKHS stock price today.Either way, there's still plenty of fuel in the tank. Bottom Line on WKHS StockWorkhorse stock is a long-term winner. Yes, it's come a long ways it a short time. Don't blindly chase the rally. But on the next pullback, buy the dip. Because WKHS still has tons of upside potential over the next few years as the last mile delivery market gets electrified.On the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2020-09-24	2020-09-24 14:10:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEx's stock paces Dow transports gainers after Stifel analyst turns bullish	Shares of FedEx Corp.  rallied 1.2% in morning trading Thursday, to pace the gainers in the Dow Jones Transportation Average , after Stifel Nicolaus analyst David Ross turned bullish on the package delivery giant, citing signs that FedEx has been a beneficiary of the COVID-19 pandemic. The stock's rally comes as the Dow transports inched up less than 0.1% and shares of chief rival United Parcel Service Inc.  shed 0.8%. In a research note titled, &quot;Upgrading to buy; FedEx Flying High With Growing Package Pie,&quot; Ross raised his rating after being at hold for the past year, while boosting his price target to $281 from $175. &quot;The big move in FDX off the lows earlier this year (Exhibit 1) has been warranted, in our view, as the world didn't come to an end, and FedEx has shown it is a &quot;winner&quot; from this odd 'pandemic' period,&quot; Ross wrote in a note to clients. The stock has rocketed 170% since closing at a more-than 7-year low of $90.49 on March 16, while UPS shares have rallied only 84% over the same time. Despite the outperformance off the post-COVID lows, Ross said FedEx's stock still trades at &quot;an above-average discount&quot; to UPS's. Year to date, FedEx shares have rallied 61.5%, UPS's stock has advanced 36.6%, the Dow transports has tacked on 1.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has slipped 5.9%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/26f21136-380f-39b1-9a4b-f5a0357216ab/fedex%26%2339%3Bs-stock-paces-dow.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-09-24	2020-09-24 13:55:04	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Unusual Options Activity Insight: United Parcel Service	United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) shares experienced unusual options activity on Thursday. The stock price moved down to $159 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-09-25  * Strike Price: $162.50  * Volume: 1080  * Open Interest: 1715Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being &quot;out of the money&quot;. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For September 21, 2020  * P/E Ratio Insights for United Parcel Service  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-22	2020-09-22 16:40:54	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Tries Again For Entry-level Driver Training Exemption	UPS (NYSE: UPS) is taking another swing at a federal exemption from new entry-level driver training (ELDT) regulations as it struggles to fill driver training slots across its network.The new application, to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, follows a denial last year by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) of its initial attempt for an exemption of the ELDT regulations. The final ELDT rule is scheduled to go into effect Feb. 7, 2022.UPS contended in its initial petition that its own well-established training program effectively trains its drivers. However, the company contended that if it were forced to comply with the rule's specific instructor qualification requirements, it would be unable to use at least 25% of its current certified driver instructors, thereby limiting its ability to meet the demand for new drivers.The company also asked for a five-year exemption from a requirement that every training location be registered separately under the program's Training Provider Registry, claiming it would place a &quot;significant administrative burden&quot; on its in-house training if it were required to register as many as 1,800 UPS locations where a new driver could be trained.FMCSA ruled, however, that UPS had not demonstrated it would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level that would be achieved absent the requested exemptions.It explained that requiring a driver training instructor to hold a commercial driver's license and have either two years of experience driving a truck of the same or higher class, or two years' experience as a behind-the-wheel instructor, is necessary to establish minimum qualification standards.In its updated exemption request filed in July, UPS again asserted that its current process of preparing driver trainers &quot;exceeds any skill set gained merely by operating a tractor-trailer for two years,&quot; according to the FMCSA. &quot;The company also believes that a two-year experience requirement doesn't automatically equate to success as a [commercial motor vehicle] driver trainer.&quot;In addition, UPS submitted updated information on issues with filling driver-training positions since its original exemption request, according to FMCSA. &quot;UPS stated that it has had to hire 100 candidates to attempt to net the 50 trainer positions necessary across the U.S. Of the 100 hired, UPS has been able to retain only 38 trainers.&quot;Related articles:  * UPS warns training regulations will hurt its long-haul driver hiring (with video)  * FMCSA rejects UPS driver training exemption request  * Driver training group frustrated with training rule delay Click for more FreightWaves articles by John GallagherSee more from Benzinga  * US Air Force Could Deploy Freighters To Fly Truckloads Of Vaccine  * Amazon To Hire 100,000 Logistics, Fulfillment Workers  * UPS Hikes SurePost Rates To Match USPS Peak Surcharges(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-20	2020-09-20 06:45:06	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEx Or UPS: Which Stock Is Poised To Deliver Better Returns?	The pandemic-led slowdown in several businesses was expected to severely drag down FedEx and United Parcel due to lower B2B (business-to-business) shipments. But social distancing restrictions and the temporary closure of retail stores caused an unprecedented rise in e-commerce sales, which in turn boosted the demand for FedEx and UPS. Prior to the pandemic, Fedex projected that the US domestic market would touch 100 million packages per day by 2026. But now the company predicts that the US domestic parcel market will hit this mark as soon as 2023.FedEx and UPS are now gearing up for the holiday season, which FedEx’s President and COO Raj Subramaniam expects to be “a peak holiday shipping season like no other in our company’s history.”With this backdrop, we will use the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool to place FedEx and UPS alongside each other and see which stock offers a better investment opportunity.Fedex (FDX)FedEx has such a massive network that about 92% of the US population is now living within five miles of its pickup or drop off location. Such a vast network and an extensive presence in over 220 countries helped FedEx meet strong volume growth as COVID-19 triggered a spike in e-commerce. Revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 (ended Aug. 31) grew 13.5% Y/Y to $19.3 billion and adjusted EPS surged about 60% to $4.87.Robust e-commerce demand resulting from shelter-at-home orders and other restrictions amid the pandemic drove strong volume growth in residential delivery services at FedEx Ground and US domestic package volume growth at FedEx Express.The top-line also gained from international export package volume growth at FedEx Express, yield improvement at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight and the impact of one additional operating day. Moreover, FedEx is benefiting from tight air cargo capacity as COVID-19 continues to hurt commercial airlines.Though B2C (business-to-consumer) volumes are large, it has lower margins and so to improve profitability FedEx Ground, Express and Freight will increase shipping rates by an average of about 4.9% beginning Jan. 4, 2021.While B2C volumes are expected to continue to be strong due to e-commerce, FedEx is also experiencing a steady improvement in B2B volumes. For the holiday season, the company is adding over 70,000 positions and is enhancing its FedEx Ground network by adding four new automated stations, eight new or expanded large package facilities and expanding 50 existing facilities with additional material handling equipment and automation.Following the upbeat results, Wells Fargo analyst Allison Poliniak reiterated a Buy rating for FedEx and increased the price target to $286 from $221. The analyst said, “Results were a beat across the board, but we believe that the focus point should be the margin trajectory that was seen today and what we expect going forward.”In a note to investors, Poliniak added, “FedEx achieved an aggregate incremental margin of 26% this quarter, and we believe this could be a base level assumption moving forward.&quot; (See FDX stock analysis on TipRanks)So far, FedEx stock has risen 60.5% and the average analyst price target of $275.05 implies an upside potential of 13.3% in the coming months. The Street’s Moderate Buy consensus for FedEx is based on 16 Buys, 8 Holds and no Sell ratings.United Parcel Service (UPS)United Parcel like FedEx has been experiencing elevated B2C shipments since the pandemic. The global logistics company’s second-quarter revenue grew 13.4% Y/Y to $20.5 billion. COVID-led e-commerce growth drove a 65.2% rise in domestic B2C shipments. In the US, the company saw a 22.8% rise in its average daily volume, reaching 21.1 million packages a day.The international business gained from robust outbound demand from Asia and a rise in cross-border e-commerce in Europe. The company added 635 flights to address the volumes in Asia. Despite a 21.9% decline in B2B shipments and margin pressure, United Parcel’s adjusted EPS grew 8.7% Y/Y to $2.13.Recently, UPS announced it will hire over 100,000 seasonal employees to support the anticipated increase in package volume for the peak holiday season. The company expects robust demand for residential shipments to continue.  However, it is unsure about how the B2B business will unfold even as the decline in B2B shipments moderated in June.Meanwhile, the company continues to trim its costs to improve its margins. It is offering buyouts to some employees to bring down its payroll costs. According to the Wall Street Journal, the company is expected to offer buyouts to some employees in non-operational roles and the workers would leave in two phases–by the end of this year and mid-2021. (See UPS stock analysis on TipRanks)On Sept. 3, Berenberg analyst William Howard downgraded United Parcel to Sell from Hold while upgrading FedEx to Buy from Hold as part of his pair trade strategy for the leading package delivery majors. The analyst notes, “All three global integrators - Deutsche Post, FedEx and UPS - have had a pretty good pandemic so far. The market has got overexuberant about e-commerce growth,” However, he believes that FedEx has a wider profit margin relative to UPS.The Street is on the sidelines when it comes to UPS. A Hold consensus is based on 6 Buys, 5 Holds and 4 Sells. UPS stock has risen 36.4% so far this year but the average analyst price target of $141.69 indicates a possible downside of 11.3%.Bottom lineBoth UPS and FedEx are expected to continue to benefit from strong e-commerce amid the pandemic. UPS has a higher dividend yield of 2.52% compared to FedEx’s dividend yield of 1.1%. However, the upside potential in FedEx stock currently makes it more attractive compared to UPS.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.View more earnings on UPSMost often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.United Parcel Service Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 36.53 of the Integrated Freight & Logistics industry.

A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For United Parcel Service, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q2 Earnings Insight United Parcel Service reported Q2 earnings per share at $2.13/share, which beat analyst predictions of $1.07/share.See more from Benzinga  * A Look Into United Parcel Service's Price Over Earnings  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For September 3, 2020  * Analyzing United Parcel Service's Unusual Options Activity(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-16	2020-09-16 09:00:53	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Plans to Put 1,000 Warehouses in Suburban Neighborhoods	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. plans to open 1,000 small delivery hubs in cities and suburbs all over the U.S., according to people familiar with the plans. The facilities, which will eventually number about 1,500, will bring products closer to customers, making shopping online about as fast as a quick run to the store. It will also help the world’s largest e-commerce company take on a resurgent Walmart Inc.Amazon couldn’t fulfill its two-day delivery pledge earlier this year when shoppers in Covid-19 lockdown flooded the company with more orders than it could handle. While delivery times have improved thanks to the hiring of 175,000 new workers, Amazon is now consumed with honoring a pre-pandemic pledge to get many products to Prime subscribers on the same day. So with the holidays approaching, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos is doubling down by investing billions in proximity, putting warehouses and swarms of blue vans in neighborhoods long populated with car dealerships, fast-food joints, shopping malls and big-box stores.Historically, Amazon gnawed away at brick-and-mortar rivals from warehouses on the exurban fringes, where it operated mostly out of sight and out of mind. That worked fine when the company was promising to get products to customers in two days. Now Walmart and Target Corp. are using their thousands of stores to beat Amazon at its own game by offering same-day delivery of online orders. Walmart also recently started is own Prime-style subscription service, upping the competitive ante.A recently opened warehouse in Holyoke, Massachusetts, exemplifies Amazon’s answer to this existential challenge. Located not far from a once vibrant mall, it’s just a short drive from more than 600,000 people. The goal is to creep closer to almost everyone in the U.S. Beyond Amazon’s retail rivals, the mass opening of small, quick-delivery warehouses poses a significant threat to United Parcel Service Inc. and the U.S. Postal Service. Being fastest in the online delivery race is so critical to Amazon’s business that it doesn’t trust the job to anyone else and is pulling back from these long-time delivery partners. Amazon is basically duplicating UPS’s logistics operation. Many of Amazon’s new hubs are within walking distance of UPS facilities.“In just a few years, Amazon has built its own UPS,” says Marc Wulfraat, president of the logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc., who estimates Amazon will deliver 67% of its own packages this year and increase that to 85%. “Amazon keeps spreading itself around the country, and as it does, its reliance on UPS will go away.”Amazon shares were up less than 1% at 9:37 a.m. on Wednesday and have gained about 70% this year. The company declined to comment on the expansion plans, but has said its last-mile delivery efforts are meant to supplement, not replace, its long-time partners. “Our dedicated last-mile delivery network just delivered its 10 billionth package since launching over five years ago, and we’re proud to provide a great service for our customers,” a spokeswoman said. The company’s appetite for real estate is so strong that many analysts have speculated that Amazon would convert vacant department stores into distribution centers. In fact, that option is only a last resort, said the people privy to the company’s plans, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter.Department stores such as J.C. Penney are often two stories and lack sufficient loading capacity, they said, meaning they require extensive remodeling to accommodate an Amazon delivery hub. Moreover, mall leases with existing tenants often prohibit the owner from introducing a delivery hub that could spoil the shopping experience, and city officials might not quickly approve an industrial use in a retail area. It’s more likely that dead malls will be bulldozed to make way for an Amazon warehouse, as they have in the Midwest, than for an Amazon delivery station to sprout in a half-vacant mall to coexist with Kay Jewelers and Cinnabon.Still, analysts expect underutilized retail space to make way for more e-commerce delivery stations due to rising rents for industrial space, along with a surge in store vacancies. “Any time you see retail being occupied by non-traditional retail uses, they’re just holding off what’s inevitable,” says Rick Stein, principal at Urban Decision Group, who estimates the U.S. has 50% more retail real estate than it needs. “It’s a Band-Aid, and at some point that mall is coming down.”In the past three years, 13.8 million square feet of retail space has been converted to 15.5 million square feet of industrial space, including vacant shopping malls razed to make room for new warehouses, according to a July report by the commercial real estate firm CBRE Group Inc. That trend will continue but not quickly enough for Amazon, which is building new facilities and moving into existing warehouses where it’s faster to get a hub up and running.Amazon usually puts new delivery stations inside existing warehouses or signs long-term leases with development firms like ProLogis Inc. to build them to its exacting specifications. Typical delivery stations are about 200,000 square feet—about one-fourth the size of one of the company’s giant fulfillment centers—with large lots where workers can park their personal vehicles and Amazon can stage delivery vans. About 20 tractor-trailers arrive each night to drop off packages, which are loaded into hundreds of vans each morning before drivers fan out to make their rounds. In the afternoons, hundreds more Amazon Flex drivers, who use their own cars, arrive to deliver whatever’s left. A typical hub can generate more than 1,000 vehicle trips each day, often in areas where roads are already congested.The surge in online shopping creates challenges for cities that still plan for growth and transportation needs based on people shopping at stores. They’ll have to make more room close to residential areas for warehouses with big parking lots that generate a lot of traffic, creating inevitable clashes with local residents who want things delivered to their homes but don’t want to have to look at a delivery station or get stuck in traffic behind a convoy of Amazon vans.“Regulation is definitely flat-footed right now,” says Nico Larco, an architecture professor at the University of Oregon, who studies urban land use. “The warehouse doesn’t want to be tucked away in an industrial district any more. It wants to be right next to you. But when these things come to our neighborhoods, they’re unsightly.”NIMBY wars haven’t slowed down Amazon so far. The company is opening three facilities in Kearny, New Jersey, this year, among more than a dozen slated for the Garden State. The small township near Newark airport offers proximity to shoppers in the New York suburbs and is less than 10 miles from Manhattan’s Lower East Side, making it a prime location. Mayor Alberto Santos has noticed a “weird gentrification process for warehousing” since Amazon came to town, with rents skyrocketing.“They don’t stop at one,” Santos says of Amazon. “They keep picking up sites, which drives up prices for everyone else. Kearny is one of those locations that had large warehouse and small warehouse users. This could crowd out that small user that has to find an alternative further away.”Back in Holyoke, planning board member Eileen Regan says Amazon’s delivery station prompted some concerns about traffic from nearby residents but didn’t face significant opposition. The company staggered shifts to keep delivery vans off roads during peak travel times, which is also in Amazon’s interest, she says. Initially, Regan worried that traffic from both Amazon and the mall during the holidays could clog streets, but Covid-19 will likely keep shoppers at home, leaving more room for those Amazon vans.“I’m glad Amazon is there because so many retail facilities have gone under during this pandemic,” she says. “I’m glad that we have them to keep things running.” For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-plans-put-1-000-090053785.html?.tsrc=rss

India Should Take the Lead on Vaccine Delivery	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The pressures of the pandemic have fallen hardest on developing countries with weak governments. They’re struggling to determine who is being infected and why, and to mitigate the economic impact of lockdowns and social distancing measures. If dealing with Covid-19 is stressing those states, however, the effort required to end the pandemic may exhaust them.Speaking to the Financial Times this week, the Indian vaccine manufacturer Adar Poonawalla — whose Serum Institute of India plans to produce a billion doses of an eventual vaccine, far in excess of any of its competitors — warned that vaccinating “everyone on this planet” poses an enormous governance challenge. He says there’s no “proper plan on paper” for distributing any successful vaccine; Serum may well provide 500 million doses to an Indian government that has no way to get them to people. And India’s infant immunization program has at least given the country some distribution capacity. The problem is worse elsewhere. One critical challenge will be storage and transportation. Some of the vaccines that use the new messenger RNA technology will need to be stored at subzero temperatures, as low as minus-70 or minus-80 degrees Celsius. The vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca PLC, which the Serum Institute has licensed, can reportedly be stored in standard refrigerated environments. But even managing a regular vaccine cold chain is enormously difficult.To anyone with experience of developing-world public health infrastructure, the World Health Organization’s recommendations for managing vaccine transport make for depressing reading. The vaccine alliance GAVI’s briefing on the first-choice storage machinery — ice-lined refrigerators — is equally sobering. Each can cost thousands of dollars. Off-grid, solar-driven refrigerators, which might be needed in countries with unreliable power supply, are even more expensive.In the developed world, big investments are already being made in scaling up cold-chain infrastructure: UPS, for example, is putting millions of dollars into new “freezer farms” near air hubs in the U.S. and western Europe. Companies are unlikely to make similar investments on spec in the developing world, however. Even countries such as India, which have had some experience and success with “mission” projects in healthcare, might struggle at the expense involved in creating single-use transportation and storage infrastructure, at scale, on short notice.This is where the economic policy community needs to step in. Getting hundreds of millions of vaccine doses out to the poorest and most remote parts of the globe is in everyone’s interest; in the words of Merck and Co. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier, “none of us are safe until all of us are safe.” Solutions exist if governments, multilateral agencies, and private capital are willing to explore them.In India, for example, the government could collaborate with private capital and multilateral lenders to set up a holding company focused on developing, distributing and installing dual-use cold chain infrastructure. India’s National Centre for Cold-Chain Development — yes, it has one — has long argued that there are “synergies” between agricultural, processed-food, and medical cold-chain infrastructure.Done right, a large network of refrigerated storage and transport created for the pandemic could have wider uses. An efficient cold chain would help permanently raise farmers’ access to markets, reduce wastage and control food inflation.Of course, this will require ministries to talk to one another, arrange de-risking mechanisms and guarantees, and then rope in possible investors. The effort will be worth it, though: If a mechanism can be evolved in India, other developing countries should be able to replicate it. Without one, it’s hard to see how those nations will escape the pandemic even with a vaccine.(Corrects spelling of Adar Poonawalla in second paragraph.)This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Mihir Sharma is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-09-15	2020-09-15 22:50:45	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEx’s Fred Smith Finds Vindication In a Wild 2020	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- FedEx Corp. founder Fred Smith vowed in January that 2020 would be the year his efforts to remake the parcel carrier for the e-commerce era would finally start to pay off — and the long run of disappointments for investors would come to an end. It appears he was right, even it took a significant helping hand from a global pandemic that no one saw coming.With digital ordering increasingly becoming the default option for Americans reticent to leave their homes amid the coronavirus outbreak, FedEx on Tuesday turned in its best quarterly results in a long time. Analysts were primed for a good showing after rival United Parcel Service Inc. blew estimates out of the water when it last reported results in July; it turns out, they weren’t nearly optimistic enough. FedEx reported the highest adjusted operating margin for its fiscal first quarter since 2017. Revenue climbed more than 13% to $19.3 billion, a quarterly record for the company. Collectively, that translated into an earnings-per-share showing that was nearly double what analysts had been anticipating. “Our earnings growth underscores the importance of our business initiatives and investments over the last several years, and, in many ways, the world has accelerated to meet our strategies,” Smith, who is also CEO, said in the press release. He’s right: The billions of dollars that FedEx has poured into automation equipment and expanded weekend services has put the carrier in a prime position to capitalize on the country's national appreciation of e-commerce as an essential service. But what’s helped FedEx and UPS the most is that the spike in e-commerce shipments was so sudden and pervasive that even their sprawling networks of planes and trucks are bursting at the seams. Chief Marketing Officer Brie Carere  told Bloomberg News in an interview this month that FedEx expects the U.S. market will reach 100 million packages a day by 2023, three years earlier than it had previously expected. Logistics capacity is tight — so much so that a group of retailers is trying to start a new shopping event in October in an effort to convince consumers to plan ahead for the holidays and help them avoid extra shipping fees and delays.In the most basic illustration of supply-and-demand economics, this has created a remarkable opportunity for FedEx and UPS to start to reclaim the pricing power they had seemingly all but abandoned in the race to ensure they had a share of the booming e-commerce market. Both companies rolled out surcharges for their largest customers during the upcoming holiday season, a contrast to the past when they’ve foregone or limited such fees. FedEx earlier this week said it would raise rates across its services starting Jan. 4., with rates for express, ground and home-delivery packages rising by an average of 4.9%.That changed dynamic has investors viewing FedEx in a whole new light. Consider the company’s update on Tuesday to its capital spending budget. It now expects to spend $200 million more in the current fiscal year than previously anticipated as it expands capacity to help meet the unrelenting demand. This will mark the fifth year in a row that FedEx’s capital expenditure budget has exceeded $5 billion. This time last year, that kind of forecast would have elicited more than a few eye rolls and prompted questions about where all this money was going year after year. On Tuesday, shares of FedEx rose as much as 10% in after-market trading. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

The UPS Store Unveils New and Modern Store Design	Nation’s largest retail shipping chain reveals energetic concept to meet evolving consumer and small business owner needs in an e-commerce world The UPS Store New Store Design 1 The UPS Store reimagined store design showcases an open layout to meet evolving consumer and small business owner needs. The UPS Store New Store Design 2 The new in-store experience for The UPS Store network resembles a contemporary open concept workshop, with light-industrial design elements and visible work areas The UPS Store New Store Design 3 The redesign includes an option to include 24/7 smart lockers near the front entry, allowing convenient and secure package pick-ups at any time, day or night.SAN DIEGO, Sept. 14, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The UPS Store, Inc., the nation’s largest shipping, postal, print and business services chain*, today unveiled a new and contemporary design of its retail stores, now available for its large network of franchise owners. The first set of fully redesigned stores, which include the first major change to the stores’ layout in two decades, have opened in several markets around the country. “In a rapidly changing business environment, The UPS Store seeks to create a place where business happens in real time,” said Tim Davis, president of The UPS Store, Inc. “We’re elevating the retail experience to cater to today’s small business owner and consumer, while helping drive growth and profitability for our network of franchise owners.”The transformed look and layout create a more seamless in-store customer experience while reflecting the new demands of a world driven by tech and e-commerce. Compared to the previous design, the new stores are more open in their layout to highlight the breadth of services, brighter in both color and lighting and feature more digital elements than ever before.The new design is part of a continued strategy to help The UPS Store® franchisees thrive in a highly competitive environment. In addition to its current network of franchisees, the new design will be standard for new franchise owners, and the retailer offers both a veteran incentive program and a minority incentive program for new franchisee candidates looking to enter the network. To thank and honor veterans for their service, the veteran incentive program provides $10,000 off the initial franchise fee. The UPS Store is committed to fostering diversity through the minority incentive program. First time minority franchisees are eligible to receive an approximate 50% discount off the franchise fee. Both veteran and minority franchisees who take part in these programs will develop their location under the new store design. Evolution of The UPS Store DesignThe redesign is a result of extensive research and planning involving key stakeholders, including franchisees, small business owners, consumers and retail industry experts. The UPS Store design team worked with Columbus, Ohio-based design firm Chute Gerdeman to develop the new look, feel and layout.“We embarked on a collaborative strategic process that shed light on the need to convey transparency within the in-store experience,” said Jeff Wietrzykowski, creative director at Chute Gerdeman. “The new store design radically opens up the retail space, highlighting the variety of key services that The UPS Store centers offer while communicating trust and collaboration to its customers.”The UPS Store, Inc. spent four years building, testing and tweaking numerous prototype centers in various communities across the country to refine the design. Rooted in functionality and accessibility, it is intended to enhance space utilization and consumer appeal in response to changing customer needs.Design Features and ElementsThe new in-store experience for The UPS Store network resembles a contemporary open concept workshop, with light-industrial design elements and visible work areas that invite customers to easily navigate the store and interact with associates. In addition, the redesign includes an option to include 24/7 smart lockers near the front entry, allowing convenient and secure package pick-ups at any time, day or night.Key design features and layout elements include:  * A reimagined open floor plan eliminating walls and dividers, and instead grouping the store into functional zones thoughtfully designed for optimal foot traffic flow and space utilization.     * The front of the store is accessible 24 hours a day, with a security gate closing off other sections after hours. This entry zone can house mailboxes, smart lockers and self-serve printers.     * The service counter area is where customers can interact with associates during business hours for core services including packing, shipping and printing. In addition, this section offers space for expert consultation and additional services including notary.    * A dedicated print consultation area with seating for customers, allowing center associates to provide an unrushed experience to explain all printing and design services.    * The back of the store has been transformed to showcase the open workspace. Full sightlines into this area allow customers to see the expert work that goes behind the packing and shipping process.  * More fixtures and services incorporating technology, such as digital menu boards and smart lockers are present throughout the store.  * Oak plank flooring greets the customers, adding warmth to the space, while the workshop flooring is finished with a concrete aesthetic to convey a modern industrial feel.  * Fresh, bright colors throughout the store stand in dramatic contrast to the monochromatic color palette of the previous generation of stores.  * Modular pieces allow for franchisees to customize the space for different situations, based on customer volume or workspace needed.Deemed essential during the pandemic, most The UPS Store centers have remained open to provide a wide array of services including shipping, mail and package receiving, printing, scanning, faxing and notary. General consumers and small business owners alike rely on easy and safe access to these services now more than ever, and the store redesign improves the way these needs are met.

Traders Discuss FedEx, United Parcel Service	On CNBC's &quot;Trading Nation,&quot; Steve Chiavarone of Federated Hermes said the rise in e-commerce -- and what he said is the economy's exit from recession and move into recovery -- is going to be good for deliveries in general and it is going to be specifically good for both FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) and United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS).Chiavarone sees additional upside potential for these companies if they can harness technology to reduce cost and achieve higher margins on their deliveries.Craig Johnson of Piper Sandler said both FedEx and United Parcel Service could be winners, but if he had to pick one, he would pick FedEx.UPS has been lagging FedEx over the last month, Johnson said. He also thinks the UPS chart is very extended, with a lot of good news is already priced in -- which he said is not the case with FedEx.FedEx looks like a great downtrend reversal and it looks like it is setting up to retest the old highs. Johnson would be a buyer of FedEx, heading into the earnings print.FedEx is going to report earnings on Sept. 15.See more from Benzinga  * Steve Grasso Prefers Cyclicals Over Tech Right Now  * Tony Zhang Advises Viewer On FedEx Ahead Of Earnings  * Todd Gordon Weighs In On FedEx And UPS(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

FedEx's stock gets a boost after Cowen analyst raises target by 58% ahead of earnings	Shares of FedEx Corp.  rallied 1.3% in afternoon trading Friday, after Cowen analyst Helane Becker boosted her price target by 58% ahead of the package delivery giant's earnings report, saying she sees &quot;no reason positive trends should end&quot; in the near term. She lifted her target to $264, which is 16% above current levels, from $167, while reiterated the outperform rating she's had on the stock for at least the past three years. FedEx is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter results on Sept. 15, after the closing bell. Becker expects the results to show that the company is benefiting from positive e-commerce trends, which is driving up volumes and revenue, and from the favorable repricing of contracts resulting from tight industry capacity. &quot;Admittedly, FedEx valuation is currently near peak levels, but the market is attempting to digest the permanent shift to e-commerce volumes, which has caused the recent increase in the multiple,&quot; Becker wrote in a note to clients. &quot;The market continues to pay for growth (e-commerce) even if it is at the expense of margins.&quot; The stock has soared 50.4% year to date, while shares of rival United Parcel Service Inc.  have advanced 35.0% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has slipped 3.7%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d30c230b-26ff-33e8-9249-964448b1ba2a/fedex%26%2339%3Bs-stock-gets-a.html?.tsrc=rss

BofA Raises FedEx Expectations, Sees Improving Airfreight Price Environment	FedEx Corporation's (NYSE: FDX) margins and returns could expand due to the paradigm shift in the pricing environment in the airfreight sector, according to BofA Securities.The FedEx Analyst: Ken Hoexter maintained a Buy rating on FedEx and raised the price target from $177 to $235.The FedEx Thesis: With accelerating online consumer spending, the demand for home deliveries has surged since March, resulting in FedEx's ground volumes growing around 25% year-on-year in the fiscal fourth quarter, Hoexter said in a Thursday note. (See his track record here.)The airfreight sector is going through &quot;positive structural change as it focuses on pricing,&quot; the analyst said. FedEx and rival United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) have already added surcharges to cover COVID-19-related costs, he said.More recently, UPS and the U.S. Postal Service announced annual peak season surcharges, Hoexter said. Surprisingly, FedEx added higher surcharges than UPS in an aggressive move &quot;to cover costs, get ahead of the U.S. election, and cover a period of potential vaccination shipments, which will absorb capacity,&quot; the analyst said. Hoexter raised his FedEx earnings estimates for fiscal 2021 and 2022 by around 2% each, from $10.40 to $12.90 per share and from $10.65 to $12.70 per share, respectively, to reflect higher surcharges, although BofA has &quot;an upward bias given the flow through potential of the surcharges.&quot;FDX Price Action: Shares of FedEx were trading lower by 0.26% at $207.34 at the time of publication Thursday.Related Links:Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On MondayUPS, FedEx Say They Don't Have Legal Status To Deliver Postal BallotsLatest Ratings for FDX  DateFirmActionFromTo  Aug 2020CitigroupMaintainsBuy  Aug 2020BernsteinUpgradesMarket PerformOutperform  Jul 2020UBSMaintainsBuy    View More Analyst Ratings for FDX   View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from Benzinga  * BofA Upgrades Caterpillar, Herc Holdings On Improving Construction Signals(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Xos Trucks Raises $20 million For Electric Chassis	Electric mobility startupXos Trucks Inc. raised $20 million to keep up with orders for its modular chassis. The money is helping meet demand for underpinning medium-duty regional and last-mile delivery trucks with its X-Platform.Investors included Proeza Ventures, a Mexican mobility-focused venture capital firm backed by the holding company of auto supplier Metalsa. BUILD Capital Group also participated. FreightWaves reported the capital raise in June. But Xos only revealed the amount Tuesday. Metalsa helped Xos design the X-Platform. It is providing components to the chassis as part of the investment.  Xos has test trucks operating in the Los Angeles area with United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) and Loomis Armored trucks. It plans to further scale the production of its X-Platform that underpins the UPS and Loomis vehicles.&quot;It's our goal to provide reliable, affordable and sustainable transportation as the volume of e-commerce demands are increasing, and have accelerated during the pandemic,&quot; said Xos co-founder and CEO Dakota Semler.Rodolfo Elias Dieck of Proeza Ventures and Mark Lampert of BUILD Capital Group will join the Xos Board of Directors.&quot;We've been impressed with what the Xos team has been able to achieve in such a short amount of time and with limited funding,&quot; said Dieck, Proeza managing director. &quot;They have designed and engineered a proprietary, reliable and affordable battery pack and skateboard solution for commercial fleets.&quot;Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Giordano Sordoni said the investment is critical to scaling the business to meet demand for new orders coming in monthly.

2020-08-19	2020-08-19 15:32:10	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEx's Peak Surcharges Go In Different Direction Than UPS	FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) disclosed its upcoming peak shipping season surcharges on Tuesday, and tweaked its surcharge language in an effort to set it apart from its chief rival, United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS).The FedEx surcharges will apply to customers that shipped more than 35,000 packages via FedEx Express and FedEx Ground in any week covering two separate periods: Oct. 5-18 and Nov. 16-29. The first FedEx surcharge will apply between Nov. 2 and Dec. 13 for the volumes shipped during the October period. The second levy applies between Dec. 14 and Jan. 17 for volumes shipped during the mid-November cycle.The amount of the surcharges will depend on how much a FedEx customer shipped between Feb. 3 and March 1, the last period of normal volumes before government lockdowns to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus closed off all buying channels except for e-commerce. Under the FedEx program, a $1 surcharge will apply to each ground parcel delivery if total volumes exceed 110% of weekly traffic tendered from Feb. 3 through March 1. The surcharges will rise in $1-per-parcel increments until topping out at $4 per parcel for volumes that exceed 500% of the February traffic.For FedEx Express, the company's air and ground unit, the surcharges will start at $2 per parcel, and escalate by $1 per parcel up to the 500% threshold. The FedEx surcharges will apply to commercial and residential deliveries, whereas the UPS surcharge applies just to residential deliveries. For example, a FedEx shipper tendering 25,000 weekly packages during the week for commercial delivery and 10,000 packages for residential delivery will be slapped with a surcharge on the residential portion.In another departure from UPS' surcharge policies, every parcel handled under FedEx's SmartPost service, where FedEx inducts bulk volume parcels deep into the U.S. Postal Service's (USPS) network for residential deliveries, will be assessed a surcharge. By contrast, UPS' peak levies will apply to 25,000 parcels moving weekly on a combined basis by air, ground and its SurePost service, which is UPS' version of its partnership with USPS. The amount of the SmartPost surcharge will depend on the peak period when a SmartPost shipment is tendered.  For example, a parcel tendered between Nov. 2 — the start of the FedEx peak — and Nov. 29 will be assessed a $1 surcharge. The surcharge will increase to $2 between Nov. 30 and Dec. 6 before reverting to $2 between Dec. 7 and Jan. 17, the end date for the peak cycle.John Haber, CEO of Spend Management Experts, a consultancy, said UPS is likely to establish a separate surcharge on SurePost deliveries after USPS on Friday announced its peak-season levies on large-volume users like UPS.Haber said the SmartPost policies are designed to wean FedEx shippers off the service and compel them instead to use the company's Home Delivery product, where costs are higher but so are potential margins. FedEx is migrating all of its SmartPost traffic in-house with the exception of sparsely populated destinations, where it will continue to use USPS.Peak season surcharges for 2020 have become very complex and expensive as the parcel supply chain braces for the typical holiday delivery deluge while coping with unprecedented volume spikes due to the impact of the virus. E-commerce volumes are expected to remain quite elevated into the peak as more consumers decide to order online rather than visit a store during the holidays.As with UPS, FedEx will impose stiff surcharges on shipments whose atypical size and dimensions make it difficult and expensive to handle. FedEx will impose a $52.50-per-package surcharge on oversized packages, a $4.90 fee for shipments that require &quot;additional handling,&quot; and a $350-per-package fee for &quot;unauthorized&quot; ground deliveries. The latter is a rarely seen fee for shipments that should be moved through the company's less-than-truckload (LTL) network, but need to be handled — at significant time and expense — by the package operation. Another difference between the two this year is that some of the extraordinary UPS charges don't kick in unless certain volume thresholds are met. By contrast, the FedEx surcharges are levied on every shipment.See more from Benzinga  * US, China Reciprocate On More Airline Access  * Q&A: COVID, The Rise Of China, And The Future Of Ocean Shipping  * Daimler Trucks North America Building At Pre-Pandemic Levels(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-19	2020-08-19 01:12:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Makes It Harder for Sellers to Avoid Shipping Service	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. plans to make it harder for merchants to ship products themselves, meaning they’ll be more likely to pay the company to handle the task.New shipping performance requirements, announced in an email to merchants Tuesday, will require third-party sellers to make deliveries on Saturdays and meet new one- and two-day delivery pledges starting in February. If the merchants fail to meet the targets, they risk losing a coveted Prime fast-shipping badge that influences which products shoppers buy.Amazon said the changes are necessary because sellers’ deliveries are often late, while merchants say they worry they’ll be forced to pay for Amazon logistics without a chance to shop around.The move has potential antitrust implications because merchants could be forced to raise product prices if using Amazon logistics costs more than paying United Parcel Service Inc., FedEx Corp. or the U.S. Postal Service.Amazon introduced Seller Fulfilled Prime five years ago to help expand the number of products shipped quickly by letting some merchants handle the delivery themselves. The aim was to ease bottlenecks in Amazon warehouses since products would go directly from sellers to Prime subscribers, who pay monthly or yearly fees for delivery discounts and other perks -- and typically spend more than other Amazon shoppers.Now Amazon says the program’s performance is abysmal and is raising standards as part of an effort to reduce delivery times for many products from two days to one. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, fewer than 16% of Amazon orders shipped through Seller Fulfilled Prime in the U.S. met a two-day delivery promise, largely because participants couldn’t make weekend deliveries, Amazon said.“Amazon is making significant investments in our fulfillment and transportation capabilities to make Prime faster, transitioning from a Two-Day to a One-Day delivery program,” the email said. “As we continue to improve the Amazon Prime experience for customers, we want to ensure Seller Fulfilled Prime meets customers’ expectations of Prime.”By raising performance metrics that Amazon itself adjudicates, the company will entice more merchants to pay Amazon for logistics rather than competing services, said Shaoul Sussman, a legal fellow at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a frequent Amazon critic.“Amazon is holding these sellers to a very high standard that Amazon itself doesn’t even follow,” he said. “It looks like the decision is to kill this program. The way to kill it is with very high cost of operating and forcing those who want to do their own delivery into Fulfillment By Amazon.”In a letter to federal lawmakers last year, an online merchant accused Amazon of forcing him and other sellers to use the company’s expensive logistics services, which in turn forces them to raise prices for consumers. The letter also accused Amazon of “tying” its marketplace and logistics services together, a potential antitrust violation in which a company uses dominance in one market to give itself an advantage in another market where it’s less established.Sellers said that delivering products on their own was potentially less expensive than Amazon’s services. But most used Fulfillment By Amazon anyway to avoid being punished for performance issues and because doing so meant their products had more visibility on the site. In the letter, the merchant said Amazon had raised its fees by 20% over the preceding four years until they were 35% more than competing services. Amazon disputed the allegations.“As we move toward One Day Delivery, we are making changes to Seller Fulfilled Prime to provide customers with fast, consistent delivery, regardless of the fulfillment method,” an Amazon spokeswoman said. “We are informing selling partners now so they have time to adjust their business and have set up a dedicated support team to guide them through these adjustments and help them succeed.”Amazon has been developing its own delivery operation for years to reduce its reliance on UPS, FedEx and USPS for the critical ”final mile” to a customer’s home. Providing logistics services to merchants is a fast-growing revenue source for Amazon. Third-party seller services, which includes logistics, generated sales of $18.2 billion in the second quarter, up 52% from a year earlier and far more than the $10.8 billion from its profitable cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services.That growth has strained Amazon facilities and pushed it to experiment with different programs meant to expand capacity. Another experimental program called FBA Onsite, which let Amazon’s merchant partners take Amazon inventory into their own warehouses and oversee its packaging and delivery, will be closed in February, Amazon told sellers Tuesday. The end of that program, which Amazon also attributed to poor delivery performance, will likely push more packages through Amazon’s logistics network.Amazon has to keep reducing delivery times because it faces competition from big rivals such as Walmart Inc. that are investing in making same-day deliveries from thousands of stores around the country, said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData in New York.“Anything that’s a monopoly doesn’t have to respond to competitive conditions in this manner,” Saunders said. “Amazon is working overtime to make sure it meets delivery promises and improves the experience because customers have more choices about where they can shop online.”(Updates with details about the end of Amazon warehouse program in 14th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-makes-harder-sellers-avoid-191604721.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-08-18	2020-08-18 21:52:51	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Postal Deal That Trump Despises Is Actually Profitable	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump has frequently assailed the pricing agreement between Amazon.com Inc. and the U.S. Postal Service. Yet the deal has repeatedly been described as a money-maker for the beleaguered agency.Trump -- who faces accusations from Democrats that funding cuts and operational changes at the post office are meant to stop mailed votes for Democratic challenger Joe Biden from being counted -- claimed in an interview with Fox News on Monday that Amazon is “maybe the biggest problem with the post office” because of the losses that the service takes on package deliveries.And in Yuma, Arizona, on Tuesday, he said Amazon should pay higher prices for shipping packages to cover the Postal Service’s costs. “Amazon is going to pay for the post office,” Trump said. “It’s part of their model. They think the post office is stupid.”The USPS has been losing billions of dollars a year for more than a decade as people use email and other online services to correspond, in addition to its onerous pension obligations. But its commercial package delivery service, which includes agreements with companies such as Amazon, FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc., is lucrative, the post office and lawmakers have said.Terms of the Postal Service’s delivery deal with Amazon are confidential, however USPS has repeatedly said it doesn’t lose money on the agreement. In addition, the post office must cover its costs in its commercial package delivery business under the law. Amazon regularly uses the postal service to complete what’s called the “last mile” of delivery.In fact, shipping and packages have been the only growth segment for the Postal Service and jumped more than 50% to $8.3 billion in revenue in the third quarter, which ended June 30, according to fiscal 2020 results released Aug. 7. Every other service category fell in both revenue and volume, in part because of the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic drove up costs, including for personal protective equipment and paid sick leave, contributing to a net loss of $2.2 billion in the period, roughly in line with the year before.Trump claimed in the Fox interview, without showing evidence, that the Postal Service loses about $3 per package with Amazon. He had previously claimed the loss was $1.50.“They take a lot of this mail into areas where they could never go because the postal system is massive,” he said. Amazon is dropping “packages into the post office by the thousands.”Spokespeople for USPS and Amazon didn’t comment on Trump’s allegations. They have previously called the deal a success.Back in 2018, when Trump repeatedly blamed the deal for the post office’s woes, two top Democratic lawmakers who said they reviewed the deal with Amazon, declared that retailers shipping packages represented a rare bright spot for the Postal Service.The agreement with Amazon and other retailers has been “one of the few areas of growth in Postal Service revenues, experiencing double-digit increases in recent years and accounting for nearly 30% of its operating revenue in fiscal year 2017,” according to a letter led by the late Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland in June 2018. Cummings and fellow Democrat Gerald Connolly of Virginia called Trump’s charges related to the post office “inaccurate” and said the Amazon deal is comparable to other last-mile arrangements.Trump has long aimed insults at Amazon and its chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, which has closely covered his administration’s foibles.The issue has resurfaced as Trump-appointed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy initiated service cutbacks and and the service warned 46 states that it might not be able to deliver their ballots on time for the November election. But amid a growing outcry over the changes, DeJoy announced Tuesday that he would suspend them until after the election.DeJoy is scheduled to testify before a Senate panel on Friday and a House panel on Monday.Even as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic prompts states to step-up mail-in voting procedures, Trump, who’s trailing Biden in polls, has claimed without evidence that it routinely leads to massive fraud, raising concerns about attempted voter suppression.Speaker Nancy Pelosi is calling the House back from the summer recess to try to address the cuts.(Updates with Trump comment, DeJoy announcement, starting in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-postal-deal-trump-despises-162646301.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-08-17	2020-08-17 21:15:29	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	USPS' Holiday Surcharges May Be Lump Of Coal For Merchants	The first-rate increase of the Louis DeJoy era as postmaster general could end up hitting millions of merchants right between the eyes during the busiest time of the year. However, the increases could be stocking stuffers for the agency's largest parcel users. With no fanfare — and subsumed by the extraordinary election-year chaos swirling around the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) — the agency on Friday afternoon announced a series of proposed peak holiday season surcharges on its biggest parcel customers, those who ship massive numbers of packages under commercial contracts with USPS. In absolute terms, the increases are measured in cents on the dollar. However, because of the very low rates already afforded to big users, they amount to substantial increases on a percentage basis.The proposed temporary hikes, which would take effect Oct. 18 and run until Dec. 27, must still be approved by the Postal Regulatory Commission, the independent agency that oversees USPS' pricing actions. The increases will not affect retail customers and do not apply to international shipments, USPS said. It will also not be accompanied by any structural changes in the agency's parcel-processing and delivery operations. Under the proposed measure, a 1-pound parcel rate for the agency's popular Parcel Select DDU drop-shipping service, where consolidators dump bulk parcels deep into the postal network for residential deliveries, would rise by as much as 7.5%, from $3.19 to $3.43 per parcel. The rate for a returned parcel of the same weight would rise 7.9%. The rate of a parcel weighing less than 1 pound would jump by 13.3%. Commercial rates on USPS' Priority Mail two- to three-day delivery product would rise 5.9% from a low of $7.02 to $7.42 per piece. The surcharges would average out to 6% to 8% increases on USPS' largest mail users, according to estimates from investment bank UBS.However, those increases will likely be passed on, and in larger increments, to the small to midsize merchants who pay the large users to consolidate their parcels with millions of others and induct them in bulk deep into the postal system for residential deliveries. According to UBS estimates, the marked-up surcharges by United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS), which operates as a consolidator of merchant traffic, could be two to four times higher than the increases that UPS will absorb from USPS. In a note published Sunday, UBS called the nature of the USPS announcement &quot;unusual,&quot; and said it reflects the tightness of the parcel delivery market as well as the greater-than-normal pricing power currently held by UPS, rival FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) and USPS on business-to-consumer (B2C) traffic.Some National Service Agreements (NSA), the name for contracts between USPS and its largest shippers, have caps on rate increases. However, NSAs allow for rate pass-throughs as a result of USPS pricing actions beyond the users' control, according to Jerry Hempstead who runs a parcel consultancy bearing his name. Carriers have levied, or are poised to levy, their own peak surcharges, which are expected to be larger than prior years due to the added volumes associated with the coronavirus pandemic. In an email, Hempstead said many shippers will &quot;most likely get a double whammy of the carriers' peak surcharge and the USPS peak surcharge.&quot;Consultancy Shipware, LLC used the example of the Parcel Select rate increase to illustrate the potential financial benefit to consolidators like UPS. The $3.19 rate paid by UPS will rise by 24 cents per parcel. However, should UPS pass on that increase proportionately, the $10.17 rate that it charges customers using its SurePost last-mile induction service will rise by 76 cents per parcel, Shipware said. The differential represents a 52 cent, or 5.1%, increase for UPS on every SurePost shipment, Shipware said. Shipware CEO Rob Martinez said the gap will create a &quot;huge profit&quot; opportunity for UPS. Conversely, merchants operating on tight margins and already offering consumers low-cost to free shipping in order to compete could find the markups painful, Martinez said.The Package Coalition, which represents a broad array of USPS stakeholders, said in a statement that the proposed increases are &quot;relatively moderate&quot; compared to the frequent calls by President Donald Trump for USPS to quadruple its parcel rates. Trump's demands, which many experts believe would severely damage smaller merchants and cause postal customers to flee to rivals, are &quot;devastating to businesses and consumers,&quot; said John McHugh, the coalition's president. Forcing USPS to &quot;set prices above competitive levels would do nothing but harm the Postal Service and, with it, the American businesses and consumers who rely on its delivery services,&quot; McHugh said.The USPS increases will apply to all businesses who drop-ship parcels at the agency's &quot;destination delivery unit,&quot; postal lingo for the local post office. These include companies like UPS, FedEx, DHL and Pitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE: PBI), as well as mega-shippers like Amazon.com Inc., (NASDAQ: AMZN), USPS' largest shipping customer, that have the large volumes to meet the agency's thresholds for receiving bulk commercial ratesThe proposed surcharges will help offset the costs of handling elevated parcel volumes since the coronavirus pandemic began, and will generate additional revenue at a critical time, the agency said in a statement on Friday.USPS handled 701 million shipments in July, a 46% year-on-year increase, according to data from consultancy ShipMatrix. Second-quarter volumes rose nearly 50% year-on-year to 2.1 billion parcels, ShipMatrix said.USPS handles immense residential volume. It delivered 6.2 billion parcels in 2019, more residential volume than FedEx and UPS combined, according to Shipware data. Most of the volume came from the Parcel Select service, Shipware said.Parcel Select is popular with consolidators and merchants because it offers universal deliveries at very low rates. By law, USPS must serve every address in the U.S. Big users value Parcel Select because it provides them with blanket delivery coverage without the cost of dispatching their trucks and drivers.See more from Benzinga  * TFI Raises 9 Million In Share Offering  * JD.com Buys 2 Million Majority Stake In Express Delivery Giant  * Alphabet-Backed Startup To Build Self-Driving 'Road Of The Future'(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Thus all private entities like UPS, FedEx and others cannot be technically involved in the process.FedEx responded by saying it's accepting individual ballots but advises voters to be familiar with the state guidelines while using FedEx to return their election-related documents.See Also: Trump's Battle Over US Postal Service Funding: What You Need To KnowWhy It's Important: The USPS, on the other hand, has warned the states in writing that mail-in votes may not arrive in time for the counting process of the presidential election.&quot;Certain deadline... are incongruous with the postal service's delivery standards,&quot; the agency said.It's expected that a large section of the voters would opt for mail-in voting due to the ongoing pandemic.

He feels it would boost the chances of his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, in the election.People on social media, therefore, were urging companies UPS and FedEx to step in and sort out the problems relating to mail-in voting. But experts believe it would not be easy for private entities to bypass the existing rules and regulations and assist the USPS in the delivery of postal ballots.See more from Benzinga * Amazon Could Use JCPenney, Sears Stores As Fulfillment Centers: Report * Biden Accidentally Reveals GM's Future Corvette Plans * Berkshire Hathaway's Profit Up By 87% Amid Business Slowdown(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-14	2020-08-14 17:56:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	U.S. Postal Service to raise prices on commercial packages, starting Oct. 18	The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) said Friday that it is planning a temporary price increase on all commercial domestic competitive packages, starting Oct. 18.

The price increase will go into effect at 1 a.m. Eastern on Oct. 18 and remain until 1 a.m on Dec. 27. The increases will apply to parcels shipped via Priority Mail Express, Priority Mail, First-Class Package Service, Parcel Select and Parcel Return Service. Among the planned increases, rates for Parcel Select Ground, which currently starts at $6.92, will increase by 40 cents; Priority Mail Express Commercial, which currently starts at $22.75, will increase by $1.50; and Parcel Select Lightweight, which currently starts at $1.81, will increase by 24 cents. The news comes after United Parcel Service Inc.  said last week that it planned to impose new surcharges on large shippers during the holiday season, to make up for the added costs to prepare for a surge in online orders.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/354ad77b-d727-302c-a3ff-3cace564d7a3/u.s.-postal-service-to-raise.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-12	2020-08-12 15:49:40	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Analyzing United Parcel Service's Unusual Options Activity	On Wednesday, shares of United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $159.92.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-09-04  * Strike Price: $165.00  * Volume: 371  * Open Interest: 433 Ways Options Activity is 'Unusual'Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being &quot;out of the money&quot;. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-11	2020-08-11 13:30:02	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Our Pandemic Love Affair With E-Commerce Could Soon Sour	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- E-commerce stocks were some of the biggest winners in the second quarter, with such companies as Shopify, Wayfair and Etsy reporting year-over-year revenue growth of about 100%, thanks to consumers ordering things online in the pandemic. A decade of e-commerce adoption took place in a matter of months.But this dramatic shift in consumer buying behavior wasn’t matched by the physical supply chain on which e-commerce relies. Price increases announced by United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. recently should raise some doubts about the ability of e-commerce darlings to keep growing enough to please investors.What's going on here, at least in the short term, is a classic case of supply bottlenecks emerging in response to a rapid increase in demand. As consumers began spending again in April after the initial shock of March’s shelter-in-place orders, they shifted some purchases online — either because it was perceived to be safer than shopping in stores, or because some stores weren't even open. While this was bad news for brick-and-mortar merchants, some e-commerce companies were big winners.Shopify Inc., a service provider for online businesses, reported revenue growth jumped 97% from a year earlier in the second quarter. Wayfair Inc., which sells furniture and home goods online, saw its revenues grow 84%. Etsy Inc., powered in part by sales of homemade masks, grew revenues 137%. All three companies enjoyed expanded profit margins, with revenues growing at a faster rate than costs.But three months ago, neither these companies nor the package-delivery services on which they rely had planned for this kind of growth. As Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos has said, the current quarter's financial results are largely due to decisions, plans and investments made a few years ago. And as Amazon has gotten bigger, it has boosted investments both in the fulfillment centers that warehouse its goods and in its own network of delivery services to ensure it's not overly reliant on third-party companies such as UPS and FedEx.The question is how other e-commerce platforms and merchants will perform during this year's holiday season, when they're likely to get crushed by unplanned record demand, both from the secular growth in e-commerce and the temporary impact of the pandemic.UPS and FedEx — large, established transportation companies with decades of experience — have thought about it ahead of time and raised their prices accordingly, to ensure they can provide a high level of service to merchants willing and able to pay, and perhaps to decrease demand from more cost-constrained sellers. Large companies that sell either offline or online — not just Amazon, but also Walmart, Home Depot and the like — are more likely to be in a position to pay or find their own delivery solutions than newer companies or smaller sellers, which rely on the bigger online platforms for their business.Sourcing inventory to meet demand may also constrain growth this holiday season. In one example, online used-car seller Carvana Co. last week noted how inventory shortages due to shuttered auto factories have hurt sales. The company is trying to buy cars from customers to replenish its stock. Widespread product shortages, with production struggling to keep pace, may be inevitable for the balance of the year for many e-commerce companies, preventing consumers from getting everything they want online, and perhaps leading to some unwelcome fourth-quarter financial results.To the extent these challenges are contained to e-commerce, online sellers may be tempted to raise prices to pay for added delivery costs or more expensive inventory. But that also risks chasing away price-sensitive consumers who still have the ability to go to stores if products there are cheaper.Over time, as Amazon has shown, these problems are fixable. To the extent 2020 levels of e-commerce demand are sustainable, UPS and FedEx will make investments to meet it, and Amazon and other e-commerce companies can do the same. Inventories will get rebuilt if the demand is there. Pricing will adjust to make all this happen. But with the holiday season only a few months away, it's largely too late to make big investments to meet this year's demand. After a banner second quarter, investors may be extrapolating surging revenues and profit margins out to the end of this year and beyond. But they should prepare for the short-term unwelcome scenario of surging cost pressures, stressed supply chains, widespread product outages and angry customers.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Conor Sen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-08-11	2020-08-11 08:34:01	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UBS Lifts United Parcel’s PT On ‘Favorable’ Pricing Environment	Shares of United Parcel gained 1.7% on Monday after UBS raised the stock’s price target to $162 (1.5% upside potential) from $150 on expectations of higher revenues in the fourth quarter due to increased pricing.UBS analyst Thomas Wadewitz maintained a Hold rating on United Parcel (UPS). In a research note to investors, he said that “The company's new peak season surcharges on its Domestic Package residential services could add $550M-$620M in Q4 revenue and highlight a favorable pricing environment.”United Parcel said last Friday that it will apply new surcharges on parcels during this year's holiday season. The courier giant plans to apply a surcharge of $4 per package for shippers that sent over 25,000 parcels per week. It will impose a $1 charge on a package for ground deliveries in case of volumes increases by 10% from the February level.An unprecedented surge in residential delivery volumes amid the COVID-19 pandemic has provided United Parcel leverage to apply surcharges. However, domestic deliveries are more costly than those to businesses. Therefore, surcharges are expected to mitigate the impact of higher costs.Overall, UPS has a Hold analyst consensus. The average price target of $130.23 implies downside potential of 18.4% to current levels. (See UPS stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News: FedEx Gains 5% As Bernstein Raises Stock To Buy Uber Acquires Taxi Tech Firm Autocab To Expand In UK Uber Launches Ride-Hailing App In Tokyo In Partnership With Taxi Operators More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Royal Caribbean Rises In Pre-Market On Higher Demand For 2021 Cruises   * Pfenex Pops 59% On Ligand $513M Buy-Out Deal; Analyst Sees 93% Upside   * American Airlines Shares Lifted By Air Travel Demand Data   * Walmart vs Target: Which Retailer is the Better Buy?	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ubs-lifts-united-parcel-pt-083401769.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-08-11	2020-08-11 00:52:44	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Option Trader Bets $3M The Stock's Huge Rally Isn't Over	United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) shares are up 70.4% in the past three months. The delivery giant appears to have gotten a boost from shelter-in-home environment, and at least one large option trader is making a huge bet on more upside ahead.The UPS Trades: On Monday, Benzinga Pro subscribers received two option alerts related to unusually large UPS trades:  * At 9:39 a.m., a trader bought 346 UPS call options with a $162.50 strike price expiring on Friday above the ask price at 88.3 cents. The trade represented a $3,055.18 bullish bet.  * At 12:05 p.m, a trader bought 750 UPS call options with a $120 strike price expiring on Jan. 15 2021 at the ask price of $42.25. The trade represented a more than $3.16 million bullish bet.Why It's Important: Even traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader.Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock.Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there's no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively large size of Monday's largest UPS option trade, it could certainly be institutional hedging.Delivering The Gains: UPS shares traded higher on Monday without any major news from the company. UPS been on fire in recent months, as the combination of low fuel prices and soaring delivery demand propelled the company to a huge second-quarter earnings beat.UPS reported a 20.9% jump in overall volumes, including a 22.8% gain in domestic volumes and a 65% increase in business-to-consumer deliveries in the quarter.Looking ahead to the third quarter, there's no obvious reason to think there will be a significant change in customers' behavior given the COVID-19 outbreak is ongoing. In the longer-term, UPS investors may be speculating that some of the pandemic related shifts in shopping behavior may stick even after the worst of the pandemic subsides, creating a better baseline environment for UPS.  UPS Chart by TradingView new TradingView.widget( { &quot;width&quot;: 680, &quot;height&quot;: 423, &quot;symbol&quot;: &quot;NYSE:UPS&quot;, &quot;interval&quot;: &quot;D&quot;, &quot;timezone&quot;: &quot;Etc/UTC&quot;, &quot;theme&quot;: &quot;light&quot;, &quot;style&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;locale&quot;: &quot;en&quot;, &quot;toolbar_bg&quot;: &quot;f1f3f6&quot;, &quot;enable_publishing&quot;: false, &quot;allow_symbol_change&quot;: true, &quot;container_id&quot;: &quot;tradingview_6fd12&quot; } ); Benzinga's Take: The fact that the January calls expire more than five months from now suggests the trader isn't making a play on near-term bullish momentum or even third-quarter earnings. The trader may simply be betting that the shelter-in-place environment drives a massive amount of holiday season shopping online, creating a late-year surge in UPS deliveries.The January calls have a break-even price of $162.25, suggesting the stock needs to gain only about 0.4% over the next five months for the trader to turn a profit on the calls.Related Links:Bearish Amazon Option Trader Bets M The Stock Won't Hold ,100 How To Read And Trade An Option AlertSee more from Benzinga  * Workhorse CFO Talks USPS Contract, Says Company Has 2-Year Lead On Competitors(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-07	2020-08-07 17:14:27	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS, FedEx Flex Price Power on Delivery Surge, Driving Up Shares	(Bloomberg) -- United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. shares jumped after the couriers said they are raising prices aggressively to boost profit and help manage an avalanche of residential deliveries spurred by the coronavirus pandemic.UPS plans to apply holiday season surcharges of as much as $4 a package for shippers that send more than 25,000 parcels a week and whose peak-season volume is triple February’s level. On the low end, the charge is $1 a package for ground deliveries for shippers with volume at least 10% above February’s level. UPS, which skipped the peak-season fees last year, charged less than $1 extra per package in 2018.FedEx will boost international surcharges on select routes beginning Aug. 10. Deliveries to the U.S. from Hong Kong will double to $2 a kilo and from Taiwan will jump to $1 from 22 cents. FedEx has said it plans to apply holiday surcharges as well.UPS, FedEx and other couriers have been hit with unprecedented residential package volume amid the pandemic. Deliveries to homes can be more costly than those to businesses because there are typically fewer packages per stop and more distance between locations.The surge in demand has given couriers leverage to raise prices, however. UPS’s average U.S. volume climbed 23% in the second quarter from a year earlier, and FedEx U.S. ground deliveries jumped 20% in its latest quarter.UPS increased 7.4% to $156.19 at 12:54 p.m. in New York, while FedEx climbed 5.3% to $181.37. UPS advanced 24% this year through Thursday, while FedEx gained 14% and the S&P 500 rose 3.7%.“The peak surcharges reflect current market conditions caused by the pandemic, which includes consumer demand and available capacity,” Atlanta-based UPS said by email Friday. The fees will “help balance the volume in UPS’s network so we can provide the best possible service.”Its holiday surcharges apply from Nov. 15 to Jan. 16. From Oct. 4 through Jan. 16, the company will also charge $50 for each large package and $250 for deliveries that exceed maximum limits, according to UPS’s website.“The companies that are going to be hurt by these surcharges are the companies that can least afford it at this point, and that’s retailers,” said John Haber, chief executive officer of Spend Management Experts, a package shipping consulting firm.Many retailers have turned to e-commerce as a lifeline while customers stayed away from stores because of the virus, he said, and only strong merchants such as Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. will likely be able absorb the surcharges without passing them on to customers.FedEx began to apply international surcharges in April as volumes jumped and commercial airlines, which carry some cargo in the belly of their planes, reduced flights dramatically. The company is incurring extra costs because of virus-related restrictions by countries seeking to contain the spread.“Those restrictions continue to disrupt the global supply chain,” the Memphis, Tennessee-based company said by email. “Air cargo capacity is limited, and we are incurring incremental costs as we adjust our international networks.”FedEx and UPS aren’t expected to boost capacity much in the medium term, said Stephens analyst Jack Atkins. Combined with the surge in residential packages and international demand, that means the couriers will have the upper hand on price for a while, he said in a note Friday before the surcharges were announced.“We believe the pricing story in parcel has legs,” he wrote.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-levy-heavy-holiday-surcharges-145645237.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-04	2020-08-04 23:10:10	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Cargo Airline Cashing in on Junk-Bond Boom for Owner Payout	(Bloomberg) -- At a little-known cargo airline that handles shipments for United Parcel Service Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., business is booming.With passenger carriers forced to cut most of their freight capacity during the pandemic, seven-year-old Western Global Airlines LLC has picked up new orders amid a surge in online shopping.Now, it’s benefiting from another big tailwind: the credit rally sparked by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented backstop.The Estero, Florida-based carrier is borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars from the junk-bond market to fund a stock program that will give it a sizable tax break, hand the founders a large payout and potentially keep its workforce union-free.Companies have been issuing debt at a record pace since the Fed announced a series of measures in March to keep the economy going. While that has provided much-needed liquidity to struggling businesses, the rally has been so broad-based that it has also allowed less-impacted companies to sell debt to fund payouts to shareholders.Read more: Airlines pledge aircraft, loyalty programs in bid to tap fundingWestern Global is looking to raise $410 million through its first ever junk bond offering as part of a plan to sell a minority stake to employees. The deal will see founder Jim Neff and other existing shareholders sell as much as 49% of the company to the employee stock ownership plan.“We believe that our employees are the best strategic partners and view the ESOP as a win-win for both the employees and the company,” a representative said in response to requests for comment. As essential transportation, the airline also experienced substantially higher operating costs in the Covid-19 environment, the company representative said.Tax BenefitsUnder the plan, the airline will lend proceeds from the bond offering to a newly set-up ESOP, which will use the funds to purchase the stake. The plan will use annual contributions it receives from the company to repay the debt over time.Western Global expects to realize significant tax benefits from the arrangement as it will be able to deduct interest on the debt and contributions made to the plan, according to people with knowledge of the company’s presentation to investors. The deal is also expected to dissuade workers from unionizing, preserving one of Western Global’s key advantages versus competitors, the people said, asking not to be named when discussing confidential information.The company began sounding out potential investors for the five-year bonds last week at a yield in the 8.25% to 8.5% range, some of the people said. In a sign of tepid demand from potential investors, the range was revised on Tuesday to 8.75% to 9%. Western Global also shifted $10 million to a separate revolver, reducing the offering’s original $420 million size.A representative for Royal Bank of Canada, which is leading the bond sale, declined to comment.Demand SurgeWhile Western Global and other cargo carriers are enjoying an increase in demand, passenger airlines have had to borrow billions of dollars and sell stock, diluting existing holders, to shore up their cash reserves as the pandemic wreaks havoc across the travel industry.Analysts at S&P Global Ratings said in late July that they expect Western Global’s revenue to jump by more than 90% this year thanks to higher demand for cargo shipments and less capacity from passenger airlines during the pandemic.UPS is Western Global’s largest customer, accounting for around 24% of revenue in the first six months of the year, the airline said in documents shared with potential investors. Amazon, which only became a customer this year, and the U.S. Department of Defense, which approved the company as a contractor in 2016, made up around 16% and 14% respectively, the documents show.The airline transports cargo for Amazon from Hong Kong to Los Angeles three times a week, and recently agreed an extension of the service through the year end, according to the documents shared with investors. The company has 19 aircraft, with 14 in service, and has flown to more than 350 airports in 134 countries, the documents show.Read more: U.S. airlines’ lifeline is enough to limp along, but little moreWestern Global is also benefiting from some of the stimulus measures approved by the U.S. Government as part of the Cares Act. It received an $8.2 million loan through the Paycheck Protection Program and was granted $34.8 million of additional payroll assistance through a separate program the U.S. Treasury established for the airline industry, according to the documents.The company owns all of the planes it operates and takes care of their maintenance directly.

2020-08-04	2020-08-04 09:30:02	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Don’t Let the Postal Service Derail the Presidential Election	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When Louis DeJoy became postmaster general in May, he was the first person in more than 20 years to run the U.S. Postal Service who had never worked there. His predecessor, Megan Brennan, had spent her entire career with the service, originally as a mail carrier.On the other hand, DeJoy, an accountant, founded and sold a company, New Breed Logistics, that worked for decades with the Postal Service and other public and private enterprises wrestling with supply and transportation challenges. DeJoy’s Postal Service work while running New Breed reportedly focused on the basics: repairing postal equipment, mail bags and hampers.In theory, what DeJoy lacked in familiarity and expertise would be more than offset by a fresh, outside perspective and an ability to help modernize the Postal Service, which employs almost 500,000 people, operates a massive domestic retail network (bigger than McDonald’s Corp., Starbucks Corp. and Walmart Inc. combined), and, until Covid-19 arrived, was delivering 182 million pieces of first-class mail daily.I would think DeJoy also came to the attention of the Postal Service’s board of governors because he is a generous political donor to President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. Since 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records, DeJoy has donated more than $2 million to Trump’s campaign and other Republican groups. As recently as February, he gave $210,600 to a political action committee, Trump Victory. The Republican National Committee and the McConnell Senate Committee have also received money from DeJoy. In 2017, he hosted a joint fundraiser for Trump and the RNC at his North Carolina home.DeJoy’s wife, Aldona Wos, is vice chairwoman of the President’s Commission on White House Fellowships and was nominated by Trump to be the next U.S. ambassador to Canada. DeJoy and Wos have disclosed financial assets worth $30.1 million to $75.3 million, the bulk of which is tied up in the company that bought New Breed from them. But they also have small stakes in Postal Service competitors, such as United Parcel Service Inc.All of this has weighed heavily on DeJoy’s brief tenure. When he arrived at the Postal Service, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was leading a White House effort to leverage federal bailout funding to get the struggling agency to agree to greater presidential control. Trump himself was exercising his animus toward Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com Inc. and owner of the Washington Post, threatening to tie up the $10 billion Congress had earmarked for the Postal Service until it raised prices for package deliveries Amazon relies on.That mud wrestling prompted the resignation of a veteran member of the Postal Service’s board of governors. Another veteran left the 11-member board after DeJoy’s appointment. In short order, the postal workers’ union and Democrats in Congress voiced concerns that the Postal Service had become politicized and that DeJoy was a stalking horse for Trump’s resentments — and for the possibility that the beleaguered president would use the service to undermine mail-in voting for the November election.In mid-July, DeJoy made a number of operational changes, including shorter post office hours and eliminating overtime for postal workers, that promised to slow down mail delivery and could throw a wrench into mail-in voting. DeJoy said it was all about cost-cutting and efficiency. Senior Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform wondered otherwise and on July 20 asked DeJoy to respond to requests for more information about those changes. They also wanted to know why he was running the Postal Service like a “private company” rather than “the constitutionally mandated public service that it is.”As I wrote in April, there’s no question that the Postal Service needs improvement, and if that means adopting some private-sector practices, so be it. But there’s no reason to believe that’s why Trump has taken such a close interest in it. The president has tried to bend federal agencies to his whims or self-interest rather than refashion them as engines of enhanced public service. The Postal Service is no exception.Trump and Attorney General William Barr also have repeatedly, and falsely, slagged mail-in voting as riddled with fraud, despite the fact that both of them and 14 other senior Trump administration officials have voted by mail. Why wouldn’t they take the next logical step and disrupt the Postal Service’s machinery with federal fraud investigations draped in the cloak of “good government” — particularly when Trump is deeply underwater in most presidential polls and has been saber-rattling about postponing Election Day?That possibility isn’t lost on casual observers, including former presidents. During his eulogy last week for Representative John Lewis, Barack Obama warned that an attack on voting rights is already being conducted “with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run-up to an election that is going to be dependent on mailed-in ballots so people don’t get sick.”Most states allow some form of mail-in voting. Although Republicans fear it favors Democrats, studies have indicated that it hasn’t provided an advantage historically for either party. Still, anything that makes voting easier increases turnout, and increased turnout has always been a boon to Democrats. And this election year is unlike any other in the modern era because of the Covid-19 pandemic, economic upheaval, social protests and the partisan passions sparked by Trump. Americans are likely to be highly motivated to vote while also being deeply worried about doing so safely at public polling booths.Voters also favor voting early, using mail-in ballots. The number of voters who have done so on Election Day more than doubled to 57.2 million in 2016, from 24.9 million in 2004 — an increase from about 20% to 40% of all ballots cast. The 2020 election promises to bring an even greater spike. States, which actually run elections despite White House views to the contrary, will need fiscal and logistical support to manage what is likely to be a massive upswing in mail-in voting.Prompt delivery of mail-in ballots will be key to this functioning well. A majority of states won’t accept mail-in ballots unless they arrive by Election Day, even if they’re postmarked prior to Election Day.I’m sure the postmaster general wouldn’t want to see tens of millions of ballots arrive after Election Day, depriving Americans of a fundamental right. But to make sure, Congress will need to do more than write DeJoy threatening letters — it will need to keep the public and voters focused on how he’s running the Postal Service and hold him, the Justice Department and the White House accountable.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Timothy L.

2020-08-01	2020-08-01 00:00:02	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	The World’s Jumbo Jets Are Heading for the Boneyard	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The queens of the skies have fallen on hard times.As Covid-19 has frozen the international travel on which they once thrived, double-decker, four-engine planes like the Airbus SE A380 and Boeing Co. 747 are more likely to be found in storage than soaring through the skies.Carriers such as Pan Am Corp. used the 747 to turn aviation into a global industry in the 1970s, and over the past decade Emirates used the A380 to repeat the trick for the global south — but those times have passed. Since mid-March, most have barely flown except on short hops to maintain pilots’ certifications and valedictory voyages to gather dust in desert boneyards.Many of those furloughs look like becoming permanent. IAG SA’s British Airways has announced plans to ground the largest fleet of 747-400s for good. Qantas Airways Ltd. sent its last 747 home to the U.S. last week, and has already suspended its stable of A380s.Among the 15 operators of the A380, which entered service less than 13 years ago, only Emirates has been operating flights in anything close to a normal fashion, according to data from aircraft-tracking site Flightradar24. Out of its 115 such planes — about half the global fleet — just a dozen have been flying to and from Europe over the past month or so, as limited traffic has trickled back. China Southern Airlines Co. has also been running a limited service with its five A380s.However, the vast majority of the planes — worth some $50 billion, if valued at about half of their list prices — have been stuck on the tarmac, possibly permanently. Qatar Airways QCSC has speculated that its A380s may never return, while Deutsche Lufthansa AG has made similar noises.By the time the long-haul routes for which the A380 was designed return to normal in 2024 or so, about half the fleet will be at least a decade old and well on the way toward retirement. Singapore Airlines Ltd., the biggest operator after Emirates, said in first-quarter results that it may write down “older generation aircraft” such as its A380s by around $1 billion.It’s a similar picture with the 747. Of the 29 planes operated by Lufthansa — the largest passenger fleet, once British Airways’ jets have retired — just four have remained in regular operation since March, with a further four gradually returning to service over the past two months.Probably the most active operator of passenger 747s at this point is Aeroflot PJSC’s Rossiya Airlines, plus a handful of charter operators that run seasonal flights to holiday destinations and pilgrimage services to Saudi Arabia. Even there, though, foreign pilgrims at this year’s hajj will be confined to 10,000 people already in the country.The reasons for the decline of these jets aren’t hard to discern. Even at the best of times, it can be challenging to fill more than 400 seats at a time, and a plane with more than 20% of seats empty will typically lose money — and that’s before you start thinking about the costs of providing crew and destination accommodation for such vast aircraft.With the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 able to achieve similar ranges using just two engines and smaller cabins, the economics of double-decker planes no longer make a lot of sense.U.S. airlines in particular have long since given up on the jumbo. They never bought a single A380, and last took delivery of a 747 a few months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when Northwest Airlines Corp. bought two before later going bankrupt and being taken over by Delta Air Lines Inc.There’s one area that’s been booming, however: freight. Air cargo typically takes up a substantial share of the belly space on passenger flights, but with borders closed to tourism, the semiconductors, high-value materials and consumer goods that typically travel beneath your feet have had to find a new route to market. Cargo traffic this year will be down just 17% from a year earlier, compared to 55% for passenger flights, according to the International Air Transport Association.That could provide a final chapter for the 747 — although not for the A380, which isn’t easily converted to cargo usage. Boeing’s jumbo is already a freight aircraft in all but name, with about two-thirds of the latest 747-800 variant being sold to freight carriers such as United Parcel Service Inc. and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.’s logistics arm. Even non-cargo aircraft can get in on the act: KLM has been carrying face masks and protective gowns on the seats of ordinary passenger aircraft pressed into pandemic freight service.That would be an appropriate end for grand planes often likened to ocean liners.

2020-07-31	2020-07-31 18:50:32	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week	During what may be the biggest week of earnings reports in decades, U.S. companies seem to have delivered with flying colors.After all, there's a long list of major stocks that rallied sharply after earnings. Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) confirmed investor optimism about the accelerated shift to e-commerce. United Parcel Services (NYSE:UPS) got a lift as well.In chips, both Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soared; yet another stumble by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) helped those two stocks as well. Big tech provided big numbers, as Amazon, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) all topped estimates.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInterestingly, the good news hasn't done much for major indices. That likely will change on Friday, as the NASDAQ Composite in particular is likely to gain nicely. But even with good news before the blowout releases after-hours Thursday, that index was up only about 1% for the week. The S&P 500 has seen similar returns, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is actually negative.We'll see if the optimism continues to lead U.S. stocks higher. Strong earnings next week would help. The docket isn't as stacked as it was this week, but there are still major companies reporting across sectors and across profiles.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for Beginners to Income Investing Here are 7 companies with earnings to watch closely in the coming week:  * Disney (NYSE:DIS)  * Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI)  * CVS Health (NYSE:CVS)  * Square (NYSE:SQ)  * Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU)  * Uber (NYSE:UBER)  * Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG)If earnings news stays strong next week, that could give the market enough momentum to keep defying the skeptics, and keep rallying. Disney (DIS)Source: spiderman777 / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, August 4, after market closeFiscal third quarter earnings from Disney seem likely to focus solely on the Disney+ streaming service. The parks, film and ESPN business segments all faced significant pressures in the quarter. Investors are likely to look past those numbers toward the long term, as they have elsewhere in the market.And Disney+ needs to deliver. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) posted impressive subscriber growth for the quarter.  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is putting muscle behind its Peacock streaming service, while AT&T (NYSE:T) is trying to recover from early missteps with its HBO Max.With the pandemic undeniably boosting demand, Disney+ numbers could define the industry for some to come. A blowout quarter means streaming, at least in the U.S., is basically a two-horse race. Anything less, however, raises hopes that a third or even fourth platform could find a foothold. Activision Blizzard (ATVI)Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke/Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, August 4, after market closeVideo game stocks continue to rally as investors view them as potential pandemic winners. Earnings from Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) on Thursday seem to support that thesis, as EA handily beat analyst estimates with its Q2 report.Earnings next week from both Activision Blizzard and, on Monday afternoon, Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) will round out the picture for the sector. And while investors might view Activision's release in particular, as a potential &quot;sell the news&quot; event -- ATVI is up over 60% from March lows -- that trading hasn't held this earnings season.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for Beginners to Income Investing Rather, stocks that have rallied into earnings generally have continued on their trajectory after earnings. We'll see if that trend holds for ATVI and TTWO next week. CVS Health (CVS)Source: QualityHD / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, August 5, before market openThe Q2 release looks absolutely crucial for CVS. The stock has rallied off March lows, but still is down almost 14% so far in 2020. It's been heading in the wrong direction since mid-2015, losing more than 40% of its value over that stretch.But performance has become a bit better of late, and there still should be benefits coming from the acquisition of Aetna that closed in late 2018. There are still hopes that the long-awaited turnaround can gain some traction.Those hopes require a strong quarter given results elsewhere in the space. Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) posted blowout numbers, and its stock rallied in response. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) whiffed again, and its shares again are threatening a multi-year low.CVS needs to follow the path of Rite Aid, and show that it was able to attract new customers in Q2. If it doesn't, CVS stock has a chance to follow the path of WBA stock -- and challenge multi-year lows of its own. Square (SQ)Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, August 5, after market closeSquare, too, needs to deliver with its Q2 report on Wednesday afternoon. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) posted strong results this week, which led PYPL stock higher. Notably, PayPal's Venmo, which is competing head-to-head with Square Cash, saw volume increase 52% year-over-year.Combine that with an SQ stock price that has tripled from the lows and sits near an all-time high, and expectations are going to be high for Square. They may be too high, given that the company has heavier exposure to off-line businesses like restaurants and shops.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for Beginners to Income Investing Square stock also has had a pattern of selling off even after seemingly impressive results. As a result, at least from a short-term perspective, Wednesday's release looks potentially dicey. Of course, that's been true for many tech stocks of late -- and most have seen solid gains after reports of their own. Roku (ROKU)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, August 5, after market closeOne of 2019's best stocks has been a bit of a disappointment in 2020. ROKU stock has gained a bit over 12% so far this year, which isn't bad. But most streaming plays have done better, and shares still sit below all-time highs reached in late November. In this market, most growth stocks have long since taken out new levels.Roku can change that on Wednesday afternoon with a big quarter and a strong outlook. The best way to do so would be to dispel the bearish narratives surrounding the stock. The pandemic unquestionably has accelerated 'cord-cutting', as Roku itself  highlighted last week.But the concern, particularly with Amazon's impressive growth, is to what extent Roku was able to capitalize. It's competing with giants, and bears have argued that market share will erode over time.ROKU stock isn't cheap, or profitable, but that hasn't stopped other growth stocks that have convinced investors they can take advantage of massive opportunities. Roku needs to inspire that kind of optimism on Wednesday. Uber (UBER)Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, August 6, after market closeUBER stock is stumbling into earnings, having dropped about 20% from June highs. A resurgence in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. likely is a factor.There's probably not much the ridesharing business can do to assuage those concerns on Thursday afternoon. So the focus likely shifts to the company's food delivery business.The recently announced acquisition of Postmates likely will receive some commentary and analyst questions. Numbers for Uber's legacy UberEats business will be closely scrutinized.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for Beginners to Income Investing After all, Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) posted a strong Q2, and UberEats needs to keep pace. If that business can't drive big growth, and start moving toward profitability, in this environment, investors are going to question the long-term outlook as well. Booking Holdings (BKNG)Source: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, August 6, after market closeUBER isn't the only stock to stumble amid rising pandemic concerns in recent weeks. Travel stocks have taken a hit, even if in some cases the rallies had simply gone too far.Taking the long view, there are likely some opportunities in the space. Investors looking for those opportunities in the sector should pay close attention to Booking Holdings' Q2 report -- and, more importantly, listen to the post-earnings conference call.After all, there may not be a company out there with a broader reach and more real-time data about the worldwide travel industry than Booking Holdings. The Booking.com website, in particular, goes beyond chain hotels to bed and breakfasts and even vacation rentals.The sector admittedly has not had much reason for optimism of late. We'll see if Booking's Q2 report provides a spark.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-07-30	2020-07-30 20:34:33	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Surges Most Since 1999 on Delivery Boom Spurred by Virus	(Bloomberg) -- United Parcel Service Inc. climbed the most in more than 20 years as the courier’s results easily topped Wall Street’s expectations on pandemic-induced demand for e-commerce deliveries, health-care equipment and goods from Asia.Revenue jumped 13% to $20.5 billion in the second quarter, exceeding the highest analyst prediction. Adjusted earnings were double the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg, and new Chief Executive Officer Carol Tomé signaled her focus on profitability with a vow to make UPS “better, not bigger” as a shift toward home deliveries threatens to squeeze margins.A surge in package volume helped UPS “crush elevated expectations,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Brian Ossenbeck said in a note to clients Thursday. “Parcel carriers have a unique opportunity to increase price given demand has never been higher for delivery services.”The Atlanta-based courier and rival FedEx Corp. have been in overdrive since the novel coronavirus swept the world this year, handling soaring residential deliveries while rushing personal protective equipment to hospitals. Both companies applied peak-season-style surcharges on large customers as demand jumped and new expenses arose that were needed to protect employees and keep sorting hubs free of the virus.UPS soared 14% to a record $141.46 at the close in New York, the biggest daily gain since the company’s first day of trading in November 1999. That pushed the shares to a 21% advance so far this year, while the S&P 500 Index rose less than 1%.‘Unprecedented Demand’Adjusted earnings climbed to $2.13 a share in the second quarter, the company said in a statement, compared with the $1.07 average of analyst estimates.UPS’s average U.S. volume climbed 23% to 21.1 million packages a day, driven mostly by a 65% jump in U.S. residential deliveries.“At the beginning of the second quarter, we assumed demand would slow. Instead, we saw just the opposite,” said Tomé, who took the reins June 1.“Due to ongoing Covid-related sheltering in place, retail store closures, and changes in U.S. consumer spending fueled by the economic stimulus, we experienced unprecedented demand and record-high volume levels,” she said during a conference call with analysts.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysThere appear to be no sacred cows at UPS under the new leadership of CEO Carol Tome, in our view, as she looks to increase the efficiency of the global network as well as improve service for customers and returns for shareholders. We believe it will result in a leaner more profitable network longer-term.Lee Klaskow and Adam Roszkowski, transportation analystsClick here to read the research.Still, the increase in home deliveries weighed on the adjusted domestic profit margin, which fell to 9.3% from 11% a year earlier. That’s because residential service has fewer packages per stop than commercial and requires drivers to travel more between locations.Business-to-business package volume fell 22% in the quarter, but has been recovering. In July, such deliveries were down about 9%, the company said.“We are focusing on efficiency and revenue quality to improve U.S. operating margins longer term,” said Chief Financial Officer Brian Newman.UPS declined to provide guidance on revenue or earnings because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and pace of economic recovery as businesses begin to reopen.But Newman warned that revenue growth would slow in the second half. U.S. domestic profit margins will likely be lower than in the first half because of increased worker pay and benefit expenses and one-time gains a year earlier, he said. UPS hired 39,000 workers in the second quarter to deal with the demand surge.UPS fared well in the highly profitable international segment, with second-quarter sales increasing 5.7% to $3.71 billion and operating profit jumping 27% to $842 million. Revenue was driven by strong outbound demand from Asia and an increase in Europe’s cross-border e-commerce, UPS said.FedEx has also gotten a boost from the pandemic-related demand and saw revenue soar 20% at its U.S. ground delivery unit during the fiscal quarter ending May 31. FedEx rose 1.9% to $172.71.CEO’s GoalsTomé inherited a company that’s positioned to handle the demand surge after her predecessor, David Abney, defied Wall Street skepticism to step up investment in recent years. Under Abney’s spending plan, UPS expanded automated sorting hubs, purchased new aircraft such as Boeing Co. 747 freighters and developed technology to route packages more efficiently.Abney will step down as executive chairman Sept. 30. Tomé made clear that changes are coming with a thorough review of how the company does business.In one example, she said UPS has a legacy of over-engineering in areas such as the 500 different products it offers customers. Those can be pared back and simplified, she said. In the past, UPS would add capacity and then search for volume to fill it, often hurting price. Tomé said she turned down the opportunity to purchase more 747 jets before Boeing halts production of the humpbacked plane in 2022.Instead, UPS is accelerating a $750 million investment this year to speed up transit times. It’s also expanding weekend deliveries, which improves customer service, Tomé said, And it may pare spending in other areas.“We will have a laser focus on creating value for our shareowners with the goal of increasing the rates of return on the capital we invest,” she said. “It’s all about becoming better, not bigger.”(Updates shares in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-soars-virus-related-deliveries-112445839.html?.tsrc=rss

Click CVID on the terminal for global data on coronavirus cases and deaths.WHO’s Ryan Says Countries Were Unprepared for Pandemic (12:38 p.m. NY)Countries have made “a deep underinvestment in public health infrastructure,” said Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s Health Emergencies Program. When asked to reflect on the past six months of the pandemic response, he said he was surprised to the extent that countries weren’t prepared for the contact tracing and testing that would be necessary. Ryan said if he could change anything, he would have the WHO offer more technical assistance to countries it had assumed would be more ready to face the challenges.The absence of universal health coverage or affordable health care also aggravated the situation, he said. “We’re paying a heavy price again for the lack of that investment.”New York to Fund More Contact Tracing (12:35 p.m. NY)New York is making $30 million available to counties to increase contract tracing for coronavirus cases and to increase testing and vaccines for the coming flu season.Flu season will pose problems for the state, as symptoms will look like those of Covid-19, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Thursday on a conference call with reporters.Tests must be done at the same lab facilities that already are busy conducting coronavirus testing, he said. “That could affect the turnaround time on the Covid tests, so we want the counties to be ready,” he said.Houston Hospitalizations Slow Again (12:22 p.m. NY)Covid-19 hospitalizations in the Houston area dropped for a ninth consecutive day, the longest streak of declines since the pandemic emerged, according to Texas Medical Center data.Virus patients in standard hospital beds and intensive-care units have fallen for 15 of the past 17 days after peaking on July 12, the center said on its website on Thursday.Virus patients occupied 44% of the region’s intensive-care admissions as of Wednesday night, the data showed.Spain Again Reports Over 1,100 Cases (12:10 p.m. NY) Spain recorded more than 1,100 new infections for the second consecutive day, the first time the number has remained above that level for a two-day period since May 1.The total number of new daily cases rose by 1,229 to 285,430. Still, the number of deaths recorded in the last seven days was stable at 10. The increase highlights concern about fresh surges of infection in Spain, one of the countries worst hit by the pandemic during the first half of the year. While the government claims the pandemic is under control, the steady increase has led to restrictions and advisories from other European countries. Arizona Death Toll Rises (11:40 a.m. NY)Arizona counted a record number of 172 new deaths, bringing the statewide toll to 3,626. But of those deaths, 78 were belatedly reported to the state based on death certificates, inflating the total.The state Department of Health Services reported 2,525 new Covid-19 cases, a 1.5% rise that lifted the total to 170,798. The percentage gain was in line with the average 1.6% increase of the prior seven days. The positivity rate statewide was 21.3%, below the 22.3% positive tests reported on Wednesday. Maricopa County also had a decrease in positivity rate from 23.7% reported on Wednesday to 22.7% Thursday.Portugal Eases Curbs in Lisbon Area (11:30 a.m. NY)The Portuguese government on Thursday eased restrictions in 19 parishes of greater Lisbon following a drop in new coronavirus cases in these areas. The so-called “state of calamity” in those parishes will pass to a more relaxed “state of contingency” that is currently in force in the rest of the Portuguese capital’s metropolitan area, Presidency Minister Mariana Vieira da Silva said. The new rules will take effect Aug. 1. Portugal, which has been less affected by the outbreak than neighboring Spain, imposed tighter restrictions in some areas of greater Lisbon last month after a surge of new clusters.Amsterdam Requires Masks in Some Areas (11:20 a.m. NY)Amsterdam will require face masks in busy parts of the city, including the red light district and shopping streets. The measure, going into effect Aug. 5, is an experiment and doesn’t replace the 1.5-meter (5-foot) rule on social distancing, the city said Thursday. Currently, people in the Netherlands are required to don a face mask only when traveling on public transport.Cases have been climbing at a higher rate in the Netherlands in recent weeks. The number increased by more than 1,320 between July 22 and July 28, up from 987 newly confirmed cases in the previous week. At the same time, fatalities have risen at a much slower pace, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News.Florida Posts Record Deaths for Third Day (10:40 a.m. NY)Florida reported a record 253 new Covid-19 deaths among residents Thursday, bringing the cumulative total to 6,586. It was the third straight day of record fatalities.The state has 461,379 Covid-19 cases, up 2.2% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 2.5% in the previous seven days, according to the health department report, which includes data through Wednesday. The seven-day rolling new cases totaled 71,511, the lowest since July 12.The new rate of people testing positive for the first time fell to 12% for Wednesday, from 12.3% on Tuesday.Johnson Warns U.K. Not Out of Woods (10:30 a.m. NY)Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Britons the pandemic is far from over, and said there are “signs of a second wave of the pandemic” in European nations.“It is absolutely vital as a country that we continue to keep our focus and our discipline and that we don’t delude ourselves that somehow we’re out of the woods or that this is all over, because it isn’t all over,” he told the BBC.South Africa Deaths Higher Than Reported, Experts Say (10:10 a.m. NY)Medical researchers in South Africa found a “huge discrepancy” between the country’s confirmed Covid-19 fatalities and the number of excess natural deaths, providing further evidence that the number of people who have perished from the disease is higher than the government reports.South Africa has the world’s fifth-worst epidemic, with 471,123 cases. The Health Ministry reported 7,479 Covid-19 deaths to date on Wednesday,UPS Surges to Record on Delivery Bonanza (9:41 a.m. NY)United Parcel Service Inc. surged to a record as the courier blew past Wall Street’s expectations, thanks to pandemic-era demand for e-commerce deliveries, health-care equipment and goods from Asia.Revenue jumped 13% to $20.5 billion in the second quarter, topping the highest analyst estimate and confounding predictions that sales would drop. Adjusted earnings climbed to $2.13 a share, the company said in a statement Thursday. That was about double the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.UPS soared 10% to $136.33 at 9:40 a.m. in New York after climbing as high as $138.79, an intraday record.Sweden Says Work From Home Even as Data Improves (9:25 a.m. NY)Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said his fellow countrymen should continue to work from home this autumn on the advice of the National Health Agency.“The crisis is not over yet, far from it,” Lofven said on social media. “It’s important to keep our distance from others and limit the number of physical contacts.”The number of deaths and infected in Sweden are dropping “faster than anyone had dared to hope,” state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell told reporters in Stockholm.Hydroxychloroquine Use Is Doctor-Patient Prerogative: FDA Head (9:20 a.m. NY)The head of the FDA said individuals and their doctors should decide together if a patient should take hydroxychloroquine, a drug his own agency has said could have dangerous side effects if used to treat Covid-19.“A doctor and a patient needs to assess the data that’s out there,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told NBC News.Iceland Tightens Restrictions; Poland Weighs Measures (9:07 a.m. NY)Iceland is limiting large gatherings and introducing mandatory face masks on public transport following a rise in infections.Poland will decide next month on new steps to tackle its widening epidemic after reporting the biggest one-day rise in new cases, the prime minister said. The European Union’s biggest eastern economy registered 615 new cases, mostly in the southern regions of coal-rich Silesia and Malopolska. The overall number of cases reached 45,031, while deaths rose by 15 to 1,709.The Portuguese government eased restrictions in 19 parishes of greater Lisbon after a drop in cases there.Philippines Posts Record Cases, Recoveries (8:51 a.m. NY)Cases in the Philippines rose by a record on Thursday to 89,374, with recoveries also posting the highest daily increase after an overhaul in data reporting.Trump Asks If Election Should Be Delayed (8:51 a.m. NY)U.S. Economy Shrinks Most on Record; Jobless Claims Rise (8:30 a.m. NY)The U.S. economy suffered its sharpest downturn since at least the 1940s in the second quarter, highlighting how the pandemic has ravaged businesses across the country and left millions of Americans out of work. The number filing for unemployment benefits increased for a second straight week.Long U.K. Pandemic Brings Europe’s Highest Death Rate (8:06 a.m. NY)The failure to bring coronavirus under control has given the U.K. the highest cumulative death rate in Europe as of June 12, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday. Mortality in Britain peaked later than in neighboring countries and remained elevated for longer. The country was one of the latest to implement a lockdown and also among the last to ease restrictions.Jakarta Extends Social Distancing Measures (7:47 a.m. NY)Indonesia’s capital delayed a plan to further relax social distancing measures after easing of some curbs last month sparked a resurgence in infections. The city, which has already allowed offices, places of worship, restaurants and shopping malls to reopen with some limits, will extend a so-called transition phase until Aug. 13, Governor Anies Baswedan said at an online briefing in Jakarta Thursday. Offices, which have become a new source of infections, should operate at 50% of their capacity, he said.Redhill Biopharma Starts Trial (7:05 a.m. NY)Redhill Biopharma initiated a global Phase 2/3 clinical study of opaganib as a treatment for patients hospitalized with severe infection. The trial will include as many as 270 patients at sites across Europe, Latin America and other regions.Mexican Economy’s Record Plunge (7 a.m. NY)Mexico’s economy sank the most on record in the second quarter, putting the pace of the recovery in doubt and posing a dire challenge to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.Gross domestic product in the three months through June fell 17.3% compared to the previous quarter, according to preliminary data. The result, the worst in data going back to 1993, came in slightly worse than the median estimate for a 17% drop from economists surveyed by Bloomberg.Brazil Eases Entry Rules for Foreigners (6:51 a.m. NY)Brazil eased rules for foreigners entering the country by air, according to a decision published in the official gazette.Visitors planning to stay for as long as 90 days must present proof of health insurance for the entire period of the trip. Entry by land or waterways remain restricted.J&J Phase 3 Vaccine Trial (5:37 p.m. HK)Johnson & Johnson wants to start Phase 3 Trials of its Covid-19 vaccine in September, the company said in a statement. The drugmaker’s experimental vaccine protected a handful of primates with a single shot in an early study, prompting the company to start trials in humans this month.A study published in Nature showed that its candidate elicits a strong immune response that protects against infection.Astra Gives Shots to Almost 10,000 in U.K. (5:12 p.m. HK)Almost 10,000 people in the U.K. have been given an experimental vaccine from AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford, a key step toward finding a shot that will help control the pandemic.AstraZeneca is also well on its way to administering shots to 5,000 volunteers in a late-stage trial in Brazil and may scale up the size of its studies there, Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Subjects are being enrolled in South Africa, and a test in the U.S. is about to begin.U.K. Lengthens Self-Isolation Period (5 p.m. HK)The U.K. lengthened the self-isolation period for coronavirus patients to 10 days from seven as health authorities seek to prevent a renewed surge in cases of the disease.The change in guidance was issued on Thursday by England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and his counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and is effective immediately. It is based on evidence that people can still be infectious 7-9 days after first showing symptoms.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-deaths-top-150-000-224709511.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-30	2020-07-30 16:31:12	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	In One Earnings Call, UPS CEO Makes Job Her Own	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Some new CEOs prefer to sit back for awhile, watching and learning while they plot their legacy. Others carry on their predecessor’s plans. And then there are those who waste no time making the job their own. New United Parcel Service Inc. CEO Carol Tome falls into the latter category.Thursday marked the first earnings day for new CEO Carol Tome, a former Home Depot Inc. executive and UPS board member who succeeded long-time leader David Abney in June. I’d say it was a respectable debut, but that somehow cheapens it. It was downright impressive. The presentation felt refreshing on many fronts. Tome (pronounced “Toe-MAY”) was able to combine a frank and hard-nosed assessment of UPS’s past spending habits with a bit of personality. She exuded confidence and competence, but she also made some jokes and it felt like she was really being herself. That’s not an easy thing to do as a woman in business; Tome is one of only about 30 female CEOs among S&P 500 companies.It helped that Tome had robust numbers to tout: Adjusted earnings in the second quarter were twice as high as analysts had anticipated at $2.13 a share. Profit margins soared in the international business as UPS added more flights at higher yields to meet a spike in demand for products out of Asia. But they also held up much better than might have been expected in a domestic segment that saw average daily volume surge by nearly 23% in the quarter as coronavirus-lockdowns spurred an  e-commerce frenzy among everyday consumers. Such deliveries tend to be less profitable because getting online orders to residences requires more driving and additional stops than business shipments.The margin resilience in the domestic segment is partly a reflection of surcharges and route limitations that both UPS and rival FedEx Corp. have imposed on deliveries for their busiest customers. Heading into the earnings call, my biggest question was whether that was going to be sustainable once the immediate surge in Covid-buying began to fade. As soon as Tome started talking, though, it was clear this was the beginning of a much deeper change. “It's all about becoming better, not bigger,” Tome said. For her, this means rethinking how UPS invests in its business,  taking a tougher stance with retailers on pricing and prioritizing higher-quality volume.She gave the example of the company’s fleet of Boeing Co. 747s. The company pressed those wide-body jets into service to help handle the large demand for products out of Asia with fewer flights in an effort to “sweat the assets that we have.” But when an opportunity recently became available to buy more of the jets, UPS passed. The planes would have created excess capacity that UPS then would have had to find volume to fill, likely at unattractive prices. “We have not gotten the returns that we should have delivered on some of the capital investments that we made,” Tome said. “We will get the network right before we think about investing more dollars’’ in it, she said.That’s bad news for Boeing and other aerospace suppliers who had been hoping demand from freight companies might mitigate malaise among commercial airlines with the pandemic bringing air travel to a crawl. But it’s great news for UPS shareholders who have long complained about a lack of visible payoff from the billions upon billions of dollars the company has shelled out in the name of making its network more efficient and profitable.The 747s are just the tip of the iceberg. UPS is rethinking all levels of its spending and only going to put money toward projects that customers actually want and will pay for. It sounds simple, but it’s easy for large operators with long histories to get stuck in old-school trains of thought. Tome pointed out that an initial review of UPS’s 400 to 500 different products found that roughly 100 weren’t selling and yet all the offerings — along with the salesforce, technology and financial infrastructure that support them — had stayed on the books.Once you have the right products, you can go after the right kind of customer. Tome is speeding up an effort to reduce the amount of time packages from small- and medium-sized businesses spend in transit in an effort to bring on more of those kinds of customers. “Why am I focusing on SMB?” Tome asked, referring to small and medium businesses. “Because the SMB customer values an end-to-end network and they pay us for it.” The implied contrast is to a customer such as Amazon.com Inc., which is more interested in negotiating discounts relative to its large amounts of volume. Every percentage point in sales retained among small business clients translates into $170 million of high-quality revenue, Tome said. “This is a big company to turn; you can't do it overnight,” Tome said. But she seems to have made a remarkable amount of progress in a very short time as CEO and the level of detail on her longer-term outlook for UPS’s network was staggering. It just goes to show what fresh eyes can do. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-07-30	2020-07-30 14:29:08	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Pilots Seek Option To Refuse Hong Kong Missions	The union representing United Parce Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) pilots has asked the express and freight delivery giant for the option to decline flight assignments to Hong Kong after the city tightened COVID screening requirements for aircrews.The Independent Pilots Association (IPA) wants the company to extend to Hong Kong an arrangement that allows cargo pilots to opt in for routes to mainland China, spokesman Brian Gaudet said.The voluntary program &quot;has worked well for us in China,&quot; he said. It provides UPS Airlines all the captains and first officers it needs to operate, and anybody who doesn't feel safe flying into the theater doesn't have to sign up.In the early days of the pandemic, China was very aggressive with nasal swab testing and spraying crews with unidentified disinfectants when they disembarked, but UPS was able to negotiate for different protocols, according to a source familiar with how express carriers operate in that country.UPS, which operates a regional parcel hub in Hong Kong, has not responded yet to the union, according to Gaudet.&quot;Throughout the pandemic, UPS has coordinated extensively with our pilots to ensure their safety and continuity of our air express services,&quot; Mike Mangeot, director of strategic communications for UPS Airlines said in email. &quot;We've provided them with facemasks, hand sanitizer, and thermometers, enhanced aircraft cleaning protocols, worked with them on scheduling concerns, and educated them on WHO and CDC-recommended public health practices. Our crewmembers have responded admirably in these dynamic conditions.&quot;UPS continues to operate the vast majority of its services in Hong Kong &quot;with the same time commitments our customers have come to expect, and we have contingency plans in place to avoid significant impact to service,&quot; he said, while declining to comment on talks with the pilots' union. Mangeot added that UPS is in touch with the government in Hong Kong to ensure the safety of employees and continuity of operations.FedEx Pilots UpsetThe development comes as FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) pilots balk at flying to Hong Kong. The Air Line Pilots Association on Tuesday called on FedEx to suspend flights to Hong Kong because of what it termed &quot;unacceptable risks&quot; to the safety and well-being of pilots. The union said pilots are forced to stay in unsafe hospitals or quarantine centers if they test positive for COVID or have been exposed to someone who has.&quot;Pilots who test positive for COVID-19 face compulsory admission and treatment in government-selected public hospitals, with as many as five patients to a room with one shared bathroom,&quot; Capt. Dave Chase, chairman of the FedEx ALPA Master Executive Council, said in a statement. &quot;In addition, any pilot or family member in Hong Kong found to have been exposed to a COVID-19 positive individual is placed in a government quarantine facility for up to 14 days with very sparse provisions.&quot;Previously, United Airlines and American Airlines temporarily halted flights to Hong Kong because of invasive tests and concerns crews would be placed out of action for up to 14 days as the city tries to contain a new outbreak of the virus. United (NASDAQ: UAL) has since resumed a couple routes but is making an extra stop in Tokyo or Guam to change crews. On Wednesday, the Hong Kong government tightened rules on incoming aircrews and seafarers even further. Pilots and flight attendants must now have proof of a negative test for COVID-19 48 hours prior to boarding their flight to Hong Kong or otherwise submit to a deep-throat saliva test upon arrival at Hong Kong airport, and wait for the results there or at a designated location.Since July 8, the government has made it mandatory for air and sea crews to be tested upon arrival at the airport, but they were not required to wait for test results like the general public and didn't have their movements restricted. Ship crews use the airport when there are crew changes to and from their home countries.Airlines must also arrange direct transportation for crews between the airport and their hotel, or other accommodation, and prohibit the use of public transportation, according to the new directive. Airlines should also ensure that crew members self-isolate and minimize contact with the local population during their stay, it says. Click here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.Recommended Reading:Getting crews on and off ships and airplanesU.S. denies China extra passenger flightsTensions ease between U.S., China over airline flightsSee more from Benzinga  * UPS Blows Away Estimates With Stunning Second-Quarter Results  * Postal Service reaches Agreement On Billion Treasury Loan  * Carriers May Face Penalties, Shutdowns Under Virginia COVID-19 Regulations(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-30	2020-07-30 14:17:22	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Blows Away Estimates With Stunning Second-Quarter Results	United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS) reported second-quarter results before the market opened on July 30 that exceeded analysts' estimates by a wide margin.Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) surged to $2.13, up 8.7% quarter-on-quarter and more than doubling the median estimates by analysts polled by Barchart. The EPS results surpassed the high-water estimate of $1.30 a share that had been set by analysts at Deutsche Bank.The Atlanta-based company reported $1.9 billion in adjusted net income, up 8.8% from the year-earlier period. Adjusted operating profit rose 7.4% to $2.3 billion, UPS said. The results included a $112 million pre-tax charge for the ongoing costs of realigning the company's infrastructure to accommodate more business-to-consumer (B2C) deliveries, which in the U.S. rose 65% over the 2019 period. E-commerce demand surged in the quarter as governments imposed or maintained population lockdowns in an effort to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus.A UPS Boeing 747-8F (Photo: UPS)Average daily volumes systemwide climbed nearly 21% as the company handled an avalanche of e-commerce traffic during the worst of the pandemic in a number of global markets. Domestic U.S. volumes jumped 22.8% to 22.1 million parcels per day. Domestic revenue rose nearly 20% while adjusted operating margins increased by 9%.View more earnings on UPSInternational revenue increased 9.8%, fueled by strong outbound demand from Asia and an increase in European cross-border e-commerce in Europe, UPS said. Operating margins increased 20.8%.UPS' Supply Chain and Freight segment, which includes its less-than-truckload (LTL), brokerage and freight forwarding units, posted an 8.5% revenue gain in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins rose 7.3%, UPS said. Strong air forwarding demand in the quarter was offset by weakness in LTL and brokerage services earlier in the quarter, UPS said. The decline in LTL and brokerage was caused by the shutdown of U.S. business-to-business (B2B) activity for part of the quarter.Carol Tomé, UPS' new CEO, said in a statement that the results were &quot;better than we expected.&quot; The company said it would not provide revenue and EPS guidance due to the timing and pace of the global economic recovery.  Carol Tomé, CEO of UPS. (Photo: UPS)Analysts had flagged a solid quarter for UPS in the wake of strong fiscal fourth-quarter results posted by rival FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) earlier this month. Deutsche Bank's Amit Mehrotra, who had a bullish outlook on UPS before the FedEx results were published, called the UPS results a &quot;blow-out.&quot; Mehrotra's estimate had been the highest among the analyst community, he said Thursday morning.UPS' share price, which rose strongly during Wednesday's activity, increased another 10% in pre-market trading early Thursday.Investors and analysts will look for further details from the company during its conference call later this morning – the first conducted by Tomé since being named CEO in March.See more from Benzinga  * Postal Service reaches Agreement On Billion Treasury Loan  * Carriers May Face Penalties, Shutdowns Under Virginia COVID-19 Regulations  * The 'Messy Middle': How Trucking Will Get To An Electric Future(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-30	2020-07-30 12:51:44	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	US STOCKS-Futures sink as data shows historic slump	Wall Street's main indexes were set to open lower on Thursday after data confirmed the economy suffered its steepest contraction since the Great Depression in the second quarter, adding to gloom from job losses and a resurgence in coronavirus cases.  Jobless claims numbers also showed another rise in the latest week, adding to signs that the momentum of economic recovery has slowed, especially in southern and western states.  The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged the surge in cases was likely stalling recovery, while pledging to support the economy as long as necessary, guaranteeing it will continue to flood the financial system with cheap funds and lifting Wall Street's three main indexes late in the session.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-futures-sink-data-125144018.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-30	2020-07-30 12:06:43	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Spikes 11% In Pre-Market As Quarterly Profit Surprises Investors	Shares in UPS (UPS) are soaring 11% in Thursday’s pre-market trading after the package delivery giant’s second-quarter earnings crushed analysts’ estimates as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated demand for online deliveries.The stock is currently rising to $137.15 as UPS reported adjusted earnings of $2.13 per share, beating the $1.07 a share forecast by analysts. Revenue rose 13.4% to $20.5 billion, which is about $3.5 billion above the analyst consensus.“Our results were better than we expected, driven in part by the changes in demand that emerged from the pandemic, including a surge in residential volume, COVID-19 related healthcare shipments and strong outbound demand from Asia,” said UPS CEO Carol Tomé.  “UPSers are keeping the world moving during this time of need and I want to thank our team for their hard work and outstanding efforts to serve our customers, our communities and each other.”In the year-to-date period cash from operations stood at $5.9 billion with adjusted free cash flow of $3.9 billion. UPS did not provide any guidance on its revenue and diluted earnings per share outlook due to the uncertainty around the timing and pace of the economic recovery.“Moving forward we are focusing on efficiency and revenue quality to improve U.S. operating margins longer term,” said UPS chief financial officer Brian Newman.  “Our liquidity and cash position remain strong, allowing us to invest in enabling capabilities through this time of unprecedented business disruption.”Earlier this month, Credit Suisse analyst Allison Landry reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $118 price target, saying that the company is at an “existential crossroads”.&quot;UPS is at an existential crossroads with COVID having pulled forward what was initially expected to be 8-10 years of B2C/residential mix into just a few short months,” Landry wrote in a note to investors. “The margin erosion from higher cost B2C has long been problematic - amplified by the massive upswing in capex required to more efficiently handle these volumes - but the good news for UPS, in our view, is that the profound pandemic-driven acceleration in mix will force a permanent, structural pricing tailwind in the domestic parcel market.&quot;Meanwhile, the rest of the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 4 Buy ratings versus 4 Hold ratings. With shares up 5.8% this year, the $118.17 average price target implies 4.5% downside potential over the next 12 months.

Statements other than those of current or historical fact, and all statements accompanied by terms such as “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “estimate,” “assume,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “target,” “plan,” and variations thereof, and similar terms, are intended to be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made subject to the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws pursuant to Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.From time to time, we also include forward-looking statements in other publicly disclosed materials. Such statements may relate to our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results, and give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made.Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience, present expectations or anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, include, but are not limited to: uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, financial condition, financial results and financial position, our customers and suppliers, and on the global economy; changes in general economic conditions, in the U.S. or internationally; significant competition on a local, regional, national and international basis; changes in our relationships with our significant customers; changes in the complex and stringent regulation in the U.S. and internationally (including tax laws and regulations); increased physical or data security requirements that may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies; legal, regulatory or market responses to global climate change; results of negotiations and ratifications of labor contracts; strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns by our employees; the effects of changing prices of energy, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and interruptions in supplies of these commodities; changes in exchange rates or interest rates; uncertainty from the expected discontinuance of LIBOR and transition to any other interest rate benchmark; our ability to maintain the image of our brand; breaches in data security; disruptions to the Internet or our technology infrastructure; interruptions in or impacts on our business from natural or man-made events or disasters including terrorist attacks, epidemics or pandemics; our ability to accurately forecast our future capital investment needs; exposure to changing economic, political and social developments in international and emerging markets; changes in business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions that may result in substantial impairment of our assets; increases in our expenses or funding obligations relating to employee health, retiree health and/or pension benefits; potential additional tax liabilities in the U.S. or internationally; the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our transformation initiatives; cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results; our ability to manage insurance and claims expenses; and other risks discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and subsequently filed reports. You should consider the limitations on, and risks associated with, forward-looking statements and not unduly rely on the accuracy of information contained in such forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances, changes in expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events after the date of those statements, except as required by law.Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles (&quot;GAAP&quot;) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including &quot;adjusted&quot; compensation and benefits, operating profit, operating margin, other income (expense), income before income taxes, income tax expense, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share. We also supplement the reporting of revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit with non-GAAP measures that exclude the period-over-period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities.  Additionally, we periodically disclose free cash flow, free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions, and capital expenditures including principal repayments of capital lease obligations. The equivalent measures determined in accordance with GAAP are also referred to as &quot;reported&quot; or &quot;unadjusted.”We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide additional meaningful information to assist users of our financial statements in understanding our financial results and cash flows and assessing our ongoing performance, because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying operations and may provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses.  These non-GAAP measures are used internally by management for business unit operating performance analysis, business unit resource allocation and in connection with incentive compensation award determinations.Costs Related to Restructuring Programs; Transformation Strategy CostsNon-GAAP operating profit, operating margin, pre-tax income, net income and earnings per share exclude the impact of costs related to restructuring programs, including Transformation strategy costs.  We believe this provides a useful comparison of year-to-year financial performance without considering the short-term impact of restructuring costs.Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Hedging ActivitiesCurrency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit. The derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period (including the period over period impact of foreign currency hedging activities). The difference between the current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations.Impact of Changes in Pension Discount RatesNon-GAAP pension discount rate-neutral operating profit excludes the period over period impact of discount rate changes on pension service cost. Effective January 1, 2020, we began evaluating our segments using pension discount rate-neutral operating profit in addition to our current segment operating profit measure.Pension discount rate-neutral operating profit is calculated by discounting the value of benefits attributable to employee service in the current period utilizing the prior year discount rate applicable to each of our company-sponsored defined benefit plans. The difference between this derived amount and the current period reported service cost is the period over period impact of pension discount rate movements on operating profit.Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Capital ExpendituresWe believe free cash flow, free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions and free cash flow adjusted for principal repayments of finance lease obligations are important indicators of how much cash is generated by regular business operations and we use them as a measure of incremental cash available to invest in our business, meet our debt obligations and return cash to shareowners. Additionally, we believe that adjusting capital expenditures for principal repayments of finance lease obligations more appropriately reflects the overall cash that we have invested in capital assets. We calculate free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, and plus or minus the net changes in finance receivables and other investing activities. Free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions adds back any discretionary pension contributions made during the period. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Income Statement  (in millions, except

2020-07-20	2020-07-20 15:51:12	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	The 'Messy Middle': How Trucking Will Get To An Electric Future	OEMs, logistics companies tout varied technology solutions on the way to a zero-emissions future.The metaphors flowed freely during a recent panel discussion as trucking experts argued for a multifaceted approach to low-carbon fuel adoption.&quot;We call the next couple of decades ‘the messy middle,'&quot; said Mike Roeth, executive director for the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE.) While an electric truck future is achievable by around 2040, Roeth said, the interim period will feature an array of sustainable technologies ranging from diesel hybrids to renewable natural gas.Laurie Counsel, global environmental relations director for Cummins, the engine manufacturer, said trucking as an industry is often considered &quot;a one-trick pony.&quot;  &quot;But now there are so many exciting things happening,&quot; Counsel said. &quot;We just need to match the right technology with the duty cycle.&quot;An Incremental ApproachCounsel and Roeth were among the speakers who shared their experiences and insights during a webinar, Real-life Lessons for Trucking's Clean Future, focused on how trucking and logistics companies are incrementally adopting clean fuel technologies that reduce tailpipe pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions.Patrick Browne, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) director of global sustainability, said the pandemic has put even greater pressure on transportation and logistics companies, and as a result the logistics giant is seeing a surge in volume. Yet UPS is doubling down on its effort to meet its greenhouse gas emissions goals: slashing emissions from global ground operations 12% by 2025 from a 2015 baseline.To help meet this goal, UPS is relying on two levers in the vehicle division. By 2025, 40% of all fuel sources will come from alternatives to gas or diesel, with the proportion today clocking in at 24%. Noting that electric alternatives are &quot;not there&quot; for medium-duty vehicles, Browne said UPS has invested over $1 billion in compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles and fueling infrastructure over the past decade, with more and more of the fuel coming from renewable natural gas, also known as biomethane.  Produced from the breakdown of organic material in landfills, wastewater and farms, biomethane is considered a carbon-neutral fuel and in some cases even carbon negative — meaning it takes more carbon out of the environment than it produces.In 2019, 25% of UPS natural gas deployment was renewable, and the company is on track to reach 50% penetration by next year, according to Browne.The second strategy is to invest in available electric and hydrogen vehicles as the fleet turns over. To that end, UPS recently ordered 10,000 electric vans from Arrival, a U.K. manufacturer.&quot;We're preparing  for a polyfuel, polytechnology future,&quot; Browne said. &quot;You can have short-term [emissions] reductions while planning for a net zero future.&quot;Science-Based Emissions Reduction StrategiesCounsel touched on several consumer and product strategies that fall under Cummins' new sustainability plan, Planet 2050, an effort to meet or exceed the greenhouse gas emissions goals in the United Nations Paris agreement on climate change. One tactic is a continuation of a current goal to partner with customers after the sale of the product, ensuring the Cummins engine has the greatest fuel economy. The engine maker is also using &quot;sector decarbonization data&quot; for both transportation and power generation to derive a &quot;science-based target&quot; of reducing absolute lifetime greenhouse gas emissions from its newly sold products by 25%, Counsel said.&quot;It's a little scary,&quot; she admitted, &quot;because we are not in total control of that scenario. It all comes down to customer preference, market acceptance, speed of regulation and advocacy.  &quot;But we wanted to do our part and the math told us what our part was, as we all move forward to a path that leads to zero emissions.&quot;Policy LeversClean truck headlines in the past week have focused on a landmark rule California approved on June 25  that will require manufacturers to sell an increasing number of electric trucks starting in 2024.  But there are other regulations that can help nudge the market to cleaner fuels, the panel said.Browne pointed to California's low carbon fuel standard, which incentivizes users to use clean fuels. The regulation will allow UPS to double its use of renewable natural gas in the state next year, he saidTax policy is another driver, he said. Because natural gas isn't as dense as diesel, UPS has to buy 1.7 gallons of CNG for every one gallon of diesel.&quot;Because we were using more we were paying more taxes,&quot; Browne explained. &quot;We worked with a lot of states to offset taxes so different types of fuels were taxed differently.&quot;Regulations and incentives should target short-, medium- and long-term solutions, according to Roeth, with infrastructure and funding for fleets to buy the trucks taking priority.&quot;We need to be able to jog, walk and crawl. In some cases we're crawling,&quot; he said. &quot;In other cases we are farther along.&quot;Related Stories:Electric, natural gas trucking sectors duel over who deserves funding — nowCalifornia approves world's first electric truck sales mandateCalifornia to fleets: Buy those electric trucksClick here for more FreightWaves articles by Linda Baker.See more from Benzinga  * The Daily Dash: Freight Volumes, Capacity And Earnings Remain Strong  * Marten, Heartland Stock Prices Get Boost After Strong Quarters  * Solving The Recurring Problem Of Mobile Workforce Optimization(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Take Your Profits in FedEx Stock and Don’t Look Back	With many brick-and-mortar stores closed in recent months thanks to the novel coronavirus, shipping companies like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) are seeing increased traffic and profits. FDX stock is up 20% in the last month.Source: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com But I'm not looking for this ride to last. In fact, FedEx is living on borrowed time. Investors would be wise to take their profits now, before Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reinstates its Amazon Shipping program and flexes its muscle once again.It's only a matter of time before the bubble of FDX stock pops.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips FedEx's Earnings at a GlanceTwo weeks ago, FedEx reported fiscal fourth-quarter 2020 earnings that sent the stock up 9%. Its revenue came in at $17.4 billion, which beat analysts' average estimate of $16.49 billion.Its earnings per share, excluding certain items, were $2.53, which was more than $1 per share better than analysts'  mean estimate of $1.52.  * 10 Work-From-Home Stocks That Are Beating the Pandemic The company said FedEx Ground's business grew 25% year-over-year. While the unit's business-to-business deliveries fell sharply because of the shutdowns, its business-to-consumer deliveries were more than enough to make up the difference.FedEx reported that it had made tweaks to improve its profit margins and offset higher costs in Q4.UBS analysts noted that FedEx's Q4 results had cleared &quot;a low bar,&quot; as expectations for its earnings were modest.  According to the firm, the company demonstrated that &quot;the spread in profitability between their B2C and B2B business is likely not as wide as perceived.&quot;FedEx scored an earnings beat, but expectations were so low that the win isn't that impressive. FDX Stock Is on Borrowed TimeThe shadow that falls over FDX stock comes from Amazon, the  e-commerce giant that seemingly has its hands in everything.Amazon is by far the biggest e-commerce player in the nation, with $280.5 billion of revenue last year. And it has its own delivery platform, bypassing FedEx and UPS (NYSE:UPS).Despite its incredible size and reach, even Amazon found itself overwhelmed in the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak. The giant's e-commerce sales exploded because consumers couldn't go to brick-and-mortar stores.Amazon hired 175,000 new workers to keep up with the demand, and it was forced to suspend its Amazon Shipping program. The pilot program let merchants who did their own warehousing also ship directly to customers, but it covered only a few major markets,Covid-19 cases are overwhelming many southern states and California now, but there is increasing pressure for states to reopen their doors as soon as possible to get the economy moving again.And happily, we may be closer to a vaccine than previously thought. Moderna (NASDAQ:MDRA) announced that its Covid-19 vaccine, which it's developing in partnership with the National Institutes of Health, performed well in a Phase 1 trial. The company is now moving on to Phase 3 tests.Remember, there's no love lost between Amazon and FedEx. The companies severed their air and ground relationships last year, and things have been tense between them ever since.Amazon barred companies enrolled in its &quot;Seller Fulfilled Prime&quot; program from using FedEx Ground and Home Delivery services. FedEx, meanwhile, purportedly told its employees not to order anything on Amazon's platform, even for personal use.Amazon won't even think twice about cutting into FedEx's business in the future.Amazon is too strong of a company to leave money on the table. You can bet that it will restart its Amazon Shipping program as quickly as possible, and that it will expand across the country as soon as Jeff Bezos & Co. determine that the investment is worth the return.That's going to take a bite out of FedEx. The Bottom Line on FDX StockDon't be fooled by FedEx's recent surge. The numbers are artificially inflated by Wall Street's overblown enthusiasm over its  Q4 earnings and Amazon's temporary suspension of Amazon Shipping.Remember, the U.S. economy hummed along nicely for all of 2019. And in that same period, FDX stock fell more than 6%.That is more indicative of FedEx's growth prospects once Covid-19 vaccines are launched and Amazon restarts its pilot shipping program.If you've been holding FDX stock, then it's time to take your profits  and move on to better opportunities. Shorting the shares could also be worthwhile.Patrick Sanders is a freelance writer and editor in Maryland, and from 2015 to 2019 was head of the investment advice section at U.S. News & World Report.

Analyst Weighs In	Unlike other industries, the coronavirus’ impact on parcel delivery services has been more nuanced. The drop in volume for the traditionally more profitable B2B segment has been countered by the massive increase in B2C deliveries, which are typically more margin tight. So much so, these companies are finding it difficult to meet demand.This is true of package delivery giant United Parcel (UPS). In normal times, the mix between B2C and B2B is evenly split, but by the end of March, the pandemic resulted in the B2C segment boasting 70% of delivery volume.In a recent note to clients, Credit Suisse analyst Allison Landry ponders how the increasing volume in a less profitable segment impacts UPS.Landry said, “UPS is at an existential crossroads with COVID having pulled forward what was initially expected to be 8-10 years of B2C/residential mix into just a few short months… The margin erosion from higher cost B2C has long been problematic – amplified by the massive upswing in capex required to more efficiently handle these volumes – but the good news, in our view, is that the profound pandemic-driven acceleration in mix will force a permanent, structural pricing tailwind in the domestic parcel market.”The other good news, according to Landry, is United Parcel’s recent appointment of new CEO Carol Tomé. The ex-Home Depot CFO brings with her extensive experience, a proven track record, as well as a reputation for improving performance. Tomé was instrumental in making Home Depot one of the best performing retailers following the 2008-2009 financial crisis.Tomé will have her work cut out for her, as she seeks to boost the company’s profit margins. Not least, the new CEO must improve the pricing structure, deal with Amazon’s impact (both as a customer and competitor) and placate its drivers, who were disappointed with the two-tier payment structure established by former CEO David Abney.For now, Landry’s Neutral rating stays as is, although her price target for UPS got a lift – boosted from $101 to $118. The new figure implies modest upside potential of 4%. (To watch Landry’s track record, click here)Landry’s rating has the rest of the Street’s backing. UPS’ Hold consensus rating is based on 6 Buy ratings, 7 Holds and 3 Sells. However, the average price target is more pessimistic than the Credit Suisse analyst’s, and at $102.62, suggests shares could decline nearly 10% over the next 12 months.

2020-07-13	2020-07-13 19:16:44	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Workhorse Gets Jolt For Zero-Emissions Electric Vans	Workhorse Group Inc (NASDAQ: WKHS) can sell its zero-emission C-Series electric delivery vans in all 50 states after a California ruling buttressed a federal finding in the company's favor.Now, Workhorse just has to build the vans.The Cincinnati-based manufacturer is building a couple of trucks a day at its Union City, Indiana plant. The goal is 300 to 400 vans this year. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) and DHL have placed orders for about 1,100 vans.The California Air Resources Board (CARB) issued an executive order to Workhorse valid for an unspecified year. CARB's website does not show the order yet. Workhorse's previous E-Series electric van received a certification for 2018. Workhorse stopped making the E-Series vans to focus on developing the composite-body C-Series vans with cargo capacities of 400 to 1,200 cubic feet. Initially, it is making 650- and 1,000-cubic-foot vans.Monday's news drove Workhorse shares higher. They are up 600% over the last 90 days. Most public electric truck makers' shares are surging, led by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), which was up more than 7% at $1,664 in midday trading.Incentivized Sales Ahead The executive order from CARB eases Workhorse's inclusion in California's Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (HVIP). The state uses proceeds from Cap and Trade fines to incentivize buyers of near-zero and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). Since 2009, California has issued 3,165 vouchers worth nearly $366 million for ZEVs. Workhorse received a certificate of conformity from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in March. The CARB order is important because California and 13 other states require more than just EPA compliance for vehicles to be sold in those states.&quot;Obtaining this Executive Order from CARB is another milestone achievement for Workhorse and for the electric vehicle industry at large,&quot; CEO Duane Hughes said, adding that he expects  HVIP to be &quot; a major growth stimulus as more voucher funds become available in the future.&quot;CARB's recent Advanced Clean Truck regulation for the first time requires commercial vehicle manufacturers to meet quotas for selling electric vehicles, beginning at 9% in 2024 and moving to exclusively electric trucks by 2045.Click for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.Related articles:Workhorse looks to scale electric truck productionWhat happens in California doesn't stay in CaliforniaCalifornia regulators to fleets: Buy those electric trucksSee more from Benzinga  * Electric Truck Maker Rivian Secures .5B In New Financing  * Electric Truck Story Stocks Drive Market Enthusiasm  * U.S. Airlines Cancel Hong Kong Flights Over Crew Testing(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

UPS Partners With Mexican Firm For International Shipping	United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) and Estafeta have announced a partnership to provide Mexican businesses with international shipping services.The new agreement will help small and midsize businesses (SMEs) in Mexico reach more than 220 countries and territories around the world, as well as customers in the United States within one business day.&quot;The future is about nimble networks and strategic partnerships,&quot; said Nando Cesarone, president of UPS International, in a release. &quot;The timely collaboration leverages UPS's smart global logistics network and Estafeta's established presence in Mexico.&quot;Cesarone added that the new partnership will benefit from the newly implemented United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).&quot;As the (USMCA) comes into force to simplify trade for a refreshed North American trade bloc, we stand ready as growth partners to further streamline established supply chains – and open up new cross-border opportunities,&quot; Cesarone said.Estafeta is a Mexico City-based company and one of the largest courier, express and parcel (CEP) firms in the country.

2020-07-02	2020-07-02 17:00:52	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Boeing Quietly Pulls Plug on the 747, Closing Era of Jumbo Jets	(Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. hasn’t told employees, but the company is pulling the plug on its hulking 747 jumbo jet, ending a half-century run for the twin-aisle pioneer.The last 747-8 will roll out of a Seattle-area factory in about two years, a decision that hasn’t been reported but can be teased out from subtle wording changes in financial statements, people familiar with the matter said.It’s a moment that aviation enthusiasts long have dreaded, signaling the end of the double-decker, four-engine leviathans that shrank the world. Airbus SE is already preparing to build the last A380 jumbo, after the final convoy of fuselage segments rumbled to its Toulouse, France, plant last month.Yet for all their popularity with travelers, the final version of the 747 and Europe’s superjumbo never caught on commercially as airlines turned to twin-engine aircraft for long-range flights. While Boeing’s hump-nosed freighters will live on, the fast-disappearing A380 risks going down as an epic dud.The grand jetliners also face another indignity: The Covid-19 pandemic threatens to leave their manufacturers scrounging to find buyers for the last jumbos built.“As it turned out, the number of routes for which you need an ultralarge aircraft are incredibly few,” said Sash Tusa, an analyst with Agency Partners.Boeing’s “Queen of the Skies” debuted in 1970, an audacious bet that transformed travel but almost bankrupted the company. Passenger versions boasted a spiral staircase to a luxurious upstairs lounge. Freighter models featured a hinged nose that flipped open to load everything from cars to oil-drilling gear. The 747 went on to rack up 1,571 orders over the decades -- second among wide-body jets only to Boeing’s 777.The millennial-era A380 could haul as many as 853 travelers and reflected Europe’s lofty aerospace ambition. But by the time it arrived in 2007, airlines were already tilting to smaller planes that burned less fuel.Boeing correctly anticipated the trend with the twin-engine 777 and the 787 Dreamliner. With prodding from Joe Sutter, a famed engineer who’d led the original 747 program, the planemaker decided to develop a relatively inexpensive upgrade of the four-engine plane to steal sales from the A380.The strategy would have been successful, had the 747-8 not been bedeviled by early mismanagement, blowing its budget and deadlines, said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with Teal Group.The Chicago-based company has lost about $40 million for each 747 since 2016, when it slowed production to a trickle, making just six jets a year, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu estimated. All told, Boeing has recorded $4.2 billion in accounting charges for the 747-8, which has been kept alive as a freighter. The 747 notched its last order as a passenger jet in 2017 -- for Air Force One.Boeing’s jumbo freighters will continue to ply the skies for decades after production stops, said Aboulafia. But he’s dropped the passenger-only A380 from his forecasts.“It’s going to have the shortest lifespan of any type in history,” Aboulafia predicted. “I’d be shocked if there’s still an A380 in service in 2030.”Airbus disagreed. “We will see the A380 continue flying for many years,” the planemaker said by email.But the coronavirus pandemic is hastening the end of the behemoths as people movers. With travel not expected to fully recover until mid-decade, airlines are culling aging jetliners and four-engine jumbos from fleets to limit spending. About 91% of 747s and 97% of A380s are parked, Credit Suisse estimated last month.Air France, Lufthansa, and Qatar Airways are among carriers weighing whether to ground their A380s permanently or are preparing to do so. Airbus has just nine of the planes still be delivered. All but one of them are tagged for Emirates Airline, the largest A380 operator, which is considering whether to scrap its final five on order.The A380 has cost Airbus about 20 billion euros ($23 billion), breaking even or generating profits for only a three-year stretch starting in 2015, Agency Partners estimated. With just 251 aircraft sold over the program’s life, the planemaker never achieved the efficiency that comes with manufacturing at large scale, Tusa said.Boeing, meanwhile, had been preparing for years to wind down the 747 program, and its sales team has been sounding out customer interest in a potential freighter version of the 777X. If such a model goes forward, it would bolster flagging sales of the largest twin-engine aircraft in the company’s lineup.The telling omen that Boeing had written the iconic 747’s final chapter came in financial filings earlier this year. Gone was any indication that the company would continue to “evaluate the viability” of the program, standard phrasing it had previously used.“At a build rate of half an airplane per month, the 747-8 program has more than two years of production ahead of it in order to fulfill our current customer commitments. We will continue to make the right decisions to keep the production line healthy and meet customer needs,” Boeing said for this story.The planemaker has just 15 unfilled orders for the 747 -- all freighters. A dozen of them are headed to United Parcel Service Inc., and the fate of the rest is unclear, part of a dispute with Russia’s Volga-Dnepr Group.Boeing has approached the U.S. courier and other potential customers about taking the three planes, people familiar with the matter said. The planemaker and UPS declined to comment. Volga-Dnepr didn’t respond to requests for comment.UPS in May agreed to take a 747 that Volga had ordered. “Working with Boeing, we saw an opportunity to bring another 747-8 online this year in time for our peak shipping season,” the courier said.Ultimately, Boeing’s decision on the 747 boiled down to resource allocation, said George Dimitroff, who leads valuations at aviation consultant Cirium. Could the assembly line floor space be better used on another airplane, such as the 767, which shares a bay in Boeing’s Everett, Washington, factory?“If you’re building half an airplane a month, it’s probably not your most profitable program,” Dimitroff said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-quietly-pulls-plug-747-170052471.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-01	2020-07-01 14:21:43	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	P/E Ratio Insights for United Parcel Service	In the current session, United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS) is trading at $117.00, after a 5.27% spike. Over the past month, the stock increased by 12.91%, and in the past year, by 14.26%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently under from its 52 week high by 6.63%.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 18.28 in the Integrated Freight & Logistics industry, United Parcel Service Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 22.51. Shareholders might be inclined to think that United Parcel Service Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It's also possible that the stock is overvalued.P/E ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance.

2020-06-26	2020-06-26 16:36:11	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Buys Driverless Startup Zoox, Cites Ride-Hailing Goal	(Bloomberg) -- When news broke last month that Amazon.com Inc. was interested in buying Zoox Inc., observers assumed the e-commerce giant was looking to automate its delivery fleet. After all, Amazon already invested in an electric truck maker and is a major buyer of everything from planes to diesel vehicles.But in a statement on Friday confirming its acquisition of the autonomous vehicle startup, Amazon touted Zoox for its ride-hailing ambitions. Ride hailing? Amazon?“You say, does it make sense?” said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner vice president who tracks the auto industry. “Well, does it make sense that the package delivery company sells me streaming movies?”Zoox is a corporate investment, not an acquisition to be folded into one of Amazon’s existing businesses, the company says. Aicha Evans, Zoox’s chief executive officer, and Jesse Levinson, co-founder and chief technology officer, will continue to lead the company as a standalone business.“Zoox is working to imagine, invent, and design a world-class autonomous ride-hailing experience,” said Jeff Wilke, the head of Amazon’s worldwide retail business. “We’re excited to help the talented Zoox team to bring their vision to reality in the years ahead.”Amazon’s corporate development team recently told bankers they wanted to look at any autonomous vehicle startup interested in selling, according to a person familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.Amazon shares were little changed Friday morning in New York, while Uber Technologies Inc. fell less than 3% -- in line with the overall market.Terms of the deal, the latest indication of Amazon’s evolution from online bookseller to sprawling conglomerate, were not disclosed. Bloomberg previously reported that Zoox wouldn’t be acquired for less than $1 billion, and on Thursday The Information reported that Amazon was paying more than $1 billion for the startup.Autonomous vehicles have been a target of automakers, Silicon Valley giants and venture capital investors for years. But technical and regulatory hurdles have made getting self-driving cars and trucks on the road a longer slog than boosters had hoped.Founded in 2014, Zoox had outsize ambition and financial backing. It aimed to not only build hardware and software capable of piloting cars, but to design autonomous taxis themselves.The Foster City, California-based startup wanted to build a fully driverless vehicle by this year. However, after a 2018 funding round that valued Zoox at $3.2 billion, the board voted to oust Tim Kentley-Klay as CEO. He criticized the move, saying directors were “optimizing for a little money in hand at the expense of profound progress.”The company last year indicated it was seeking investors and potential strategic partners, a situation made more urgent by the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to layoffs that Zoox characterized as temporary.In its statement, Amazon highlighted Zoox’s “ground-up vehicle” that “focuses on the ride-hailing customer.”Despite its challenges, Zoox was one among a few independent companies working on credible autonomous vehicle technology, said Ramsey, the Gartner analyst. “Amazon is all of a sudden real close to being its own automaker,” he said.The company could integrate future ride-hailing services into its Prime membership program, Ramsey added. And despite Amazon’s assertion that it was interested in Zoox because of its ambitions in ride-hailing –- already a fiercely a contested market –- Ramsey said Amazon would probably consider using the autonomous technology in delivery vehicles.Bulking up in driverless technology represents an expansion of Amazon’s already sprawling interests in transportation and logistics. The company, which used to rely on delivery partners like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. to move packages from its warehouses to customers, in the last several years has invested heavily in its own capacity to move goods, acquiring planes, vans and long-haul trailers.Seattle-based Amazon has also invested in delivery drones -- though it didn’t meet the goal CEO Jeff Bezos set of having them flying packages to customers by 2018 -- as well as sidewalk-crawling robots and autonomous carts.Last year, Amazon invested along with Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital in Aurora Innovation Inc., a self-driving startup led by the former heads of Google’s driverless car project and Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot team. The company has also backed Rivian Automotive Inc., the electric pickup and SUV maker, and emerged as its biggest buyer, pledging to acquire 100,000 delivery vans designed in partnership with Amazon.(Updates with Amazon interest in other automonous vehicle startups)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-buys-driverless-startup-zoox-161110360.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-17	2020-06-17 20:48:08	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Deutsche Bank Sees Some Winners As Earnings Season Approaches	In a report to clients, Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB) analyst Amit Mehrotra views the outlook for transportation equities as &quot;favorable&quot; heading into the second quarter earnings season.He said transportation demand bottomed in late April with a slow but steady recovery since. Citing recent conversations with management teams at a dozen transportation companies and a sequentially improving demand backdrop, Mehrotra initiated favorable &quot;catalyst calls&quot; on Werner Enterprises (NASDAQ: WERN), XPO Logistics (NYSE: XPO) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS).The firm uses catalyst calls when an analyst has a high-conviction belief a stock will outperform or underperform the market over a time period of at least two weeks and not greater than three months.Trucking calls The catalyst call &quot;buy&quot; rating on Werner stems from Mehrotra's belief the company will report a &quot;sizable beat&quot; when it releases second quarter 2020 earnings. He raised his earnings per share (EPS) estimate $0.05 to $0.51, significantly ahead of the $0.37 consensus estimate. He believes weakness in the company's one-way truckload (TL) segment was offset by improving trends in its dedicated unit, which has guaranteed capacity commitments with retailers that have seen demand accelerate during the pandemic.Further, Mehrotra said weakness in the one-way TL market, which has less stringent contractual agreements, during April was followed by recovery in May and thus far into June. He sees the potential for modest year-over-year improvement in equipment utilization and a lower than expected decline in revenue per total mile in Werner's one-way segment during the quarter.Werner's dedicated business represents approximately 60% of its TL transportation revenue and nearly half of the company's total revenue.The near-term expectations aren't as rosy for the nation's largest TL carrier, Knight-Swift Transportation (NYSE: KNX). &quot;We're bracing for a weak 2Q from KNX...but exit rate is most important and possible reinstatement of guidance likely to support shares,&quot; said Mehrotra. He believes Knight-Swift saw an &quot;extremely weak April&quot; given Knight's spot market exposure (roughly 10%) and Swift's &quot;disproportionate&quot; retail apparel and automotive customer base. He lowered his second quarter EPS estimate $0.04 to $0.32, a penny under consensus, and noted &quot;potential downside risk&quot; to the revised number.However, Mehrotra is more focused on how trends progressed through the end of the quarter versus the overall headline number. He thinks positive commentary regarding the exit rate of the quarter and reinstatement of the company's earnings guidance, which he expects to reveal a &quot;big second half rebound&quot; could buoy the shares. He maintained his buy rating on Knight-Swift's shares, pointing to improving demand and the expectation that TL capacity will continue to come out of the market.On the logistics and less-than-truckload (LTL) fronts, he's positive on XPO and Saia (NASDAQ: SAIA).He expects XPO to &quot;meet or slightly exceed&quot; consensus in the quarter. He views the adoption of ecommerce solutions by retailers as beneficial to XPO's growth outlook. He sees the company's logistics unit as a beneficiary of the growing need for ecommerce fulfillment centers, noting the segment's warehouse scale and expertise in automation.Mehrotra's expecting a big second quarter from Saia with EPS of $0.94 compared to the consensus estimate of $0.86. He believes the company's cost initiatives during the pandemic will help offset the likely revenue declines the carrier reported during its mid-quarter update.Saia has cut workforce hours by 16% and implemented a &quot;shared sacrifice&quot; structure, meaning hourly employees rotate their time off. This has been done to maximize hours per employee and minimize furloughs, allowing it to be nimble and bring employees back quickly as demand turns. The company also has a large linehaul optimization program in the works.He maintained his buy rating on the carrier.UPS and Norfolk Southern Mehrotra made a couple of other near-term calls in the earnings preview report. He implemented a catalyst call buy rating on UPS based on the expectation of a more than 20% earnings beat during the second quarter, hence his $1.30 EPS estimate compared to consensus of $1.06.He believes investors are &quot;overly (albeit understandably) negative&quot; on the freight mix shift from B2B to B2C during the pandemic. He believes weights per package and shipping distances increased sequentially in the second quarter as lockdown mandates eased. He also believes the company has become accustomed to the higher level of demand that has become the new norm and that new CEO Carol Tomé will bring a renewed focus to improving financial returns.Mehrotra initiated a catalyst call &quot;sell&quot; on Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) based on his expectation for second quarter EPS to decline 55% year-over-year. He's forecasting a 1,000-basis-point decline in the railroad's operating ratio on a 30% decline in revenue with operating expenses declining only 20%. Mehrotra believes the railroads will see revenue decline 22% on average with earnings down 33% in the second quarter.He expects Norfolk Southern to report the &quot;worst&quot; trends out of the railroads. His EPS estimate of $1.24 sits well below the consensus estimate of $1.62.In total, Mehrotra made very modest EPS changes to the transportation companies he follows. 2020 forecasts were lowered 2% on average and 2021 numbers were cut only 1%.Shares of WERN (+2.3%), XPO (+3.4%) and UPS (+2.5%) were all higher in midday trading. Shares of NSC (-0.1%) are off slightly on the day.See more from Benzinga  * Truck Crossings Have The Best Week Since US-Canada Border Closed  * Airlines Seek Government Help To Survive Winter Doldrums  * Senate Bill Targets FAA Certification Process Used For 737 MAX(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-06-07	2020-06-07 16:51:07	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Notable Insider Buys This Past Week: HP, UPS And More	* Insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors.  * Some insiders took advantage of a secondary offering last week.  * Two chief executives also have stepped up to the buy window.Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly during periods of uncertainty.Insiders continued to add shares despite overall market volatility and global economic gloom. The following are some of the most noteworthy insider purchases reported in the past week.Pinnacle Financial Partners Pinnacle Financial Partners Inc (NASDAQ: PNFP) saw an executive and three directors take advantage of a secondary offering and purchase 116,000 depositary shares altogether. At a per-share price of $25, that totaled $2.9 million. Note that two of those directors also bought shares back in March.Shares of this Nashville-based bank holding company popped more than 16% in last week's trading to end at $47.14 each. The share price is up over 39% since its year-to-date low during the pandemic sell-off in March. Yet it is still more than 26% lower than at the beginning of the year.UPS United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) CEO Carol Tome stepped up to the buy window recently. She picked up 10,100 shares of this Atlanta-based company for an average of $99.33 each. That cost her more than $1 million. Tome's stake was listed as 13,036 shares.This buy came about the same time UPS added new fees to manage the surge in e-commerce shipments. The stock rose nearly 7% last week, a bit more than the Dow Jones industrials, and closed most recently at $106.65 per share. It is now more than 21% higher than the year-to-date low in March.HP CEO Enrique Lores and another director together purchased 30,500 HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) shares last week. Share prices ranged from $15.03 to $15.85, and the total for these transactions came to around $464,300. Lores' stake was last seen at 397,150 shares.Goldman Sachs recently listed HP as an oversold S&P 500 stock. Shares ended last week up almost 15% to $17.41, well above the purchase prices mentioned above. The share price is almost 21% higher since its year-to-date low in March, and it is approaching its consensus price target of $17.69.See also: Bulls And Bears Of The Week: Gilead, Shopify, Tesla And MoreIn addition, note that there was some insider buying at CME Group Inc (NASDAQ: CME) and General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) last week as well.At the time of this writing, the author had no position in the mentioned equities.Keep up with all the latest breaking news and trading ideas by following Benzinga on Twitter.See more from Benzinga  * Barron's Picks And Pans: Sysco, Twitter, Zoom Video And More  * Barron's Picks And Pans: Cheniere Energy, Delta Air Lines, Extended Stay And More(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-06-04	2020-06-04 16:39:20	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEx Puts Surcharges On Several Types Of Packages	Less than two weeks after United Parcel Service, Inc. (NASDAQ: UPS) posted surcharges on all types of delivery, FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) has followed suit.In a late announcement on June 3, FedEx rolled out several different types of surcharges, depending on the type of shipment. The surcharges go into effect on Monday, June 8.A temporary surcharge of 40 cents per package was put on FedEx SmartPost packages. FedEx SmartPost is what is known as &quot;postal injection,&quot; wherein FedEx has the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) make the final delivery. &quot;FedEx SmartPost offers a customized solution – we pick up (or accept drop shipments), provide line haul and deliver your packages to a USPS facility for final delivery by a postal carrier,&quot; describing the service on the FedEx website. FedEx Smart Post is a contract-only service. FedEx also is applying a $30 per package surcharge on oversized deliveries during peak times. FedEx defines oversize as a package that exceeds 96 inches in length or 130 inches in length and girth combined. The third surcharge is a peak residential delivery charge of 30 cents per package. But that applies only to what FedEx calls &quot;enterprise level&quot; customers that meet certain criteria. The first is that in any given week, they ship 40,000 parcels via FedEx Express residential and FedEx Ground residential, excluding SmartPost and FedEx One, and second, their volume in that week is more than 120% of their average weekly volume from February. The Deutsche Bank transportation team led by Amit Mehortra, commenting on the move in the company's daily transportation email, noted that the growth of e-commerce &quot;is very positive for FDX (and UPS) revenues, but extremely challenging for profitability because of density challenges on the last mile (i.e. the number of packages per stop in residential deliveries is about one-third of B2B deliveries... driving significantly adverse unit economics). As such we believe this is exactly the right move for both FDX and UPS to partially offset last mile density challenges.&quot;In the note, Deutsche said it calculated that the UPS moves of May 31 amounted to about a 6% increase in shipping costs. They described the FedEx increase as &quot;similar.&quot;The move by UPS on May 31 added 30 cents per package for both UPS Ground Residential and UPS SurePost deliveries. UPS SurePost is like FedEx' SmartPost, with final delivery handled by USPS. The UPS move also added $31.45 per package to large packages. UPS defines large packages with similar dimensions as FedEx.At the time of the UPS announcement, the Deutsche team projected that FedEx would follow suit. &quot;Ultimately, this is exactly the right thing for UPS to do given the...mix and profitability challenges, and we wouldn't be surprised to see FDX following suit shortly.&quot;The move by FedEx had no obvious impact on its stock price. At approximately 10:30 a.m., FedEx stock was down $1.20 to $136.88, a decline of 0.87% on a day when the broader S&P 500 was down to mostly unchanged.See more from Benzinga  * Freightonomics: Are production Numbers Lagging Or Leading The Freight Market's Recovery?  * Decline In US Rail Volumes Slows  * Scheduled Third-Quarter Sailings Sinking(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Amazon Dives Into Weak Aircraft Market, Leases 12 More Planes	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is expanding its air cargo operations with plans to grow its fleet to more than 80 planes as the online retailer takes advantage of a depressed market for aircraft during the pandemic.The company announced Wednesday that it had leased 12 converted Boeing 767-300 passenger planes from Air Transport Services Group Inc. One was added to Amazon’s existing fleet of 70 aircraft last month, and the rest will be delivered in 2021, the Seattle-based company said in a statement.The deal comes as the global aviation industry grapples with severe travel restrictions to limit the spread of Covid-19. Air Transport shares rose as much as 16% on the news.Amazon, meanwhile, is trying to keep up with a booming e-commerce business that has benefited from a surge in online shopping from people sheltering at home. The company unveiled the air cargo service, now called Amazon Air, in 2016 as it looked to rely less on carriers such as United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp.A report released last month by the DePaul University’s Chaddick Institute of Metropolitan Development estimated that Amazon Air may grow to 200 planes in the next seven or eight years, creating a cargo service that could rival UPS. “Amazon Air’s robust expansion makes it one of the biggest stories in the air cargo industry in years,” the study’s authors wrote.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-dives-weak-aircraft-market-205035716.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-27	2020-05-27 21:27:01	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	E-commerce Drives Multi-Pronged Expansion At UPS Airlines	UPS Airlines is expanding in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic that is forcing passenger airlines to shrink fleets and permanently downsize in line with expectations for weak travel demand in the coming years.The United Parcel Service, Inc (NYSE: UPS) fleet has been busy flying charter flights for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other customers ordering desperately needed medical supplies for the COVID-19 response in the U.S. and other countries. But the real driver of extra business and aircraft investment is e-commerce and customers seeking express shipping – factors that were rising in importance well before the pandemic.In the first quarter, Next Day Air shipments in the U.S. grew by 20.5%, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, the company said in its earnings report. In 2019, Next Day Air grew more than 22%.The popularity of online shopping continues to grow and consumers don't want to wait for their orders. Two-day shipping is now standard for many merchants. It remains an open question whether coronavirus stock-outs will force a rethink among companies trying to implement one-day or same-day deliveries. Global e-commerce sales are projected to more than double to $6.5 trillion by 2023, according to Statista. The Boston Consulting Group estimates U.S. e-commerce sales will double too, to $1 trillion, growing at six times the rate of all retail transactions. More than half of that growth is through giant marketplaces such as Rakuten, JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) and Amazon that enable merchants to reach much larger audiences than they could on their own.Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), is UPS' largest customer, accounting for 11.6% of UPS' $74 billion in revenue last. UPS is picking up more business as rival FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) dissolved its U.S. air and ground delivery partnerships with Amazon.And e-commerce continued to boom as the coronavirus pandemic forced large numbers of people to quarantine at home and avoid brick-and-mortar stores.On May 12, UPS Airlines took delivery of a new 767 freighter from Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), one of 22 new, converted or leased 767s the company is adding over five years ending in 2022. Seven days later the all-cargo plane took its first revenue flight, UPS spokesman Jim Mayer said in an email. Boeing's website shows seven unfilled UPS orders for production of 767 freighters.Overall, UPS is expanding its in-house airline by 55 aircraft over that period, equivalent to more than 12 million pounds of payload capacity, including 28 Boeing 747-8 production freighters. Thirteen of the 747-8s are still on back order. The fourth-largest airline in the world currently operates 261 aircraft of its own and utilizes about 200 more through short-term leases and charters, according to a company fact sheet. UPS said in a tweet several days ago that it is adding five MD-11 aircraft — two this year and three in 2021. Mayer confirmed that the planes are used passenger aircraft that are being converted and resold by Boeing.Although the triple-engine planes are less fuel-efficient than many others in service today, they have large cargo payloads and are inexpensive, Mayer explained to The Points Guy blog.E-commerce also propelled Louisville International Airport in Kentucky to fourth place in preliminary rankings of the world's busiest cargo airports, released this month by Airports Council International. UPS's Worldport global package hub is located at the airport, which also serves as home base to UPS Airlines.Airports Council International 2019 ranking of top global cargo airports.The Louisville airport moved up three spots as freight and mail volume increased 6.4% to a record 6.2 billion pounds (2.8 million metric tons). It also moved up to second place, from third, among the largest cargo airports in the U.S. Louisville was one of the few airports to gain cargo business during a year when overall cargo demand fell 3.9%. And cargo volume grew 2.2% in the first quarter, despite economic slowdowns around the world due to the coronavirus.Hong Kong remained the top global airport for cargo, despite a 6.1% decline in volume attributed to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and pro-democracy protests that dampened air travel and flights to the city. Memphis, Tennessee, home to FedEx Express, continued to hold the second spot for cargo, followed by Shanghai.New Chicagoland AirportOnline deliveries are also behind the recent decision to expand the UPS express air network to Gary/Chicago International Airport in Indiana. UPS said it will begin operating there Nov. 2, in time for the peak holiday shipping season, with an Airbus A300 cargo plane that can carry more than 14,000 packages.Each weeknight the aircraft will depart Gary for the UPS Worldport in Louisville and return in the morning with packages sorted from around the world for the northern Indiana and Chicago area.UPS said it expects to employ about 60 people at the airport, including ground handlers, administrative personnel, aircraft maintenance technicians and managers. UPS signed a lease on May 13 for 14,000 square feet of office space in the airport's passenger terminal and a 150,000-square-foot ramp area with enough space to park two A300s.UPS will install a mobile distribution center on the ramp, Mayer tells FreightWaves. The MDC is a poured foundation and a modular metal building with truck doors and a conveyor belt inside for directing packages to the correct vehicle. Mayer said the MDCs give UPS a quick way to add sort capacity and are sometimes used at existing warehouses to expand operating space during the peak holiday season. See more from Benzinga  * Beef And chicken inventories Surge In April  * Weekly Fuel Report: May 25, 2020  * Amazon Is Serious About Self-Driving Technology, Eyeing Multi-Billion Dollar Acquisition(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-05-27	2020-05-27 13:43:27	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Buying Zoox May Save $20 Billion, Put Tesla on Its Heels	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s talks to buy driverless vehicle startup Zoox Inc. has analysts speculating the deal could save the e-commerce giant tens of billions a year and put auto, parcel and ride-hailing companies on their heels.Shipping costs are one of Amazon’s largest expenses and may reach $90 billion in the coming years, Morgan Stanley’s internet, auto and transport analysts wrote in a report Wednesday. An autonomous offering could save the company more than $20 billion annually, they estimate.“Autonomous technology is a natural extension of Amazon’s efforts to build its own third party logistics network,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote. They see the company being a “clear” competitor to the likes of Tesla Inc. and General Motors Co. and the potential for Amazon to compete in ride-sharing and food delivery. United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. also “will have to respond to keep up.”Other companies in the automotive and chip industries have also held talks with Zoox about a potential investment, according to people familiar with the matter. At least one other business besides Amazon has offered to buy the company, they added. Zoox is unlikely to sell for less than the more than $1 billion that it has raised, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private negotiations.“Zoox has been receiving interest in a strategic transaction from multiple parties and has been working with Qatalyst Partners to evaluate such interest,” the startup said Tuesday. It declined to comment on Amazon’s interest. A spokeswoman for Amazon declined to comment.Zoox had outsize ambition and financial backing. The startup wanted to build a fully driverless car by this year. However, after a 2018 funding round that valued Zoox at $3.2 billion, the startup’s board voted to oust Chief Executive Officer Tim Kentley-Klay. The executive criticized the move, saying the directors were “optimizing for a little money in hand at the expense of profound progress.”Dow Jones reported that Amazon is in advanced talks to buy Zoox for less than the $3.2 billion valuation from 2018.Amazon is willing to spend heavily to automate its e-commerce business. The online retail giant purchased warehouse robot-maker Kiva Systems Inc. in 2012 for $775 million and now has tens of thousands of robots in warehouses around the world.But paying drivers to deliver packages is still one of the biggest costs in the company’s operation. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos announced plans for drone delivery in 2013, though they have yet to materialize at scale. Last year, Amazon revealed an experimental delivery robot called Scout in the Seattle area that rolls on sidewalks like a shopping cart.Last year, Amazon invested along with Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital in self-driving startup Aurora Innovation Inc., a startup led by the former heads of Google’s driverless car project and Tesla’s Autopilot team. Amazon also backed Rivian Automotive Inc., the electric pickup and SUV maker. Those bets left Morgan Stanley’s auto analyst questioning earlier this month whether Tesla’s rich valuation is warranted given the competitive threats the company faces.“We often hear from investors that Tesla could potentially be the Amazon of transportation,” Adam Jonas, who rates Tesla the equivalent of a hold, wrote in a May 17 report. “But what if Amazon is the Amazon of transportation?”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-talks-buy-autonomous-vehicle-012510536.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-22	2020-05-22 17:00:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Prime Air Seen Surging Fivefold to 200 Jets, Rivaling UPS	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Air fleet will grow to about 200 planes -- up from 42 now -- in the next seven or eight years, creating an air cargo service that could rival United Parcel Service Inc., according to a study.“At a time when many other airlines are downsizing due to the pandemic, Amazon’s push for faster and cheaper at-home delivery is moving ahead on an ambitious timetable,” said the report issued Friday by DePaul University’s Chaddick Institute of Metropolitan Development. “Amazon Air’s robust expansion makes it one of the biggest stories in the air cargo industry in years.”Amazon unveiled the air cargo service in 2016, prompting speculation that it would ultimately create an overnight delivery network to rival delivery partners UPS and FedEx Corp.Prime Air operates out of smaller regional airports close to its warehouses around the country, helping Amazon quickly move inventory to accommodate one- and two-day delivery. For that reason, some analysts have dismissed Amazon as a potential competitor to UPS and FedEx since it can only offer limited service to a small number of destinations and seems designed to handle Amazon packages.Key to its ability to take on the entrenched players, the report says, is Amazon’s new $1.5 billion facility near Cincinnati that will accommodate up to 100 planes and as many as 200 flights each day. Amazon’s lack of a central hub has kept it from competing in the overnight delivery services offered by UPS and FedEx, which have more planes flying to more destinations.“The massive investment being made in a large hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, however, could change everything,” the report says. “This hub appears to be the linchpin to Amazon’s efforts to develop a comprehensive array of domestic delivery services.”A separate report released Monday noted Amazon’s lack of a central hub in concluding it was not a competitive threat to FedEx, which has a hub in Memphis, or UPS, which has one in Louisville. FedEx’s network can offer 9,000 daily flight connections, UPS’ 5,500 and Amazon Air just 363, according to the report from Bernstein.“The viability of a commercial overnight offering from Amazon remains very limited,” Bernstein analyst David Vernon wrote. “Offering a low cost on shipping to a small number of markets every so often will never be a serious competitive threat.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-prime-air-grow-200-170000376.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-13	2020-05-13 21:45:57	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Matternet Readies Cargo Drone For FAA tests	"One of the country's largest small drone manufacturers is ready to begin durability and reliability testing of one of its cargo delivery units with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) this year.Mountain View, California-based Matternet announced Tuesday that the testing with the agency brings the company's M2 drone closer to receiving special type certification for unmanned aircraft systems.Achieving this certification from the FAA will establish that Matternet's M2 drone is airworthy and eligible for use by commercial air carriers. While numerous cargo delivery drones are undergoing development and testing, none has received this level of certification.Since March 2019, FAA-approved drone airline UPS Flight Forward has used Matternet's M2 drones to carry out various urban cargo delivery tests throughout the country.In partnership with WakeMed Health, UPS Flight Forward used M2 drones to complete more than 1,850 deliveries of lab samples within its Raleigh, North Carolina, medical campus in 2019. The FAA requires UPS drone operators to maintain a clear line of sight of the machines during flight.This month UPS Flight Forward will use M2 drones to make short-distance deliveries of prescription drugs from a CVS Health Corp. pharmacy to The Villages in Florida, the largest U.S. retirement community and home to more than 135,000 residents.The potential for ""touchless"" drone deliveries of medical supplies, lab samples and pharmaceuticals has taken on increased significance with efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19 within communities.""The Matternet M2 has been purpose-built for its mission of urban medical delivery, combining solid engineering, years of flight experience, and the safety and security required for medical logistics,"" said the company's CEO, Andreas Raptopoulos, in a statement.Receiving this type of certification from the FAA will allow UPS to scale operations much more quickly, Matternet said.However, industry experts say the agency's durability and reliability testing to certify airworthiness is rigorous.""This will probably be measured in years rather than months,"" said Michael Blades, vice president of aerospace, defense and security at investment strategies firm Frost & Sullivan. ""The strict safety requirements will require a lot of testing over a relatively long period of time.""Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) began developing drones in 2013 for consumer deliveries. Since then, other express delivery companies, such as United Parcel Service, Inc (NYSE: UPS) and FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX), have initiated their own plans for the technology.Blades told American Shipper during an interview in mid-April that FAA regulations for drone flight ceilings, times of operation and visual contact by operators during flight continue to hold back the technology's commercial cargo potential in the U.S.He estimated in a recent Frost & Sullivan report that between 2019 and 2023, about 100,000 drones will be in use for cargo delivery applications, and they will be operated by firms providing niche services.Photo credit: MatternetSee more from Benzinga  * Avianca Receives Preliminary OK For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy  * Today's Pickup: How A Canadian Carrier Recession-Proofed Its Business  * Double-Digit Percentage Declines Persist For US Rail Volumes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-05-08	2020-05-08 14:51:47	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Even the Essential Industries Aren’t Adding That Many Jobs	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Amid the worst jobs report in the history of jobs reports, a few industries actually added jobs from mid-March to mid-April.“General merchandise stores including warehouse clubs and supercenters” is the North American Industry Classification System category for Walmarts, Targets, Dollar Trees, Sam’s Clubs, Costcos and such. It seems likely that supermarkets also saw job gains, but for them and most other industry subcategories employment is reported with a one month lag, so we won’t know until the next jobs report. Food and beverage stores, the supersector that includes supermarkets, saw a 42,000-job seasonally adjusted decline in employment in April.Among the other job-gaining sectors, “other information services” may require some explanation. About 80% of its jobs are at “Internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals,” which covers the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter. The remainder are at other digital information providers such as, well, the publisher of Bloomberg Opinion. “Couriers and messengers” is FedEx, United Parcel Service and their ilk.One thing that stands out here is that the job gains are really, really tiny compared with the 20.5 million jobs lost. We may well see a more significant shift of employment into pandemic-resistant or pandemic-fighting sectors in the coming months, but that takes a while. And given that the shifts in demand that have had everybody lining up at Costco for toilet paper are not (one hopes) permanent, such companies are unlikely to go overboard with hiring.Another thing that stands out is that a lot of sectors that would seem to be quite essential in a pandemic nonetheless shed jobs. I’ve listed a selection here, ranked by percentage job losses rather than the absolute numbers because that seemed more informative.Other health-care sectors were even harder hit as almost all non-coronavirus-related care was put on hold for the month, with employment down 15.2% at ambulatory health-care services and 52.5% at dentists’ offices. Then again, a lot of those jobs ought to return quickly as well, although things are definitely going to be tough for dentists and dental hygienists, whose work probably entails more intense coronavirus risk than any other.The bigger message here may just be that a U.S. economy that is pared down to “essentials” isn’t much of an economy. Here’s hoping we all start doing a lot more nonessential (but also non-virus-spreading) things soon.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Justin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2020-05-08	2020-05-08 10:00:11	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Stock Can Handle the Load	"In the center of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the question on income investors' minds is whether any stock can afford to pay its dividend. United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) stock can handle that load.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com For the March quarter, UPS had net income of $935 million, $1.11 per share diluted, on revenue of $18 billion.  That was higher than its quarterly dividend payout of $1.01 per share. The company also announced free cash flow of $1.6 billion, also enough to clear the dividend's cost.Analysts whined about the revenue mix, which was higher for residential than commercial deliveries, and terrible for international. But UPS opened for trading May 8 at about $93, and that dividend yield is about 4.3%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Income Investors Take NoteAt a time when retired investors are reaching for yield in high-risk corporate bonds, the UPS dividend should be attractive. While common stock investors are always last in line for corporate obligations, behind bonds and all other bills, UPS proved this winter it can deliver results in all economic seasons.This has not made it a stock for all investors. Those seeking capital gains will see its down 20% so far in 2020. Those seeking growth will see that March revenue was just 5% ahead of last year. Analysts are updating their models to reflect UPS' slow, steady and profitable growth.  * 7 A-Rated REITs to Buy NowUPS isn't coming away from the pandemic unscathed. Home deliveries are less profitable than bulk deliveries to business. First-quarter profit was down from a year earlier, even while revenue grew.UPS is also finding new ways to compete with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Its network of UPS Stores means it has a physical presence that can even take Amazon returns. This will expand through an agreement to take packages from The Michaels Companies (NASDAQ:MIK) chain of crafts stores, when retailing reopens.While longtime rival FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has gotten itself into trouble by picking fights with Amazon, UPS learned to adapt. I have speculated it's because FedEx is still led by founder Fred Smith, while UPS has recharged its management with outsiders from Home Depot (NYSE:HD), PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). For them, Amazon is less an existential threat than a part of the business environment. A Trump Bump?UPS may also benefit from Trump's insistence that the U.S. Postal Service stop ""subsidizing"" Amazon and raise rates. Such a move would bring UPS more incremental business, cash with which to expand its own delivery network.During the current quarter, UPS drivers are hitting the road more, but making less for the company. That should change as stores and factories re-open over the next few months. UPS has also proven it can make money in a tough environment so that, if the lockdowns return, it is ready.Competition with Amazon also steeled UPS in the use of new technology. It is now delivering prescriptions to some senior centers using drones, in conjunction with CVS Health (NYSE:CVS). The pandemic is giving UPS the cash flow to move ahead in areas that had previously been theoretical. The Bottom Line for UPS StockUPS stock is not for everyone.In today's market it's the equivalent of an old-line industrial. It's a slow growth company with a steady stream of income.That means if you're looking for capital gains, look elsewhere. UPS' share price should recover as the pandemic retreats, but it will never be a high-flyer. It will continue to ride low to the ground.But at a time when high-flyers are out of fashion, with conservative investors doing triage on their portfolios against the virus' siege, UPS stands out at its current price. It will still pay you to own it, and that's saying something.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

2020-05-08	2020-05-08 08:00:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	SBA Treated as a Washington Backwater, Until Disaster Strikes	(Bloomberg) -- The only person who didn’t speak at a White House briefing on a massive federal effort to aid mom-and-pop firms crushed by the coronavirus pandemic was the woman actually running the initiative, Jovita Carranza.President Donald Trump, his daughter Ivanka and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin all lauded the program despite its rocky start at the beginning of April. Carranza, who was charged with processing hundreds of billions of dollars in loans only months into her new job as the head of the Small Business Administration, smiled approvingly, but was never asked to speak.Carranza’s sideline role at the April 28 event was emblematic of the challenges facing her agency, which has long been treated as a backwater in Washington. Despite its checkered track record in disaster response, the SBA is now responsible for a $669 billion program to rescue the 30 million small firms that make up nearly half the U.S. economy.The SBA has approved more than half a trillion dollars in loans in a matter of weeks and has about $125 billion left before a second round of funding runs out. Advocates fear that the money will be exhausted again before all small firms that need it get help. At the same time, Trump is pushing to reopen the economy with polls showing Americans are wary about returning to business as usual.For years, Congress hasn’t set up the SBA to adequately respond to crises. And lawmakers have never before asked it to handle an effort as massive as the Paycheck Protection Program, meant to help devastated small businesses survive the pandemic.Working with the Treasury, Congress decided that to get money out fast, it had to put the SBA in charge because the agency already had an established loan program with a network of pre-approved banks. That left Carranza, who was a deputy administrator under President George W. Bush, to make the best of a situation everyone worried would be fraught with problems.‘Massive, Massive Program’“They gave the SBA, an agency that has repeatedly botched previous disaster responses, the responsibility to handle this massive, massive program,” said Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center who has studied the agency’s history.An agency spokesman called the SBA’s performance an “historic achievement.” A Treasury spokeswoman agreed that the SBA is performing well under Carranza and said that she works closely with Mnuchin. White House spokespeople didn’t respond to a question about why she wasn’t invited to address the April 28 White House event.Carranza declined to be interviewed for this article.“She’s been faced with about the most challenging circumstance a head of the SBA has ever had to operate under,” said Representative Steve Chabot of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Small Business Committee. “I mean, the very survival of the American economy rests on your shoulders.”The SBA, which was elevated to a cabinet-level agency by President Barack Obama, supports the nation’s small businesses through loan programs and training for entrepreneurs. In times of crisis, including after Hurricanes Katrina, Irma and Harvey, the agency bolstered its funding programs to supply mom and pop firms and homeowners with emergency capital.The rocky launch of the PPP program featured some of the same problems the SBA hadn’t fixed after past disasters, in addition to new ones. Technology meltdowns and the way the program was structured led to delays in getting the money to those who needed it the most.In the first round of funding, many small companies were left stranded while hundreds of publicly traded companies got more than $1 billion. Major banks favored large corporate clients, whose bigger loan amounts gave lenders fatter fees. Congress was forced to replenish the fund just two weeks after it began.The SBA has been especially handicapped under Trump, according to John Arensmeyer, who heads the Small Business Majority, an advocacy group that has a network of more than 58,000 small business owners, most of whom have less than 100 employees.When Carranza took up her post in January, the agency had had a leadership vacuum and was being run by its general counsel. Its former head, Linda McMahon, a Trump donor and co-founder of World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., left in April 2019 to chair Trump’s 2020 Super-PAC America First Action. Carranza was picked for the post last July after serving as U.S. treasurer since June 2017. In that role, she advised Mnuchin and oversaw the printing of money. Her signature appeared on bills.The White House still hasn’t nominated a new No. 2 -- the deputy administrator who normally handles the day-to-day affairs -- after the last one left in 2018. In February, Trump proposed cutting the agency’s 2021 budget by 25%.The Government Accountability Office, Congress’s watchdog agency, has repeatedly warned that the SBA’s technology needs to be revamped. Its budget is about $1 billion and its staff of more than 6,000, compared with the Commerce Department, which has 52,000 employees and a budget of $15.2 billion. Although Congress eventually added $2.8 billion for SBA salaries and other expenses in its pandemic relief measures, some said it was too little, too late, given the magnitude of the task.“The SBA is going to need to be better-funded and more of a priority agency simply because of the disaster that’s befallen small businesses across the country,” said Arensmeyer. “I would hope that the administration and Congress recognize that.”Despite the difficulties, Carranza has earned the respect of key lawmakers and small-business groups, who said she’s been accessible, willing to listen and a problem-solver.She is no stranger to challenges. A native of Chicago and the daughter of first-generation Mexican-Americans, she worked two jobs and raised a child as a single mother, according to her testimony during her December Senate confirmation hearing.She spent 30 years at United Parcel Service Inc., where she started as a part-time, hourly employee on the warehouse docks, loading packages onto trucks. She climbed the ladder to eventually lead the company’s operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, managing thousands of employees. She retired as the highest-ranking Latina in the company’s history.Carranza ran the SBA’s day-to-day operations under Bush from 2006 to 2009. As deputy administrator, she oversaw 80 national field offices and a portfolio of loans worth tens of billions of dollars. She developed the SBA’s disaster recovery plan after the agency faced a torrent of criticism over how slowly it administered loans after Hurricane Katrina.Her former SBA colleagues describe her as a hands-on manager who can speak authoritatively on minute details. Eric Thorson, who was the SBA’s inspector general at the time, said agency heads often had antagonistic relationships with their inspectors general. That wasn’t the case with Carranza, who was eager to address issues his office highlighted, he said.Carranza began her second stint at SBA with ambitious goals to reform the agency, including doing more to support women and minority-owned businesses and making the agency’s emergency loan systems more efficient.Then catastrophe struck. By mid-March, the pandemic had prompted businesses to close their doors as stay-at-home orders stretched across the country. Hotels, airlines, media, restaurants and manufacturers shed jobs by the millions as revenue dried up.Carranza and Mnuchin met with lawmakers including Senators Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, and Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, to hammer out a small business aid package as part of the administration’s multi-trillion-dollar relief initiative. Democrats on the small business panel wanted to set up a grant program, which Republicans opposed because they thought it would take too long and instead pushed for a loan program, according to a person familiar with the matter.Lawmakers worried that the SBA wouldn’t be able to handle the job. Mnuchin dispatched Deputy Secretary Justin Muzinich, his No. 2 at the Treasury, to the SBA to smooth out the program’s rollout, according to a person familiar with the matter.Representative Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat and chairwoman of the House Small Business Committee, said she called Carranza after the program was approved and told her: “You got to be prepared.” Carranza replied that she had her team working overtime to be ready because she knew how important it was to the economy, Velazquez said.‘She Is Committed’“She has been there, what, three months?” said Velazquez. “I know she is committed. I know they are working hard.”The SBA has moved much more quickly amid the coronavirus pandemic than in past crises, despite a flood of applications and technology glitches. It made changes to ensure the money gets to those who need it the most, including creating a window when only the smallest lenders could apply. Lawmakers, the White House and even Carranza herself have boasted about how rapidly the agency was able to distribute the loans.The SBA’s pandemic response could face more attacks as it distributes an additional $320 billion. It missed an April 26 deadline for providing guidance on how loans will be forgiven -- meaning that small business owners who struggled to get funding still don’t know how much they may have to repay.Cardin said the pandemic has underscored the need to fix the country’s response to disasters. “There’s two parts to this,” Cardin said. “One is to triage this current situation to make sure underserved communities get loans” and the other is to build capacity for the future, he said. “Whether they’re economic downturns or natural disasters or other pandemics,” Cardin added, “there will be other problems.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sba-treated-washington-backwater-until-080000094.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-01	2020-05-01 08:00:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Kushner Airlift Moves Millions of Masks, But Details Are Secret	(Bloomberg) -- A program created by Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner has airlifted millions of gloves, masks and other coveted coronavirus supplies into the U.S. from overseas -- but it isn’t clear who’s getting them and at what price, or how much private-sector partners are earning through the arrangement.Kushner’s “Project Airbridge” provides transportation via FedEx Corp. and others for supplies that medical distributors, including McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc., buy from overseas manufacturers, mainly in China. Once a supplier’s goods arrive in the U.S., the companies must sell half the order in government-designated hotspots. They sell the rest as they see fit.The U.S. government provides the air transportation for free, to speed the arrival of the products. The six distributors keep the profits, if any.The program has won praise from some states, where officials say it provided hard-to-find supplies at a critical time in the Covid-19 outbreak, even if it met a fraction of demand.“We are very supportive of Airbridge and other federal programs that can provide PPE to our first-line responders,” said Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat. “But it doesn’t meet our full needs.”Other governors and lawmakers have raised questions, saying they have no visibility into how supplies are distributed and the government has only limited power to direct it. The program appears to run largely outside the standard federal channels for competitive bidding, disclosure and transparency -- the government hasn’t documented how the products are sold, how prices are determined or which hospitals and other customers receive the supplies.Senate QuestionsThe House Oversight Committee is seeking answers, and Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal wrote to the medical supply companies this week requesting details about their participation in Kushner’s program. “The American people need an explanation for how these supplies are obtained, priced, and distributed,” they said.The letter went to all six participating distributors: McKesson, Cardinal, Medline Industries Inc., Henry Schein Inc., Owens & Minor Inc. and Concordance Health care Solutions.McKesson issued a statement saying that its work with the government “reflects our commitment” to fighting the pandemic, but declined to answer specific questions. The other five companies declined comment or didn’t respond.“Providing free flights for supplies sold by the private sector may help, but it is not a substitute for a comprehensive federal response to this crisis,” Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat who chairs the Oversight committee, said in a statement. She said her panel seeks to “understand how our taxpayer dollars are being spent and whether supplies are reaching those who need them most.”Project Airbridge has become a fixture at the president’s news conferences, where Trump regularly ticks off the number of flights it’s completed and the millions of pieces of gear it’s delivered. Its development is characteristic of an administration that’s shown little patience for the traditional processes and pace of government. Slow to prepare for the coronavirus outbreak, Trump turned to Kushner in March to try to quickly fill shortages of vital medical gear.In Trump’s telling, the nation is fortunate Kushner stepped in, because the program relieved a bottleneck causing shortages of protective gear at the front lines of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, the largest in the world. The country has had more than 1 million documented cases of the disease and at least 61,000 deaths since February.Kushner’s program is not the only way medical supplies are imported into the country. The U.S. government has bought gear on its own, and states, hospitals, medical suppliers, retailers and others have placed their own orders. The president has encouraged states to source and buy most of their own medical equipment, and Kushner has described the federal stockpile as a backup.Suppliers and middlemen trying to keep hospitals equipped say that securing a flight out of China has become their biggest logistical hurdle, with a surge in demand doubling and even tripling prices for the limited number of cargo planes handling shipments.For about $69 million in flight costs so far, the Airbridge project has flown at least 746 million pairs of gloves, 71 million surgical masks and 10 million surgical gowns to the U.S. market, mainly on planes operated by FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc., according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The program has also brought in about 2 million thermometers, 768,000 N95 masks and 562,000 face shields.The Department of Justice said it would not mount an antitrust challenge to the “collaborative efforts” of the distributors “to address supply needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic,” for which, DOJ said in a statement, the companies “should be applauded.”‘Young Geniuses’Airbridge is run out of FEMA, but its leadership includes what Trump has referred to as “military people and young geniuses.” That includes Kushner and his longtime friend, Adam Boehler, the chief executive officer of a new government agency created in 2018, the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. Navy Rear Admiral John Polowczyk, a logistics expert who is Trump’s top adviser on the medical supply chain, also helps direct the effort.Speaking Wednesday on Fox News, Kushner said he took “a custom-tailored approach” to Airbridge because the U.S. health care system is mostly run by private firms or non-profits, not government.“We created a control tower approach with the private company distributors in order to make sure that we can be as efficient as possible, and it’s been quite successful,” Kushner said.FEMA says the effort has slashed shipping time to two days, from the 30 to 40 days that a conventional sea shipment would normally take.Still, Airbridge accounts for only a small portion of the protective medical gear sold in the U.S., according to a person at one of the participating companies who spoke on condition of anonymity. The person said the company sells Airbridge supplies at prices consistent with what customers have previously paid.Polowczyk said the administration doesn’t want to try to direct distribution. “I’m not here to disrupt a supply chain,” he said on April 2, shortly after the program was struck up. “I’m putting volume into that system.”A spokesman for Medline Industries Inc., one of the distributors involved, told CNN that it sells some items transported by Airbridge at a loss.The White House declined to provide any information on prices charged by the distributors, nor did it offer any accounting of the products brought into the U.S. or their final destination -- even for the half of the products designated for areas the government considers hotspots.“Why isn’t there transparency?” Representative Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat, said in an interview. Deutch and colleagues have introduced legislation that would require the White House to report on the program and other elements of the medical supply chain every two weeks.“If they’re so willing to hold press conferences touting the importance of putting together this program to bring a hundred cargo planes worth of equipment to the United States in this time of a global pandemic, then they ought to be willing to answer some basic questions about what’s coming,” he said. “How much it costs, where it’s going, so that we can make sure that every life that can be saved is being saved.”Some health-care executives are similarly concerned.“There does need to be more transparency here, because this is the sort of thing that people investigate and wonder about,” said Blair Childs, a senior vice president at Premier Inc., which helps 4,000 member hospitals purchase supplies. “What are they paying? Is it a competitive price?”FedEx, UPS ContractsUnder Airbridge, FEMA pays the cost of shipping and ensures that the U.S. gets the supplies quickly. The goods are transported by FedEx, UPS, Landstar System Inc. and Radiant Logistics Inc., according to FEMA. The agency doesn’t know the specific contents of shipments until the cargo is loaded, the agency says.FedEx received a $60 million sole-source shipping contract for the program while UPS was awarded a “not competed” contract for “warehousing and distribution” worth as much as $9.8 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Government. Total figures for the program remain unclear.Bonny Harrison, a FedEx spokeswoman, said the cost of the flights is consistent with market rates. The company’s coronavirus work includes flights of supplies, distribution and collection of test kits and shipment of other things like swabs, she said. UPS did not respond to a request for comment, Landstar declined comment and Radiant referred questions to FEMA.The program plans to shift cargoes to lower-cost sea freighters once the need for equipment isn’t as urgent, an administration official said. The person wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about Airbridge and asked not to be identified. Airbridge had completed 89 flights with 21 more scheduled, FEMA said, but the number of total flights has ticked down over the past week.Terms of the shipments can vary. If they’re ordered by the six participating medical supply companies, those firms retain control of the goods throughout, with the understanding that they have to sell half to hotspot regions. There are no other known constraints on the distributors.Under the agreement with participating companies, the U.S. government can take up to 20% of supplies it finds on its own, while the companies distribute the remaining 80%. Project Airbridge has flown in at least 18.6 million masks and respirators procured by FEMA, the agency says.Pence CallGovernors discussed Airbridge in an April 24 call with Vice President Mike Pence. While Polis has complimented the program, another governor said allowing private distributors to manage deliveries means the equipment isn’t necessarily going where it’s most needed.“The White House has not delivered what it has said it would deliver,” Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker, a Democrat who has sparred with Trump, said on April 20. Allowing companies to distribute the supplies is “a far cry from delivering to the states so that we can distribute to, for example, a nursing home that has an outbreak.”A spokesperson for Washington Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, said the program “appears fairly small-scale,” and that the state doesn’t know how the distributors decide where to sell the supplies.Buyers in New Jersey have received about two million pieces of equipment through Airbridge, according to a person familiar with the matter.“To classify it as significant might be a bit of an overstatement,” Patrick Callahan, superintendent of the New Jersey state police, said Friday. “We’ll take everything we can get.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-hails-kushner-ppe-airlift-080000733.html?.tsrc=rss

U.S. Covid-19 Deaths Top Lives Lost in Vietnam War: Virus Update	(Bloomberg) -- Tuesday saw two new milestones in the U.S.: coronavirus cases passed the 1 million mark and deaths topped the 58,220 lives lost in the Vietnam War, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.France plans to begin reopening shops on May 11, while Spain is preparing for a “new normal” as Europe’s hardest-hit nation removes restrictions over the next eight weeks. New infections in Germany fell below 1,000 for the first time in more than five weeks. China’s top scientists said the virus won’t be eradicated, joining a growing consensus that the pathogen will probably return in waves.New York City reported a decline in the number of people admitted to hospitals for the new coronavirus, while the state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, laid out criteria necessary for some upstate regions to reopen. President Donald Trump plans to order meat-processing plants to remain open, a person familiar with the matter said.Key DevelopmentsVirus Tracker: Cases top 3.1 million; deaths pass 216,000Testing shortages undermine drive to restart U.S. economyMexico City top hospitals reach capacity, reject virus patientsVirus forces China to rethink Xi’s annual political pageantBack to school brings a bleak new normal for China’s studentsBusiness of survival fuels race for new skills to stay afloatSubscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg’s Prognosis team here. Click VRUS on the terminal for news and data on the coronavirus.Starbucks Sees China Sales Falling 25% (5:12 p.m. NY)Starbucks Corp. has opened almost all its locations in China, but still sees the lingering impact of the coronavirus pandemic trimming same-store sales there by 15% to 25% this fiscal year. The shares fell in late trading.Same-store sales fell 10% globally in the company’s second quarter, slightly outpacing the average estimate for a 9.7% decline compiled by Consensus Metrix. The measure -- a key gauge of success for restaurant chains -- fell 50% in China, which along with the U.S. is a priority market for the company.With the U.S. likely following China’s path to reopening, but on a delayed timeline, 2020 increasingly is looking like a lost year for the company. Since the pandemic started to affect U.S. sales only at the end of the quarter that ended in late March, impact on third-quarter results will be “significantly greater” and extend into the fiscal fourth quarter “at a more moderate level.”The company has said it will take a store-by-store approach to resuming business activity in the U.S., with locations remaining limited to drive-thru, delivery and takeout activities. Starbucks said this plan will draw on the company’s experiences in China, where 98% of stores are now re-opened and operating under modified schedules or protocols.California Considers Starting School Year in Summer (4:45 p.m. NY)California, which has closed schools for the academic year, is considering bumping up the start of the new school year to late July or early August, Governor Gavin Newsom said. The tools necessary for distance learning – laptops, tablets and reliable wireless internet – aren’t adequately available across the state, he said.“There’s been a learning loss, and you can either just roll over and just accept that or you can do something about it,” Newsom said at his daily press conference. “If we can maybe start up the school year a little earlier, that would help mind that gap a little bit.”Opening schools would also help parents get back to work as the economy restarts. Newsom reiterated that he expects some changes to California’s stay-at-home order will come in “weeks, not months,” with the next phase aimed at bringing back some lower-risk workplaces, including childcare facilities. Still, he wouldn’t commit to any hard timeline, citing an increase in Covid-19 related deaths and confirmed cases on Tuesday as a signal that the virus is still too dangerous for the state to reopen.Trump Ties Aid to Sanctuary Policies (4:30 p.m. NY)President Donald Trump indicated he wouldn’t allow federal aid for states facing budget deficits from the coronavirus outbreak unless they take action against “sanctuary cities” -- municipalities that prevent their police from cooperating with immigration authorities.“We would want certain things” as part of a deal with House Democrats to aid states, he said at a White House event on Tuesday, “including sanctuary city adjustments, because we have so many people in sanctuary cities.”“What’s happening is people are being protected that shouldn’t be protected and a lot of bad things are happening with sanctuary cities,” he added.U.S. Cases Rise 2.5%, Below Week’s Average (4 p.m. NY)U.S. cases rose 2.5% from the day before to surpass 1 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. That was higher than Monday’s growth rate of 2.3% but below average daily increase of 3.3% over the past week. Deaths rose 3.7% to 57,608. Deaths rose 3.7% to 57,608.New York’s cases rose 1.1%, according to the Johns Hopkins and Bloomberg News data.New Jersey, which has the second-highest Covid-19 rate, reported 402 new deaths, for a total of 6,442, according to the state’s health department.In Texas, cases rose 3.5% to 26,171, almost in lockstep with the rate of increase in testing, according to the state’s health department. Hospitalizations climbed by 119 to 1,682, or 19% higher than a week ago.Florida reported 32,846 cases, up 2.2% from a day earlier, according to the state’s health department. Deaths reached 1,171, an increase of 7.6%.Nebraska had the highest daily increase, with cases rising 16% to 3,507Fauci ‘Cautiously Optimistic’ on Vaccine (1:57 p.m. NY)The U.S. government’s top infectious disease specialist is “cautiously optimistic” scientists will develop a Covid-19 vaccine that can protect against future outbreaks of a virus he said is unlikely to disappear.“The very fact that people can mount a natural immune response that gets rid of the virus in them makes me cautiously optimistic that we can develop a vaccine that can mimic natural infection enough to induce that same sort of response that would ultimately protect people,” Anthony Fauci said Tuesday at a virtual event hosted by the Economic Club.Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in the past has shied away from making predictions about treatments.Texas Cases Rise 3.5% (1:19 p.m. NY)Texas cases rose 3.5% to 26,171, almost in lockstep with the rate of increase in testing, according to the state’s health department. Hospitalizations climbed by 119 to 1,682, or 19% higher than a week ago.The increases in caseload and admitted patients come as Governor Greg Abbott moved to reopen the economy and leaders of the state’s biggest metropolitan areas warned that moving too fast could ignite a second wave of contagion.Spain Aims to Lift Lockdown in 8 Weeks (1:15 p.m. NY)Spain aims to remove most restrictions on daily life and return to a “new normal” over the next eight weeks, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.The process will be subject to data on the number of Covid-19 infections and won’t follow a strict calendar, Sanchez said in a televised address. Schools won’t return until September. Each province will ease curbs on activity at its own pace in accordance with its particular situation, Sanchez added.After a six-week lockdown that has crippled the economy, the health ministry earlier reported a drop in the number of new virus cases and deaths, continuing a trend of steady decline in the nation with Europe’s most extensive outbreak.Turkish ICU Cases Fall for Fifth Day (1 p.m. NY)The number of coronavirus patients requiring intensive care fell for a fifth day across Turkey, while the tally of patients discharged from hospitals rose to the highest since the outbreak began 50 days ago.The total figure for confirmed cases now stands at 114,653, or 2.1% higher than Monday, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said in a Twitter post. The ministry reported 92 new fatalities, bringing the death toll from the outbreak to 2,992.U.K. Reports 586 More Deaths (12:23 p.m. NY)A further 586 people are reported to have died from the coronavirus in U.K. hospitals, the government said.That’s an increase from the 360 deaths reported Monday, but U.K. death numbers are usually artificially low after a weekend.Some 3,996 more people tested positive for the disease, down from an increase of 4,310 the day before, according to figures given by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Tuesday. The U.K. now has more confirmed cases than Germany, and the fifth-highest number of confirmed cases in the world.Putin Extends Russian Lockdown (11:10 a.m. NY)President Vladimir Putin ordered Russians to remain under lockdown through May 11 after the total number of coronavirus cases in the country surpassed China’s.“We have been able to slow down the epidemic,” Putin said Tuesday in a videoconference with officials and regional governors. “The peak has not yet been reached. We are facing the most intense stage of the fight against the epidemic.”Putin also ordered the government to prepare a plan for gradually lifting the virus restrictions starting as early as May 12, and said ministers should draw up further programs to support the economy. Easing the measures against the epidemic won’t happen all at once, the president said.Florida Governor to Meet With Trump (10:56 a.m. NY)Florida reported 32,846 Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, up 2.2% from a day earlier. Deaths reached 1,171, an increase of 7.6%.Governor Ron DeSantis is in Washington Tuesday to meet with President Donald Trump, an ally -- and technically a Florida resident -- to whom DeSantis has frequently turned for guidance during the pandemic.NYC Sees Drop in Virus Admissions (10:37 a.m. NY)New York City reported a decline in the number of people admitted to hospitals for the new coronavirus, to 112 from 122 as of April 25.The number of people in New York City Health + Hospitals intensive-care units also declined, to 745 from 766 as of April 25, according to figures presented by Mayor Bill de Blasio at his Tuesday virus briefing.In another sign of progress, de Blasio reported that the citywide percentage of people who tested positive for Covid-19 is 27%, down from 29%. Testing positivity was slightly higher at the public health lab, up to 56% from 55%.France to Reopen Shops Starting May 11 (9:46 a.m. NY)Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said a decision on whether to reopen restaurants and cafes will be examined at the end of May, and that pupils can start returning to school from May 11 but with strict rules. Public events of more than 5,000 people are outlawed until September, and working from home is encouraged for at least three more weeks, he said.Ford to Restart Production at European Plants (9:14 a.m. NY)Ford intends to restart initial production at most of its main European vehicle and engine plants beginning May 4, the company said. Manufacturing will resume in a phased approach, and employees will receive personal-care kits including masks and thermometers.Mnuchin Says Loans of $2 Million to Be Audited (9:10 a.m. NY)U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said all loans of more than $2 million in a government relief program for small businesses will be audited to ensure they were justified after large public companies and big chains sparked outrage by taking funds.Mnuchin said the loans of as much as $10 million meant to keep workers on payrolls under the Paycheck Protection Program were intended for small firms that lacked access to other capital, and the U.S. Small Business Administration will check that borrowers who took large loans properly certified it was needed because of the coronavirus outbreak.“I want to be very clear it’s the borrowers who have criminal liability if they made this certification and it’s not true,” Mnuchin said Tuesday on CNBC.The Treasury secretary also said those states that had poorly managed budgets before the Covid-19 outbreak shouldn’t be rescued by the federal government.U.S. Merchandise Trade Slumps (8:54 a.m. NY)U.S. exports and imports of goods slumped in March to the lowest level in almost three years as the coronavirus pandemic shut down economies across the world.Goods exports fell 6.7% from the prior month -- the sharpest decline since 2008 -- led by plunges in auto shipments and industrial supplies such as oil, according to Commerce Department data released Tuesday. Imports fell by 2.4% on autos and consumer goods. Combined, U.S. exports and imports were the lowest since May 2017.Germany to Extend Takeover Controls to Health Care (8:48 a.m. NY)The German government plans to extend its protection against foreign takeovers to the health-care industry after the coronavirus outbreak made companies more vulnerable. Angela Merkel’s cabinet aims to lower the threshold for scrutinizing investments in the sector from outside the European Union, the Economy Ministry said Tuesday.Netherlands Sees Fewest New Cases Since March 14 (8:13 a.m. NY)The Netherlands reported 171 new cases, the lowest since March 14, which was a few days before an “intelligent lockdown” was imposed on the country. Confirmed cases rose a mere 0.4% to 38,416, marking the lowest recorded growth rate. Fatalities increased by 48 -- five more than Monday, but still below the triple-digit numbers seen for most of the month -- for a total of 4,566.FDA’s Hahn Optimistic About Plasma Treatment (7:48 a.m. NY)“There are some good preliminary data to suggest that it is a benefit, this is a therapy that we’ve been scaling up over the last two months,” FDA Chief Stephen Hahn told Fox Business. On Gilead and its drug remdesivir, he said: “We’ve been in very close contact with the company and are working closely with them to look at what those data show”U.K. Regulator Warns Banks Not to Use Loans to Win Deals (7:31 a.m. NY)“We have heard credible reports of a small number of banks failing to treat their corporate clients fairly when negotiating new or existing debt facilities,” the Financial Conduct Authority said Tuesday in the letter. “We have heard reports that banks may have used their lending relationship to exert pressure on corporate clients to secure roles on equity mandates.”Providing financial services in return for future business is not an unusual strategy for lenders. The outbreak of the Covid-19 virus triggered an unprecedented demand for banks to provide short-term liquidity and prompted regulators to ease capital buffers. The transactions could include a capital raising, a bond issuance or other types of equity mandates.European Banks Get Break on Leverage Limits (7:15 a.m. NY)A key rule on banks’ indebtedness -- the so-called leverage ratio -- will be relaxed under a European Union proposal announced Tuesday, enabling banks to hold less capital for funds they keep at central banks. Deutsche Bank AG, which had 134 billion euros in cash primarily at central banks at the end of 2019, stands to be a major beneficiary.The softening of the rule is part of the latest plan unveiled by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, that also would allow banks to save on capital when they invest in software and when they fund infrastructure and small- and medium-sized businessesSingapore Virus Trend ‘Improving’ (6:43 a.m. NY)The trend of overall cases is “indeed improving” but the government wants to make sure there is a decisive reduction in local community transmission before moving to relax circuit breaker measures, Singapore Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said at a briefing.As part of the city-state’s strategy to bring down infections in the weeks to come, the government said it has more than doubled its daily testing capacity since early April even as the number of cases. Once touted as an early success in containing the spread, Singapore now has Asia’s highest number of coronavirus cases after China and India. Much of the surge in infections has been driven by hundreds of new daily cases from migrant worker dorms.UPS, PepsiCo Pull Outlook (6:14 a.m. NY)UPS, PepsiCo, 3M and Xerox joined the growing list of companies who have scrapped forecasts because of the disruption caused by the coronavirus. “There is still a great deal of uncertainty that exists in relation to Covid-19, including how geographies, retail channels and consumer behaviors will evolve over time,” PepsiCo said. UPS is suspending share buybacks for 2020 and expects capital expenditure to be about $1 billion lower than expected.At 3M, rising demand for cleaning supplies, food-safety products and even home-improvement items helped propel sales and profit above expectations for the first quarter.Caterpillar Inc. didn’t provide an outlook for the year and said it had taken actions to cut costs, including reducing discretionary expenses and suspending 2020 base salary increases and short-term incentive compensation plans for many employees and all senior executives. Harley-Davidson Inc. is in talks with major U.S. banks to secure $1.3 billion in funding after sales declined in every market worldwideSouthwest Airlines Co. plans to sell $1 billion in convertible bonds and 55 million shares. The company is cutting the number of Boeing Co. 737 Max jets it will take through December 2021 by more than half as the travel outlook remains bleak. Max deliveries will total no more than 48 through the end of next year as the pandemic batters demand for flights, Southwest said. More than 120 planes had been expected.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-cases-pass-3-million-230303436.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-28	2020-04-28 21:17:51	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Faces Mix/Margin Challenges As COVID-19 Skews Shipping Choices	United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS) has long planned for the day when business-to-consumer (B2C) traffic would become the truly dominant force in its volume mix. The extraordinary events of the past 60 days may have pulled that day forward faster than anyone could have expected.On April 28 the Atlanta-based shipping and logistics giant posted adjusted first-quarter earnings per share of $1.15, below analysts' consensus range of $1.21 to $1.24 per share. Adjusted net income fell to $1 billion from $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2019. Revenue climbed to $18 billion from $17.2 billion, due mostly to strong demand from U.S. e-commerce customers and gains in healthcare volumes. U.S. domestic revenue, which makes up roughly two-thirds of UPS' overall volume, grew by 9.3% year-over-year (y/y), well above analysts' expectations. Ground volumes rose 7.2%, and next-day air volumes continued their impressive run, up 20.3% y.y. Both figures also exceeded most analyst expectations.The growth numbers, however, proved a double-edged sword. By the end of the quarter, B2C traffic, the main driver of e-commerce, accounted for an unprecedented 70% of UPS' global traffic mix, with the remainder being business-to-business (B2B) commercial traffic that came to a virtual standstill by quarter's end as governments' worldwide stay-at-home orders and social-distancing measures shuttered virtually all brick-and-mortar enterprises.In the U.S., UPS' first-quarter ratio of B2C to B2B traffic was about 55% to 45% in favor of B2C before the mandates went into effect, according to company estimates. In the past few years, the ratio has oscillated between a 50-50 split to 55%-45% toward B2C, the company said.B2B traffic is a higher-margin business for UPS because the company can deliver multiple packages per stop. By contrast, B2C deliveries are more costly propositions because, with the exception of densely populated urban areas, they typically involve one package per stop, and require drivers and vehicles to operate over longer distances. UPS paid the price for the massive shift to B2C in the quarter. In the U.S., its miles driven rose 10% y/y, while its daily stops jumped by 15%. Because of the presence of lower-cost rivals like FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX), the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and Amazon.com, Inc., (NASDAQ: AMZN), it is almost impossible for UPS to implement B2C price increases to offset such sudden and dramatic cost spikes. UPS' ongoing multi-year program to re-engineer its U.S. distribution network is designed to boost the productivity of e-commerce package flows. This is expected to reduce costs and bolster profits without the need to push for price hikes. The full benefits of the initiative won't be felt for another two to three years, however.View more earnings on UPSThe first-quarter results illustrated UPS' current dilemma. Domestic profit margins fell by more than three full percentage points year-over-year, while adjusted operating income dropped to $401 million, a nearly $300 million decline. UPS executives sidestepped analysts' queries as to whether it will need to re-think its long-term B2C pricing strategy should its traffic mix permanently stay at or near such elevated levels.In all, UPS suffered a $140 million bottom-line hit due to disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic. It also received a $110 million higher-than-expected poke from self-insurance accruals from an increased frequency in accident-related claims. Company executives said they plan to beef up safety initiatives in response to the unfavorable trend.In addition, the small to midsize business (SMB) segment, probably UPS' top priority, was impacted as many SMBs could not pivot quickly enough to e-commerce models to offset the impact of the sudden changes in their regular ordering and shipping activities.UPS is doing what it can to mitigate any financial disruptions. It has slashed its 2020 capital expenditures by $1 billion to about $5.7 billion. It suspended its stock repurchase program, which the company said will save it an additional $783 million. UPS said it had $2.6 billion in operating cash flow and $1.6 billion in adjusted free cash flow at quarter's end. Executives said the company's liquidity position and overall financial condition remain strong, and it is committed to preserving its $4.04 per share annual dividend.The company's international segment posted $558 million in adjusted operating profit on revenue of $3.38 billion. In the 2019 quarter, adjusted operating income came in at $612 million on slightly higher revenue. After pronounced weakness in January and February, Asian export volumes rose 15% in March as Chinese factories resumed operations following the country's early fight with the coronavirus. Demand strength continued into April, UPS said. European activity remains weak, reflecting the continent's transition to a post-COVID-19 business environment, UPS said.Much of the end-of-quarter gains out of Asia came from end users' inventory restocking needs. Given the profound demand destruction in the U.S. and elsewhere, it is an open question as to how the segment will perform in the second quarter should the restocking need wane, analysts said.The UPS Supply Chain and Freight unit posted a $53 million y/y decline in adjusted operating profit on slightly lower revenue. Weakened economic activity depressed volumes at the unit's Coyote brokerage operations and at its UPS Freight less-than-truckload (LTL) business. The one exception was the unit's Marken healthcare logistics business, which posted double-digit gains in revenue and operating profit.As of 1:30 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, April 28, UPS shares were trading down 4.26% to $98.18 per share.See more from Benzinga  * UPS Drone Deliveries To Help Retirees Practice Social Distancing  * Will COVID-19 Accelerate The Adoption Of Autonomous Vehicles?  * More Humanitarian Aid For US Pours In By Air(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-04-28	2020-04-28 17:17:47	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	You Saw The Earnings, But What Did CEOs Say?	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Tuesday was a jam-packed day for earnings across all sectors. In the industrial landscape, I paid closest attention to 3M Co., Caterpillar Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc., each a bellwether in its own right. You can find the specifics on earnings numbers in the companies’ news releases here, here and here, but in this time of unprecedented volatility, what CEOs are saying about how they are running their businesses is more telling. Here are my top takeaways:3M: Like many companies, 3M has suspended its 2020 guidance given the unpredictable nature of the coronavirus outbreak and rolling economic shutdowns, but in an effort to provide more transparency, the maker of Post-it notes is now going to provide monthly sales updates — broken down by geography and business segment — for the foreseeable future. This follows Emerson Electric Co.’s marathon two-hour-plus earnings call last week that featured presentations by not only the CEO and CFO but also the heads of its main business divisions. It’s nice to see companies setting the bar high on disclosures during this period of upheaval; hopefully others follow suit. The second quarter is expected to bring the worst of the virus impact, and 3M is cutting $350 million to $400 million of costs in the period to adjust to lower demand. Notably, however, much of that involves discretionary spending on things like travel, external services and advertising, rather than cuts to payroll, which 3M says it’s trying to minimize. It’s using furloughs, but they’re paid leaves, and in other cases, employees are being asked to take vacation. Bear in mind that 3M had announced a restructuring plan in January, separate from the coronavirus, that would see it eliminate some 1,500 jobs, so it’s hardly a corporate saint. But given its sales of N95 respirators, you’d be hard-pressed to find a company that better understands the toll the virus is taking, and 3M seems to legitimately want to to do the right thing by its workforce. Like others in the industrial sector, the company also appears wary of cutting too deep and being unprepared for an eventual recovery. 3M is clearly conscious of its image after having its name dragged through the mud by President Donald Trump and billionaire Mark Cuban over production and sales of N95 respirators. The company devoted an entire slide in its earnings presentation to the topic. 3M has already doubled global N95 output to 100 million per month and is investing in capacity to double that yet again; it’s directed 90% of production to health-care workers, with the remainder going to other critical industries such as food production; and the company has cut loose some distributors who acted “unethically” and is pursuing numerous lawsuits amid allegations of price gouging. The company also made a point of highlighting its 76 plants and distribution centers across the U.S. in an apparent nod toward calls for a revival of America’s manufacturing might. “3M has never left our home country,” CEO Michael Roman said on the call. CATERPILLAR : The maker of bulldozers and backhoes is also holding off on sweeping job cuts, and it made an interesting argument as to why that’s the case. Caterpillar held headcount as well as administrative, manufacturing and research spending relatively flat from 2016 to 2019, even as sales increased some 40%. That means there’s less to cut when a downturn hits, CEO Jim Umpleby said on a call to discuss the company’s first-quarter results. It also means Caterpillar doesn’t have to use up cash to pay out large amounts of severance, and “cash is obviously king in this environment,” Umpleby said. So the overall effect is that margins and cash flow will be higher than historically, even though the chaotic nature of the coronavirus outbreak and supply-chain disruptions will likely prevent the company from reaching its targets on those metrics. While Caterpillar has suspended share buybacks and is delaying some R&D and capital expenditure projects with less visible returns, it made the decision to continue investing in growing its services business and expanding its product offerings because it continues to view those initiatives as key to its longer-term profitability. That’s a positive sign that the coronavirus hasn’t completely zapped CEOs’ appetite for investment.UPS: The good news for the package-delivery company is that its services have never been more important as store shutdowns and fear of contagion drive more consumers to online ordering. The bad news is that the spike in sales is coming at the expense of its profit margin. Why? It’s partly due to the sporadic nature of residential deliveries, which  makes the process more expensive than shipping to businesses, and also because of the increased expenses involved in keeping workers safe. The knock-on costs of the coronavirus — including the expense of doing extra cleaning and providing workers with protective gear — amounted to $140 million in the first quarter. That’s an important data point to keep in mind as companies across less essential industries start bringing people back to work. Like Caterpillar, UPS will maintain investments in strategic priorities such as automation to help bolster its longer-term profitability. An expected $1 billion reduction in capital expenditures is going to come largely from a rethink of certain facilities projects and a delay in vehicle purchases. The company is also working with its customers when it comes to investing in their supply chains as the coronavirus exposes the flaws in far-flung networks. In many cases, that's going to mean a shift to third-party order fulfillment and logistics services. This is just an acceleration of a reappraisal that began with the U.S.-China trade war, UPS CEO David Abney said on the earnings call. A lot remains unknown about the coronavirus pandemic, but the messaging from most industrial CEOs at this point has focused on staying the course, whether that means maintaining most of the workforce or following through on investment commitments. UPS's Abney may have put it best: “I don't know that we'll ever get back to what we call the old normal, but we're not ready to declare what we see today as a new normal, either.”This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-04-28	2020-04-28 13:49:03	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Drone Deliveries To Help Retirees Practice Social Distancing	Drones are proving to have many useful applications during a pandemic, not the least of which is delivering goods to minimize physical interaction and the spread of the coronavirus.United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) on Monday said it will use a Matternet M2 drone system to make short-distance deliveries of prescription medications from a CVS Health Corp. (NYSE: CVS) pharmacy to The Villages in Florida, the largest U.S. retirement community and home to more than 135,000 residents.Older people are more vulnerable to the serious effects of the COVID-19 disease, so providing a convenient alternative to visiting the pharmacy reduces their risk, as well as risk to those in stores they might come in contact with.Flight Forward, the UPS drone delivery subsidiary, in November made its first commercial deliveries of prescription drugs in North Carolina from a CVS store to customers' homes using the M2 autonomous aerial technology developed by Matternet. The deliveries followed Federal Aviation Administration approval to operate unlimited drone flights. The operator was able to keep the unmanned aerial system within sight at all times. UPS and Matternet also rush blood and swab samples across WakeMed Health & Hospitals' campus. They performed more than 3,700 flights in 2019.The new service in The Villages will begin in early May, with authority to operate through the pandemic. The operation could expand to include deliveries from two additional CVS pharmacies in the area. An extension of the program is possible if a need remains, UPS said.&quot;Now more than ever, it's important that our customers have access to their prescriptions,&quot; said Jon Roberts, CVS Health chief operating officer, in a statement. &quot;In addition to our in-store pickup, free delivery services and drive through pickup, this drone delivery service provides an innovative method to reach some of our customers.&quot;The first flights will be less than one-half mile and land near the retirement community. Initially, a ground vehicle will complete the delivery to the residents' home, UPS said.Technology and health care experts are exploring how to use unmanned aerial and ground-based vehicles during a pandemic, including for:  * Delivery of supplies to front-line health care workers.  * Transport of test results to labs.  * Delivery of medicines and meals to quarantined individuals.  * Spraying disinfectant in public areas.  * Serving as mobile public speakers to inform people of safety measures and tips.  * Patrolling high-risk areas with photoelectric sensors to enforce curfews.  * Monitoring the health of people with heat signature, infrared cameras or computer vision systems that can check temperature, heart and respiratory rates.Earlier this month, UPS Flight Forward announced it participated in tests with the U.S. government, the Virginia Center for Innovative Technology, and drone technology companies Drone Up and  Workhorse Group to determine how drone systems can assist medical professionals in stopping the spread of the coronavirus. Among the use cases explored were picking up lab specimens and test kits.The tests focused on safety, sorting out right-of-way for vehicles in the air, developing processes, policies and training for safe day/night operations, and proposed policy changes that would enable further use of unmanned aerial systems.&quot;We've proven through ongoing commercial drone delivery programs that effective drone delivery of medical products is faster than conventional ground-based transportation,&quot; said Scott Price, UPS chief strategy and transformation officer, in a statement.Data collected during the fast-paced simulation will be used to determine how private-sector drone operators can effectively supplement emergency response and certain patient care. The findings and recommendations will be included in a report to the White House.Photo: UPSSee more from Benzinga  * Heartland Shippers Feel 20-Foot Box Squeeze  * New Aircraft Recruited For COVID Mission; Air Cargo Gets Window Seat  * Soros, Siemens Fund Expansion Of Electric Infrastructure Management Startup(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-04-27	2020-04-27 10:00:05	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Trump Holds Postal Service Hostage to Settle Amazon Score	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Your neighborhood mail carrier and their co-workers at your local post office are doing dangerous work these days. The coronavirus has killed 44 of the U.S. Postal Service’s 630,000 workers and an additional 1,219 have tested positive.And the White House is threatening to kill the Postal Service itself unless it gets greater control over its operations and its future. If this was any other administration this might be written off as the federal government using a crisis to jockey for position and streamline a struggling enterprise long overdue for change. But this isn’t any other White House.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, President Donald Trump said that until the Postal Service raised its prices for package deliveries he wouldn’t allow Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to release $10 billion in aid earmarked for it in the federal government’s epic, $2.6 trillion national bailout.“The Postal Service is a joke,” the president said. “Because they’re handing out packages for Amazon and other internet companies, and every time they bring a package they lose money on it.”This isn’t true, of course. Package deliveries have provided a welcome boost to the Postal Service’s top and bottom lines in recent years. In fact, packages are a strength in an otherwise sagging operation pulled down by a steep drop on the amount of old-fashioned snail mail it delivers and a congressional mandate that it prefund future retiree health benefits for employees -- a reality I outlined in a recent column. Digital retailers like Amazon.com Inc. that ship copious loads of packages have been a financial godsend for the Postal Service, but that business hasn’t been nearly robust enough to replace all of that lost mail revenue. So a price increase on package deliveries isn’t the silver bullet the president claims it to be.The Postal Service certainly needs a silver bullet, and it should take the form of enough federal aid to sustain it and its workers in the near term. Postmaster General Megan Brennan told Congress recently that unless the Postal Service gets about $89 billion in grants and aid it will be out of money by the end of the year. A $10 billion grant is barely a start in that scenario, but it’s a much-needed start for an enterprise that provides vital connective tissue for the nation’s rural areas, senior citizens and commercial deliveries.Over the long term, the Postal Service needs to reimagine its services and its finances, and it could team up with the White House to do that. But all signs point to a White House more interested in controlling than rebuilding. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Mnuchin is using the $10 billion lifeline as a bargaining chip that would allow the White House to take “unprecedented control over key operations.” That would include management of the Postal Service’s finances, senior hiring decisions (including the postmaster general) and union negotiations — as well as delivery charges for packages and the ability to review contracts with companies that use those services.You know, companies such as Amazon.Amazon’s founder and chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, owns the Post, and Trump would undoubtedly consider the Post’s reporting shaded by that fact. I’ll go out on a limb and say that I don’t think the Post’s reporting on the Postal Service was shaded at all, but I certainly think the president’s misguided hostage negotiations over the service’s future are shaded by his animosity toward Bezos.Trump has had Bezos in his sights for a long time. The Post has published seminal and award-winning coverage of Trump’s political and business dealings as well as his shortcomings, legal perils and personal life, making it a routine Trump target. Amazon is challenging the circumstances under which it lost a big cloud-services contract with the Pentagon last fall, an outcome that may or may not have had something to do with Trump’s dislike for Bezos. And Bezos famously butted heads with American Media Inc., publisher of the National Enquirer, after the Enquirer threatened to publish intimate photos Bezos exchanged with his girlfriend. American Media’s CEO is David Pecker, a longtime Trump crony.But as my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Joe Nocera pointed out in an earlier column, it’s absurd to think that Trump can truly use the Postal Service to harm Bezos or Amazon. The company has already established its own delivery network to save money on delivery fees it pays FedEx and the United Parcel Service and it could possibly expand that system if working with the Postal Service becomes prohibitively expensive. The Postal Service, however, could lose out to FedEx and UPS if raising its delivery rates makes it less competitive with them.A responsible president would focus on fixing what actually needs to be fixed at the Postal Service rather than using it to settle old scores. On the other hand, a responsible president also wouldn’t suggest at a televised press briefing that injecting disinfectants might offer a promising cure for the coronavirus.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gestured at all of this in a press conference on Friday when asked whether the Postal Service would receive a federal bailout. She noted that seniors still rely on the service to receive medications and that the country will rely on it further if the pandemic makes vote-by-mail a necessity in November. She also said there had been bipartisan support to protect the Postal Service until Trump intervened. “They tell me it came right from the president,” she noted. “No money for the post office. Instead, inject Lysol into your lung as we shut down the states.”This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Timothy L.

2020-04-17	2020-04-17 19:27:41	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	More Humanitarian Aid For US Pours In By Air	The frequency of freighter aircraft transporting emergency supplies to the U.S. from overseas continues to grow in support of government and private-sector relief efforts for coronavirus prevention and treatment.Project Airbridge, the airlift organized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to expedite delivery of medical supplies for health care distributors, has already completed 44 flights since March 29, with 50 or more additional flights scheduled to arrive in the coming days and weeks, according to the latest information from the agency. One of the flights, for example, is bringing 7,500 COVID-19 test kits manufactured in South Korea under contract with FEMA. Each kit has the ability to test 100 people.Vice President Mike Pence said at a White House briefing this week that the average daily flight is carrying 22 million face masks, building up the average seven-day inventory to 80 million masks.New airports are also being added to the mix as the flight tempo picks up. This week a Russian cargo plane landed at Rockford International Airport, located about an hour's drive west of Chicago, with N-95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves and gowns, according to FEMA.Ken Ryan, the airport's director of cargo business development, said Antonov Airlines operated the flight using a heavylift AN-124 aircraft. The shipment went to a warehouse in Elk Grove, near O'Hare International Airport, for distribution. Rockford, which has seen huge growth in cargo business the past two years, has been told to expect more FEMA flights, but there is no schedule yet, Ryan said.Project Airbridge is also using the following airports as import gateways: Chicago O'Hare; New York JFK; Miami; Louisville, Los Angeles; Dallas Fort-Worth and Columbus, Ohio (Rickenbacker).UPS said it has added more than 200 flights in April, using its own fleet and chartered freighters, to support Project Airbridge and other healthcare-related missions. The vast majority of flights are from Asia to the U.S. and Europe.UPS is supporting FEMA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in multiple ways, including warehousing, distribution and parcel delivery of test kits. The integrated logistics company is also supporting public health agencies worldwide with the shipment of vital health care equipment, including the recent shipment of ventilators to the UK's National Health Service.On Tuesday, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) announced it is working with Qiagen, a provider of molecular diagnostics and sample preparation technologies, to deliver nucleic acid extraction kits critical to COVID-19 testing, as well as testing cartridges around the world. The testing kits are produced at Qiagen's plant in Hilden, Germany.Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAWW), which also is heavily involved in Project Airbridge, said Thursday it donated two flights to New York University's Langone Health in the past week. The flights from Shanghai landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Chicago O'Hare. On board the Boeing 747-400 freighters were medical gowns, face shields and masks.  * Cargo being loaded in Shanghai (Photo: Atlas Air)&quot;The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the accessibility of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers at NYU Langone Health, and across the world,&quot; NYU Langone CEO Robert I.

2020-04-17	2020-04-17 09:00:26	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	The Covid Test Lab That Could Save America	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A series of dispatches from America in the age of Covid-19.A decade ago Joe DeRisi received a letter from a woman with a picture of herself wrapped in a boa constrictor. “I heard you’re a virus hunter,” the letter began before going on to explain that the snake, which she referred to as “Mr. Larry,” was her service animal. She was terrified that an illness then killing snakes all over the world might carry away Mr. Larry too. “I thought, ‘Wow, that’s crazy,’” recalls DeRisi, a biochemist at the University of California at San Francisco. It actually wasn’t much crazier than a lot of the other problems that landed on his desk. Human beings with illnesses that mystified the global medical establishment often found their way to DeRisi. Snakes, not so much. “I let the letter sit on my desk for maybe a year,” he said. “It was a weird letter.”One day his curiosity got the best of him. He called a vet he knew and asked, “Is it true that snakes are dying of some mysterious disease?” “Oh yeah,” said the vet, as if everyone knew this, and told DeRisi that zoos everywhere were seeing their snake populations being wiped out. “I then went on YouTube, and typed in ‘Hey, my snake is sick,’” says DeRisi. “And all these videos start popping up, from all over the world.”DeRisi soon realized that he had stumbled onto a snake pandemic whose origin remained entirely uninvestigated. He ordered up some dead snakes so that he might play around with their genome in the same way that, back in 2003, he’d analyzed human genomes after people were killed by a mysterious new coronavirus that had surfaced in Hong Kong. (SARS, the new virus was being called.)To work the same magic on snakes that he did on humans — that is, to separate the genetic material that was “python” from everything else, he needed to know the python’s genome. “Who founded the Python Genome Project?” says DeRisi. “No one!” And so DeRisi took some of his graduate students to the San Francisco aquarium, extracted the blood of one of its snakes, and began what amounted to the Snake Genome project. Once he was done, he was able to take the genetic material of an infected snake, eliminate everything that was “snake,” and thus isolate what wasn’t snake: the virus. “It was actually an ancient ancestor of Ebola,” says DeRisi. “Dinosaurs had this same virus.”*****Just before the SARS epidemic, DeRisi had created a new computer chip, which he called the Virochip. It allowed him, in effect, to take the DNA from a sick person and sort the human genetic material from whatever wasn’t human — say a virus. “The game is to separate you from everything else,” he said. In 2003, few knew about DeRisi’s new tool, and it never occurred to the public health authorities to consult him. “We literally had to beg the CDC to send us a sample of the virus,” DeRisi recalls.Eventually he got his hands on a sample, and presented it to the Virochip. It read SARS as one part cow coronavirus, one part bird coronavirus and one part human coronavirus — in other words, it did not match any known virus. “It was like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle from three different puzzles,” DeRisi says. “They didn’t fit together.” He sequenced the virus’s genome — and that’s what allowed others to figure out that it, like the new coronavirus, had come from a bat. “No one had ever seen bat coronaviruses,” DeRisi says. “They didn’t exist. We should have paid more attention the first time.”I tell you all this to explain why, on the night of April 11, I found myself driving across the Bay Bridge to see Joe DeRisi. He’s now the co-president of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, a nonprofit organization created a few years ago with a $600 million gift from the Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg and his physician wife, Priscilla Chan. As a graduate student Chan had heard DeRisi give a single lecture, about the computer chip that could detect and identify all viruses, known and unknown, and it had blown her mind. The Biohub’s stated mission was to eliminate all disease by the end of the 21st century, which sounds audacious but then: Why not? Chan asked herself who in the world might be able to do such a thing and decided that DeRisi was the best hope.That was an example of a general phenomenon: When a problem feels unsolvable it tends to find its way to DeRisi. Another example occurred at the end of February, when DeRisi’s office phone began to ring. He looked down, didn’t recognize the number and almost didn’t answer. “I thought it was a telemarketer, but I picked it up and it was Gavin Newsom,” says DeRisi of the governor of California. “He asked: ‘What are the three things California could screw up in the coming weeks?’ I said number one was testing. Because if there is no testing there isn’t even the possibility of a solution.” DeRisi thought testing was so important that he would soon forget the other two important things that California might screw up.He then watched the entire country screw up testing. By the second week of March it was clear that the absence of federal leadership, combined with the fragmented nature of the American health-care system, meant that tests for the coronavirus either were not available or were not processed by labs in anything like a useful period of time. He read stories of patients waiting 10 days for test results. “We heard that sending tests even to the CDC was taking days, not hours,” says DeRisi.Absent fast tests, the hospitals were being forced to treat anyone who rolled into the parking lot with coronavirus-like symptoms as if the patient had the virus, when more often than not, the patient did not. Beds in the coronavirus wing were being taken by people who didn’t need them; nurses and doctors were running through scarce protective gear they needed for actual coronavirus cases. But the biggest problem of having no tests was not knowing where the virus was, and where it was not. Without fast tests you could not isolate the people who needed to be isolated, or free up the people who didn’t.On March 12, DeRisi decided to turn the Biohub into a coronavirus testing lab. He enlisted the help of 200 University of California at San Francisco graduate students, and persuaded Newsom to issue an executive order that would allow the Biohub to operate under U.S. regulations, rather than the more stringent California ones, which prevented people not specifically trained to work in a clinical lab from doing so.His student army organized themselves into squads kept separate from one another — so that if one person contracted the virus it would incapacitate only one squad and not the entire army. Each squad had its hierarchy, and people learned the jobs of the people immediately above them, so that they could replace them if necessary. “We built in battlefield promotions,” says DeRisi. They looked into what was going on in the various markets, all tight, for the stuff you needed to run tests — the plastic jugs of chemical reagent, for example. They designed the lab around the supplies they were sure they’d have access to.The equipment — well, that was its own story. American medicine is littered with machines designed for testing. But they lay idle because the companies that made them were failing to supply the reagents they needed to work. UCSF itself had a machine, called the Panther, capable of processing 1,400 tests a day, but it was just sitting there unused for this very reason. “Big clinical testing machines are designed on the razor/razor blade model,” says DeRisi. “You can’t use them without their razors.” His graduate students either built the machines they needed themselves or grabbed wherever they could find that might be adapted. “Here is the frightening aspect of the global supply chain,” says DeRisi. “When there is a surge in demand, inventory goes to zero.”Eight days after the 200 volunteers started building the new UCSF testing lab, the Biohub was up and running. Since March 20, it’s been able to process 2,500 tests a day, at no cost. Quest Diagnostics, one of the biggest diagnostic labs in the country, was saying that if you sent them a test, it would take them a week to get back to you with an answer, along with their bill. In just one day more than it took Quest to process a single test, DeRisi built an entire lab that could process 2,500 of them. A day. For free. Any given test it could process inside of three hours. DeRisi was pretty sure his lab was bigger than any lab in the country that was faster than his, and faster than any lab that was bigger.It was also different, in an important way. The commercial labs are set up to take in the samples and spit out a simple answer: positive or negative. They aren’t set up, as the Biohub is, to sequence the genome of every positive specimen and look for variations among them. As it moves through the population, the virus replicates and, as DeRisi says, “every time you replicate something there is a chance of an error.” He’s already found tiny differences from one coronavirus genome to the next — not so great that it changes the essential nature of the virus but noticeable nevertheless.Those tiny disparities can paint a picture of how the virus has traveled and how widely it has spread. It’s a bit like a game of telephone. A group of people sit in a circle. A person starts the game by whispering a little story into the ear of the person to his right, who then repeats it to the person on her right, as best as she can. As the story travels around the circle, tiny flaws get introduced. If you knew the flaws — both the number and the nature — you could make good guesses about the number of people playing the game, and also where they were sitting in relation to one another. That’s exactly the sort of information we’re all now starving for: How is the virus spreading, and how many people have had it.The lab is a single room the size of half a basketball court organized into stations, and staffed by graduate students, in white coats and masks, working in shifts of roughly 60 people, around the clock. DeRisi walks me around and introduces me. The masked people are from everywhere in the world, and the only obvious pattern is that, when asked where they are from, the Americans answer with a city or a state, and the non-Americans with a country: China, Taiwan, Colorado, Tanzania, Lithuania, Florida, Canada, Phoenix, Belgium. None of them are doctors; they’re research scientists, many with PhDs; exactly zero of them have ever done the jobs they’re doing now. “It’s different from a regular research lab where people just do what they want and come and go as they please,” says DeRisi. “It’s more like a factory. A production line.”The graduate students were still getting used to the idea that some actual human is out there on the edge of a hospital bed, waiting to hear what they’ve found. One scientist tells me she has a version of a recurring dream she used to have when she worked as a cocktail waitress. “I used to have these terror dreams that we’d have 100 people need a cocktail at the same time for happy hour,” she says. “Now I have the same dream about thousands of people needing test results at once.”But this isn’t a dream. It’s the problem consuming American society at every level, even if it isn’t always put that way. Every question about when the country reopens is actually a question of when testing will be good enough to allow it to reopen. Every question about the virus itself — how lethal it is, how many people have it without knowing they have it — can only be answered by more testing. In mid-March, when DeRisi got started, the entire state of California was generating test results for only about 2,000 people a day — with tens of thousands of tests backed up in commercial labs. DeRisi knows he can help close this gap, doubling or even tripling his lab’s capacity to 6,000 a day from 2,500. In a sane world, the Biohub would be doing just that. Instead, it is receiving only about 200 tests each day. Two things interfere with DeRisi’s ability to solve the nation’s biggest problem. The first is that U.S. hospitals are either contractually obliged or habitually inclined to send tests to the for-profit labs, and the for-profit labs aren’t moving fast enough. The tests that arrive each morning and evening at the Biohub’s nonprofit lab come from the UCSF hospital down the street or public health clinics in surrounding counties. These clinics are places of last resort for people without health insurance, but they now offer the fastest and most reliable coronavirus tests.But the bigger problem is the scarcity of testing kits, for both rich and poor. Actually that’s not quite right. If you roll into a hospital parking lot with a dry cough and a fever and ask to be tested and they say, “Sorry, we have no testing kits,” what they likely mean is “We have no nasal swabs.” The long translucent sticks that can be inserted deep into the nasal passage, and offer the only reliable, safe method to obtain a sample of the virus, were manufactured in just two factories. One, in Northern Italy, was crippled by the virus, and other countries moved faster than the U.S. to soak up the nasal swabs on the market. “It’s the one thing if I could go back in time and change I would,” says DeRisi. “I wish I had bought 100,000 swabs. It was not on my radar. It was not a thing I thought would be a limiting factor in life.”When he said this, he was leaning back in a chair in a room down the hall from his new lab, filled with a dozen exhausted volunteers. Like DeRisi, the students were mostly infectious disease researchers, and so I took it as an opportunity to ask actual experts a bunch of seemingly relevant questions.“What comes first, a treatment or a vaccine?” I ask.Every one of them thought a treatment. “Coronavirus vaccines are tricky,” says DeRisi. “We still don’t have one for the common cold.”“How many of you are worried about getting the virus yourself?” I ask. They were all in their 20s and, I assumed, more or less immortal. Every hand in the room went up. Some already knew a person their age who had died from it.“It’s starting to knock off people who matter to us personally,” one says.More to the point: None of them knew why some people walked around never knowing they had the virus, while other people were killed by it. The knowledge simply didn’t exist.“It feels like a roll of the dice,” another of the young scientists adds. “But it’s a nasty roll of the dice.”Maybe hoping to cheer everyone up, DeRisi pointed out just how much worse the situation could be. “If the virus had a higher fatality rate we might be looking at societal collapse,” says DeRisi. “What if it was worse in kids? Would I be here? Or would I be looking for a cabin somewhere?”“It’s disturbing how much no one knows about this,” I say, at length.“Welcome to science,” says DeRisi. “You don’t have to scratch too much below the surface here to realize you have reached the limit of knowledge.”In the last week or so, word’s spread that the absence of nasal swabs is screwing up Joe DeRisi’s ability to save us from ourselves. The day after my visit he had a phone call from a UCSF donor. A big shot. “I know a guy who has some swabs,” the donor said. DeRisi was dubious: He’d already searched high and low, at every level of business and government, for the swabs. “I said, Really, you know a guy? Prove it.” The big shot said that he would have his friend overnight 5,000 swabs.The next day DeRisi went to the UPS Store, and grabbed the package. “I pop open the box and there’s 5,000 of something in there,” he says. “They clearly didn’t just fall off the back of a truck. And they kind of looked like swabs.” But they weren’t packaged, or sterile, so they clearly weren’t medical supplies of any kind. DeRisi picked one up and studied it. It looked familiar. Then he realized: eyelash brushes. Someone had actually bought eyelash brushes, relabeled them as medical swabs, and was now selling them at a huge profit.

2020-04-16	2020-04-16 20:02:36	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Squeezes Affiliates When They Can Least Afford It	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The coronavirus pandemic has gutted many U.S. businesses. Amazon.com Inc., of course, is one of the notable exceptions.The e-commerce giant is thriving as self-isolating consumers make more and more of their purchases online rather than risk Covid-19 infection by shopping outdoors. To illustrate the magnitude of the recent ramp-up, the company announced earlier this week it plans to hire another 75,000 workers, on top of the more than 100,000 employees it has already put on its payroll over the past month to deal with the increase in demand. And investors are noticing the trend as its shares have risen some 30% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500’s double-digit decline.But the sudden surge is not without its difficulties. On Thursday, CEO Jeff Bezos spoke about the company’s logistical challenges and the tremendous stress it has put on its supplier and delivery networks in his annual letter to shareholders, and to its workforce. Amid criticism about the degree to which it is protecting its workers, he cited efforts the company is making to step up safety measures, including increased social-distancing practices and virus testing. From a business standpoint, Amazon has had to make some difficult choices. Since mid-March, it has prioritized the stocking and delivery of essential items such as household staples and medical supplies, leading to longer delivery times for other items, while reportedly scrapping some promotions and scaling back coupons to keep customers from overloading their digital shopping carts. In addition, the company informed its customers earlier this month it will suspend its budding shipping service that competes with FedEx and UPS in June. While these steps are understandable and probably necessary at least until the pandemic ebbs, there is one move that is a bit of a head-scratcher. CNBC reported on Tuesday that Amazon will lower the commission rates it pays out in its affiliate marketing program starting next week. The program, called Amazon Associates, gives members a cut of any sales generated by links to an Amazon product listing. The reductions are significant across product categories. For example, the fee rate for furniture fell to 3% from 8% and the percentage for grocery declined to 1% from 5%.The move makes financial sense for Amazon. By lowering the payouts, it can manage the flow of demand and increase its own profitability. And in the current environment when supply is limited and consumer demand is high, there isn’t a need to pay high commissions for more orders. But for many affiliates — including digital media companies such as Buzzfeed and Vox Media, which have grown reliant on this type of marketing as a key revenue stream — the negative implications of Amazon’s move are vast. The tech giant’s decision will only add to the pressures on the media industry as corporations are already slashing ad budgets due to the economic aftereffects of Covid-19. Further, many online content creators, web marketers and small businesses that rely on the affiliate business for their livelihoods will likely get wiped out.Yes, Amazon has every right to look out for itself and exercise its market power. That’s capitalism. But it may also prove shortsighted in a couple ways. First, unfavorable public relations are inevitable. The upcoming stories on how Amazon stepped away from its loyal longtime partners just when they needed support the most will be bad optics. Second, Amazon should not forget Big Tech is still under a cloud of antitrust scrutiny from regulators. Flexing its ability to generate higher profits, when businesses are in turmoil can’t, isn’t a great look either.Given Amazon’s vast financial resources, does it really need to make this extra money now? Perhaps it’s not the right time. Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-04-15	2020-04-15 16:00:23	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Death of the Postal Service Would Hurt Trump’s Base Most of All	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s no surprise that President Donald Trump wants to let the U. S. Postal Service die.Remember in the spring of 2018, when Trump created a task force to “conduct a thorough evaluation of the operation and finances of the USPS?” His primary complaint then — and presumably now — was not so much that the Postal Service was losing billions every year but that it was aiding and abetting Amazon.com Inc., whose chief executive is Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post, which Trump despises. According to Trump, the Postal Service was delivering Amazon packages at a discount, which was supposedly adding to its growing deficit. Needless to say, that was exactly the opposite of the truth. Indeed, the Postal Service’s package business was one of the few areas where it made a profit.Now it appears as if Trump is hoping to use the coronavirus crisis to finish off the Postal Service. As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Timothy L. O’Brien pointed out in an earlier column, Postmaster General Megan Brennan has said the Postal Service needs $89 billion in federal aid or it will run out of money by the end of the year. But when Congress tried to add money for the Postal Service in the $2.2 trillion bailout bill it passed late last month, the administration insisted that the aid be stripped out of the bill before Trump would sign it. The Postal Service is now saying it will run out of money by September.In his column, O’Brien explains why the Postal Service remains a vital service for the U.S. — especially rural America — and that the way to fix its woes is to free it from congressional mandates that prevent it from taking cost-saving measures and seizing new revenue opportunities. I’d like to point out something else: the sheer idiocy of trying to cripple it — especially right now.There is both a business and a political dynamic, neither of which works in Trump’s favor. First, the idea that damaging the Postal Service will somehow hurt Amazon is ludicrous. It is true that the Postal Service performs an important function for the online giant. It delivers millions of packages “the last mile,” especially in rural communities that private delivery companies don’t serve. Let’s suppose the Postal Service could no longer perform that service, either because it ran out of money or because it was forced to end its contract with Amazon. The Postal Service would be hurt because it would lose a profitable line of business. But Amazon? It might become more profitable.It has already begun establishing its own delivery services to cut back on tens of millions of dollars it pays to FedEx and United Parcel Service. It has long talked about using drones to deliver packages. Amazon would almost certainly use the end of its relationship with the Postal Service to extend its own delivery network into every nook and cranny in America. There are few companies as customer-obsessed as Amazon. You can bet that, having heard the president’s threats, it already has a plan to fill the vacuum should it lose access to the Postal System. To everyone but the president, this seems pretty obvious.As for the politics, consider who would be hurt the most if the Postal Service went broke. The elites in the big, blue cities? Hardly. They use email and texts and go online to read their favorite magazines or conduct financial transactions. It’s the people in rural America, who often have substandard WiFi and mobile phone service and still count on mail delivery for, say, their Social Security checks, who would be hurt the most. That is, Trump would be hurting his supporters far more than his detractors.Then there is the timing. If the post office were to go broke in late September, that would leave only five weeks or so before the presidential election. One theory holds that Trump wants to damage the Postal Service before the election to prevent voting by mail, believing that depressing the turnout will help his re-election chances. The recent Wisconsin results would seem to suggest that’s a fool’s errand.But also, just imagine if Americans stopped receiving mail in October. Imagine if there were a delay in all those Social Security checks. Millions of people — millions of voters, many of them Trump supporters — would be furious. And though Trump would undoubtedly attempt to blame others, those voters would most likely blame him. Presidents simply don’t let the Postal Service go bust.Which, for those of us who can’t wait for Trump to be swept out of office, might be the best-case scenario. So go ahead, Mr. President, keep putting the hurt on the Postal Service. By the time you realize what an enormous mistake you’ve made, it’ll be too late. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2020-04-15	2020-04-15 13:10:32	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Trump's Comments On USPS Rates May Not Square With Agency's Recent Actions	To hear President Donald Trump tell it, there's nothing wrong with the finances of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) that a parcel rate hike, notably on Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), its largest shipping customer, wouldn't cure. Trump commented on  Wednesday, April 8, that the USPS &quot;ought to do that, and we are looking into it. We've been pushing them [USPS] now for over a year.&quot;However, USPS has for years been raising its prices on shipping and package delivery services as demand has increased along with the growth of e-commerce. The 2020 increases ranged from a little more than 2% for USPS Parcel Select service, in which big shippers place bulk consignments deep into the postal network for last-mile deliveries, to a little more than 4% for Priority Mail, which USPS handles on an end-to-end basis and which, unlike Parcel Select, has tight on-time guarantees. In 2019, USPS hiked rates on those same products by high single-digit to low double-digit levels. Ironically, USPS eased off on the pace of rate hikes in 2020 partly because of concerns it might be pricing itself out of the market vis-a-vis its competitors, which are the same companies that use it for Parcel Select.In addition, USPS' 2019 data analyzed by consultancy ShipMatrix concluded that Amazon actually paid more to ship with USPS than it did through its own network of delivery service providers (DSPs). USPS generated $2.34 in revenue for each parcel it handled for Amazon, as well as its two other large Parcel Select customers, United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS) and FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX), the consultancy said.By contrast, it cost Amazon $1.75, on average, to move a parcel through its own network of fulfillment and delivery partners, ShipMatrix said. Despite the price hikes, Parcel Select has remained the lowest-cost option for the 1- to 5-pound parcels that still dominate e-commerce business-to-consumer deliveries.In a letter sent Friday, April 10, to Treasury Secretary Stephen T. Mnuchin, the Parcel Shippers Association said the administration labors under the &quot;mistaken impression&quot; that USPS underprices its package delivery services. &quot;This claim has been widely debunked by independent commissions, experts and virtually everyone&quot; who has studied the issue, said Jim Cochrane, CEO of the parcel group and a former USPS executive. Cochrane said the perception has been promoted by a USPS competitor, which he did not name in the letter. Cochrane did not respond to an email request for comment on Tuesday.Deaf ears at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.The various data points have so far fallen on deaf ears at the White House, if they've been heard at all. In a stunning move, the Trump administration refused to go along with any direct funding for the agency in the $2.2 trillion emergency coronavirus relief bill signed into law March 27. The White House would only agree to a $10 billion loan, with terms dictated by the Treasury Department. The Washington Post reported over the weekend that Trump threatened not to sign the legislation if it included funding for USPS.The original Senate version had called for $13 billion in direct aid, while the House version would have injected $20 billion to $25 billion to reimburse USPS for lost revenue, provided $11 billion in debt relief, reset USPS' borrowing limit with the Treasury at $15 billion, and eliminated an annual $3 billion borrowing ceiling.Initially, it was thought that with $8 billion in cash and $4 billion in existing borrowing capacity, USPS could make it through 2020 once it had access to the $10 billion loan authority. If it ever was the case, it isn't now, according to USPS officials. Last week, the presidentially appointed USPS Board of Governors told Congress that, at the current rate of losses and spending, the agency will run out of cash before September 30 (the end of the federal fiscal year). The Board of Governors requested $75 billion in the next round of coronavirus relief. Of that, $25 billion would be used to offset pandemic-related losses, $25 billion would take the form of a grant to fund modernization projects, and the remainder would give USPS unrestricted access to borrowing authority from the Treasury.On April 9, Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that a sharp drop in mail volume during the coronavirus pandemic will result in a $13 billion revenue loss tied &quot;directly to COVID-19&quot; in the current fiscal year. Over the next 18 months, that loss would approach $22 billion and would exceed $54 billion within the next decade, Brennan warned.The 245-year existence of the USPS may hinge on what emerges from the next round of funding legislation. Mnuchin considers any language calling for a direct capital injection to be tantamount to a &quot;poison pill&quot; that could thwart progress on additional federal funding, according to the Washington Post article.USPS, which continues to process mail and parcels every day during the pandemic, was on shaky financial ground before the virus hit U.S. shores. Volumes and revenues in its core first-class and marketing mail products have been in multi-year declines due to digitalization. At the same time, UPS and FedEx have increased their use of dynamic routing technology capable of redirecting the flow of packages into their own networks. The software can identify last-mile deliveries typically handled by USPS and divert them onto their own vans and trucks.FedEx and UPS have been aggressively courting small to midsize shippers that are heavy users of the USPS Priority Mail service, which generates about four times the revenue per piece as Parcel Select, according to Satish Jindel, founder of ShipMatrix. Jindel has estimated that USPS may lose about 10% of that volume due to diversion to rivals.UPS is also under pressure from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, which represents company drivers, to shift as much business as possible away from USPS and onto its members' routes.Amazon, meanwhile, is handling more of its high-density urban deliveries through its own network, leaving USPS with the less dense suburban and rural routes that, by law, it must serve. The USPS share of Amazon's deliveries has fallen over the past three years. FedEx has said that it will end its last-mile relationship with USPS by the end of 2020.The three companies make up the bulk of USPS' shipping and package revenue, and analysts said it would be impossible for new business to fill the void should they all part ways with the agency.As a way to reduce costs and focus on profitable revenue, Jindel said USPS should refuse any parcel consignment that cannot fit inside mailboxes, where it still has a monopoly. The agency is allowed to turn away such business, according to the consultant.Image: Flickr/Travis WiseSee more from Benzinga  * Container Lines Slash Even More Services To Prop Up Rates  * Coronavirus Kills Traffic  * Airlines Face 4 Billion Bath As Economy Dives(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-04-14	2020-04-14 10:30:23	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Don’t Kill the U.S. Postal Service. Unshackle It.	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.S. Postal Service has had a foot in the grave for years, with fatalists regularly urging it to accept the inevitable. “The Post Office Is Dying Because We Don’t Need It Anymore,” a tech- savvy writer advised in 2011. “The U.S. Postal Service Is Dying. Let It,” a libertarian blogger suggested in 2017. “Why Do We Have U.S. Mail And How Much Longer Will We Have It?” a self-described “customer experience futurist” asked in Forbes last year.Mother Nature recently decided to weigh in, too. The coronavirus pandemic has delivered a potentially fatal blow to the postal service, a 228-year-old mainstay of American life that traces its roots to the Constitution and whose services and ubiquity are made real by carriers visiting mailboxes and post offices that remain neighborhood fixtures.Postmaster General Megan Brennan told Congress recently that unless the Postal Service gets $50 billion in grants and aid, a $25 billion unrestricted credit line from the Treasury Department and $14 billion to pay off debts — $89 billion overall — it will run out of money by the end of the year. Brennan said that mail delivery volumes have plunged so drastically that the Postal Service is likely to have a $13 billion revenue shortfall this fiscal year.“The Postal Service is holding on for dear life, and unless Congress and the White House provide meaningful relief in the next stimulus bill, the Postal Service could cease to exist,” Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat who is chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, observed during Brennan’s testimony.Our romantic attachment to letters from far away, birthday cards and exotic stamps aside, why not just use the coronavirus-crisis to finally put the Postal Service out of its misery and rely on email and private carriers instead? Why do we keep subsidizing a losing enterprise long since eclipsed by technological innovation?After all, the Postal Service has been struggling for a long time. Unlike private companies, it can’t pick and choose its customers. The law requires it to operate everywhere in the country, and it does. It has nearly 500,000 employees and the nation's largest domestic retail network — bigger than McDonald’s Corp., Starbucks Corp. and Walmart Inc. combined. It operates 34,000 facilities and 232,000 vehicles. That’s expensive; the Postal Service’s payroll alone is about $157 million a day.Before the coronavirus outbreak, the Postal Service was processing and delivering about 182 million pieces of first-class mail each day at the bargain rate of 55 cents a letter. But a federal agency, not the Postal Service, decides whether or not postage rates can rise — which hamstrings the service’s ability to fund itself more robustly. (Contrary to popular belief, the Postal Service hasn’t traditionally received taxpayer funding for its operating expenses and pays its way by selling postage and other products and services.) Federal overseers also dictate how many days a week the mail has to be delivered and how many post offices have to remain open.In a press briefing last week, President Donald Trump offered a diagnosis of what ails the Postal Service. Its demise is due to “these Internet companies that give their stuff to the Postal Service — packages.” Yeah, but no. The president’s critique stems from his long-running vendetta against Amazon.com Inc., a large customer of the Postal Service. Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, owns the Washington Post, whose coverage the president resents and, well, you get it. This may weirdly wind up informing how much support the federal government provides the Postal Service as it lies on its deathbed, but singling out package delivery as the force dragging the service down is wildly ill-informed.Mail delivery, in fact, remains the lifeblood of the Postal Service, and  it has been withering for years:  142.6 billion pieces of mail were delivered in 2019, compared with 216 billion pieces in 2006, which turned out to be a peak year. While e-commerce has given a handsome revenue boost to the Postal Service because of a jump in package deliveries, that hasn’t been nearly enough money to right the ship — packages still remain a relatively small part of what mail carriers deliver.In its semiannual report to Congress last fall, long before the coronavirus emerged, the Postal Service described its financial situation as dire. It recorded a net loss of $3.9 billion in fiscal 2018, following net losses of $18.9 billion for the fiscal years 2014 through 2017. A big chunk of those losses are due to a mandate from Congress that the service prefunds future retiree health benefits for its employees — a requirement that many other public and private entities don’t have to live with.For most of its history, the Postal Service believed that demand for its mail services would grow alongside the country’s population boom. And demand followed that script. Until it didn’t. Email and other services created an end-run that nobody anticipated when the Postal Service’s business model was invented. Time and crises have since undermined it even further.But simply pulling the plug on the Postal Service isn’t the answer. It still provides a vital lifeline to often unwired rural communities around the country, and older Americans depend upon it more than millennials and other younger correspondents. Those lithe private competitors – FedEx Corp., United Parcel Service Inc. and Amazon – still rely on the Postal Service to ship packages to the unprofitable “last mile” destinations their own services don’t reach. Households that operate small businesses often depend on the Postal Service’s package delivery as well.The Postal Service’s reach and its broad network of experienced, committed employees are assets, not liabilities. The network just needs to be reconfigured and repurposed, in some wrenching ways given how the coronavirus may permanently alter how consumers transact. The service should get more control over how much it charges for its services, how many people it employs and how easily it can innovate. Many post offices may have to be closed, but others could be reconfigured to also provide banking and licensing services if and when the world normalizes.Reimagine the Postal Service.

2020-04-10	2020-04-10 10:00:11	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	For the Next Pandemic, Run the Trump Playbook in Reverse	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As the coronavirus pandemic continues, Bloomberg Opinion will be running a series of features by our columnists that consider the long-term consequences of the crisis. This column is part of a package on public health. For more, see Max Nisen on creating a faster vaccine, Virginia Postrel on the renewed promise of telemedicine and Faye Flam on a  grim future for the medical profession.“Allow me to say as I told her personally today, the governor of Oregon, Governor Kate Brown — her unilateral decision to send 140 ventilators … to New York, to me was in the very highest American tradition of loving your neighbor. And when I talked to Governor Cuomo, Mr. President, he said they never asked Oregon for the ventilators and Governor Brown hadn’t even called him to tell him that she was doing that. It really is remarkable.”So spoke Vice President Mike Pence during Saturday’s coronavirus briefing, and on one level, he’s right. With ventilators arguably the nation’s most precious piece of equipment, it was remarkable that a governor on the West Coast sent 140 of them to a state in dire need on the other side of the country. The next day, Washington Governor Jay Inslee returned more than 400 ventilators to the federal government so that they could be used in harder-hit states.“I’ve said many times: We are all in this together,” Inslee said.On another level, however, the fact that Brown and Inslee had to take it upon themselves to ship unused ventilators suggests something appalling: The federal government, which is the only entity with the resources and capacity to truly manage this crisis, is missing in action.Yes, there are daily press briefings, in which some facts are conveyed and warnings issued (along with occasional misinformation from President Donald Trump), and they have some limited utility. But if this crisis were being managed properly, the federal government would know where every ventilator in the country was, and it would be able to quickly deploy them to the states where they were most needed.To put it another way, what the Trump administration should’ve done in late January was to mobilize the entire federal government. That it still hasn’t done so is both inexplicable and shocking.*****Federal mobilization is common when disaster hits. Protocols have been in place for decades. After Hurricane Sandy, a half-dozen agencies, led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, worked together to help the hardest-hit areas recover. A similarly coordinated effort followed the outbreak of the H1N1 virus in 2009. What’s unusual about the current crisis is that it’s affecting all 50 states at once, rather than a single region ravaged by, say, a hurricane. But that’s all the more reason for the federal government to be running the show.In fact, the government already has a plan in place for dealing with what we’re now facing. In 2005, according to ABC News, President George W. Bush read an advance copy of John M. Barry’s book about the 1918 flu pandemic, “The Great Influenza.” “This happens every hundred years,” he told other officials. “We need a national strategy.”Over the next three years, prodded by the president, administration officials created a detailed pandemic-response strategy. According to Fran Townsend, Bush’s homeland-security adviser, it included an outline for a global early-warning system, money for vaccine technology and the now-infamous national stockpile for protective equipment, ventilators and so on.President Barack Obama’s administration confronted outbreaks of the Ebola, Zika and H1N1 viruses. Although these had limited effect in the U.S., they highlighted the very real possibility of a pandemic wreaking havoc here. By the end of Obama’s second term, his National Security Council had developed a 69-page playbook for responding to such threats.As Obama was leaving office, members of his national-security team conducted a so-called table-top exercise on pandemics for the incoming Trump officials. The reception their presentation received, according to Politico, was “chilly.”*****So what should’ve happened once it was clear the pandemic would threaten the U.S.? I spoke to half a dozen officials who have been involved in preparing for and dealing with disasters, including Ashton Carter, the former defense secretary; Juliette Kayyem, the former assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs at the Department of Homeland Security; and Michèle Flournoy, the former undersecretary of defense for policy. Here are some of the messages I took away from those conversations.The Department of Health and Human Services needs a seat at the disaster-preparation table. In the Washington Post’s definitive recounting of the Trump administration’s early mistakes, HHS Secretary Alex Azar is portrayed as trying desperately to get the White House to take his warnings about the pandemic seriously. One problem was that Azar had “a strained relationship with the president,” who viewed his warnings as “alarmist.”But a deeper issue was that HHS has never played a prominent role in disaster preparation. “During any disaster, FEMA plays a big role, and so does the Commerce Department, which knows where all the industrial production is,” said Andrew Philip Hunter, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Because the government has generally done disaster-planning with natural disasters in mind, HHS has never been factor. As a result, it lacks employees with the necessary skills.“There needs to be greater focus on health intelligence,” said Kayyem. “And the health experts need to have access to the national security apparatus, which tends to discount health issues.”The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should be overhauled. Remember how disastrously FEMA performed following Hurricane Katrina in 2005? After it was over, the agency, embarrassed by its performance, worked to right itself — and did so with very little additional funding. The coronavirus crisis is the CDC’s Katrina.First, the agency should’ve been much more forceful in alerting the country to what was coming. Its flip-flop on whether to wear masks in public damaged its already strained credibility. And then there’s the issue of testing, which is at the heart of what the CDC is supposed to do in a pandemic. The agency insisted on coming up with its own Covid-19 test even though the protocols for a perfectly good one had been published by the World Health Organization. When the CDC’s test turned out to be faulty, federal officials took weeks before allowing academic and private labs to develop alternate versions.This lag is perhaps the most important reason why even now, there aren’t nearly enough tests being conducted — and why the U.S. has had to practically shut down instead of relying on the “contact tracing” that worked so well in South Korea.Invoking the Defense Production Act should be a priority, not a last resort. Just about everybody I spoke with was mystified that Trump has been so reluctant to use the DPA, which gives the president expansive authority to “instruct everybody to do anything that is in service of our national security,” as Carter put it.What’s more, it is used routinely, mainly when the government wants to prioritize its own production needs over a company’s commercial needs. Companies are used to it, and know how to deal with it. And it’s not just about manufacturing. A government mobilization might include using the DPA to require FedEx Corp. or United Parcel Service Inc. to ferry emergency equipment. It might require having Amazon.com Inc. use its cloud services as a repository for critical data. It might mean that private hospitals have to act as public ones during emergencies. And so on.What makes no sense is using the DPA the way Trump has — as a means of embarrassing and punishing companies he’s annoyed with.Industry needs to be involved in federal pandemic planning. There is something inspiring about the way companies small and large have pitched in to help. Last week, I spoke to Karen Atta, who runs her own commercial sculpture studio in New York City. Because her firm deals in plastics, she realized she could make face shields for the hospital workers caring for Covid-19 patients. She and her six employees have since made 1,000 of them, she told me, and hospitals have eagerly snapped them up.The problem is that she hasn’t been able to get through to state or city officials, so they have no idea that she’s doing this. She’s also had to use GoFundMe to pay for the effort. This isn’t how it should work. The federal government should have a list of companies with the capability to shift production to the materiel the country needs, and the companies should know that they might be called on in an emergency. That requires a great deal of advanced planning and coordination. But it’s a must.Logistics matter. On Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the government had contracted with Amazon Canada to deliver critical medical supplies. He was showing that he understood the supreme importance of logistics in surviving a national pandemic. In the U.S., there are three logistics-related issues that need urgent attention.The first is that the federal government needs to be the sole entity purchasing the equipment the country needs. What’s happening now — with states trying to outbid each other for masks and ventilators — is insane.Second, the government needs to know where all the equipment resides, whether in the national stockpile or in private hands. That will require a reasonably sophisticated database — but really, it’s nothing Big Tech can’t handle.Finally, it will require access to planes, trains and trucks to move the equipment where it’s most useful. This could be done by the armed services, which have extensive logistics experience, or by delivery companies that are pressed into service.There can only be one person in charge. And that person shouldn’t be the president. Yes, have a task force, but it should only consist of leaders with genuine expertise — in infectious diseases, logistics, manufacturing, communication and so on. The person in change needs to be an expert in managing disasters. “You could take a senior person in industry or a retired military officer and say `Here’s a chance to serve your country for a limited period of time,’” said Flournoy. “And then really empower that person.”As for the president, he or she should be the chief communicator, but shouldn’t be the one deciding which companies should be making ventilators.*****The most successful mobilization in U.S. history was during World War II, when President Franklin Roosevelt followed exactly this approach: He put General Motors president William Knudsen in charge of military production and gave him tremendous authority. By the war’s end, 30% of America’s manufacturing capacity had been turned over to defense needs, with Ford Motor Co. making bombers, Chrysler making tanks and so on.When the next pandemic hits — and can anyone doubt that it will? — we’ll need a mobilization that will once again be equal to the task, just as in World War II. The good news is that many of the necessary elements are already in place. But a tremendous amount of additional planning will be required, involving industry, federal health officials, Army logistics teams, technology companies and others. It can’t start soon enough.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2020-04-09	2020-04-09 15:29:39	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Now May Be the Perfect Time to Snap Up UPS	UPS (NYSE:UPS) is a well-managed company, but UPS stock has seen better days. Like everything else, the package delivery company's future is cloudy thanks to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Even so, I remain optimistic about the company's long-term prognosis, however rough the short-term is going to be.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThree years ago, Wall Street sent UPS shares into the &quot;penalty box&quot; after CEO David Abney committed the crime -- at least in the eyes of short-term traders -- of investing $20 billion in the company. Some investors haven't forgiven Abney for his action. Shares of UPS dropped off hard during the latter part of 2018, as Wall Street worried about the massive spend.Fast forward to the present, and evidence abounds that Abney's bet on new airplanes and 10 million square feet of automation has paid off.  Investments Pay Off for UPS Stock During the Atlanta-based company's most recent earnings report, UPS reported its third straight gain in profit margins. Operating profit rose to 11.1% from 10.1% a year earlier. The adjusted cost to deliver a package dropped by 3.2% thanks to Abney's investments.   UPS also picked up business from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) after FedEx (NYSE:FDX) cut ties with the e-commerce site because of Amazon's plans to start its own package delivery business. According to UPS, Amazon now accounts for about 12% of its overall revenue. Although UPS's growing dependency on Amazon is a concern, it's nothing that keeps me up at nights because it would be costly for Amazon to replace them.   * 7 Companies That Deserve to Be S&P 500 Stocks  The company is broadening its weekend delivery options and is expanding services to small- and medium-sized businesses. It also is adding more than 5 million square feet of new automated capacity. I'm also a fan of UPS's Flight Forward drone delivery service, which last year got clearance from the FAA to run a &quot;drone airline.&quot; A recent forecast estimates the drone package delivery market will hit $27.4 billion by 2030, indicating a compound annual growth rate of 44.7% since 2019. Coronavirus Still Takes a TollEven so, the company will get hit hard by the economic slowdown along with every company that is dependent on consumer spending. Analysts at Credit Suisse recently slashed their 2020 earnings per share forecasts by 15 percent to $6.68 &quot;in light of the broader macro implications that have emerged from the coronavirus pandemic.&quot;Shares of UPS are down nearly 16% so far during 2020 as investors sold off in the wake of disappointing earnings guidance and of course, again as Covid-19 ground the economy to a near-halt. Valuation-wise, UPS stock isn't anything special. The shares trade at a trailing price-earnings multiple of approximately 18, in line with the S&P 500's valuation of 19.6. However, its dividend offers a yield of 4%, which isn't anything to sneeze at in the current low-interest-rate environment. The time to buy UPS stock is now, because it will become more expensive if -- as many experts expect -- the economy snaps back when the pandemic subsides.Jonathan Berr is an award-winning freelance journalist who has focused on business news since 1997.

2020-04-08	2020-04-08 21:26:58	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Puts Outside Delivery Program On ice	In late 2017, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) launched a pilot to offer parcel deliveries to businesses outside its retail and fulfillment universe. It was thought the program would lead to the biggest transport network build-out in years, and would put Amazon in direct competition with FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) for the first time.Now the initiative, Amazon Shipping, has been put on hold, overtaken by unprecedented life-or-death events, as well as a perception, fair or not, that the program may not have lived up to the billing.Amazon has notified customers that the program will be suspended, effective in June. The company will help customers transition out of the program, according to a communique reviewed in The Wall Street Journal. The initiative targeted businesses that had previously not used Amazon to sell goods and fulfill orders. The pilot began in Los Angeles in December 2017 and expanded in early 2019 to New York, Chicago and London. The program is not believed to have generated meaningful revenue or cost savings from more favorable shipment density characteristics.Amazon has not publicly commented on the development. However, it's apparent that the company is focusing its resources to cope with a surge in demand as the COVID-19 pandemic keeps people indoors and almost exclusively reliant on home deliveries of online orders. Amazon has announced plans to hire 100,000 employees — with 80,000 already hired — prioritizing deliveries of essential items, and pushed out delivery windows for its Amazon Prime and Amazon Fresh grocery customers.Ravi Shanker, transport analyst for Morgan Stanley & Co. (NYSE: MS), said in a note Wednesday that Amazon is likely to resume the delivery initiative once global markets return to some semblance of normal. The company is &quot;pulling back&quot; on the investment in light of the current situation, Shanker said. Once current demand calms down, Amazon will launch a &quot;full-fledged&quot; outside delivery service, cherry-picking the densest lanes in the process, according to Shanker.UPS, which accounts for about 23% of Amazon's annual shipping costs and is its largest shipping vendor, will be most at risk from Amazon's move, Shanker said. FedEx and UPS cut ties in 2019, though Amazon reinstated FedEx as a hauler of some Amazon volumes during the high-volume holiday period.In a December report, Shanker forecast a full-scale launch by the end of 2020. However, the timetable is likely to be pushed out a few months due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, he said in the Wednesday note.However, Matthew White, analyst for consultancy iDrive Logistics, said the delivery program faces structural challenges that will lead Amazon to delay the rollout for at least five years, with a 30% chance that it will ever be relaunched. The pilot was viewed as a way to amortize the costs of any excess shipping capacity during nonpeak periods for Amazon Logistics, the Amazon unit that provides integrated fulfillment and delivery services for Amazon customers, White said. However, the surge in traffic related to the pandemic, as well as what may be a permanent upshift in demand as more consumers and businesses acclimate to e-commerce, means that Amazon is &quot;looking at an indefinite peak season&quot; for logistics, he said. In this scenario, there is little value in competing with large incumbents like FedEx and UPS for midsize e-commerce accounts where low-margin, capital-intensive transportation programs is the only category that can be monetized, he added.The program also has shortcomings for prospective customers, White said. In reviewing an Amazon Shipping proposal for a large customer, IDrive found that the offering did not allow the customer to choose the last-mile provider. Ceding delivery control doesn't sit well with many shippers because they are likely fulfilling in-house or through a third-party logistics provider. In addition, dividing up delivery functions, which is likely to happen in the vast majority of relationships, could rob the shipper of volume discounts that it would receive by tendering most, if not all, parcels to one carrier, White said. That said, White said he expects Amazon Logistics' volumes will grow enormously due to secular e-commerce growth trends and the strength of the Amazon integrated retail, fulfillment and transport business.Image: AmazonSee more from Benzinga  * Today's Pickup: C.H.

Alphabet’s Delivery by Drone Surge to Stay-at-Home Customers	(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Wing unit is seeing a dramatic increase in the number of customers using its drone delivery service in rural Virginia during the Covid-19 pandemic.Wing, which began routine deliveries under a test program approved by the federal government last October, has added new vendors and expanded the items customers can order to better serve people during the epidemic, the company said in a statement Wednesday.“The technology is particularly useful at a time when people are homebound in many cases and the need to limit human-to-human contact is important,” spokesman Jonathan Bass said in an interview.Deliveries have more than doubled in the Christiansburg, Virginia, area where the U.S. test is being conducted and in a similar project in Australia, Bass said.In addition to partnerships with FedEx Corp. and the Walgreens drug-store chain, Wing recently began deliveries from a bakery and a coffee shop.Mockingbird Cafe sold 50% more pastries through Wing’s drones in its first weekend with the company than it typically sold in its store prior to the virus-related business disruptions.Deliveries from Walgreens have included toilet paper, medicine and toothpaste, the company said. They recently added items such as pasta and baby food to meet demands of people staying home.While the payload of Wing’s autonomous drones is limited, orders are fulfilled within minutes, Bass said.The program is being run in the community around Christianburg. Wing is working with nearby Virginia Tech, which has a drone-test program approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.Amazon.com Inc., United Parcel Service Inc. and many smaller companies are also experimenting with the concept of drone deliveries.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-delivery-drone-surge-stay-182209872.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-08	2020-04-08 13:15:22	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Plays Multilayered Logistics Role In FEMA Relief Effort (With Video)	United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS) was identified early on as one of the private-sector logistics companies involved with Project Airbridge, the airlift coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to help plug the shortage of critical medical supplies for the coronavirus pandemic, but few details about its role were available until now.On Sunday, a UPS Airlines 747 freighter arrived at the company's Worldport air hub in Louisville, Kentucky, carrying personal protective equipment from Shanghai. And earlier this month, a UPS Boeing 767 aircraft delivered 43,000 pounds of equipment to Miami.Those flights were previously disclosed, but on Tuesday UPS revealed the extent of its participation in the logistics operation.The Atlanta-based company, which offers integrated logistics services from express delivery to warehousing and customs clearance, said it is brokering airfreight shipments on third-party aircraft as well as operating its own flights. During the next two weeks, it will arrange and manage 25 flights carrying more than 3 million pounds of masks, surgical gowns, gloves, medical swabs and thermometers.Shipments are originating in China, Malaysia and Honduras, among other countries.The UPS Healthcare unit is also opening a 450,000-square-foot facility in Louisville with dedicated space for FEMA shipments of personal protective equipment. In addition, UPS is in charge of kitting and distribution. The proximity to the Worldport allows UPS to quickly fulfill orders for overnight delivery anywhere in the U.S.&quot;UPS Healthcare, and our full portfolio of services, is providing a suite of highly-choreographed logistics solutions in support of Project Airbridge,&quot; said UPS Chairman and CEO David Abney in a statement. &quot;We are bringing the full power of our integrated global logistics network to bear to assist FEMA in the pandemic fight.&quot;Project Airbridge is part of a supply-chain partnership between FEMA and health care distributors such as Cardinal Health and McKesson Corp. to procure, transport and expedite delivery of critical supplies from overseas sources to areas of the country where more resources are needed to deal with a rise in COVID-19 cases.Since March 29, cargo planes have delivered nearly 300 million gloves, almost 8 million masks and 3 million gowns, according to FEMA.  UPS Healthcare and the overall UPS organization are working with many public and private entities to help with the rapid deployment of lifesaving medicines, test kits and other supplies for combating the novel coronavirus.See more from Benzinga  * Container Lines Are Still Holding Firm On Trans-Pac Rates  * Coronavirus Results In Suspended Trade Tariffs  * Lufthansa Decommissions Aircraft, Predicts Recovery Will Take Years(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

FedEx, UPS stocks surge after WSJ report of Amazon halting competing service	Shares of FedEx Corp.  surged 5.0% and of United Parcel Service Inc.  rallied 4.2% in premarket trading Wednesday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon.com Inc.  was halting a delivery service known as Amazon Shipping that directly competes with the package delivery services. J.P. Morgan analyst Brian Ossenbeck kept his ratings at neutral for both FedEx and UPS, but said he expects the stocks to react &quot;favorably&quot; to the WSJ report. &quot;The news reads slightly more positive for FedEx considering it no longer ships for Amazon and was viewed as at risk for direct competition,&quot; Ossenbeck wrote in a note to clients. &quot;However, we expect UPS will also benefit on news its largest customer has suspended a competing service for non-Amazon volumes, but we expect Amazon will continue to insource its own deliveries over time.&quot; The WSJ report out late Tuesday, which cited people familiar with the matter, said Amazon was suspending the Amazon Shipping service, which was available in only a handful of cities, because it needed its people and capacity to handle a surge in its own customers' orders. Shares of FedEx have lost 23.3% year to date through Tuesday and of UPS have declined 20.6%, while Amazon's stock has gained 8.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has declined 20.6%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8d2d2ef2-3344-397b-8b4c-3562a2324b86/fedex%2C-ups-stocks-surge-after.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-08	2020-04-08 03:59:46	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEX, UPS Shares Surge As Amazon To Suspend Delivery Service For Third-Party Sellers Due To Increased Demand	Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is suspending the delivery service for third-party sellers on its platform starting June, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.What Happened The service called &quot;Amazon Shipping&quot; was available in only a few handful cities in the United States, the Journal noted.Ahead of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the e-commerce giant was seemingly looking to establish it as a competitor to prominent delivery companies likes United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS) and FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX).&quot;We understand this is a change to your business, and we did not take this decision lightly,&quot; Amazon is said to have told shippers, according to the Journal. &quot;We will work with you over the next several weeks so there is as little disruption to your business as possible.&quot;The pandemic significantly increased the demand for Amazon services as widespread lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the virus forced a majority of people to stay home.Amazon said in March it was looking to hire 100,000 additional workers to meet the increased workload. The Seattle-based company's warehouses across the country remain functional at full capacity despite some protests by workers at multiple sites.Price Action Amazon shares closed 0.7% higher at $2,011.60 on Tuesday. The shares traded slightly lower at $2,010 in the after-hours session.The shares of FedEx and UPS surged in the after-hours session following the news.FedEx traded nearly 3.5% higher at $120 after closing the regular session 2.56% lower at $115.95. UPS traded 3.2% higher at $95.88 after closing the regular session 2.9% lower at $92.91.See more from Benzinga  * 'The Netflix Of China' Inflating Numbers Since Before IPO, Short Seller That Warned Against Luckin Coffee Says  * Uber Launches Tool To Help Drivers Affected By Coronavirus Find Work  * Luckin Stock Drops Further As Lenders Seek To Seize 76.4M Shares For Defaulted Loan(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The U.S. Treasury set that deadline for the airline sector to receive funds as soon as possible and to propose financial instruments such as warrants or equity options to compensate taxpayers for the money.  Many Democrats and airline labor unions have urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin not to demand equity or warrants in return for the grants because they are meant to ensure carriers take the funds and pay workers until Sept. 30, by which time many hope travel demand will have started to recover.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-airlines-face-deadline-apply-145918500.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-31	2020-03-31 19:22:57	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Airlines, Governments And 3PLs Get Creative With Emergency Airlifts	Large numbers of dedicated freighters are descending on China to pick up face masks and other equipment being made in large quantities after the country was able to stop the spread of COVID-19 and reopen factories. No longer requiring as much equipment for its own use, China is churning out millions of pieces of personal protective equipment and other medical items. Charter flights organized by governments and private groups to carry critical medical supplies and other material to areas experiencing high caseloads of COVID-19 are proliferating. In some cases, governments have created airborne supply lines to shuttle huge amounts of supplies to healthcare workers, patients and others with essential jobs who require protection from infection.After first renting entire airplanes for on-demand cargo transport in response to the shortage in airfreight capacity and widespread suspension of passenger flights, some airlines are now setting up regularly scheduled cargo operations.On March 30, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) announced it has started cargo service between Shanghai and Detroit three times per week using Airbus A350-900 aircraft, able to carry 49 tons, to deliver urgent medical supplies. Once the supplies arrive in Detroit, they will be transferred to domestic passenger flights and shipped to cities around the U.S. Delta said it will evaluate increasing frequency to daily flights or open additional U.S. gateways depending on demand. Detroit is considered by U.S. health authorities as a hotspot for the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus.Delta was one of the first passenger carriers to offer its planes to logistics companies on a charter basis.Similarly, Qatar Airways announced on March 30 that it is now running regular cargo routes between Doha and six cities in China using widebody passenger planes. U.S. and French airliftsThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is contracting with private carriers to airlift large quantities of critical supplies to strategically located airports for distribution to nearby cities and states. Atlas Air has flown the first two sections of the mission, dubbed Project Airbridge, delivering medical shipments to New York and Chicago. A third delivery scheduled for today at an undisclosed Ohio airport has been delayed, a FEMA spokeswoman told FreightWaves.The French government has also launched its own version of Project Airbridge, creating an airborne pipeline to move large amounts of equipment from China to France. The French Ministry of Solidarity and Health has hired third-party logistics provider Geodis to organize the flights.Geodis said Tuesday it has chartered two massive Antonov-124 aircraft operated by Moscow-based Volga-Dnepr to make 16 flights in April to supply millions of masks from China. It said the schedule could be extended into May.The first flight from Shenzhen containing 8.5 million masks arrived in Paris. A second flight is scheduled later this week carrying 13 million more masks.The French government is working to deliver one billion masks over the next 14 weeks. Separately, Geodis has leased aircraft from an all-cargo carrier to provide roundtrip charter flights between Chicago and Amsterdam four times per week to meet regular private sector needs.German logistics provider Dascher said its Mexico subsidiary has donated air transport of three million surgical and respiratory masks. The Boeing 787-9 charter flight flew last week from Mexico City to Frankfurt and then Dascher delivered the equipment through its road network.Dascher, like Geodis, is also essentially running a private airline by chartering aircraft to fly between Europe and Asia. It has also set up an air bridge between the U.S., Latin America and Frankfurt for deliveries to Shanghai. Dascher said it is chartering 747s and integrating them into the rotation of flights connecting in Shanghai.Meanwhile, European aircraft manufacturer Airbus is working with Bolloré Logistics to expedite the distribution of two million face masks to health workers in France and Spain. Airbus last week operated one of its own A330-800 passenger aircraft to Tianjin, China, to collect the shipment, and then flew back to Toulouse, France. Some of the shipment was broken down and dispatched to facilities in France, while the remaining load was put on new pallets and onto an Airbus A400M, a four-engine turboprop military aircraft, and flown to Getafe, Spain. Florida-based National Airlines said it recently operated a relief mission to Mumbai, India, with one of its Boeing 747-400 freighters. Last week India closed its borders to contain the spread of the deadly virus. National Airlines is also under contract to transport pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies from India, Europe and China to the U.S. 3PLs handle emergency distributionThird-party logistics providers (3PLs) are doing more than simply arranging charter flights for governments, aid organizations and private companies involved in the COVID-19 response.Geodis is working with the French government to distribute supplies within France. Fedex Express and UPS are delivering test-kit specimens overnight to laboratories around the U.S. on behalf of the U.S. government. UPS is also helping the federal and state governments set up drive-up testing sites and participating in Project Airbridge.As part of the airlift collaboration, FEMA will gain access to UPS's huge Worldport hub in Louisville, Kentucky, for temporary staging of critical shipments from overseas, according to United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS). The integrated logistics giant and express carrier is also helping healthcare distributor Henry Schein Inc. distribute and track delivery of personal protective equipment (PPE) to medical professionals and drive-through test facilities as it gets flown in. UPS is also delivering PPE shipments for the McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK), another healthcare distributor, to pop-up testing sites and military bases where military members and civilians returning from overseas are required to quarantine. And UPS is using its air and ground network to deliver tens of thousands of test kits and related supplies each week for several manufacturers, including DuPont.CEVA Logistics, now owned by ocean container line CMA CGM, is using its multi-modal capabilities to overcome supply chain bottlenecks for critical shipments. It said it is handling distribution for one of the medical technology companies appointed by the U.S. government to manufacture and supply COVID-19 test kits. A combination of expedited ground, airfreight and final-mile delivery are being used to get the kits to New Jersey, Seattle, Chicago and other areas with high demand. CEVA said it took charge of the import process, customs clearance and same-day delivery of one million masks donated by Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to the Spanish health service. In southeast England, CEVA will handle the assembly and delivery to hospitals of visors that will be made on 3D printers. A new facility under construction by partner businesses will host 200 to 250 3D printers.Photo: GeodisSee more from Benzinga  * Freight Futures Daily Curve: 3/31  * Jobless Claims And The Likely Collapse Of Volumes – FreightWaves NOW  * Knight-Swift CEO Discusses Company's Challenges, Response To COVID-19(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-03-25	2020-03-25 15:48:33	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Seeks To Accelerate Growth Of Drone-Delivery	United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) has announced a collaboration with Wingcopter, a German-based electric vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft startup, to scale up its drone delivery operations in the U.S. and across the world. Wingcopter will be working with UPS Flight Forward (UPSFF), the drone delivery subsidiary of UPS, to create this next generation of package delivery drones. &quot;Drone delivery is not a one-size-fits-all operation. Our collaboration with Wingcopter helps pave the way for us to start drone delivery service in new use-cases. UPS Flight Forward is building a network of technology partners to broaden our unique capability to serve customers and extend our leadership in drone delivery,&quot; said Bala Ganesh, vice president of the UPS Advanced Technology Group. The drone delivery segment has gained momentum in recent years, thanks to the ever-growing importance of expedited delivery, especially within the ecommerce market. With delivery speed being considered an important marker of end consumers' satisfaction, logistics companies see the relevance in investing across two distinct unmanned VTOL drone segments – long-range heavy-haul and short-range light-haul aircraft. While heavy-haul drones are typically used to deliver across remote and impoverished regions, light-haul drones are helpful across the last-mile delivery segment, particularly for hastening delivery in urban spaces with frequent traffic deadlock. For UPS, the partnership with Wingcopter will be within the heavy-haul VTOL aircraft segment, following Wingcopter's track record in &quot;delivering a variety of goods over long distances in multiple international settings.&quot;The Wingcopter collaboration is UPSFF's first venture with a drone manufacturer. In a statement, UPS has stated that the companies will jointly work to gain regulatory certification for commercial flight of unmanned drones in the U.S., as well as building a diverse fleet of drones with varying capabilities to meet different customer needs. &quot;We are proud to partner with UPS, a global giant in delivery and logistics. Together we aspire to extend the speed and reach of package delivery,&quot; said Tom Plümmer, Wingcopter chief executive officer and co-founder. &quot;Our vision has always been to leverage technology to improve the lives of people around the world, and the strategic relationship with UPS will further accelerate our growth and global expansion, strengthening our role as an industry leader in drone technology.&quot;Wingcopter comes into this partnership fresh from the successful completion of its first drone delivery trial this February with healthcare giant Merck, delivering a shipment from a Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) lab in Gernsheim, Germany, to the Merck headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany. The test was a beyond the visual line of sight (BVLOS) project, which meant that the drone flew over inhabited regions that included buildings, electric power lines, traffic and people. The drone startup has considerable experience in delivering shipments for BVLOS projects across several domains, including commercial factory-to-factory deliveries, humanitarian programs and medical emergencies. Wingcopter's VTOL aircraft is unique in the market, as its patented tilt-rotor mechanism enables a seamless transition between two drone modes – multicopter for hovering and fixed-wing for low-noise forward flight. These modes help the drone to stabilize itself even when faced with harsh weather conditions, including wind speeds of up to 45 mph. The aircraft can reach speeds up to 150 mph with a range of approximately 75 miles. See more from Benzinga  * Courier Giants Help U.S. Operate Pop-Up Virus Test Centers  * Vehicle Electrification Is Not Just About Reducing Emissions  * Today's Pickup: Amazon Insourcing Hurting DHL Globally(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Courier Giants Help U.S. Operate Pop-Up Virus Test Centers	Express carriers FedEx Corp. and UPS are helping the U.S. government open drive-up coronavirus testing centers in dozens of communities and deliver the specimens to laboratories.The companies have a long history of assisting humanitarian operations and have the ability to quickly flex their freight networks to meet urgent logistics needs.FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) said Monday it launched a special operation over the weekend ferrying COVID-19 test specimens from more than 50 remote locations in 12 states with a combination of dedicated aircraft and package trucks for pickup and delivery.Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE: CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBA) 10 days ago told the White House they would set up coronavirus testing in their parking lots to help speed up testing for the respiratory illness that has claimed more than 530 lives in the U.S. already.The sealed boxes were shipped overnight on 28 dedicated flights, according to FedEx. They included a multisensor device that collects and transmits data on each shipment via wireless communication to an online application for real-time tracking and monitoring. The patented SenseAware technology gives the current location, temperature, light exposure, relative humidity, barometric pressure and shock readings.FedEx Express package drivers collected the test sample boxes, took them to nearby airports and then picked them up for delivery to 10 labs operated by Quest Diagnostics and other commercial labs in several markets.FedEx said it will continue to support the testing effort seven days a week as more remote testing centers become available across the country.Atlanta-based United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) said last week it assisted with the logistics planning for opening and operating the drive-through testing sites.Automakers Pitch InIn another example of companies stepping up to help the public, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU) said it is installing machinery to make more than 1 million protective face masks per month and will donate them to first responders and healthcare workers across North America.Ford Motor Co. announced Tuesday it is working with 3M and GE Healthcare to speed up production of medical equipment for healthcare workers, including a redesigned 3M powered air-purifying respirators and a simplified version of GE's ventilator for patients experiencing breathing difficulty. Ford, in cooperation with the United Auto Workers, will assemble more than 100,000 critically needed plastic face shields per week at a Ford manufacturing site for use by medical professionals, factory workers and store clerks. Ford will also use its in-house 3D printing capability to produce disposable respirators for heallthcare workers.Automakers General Motors and Tesla previously said they would help make ventilators.FedEx has also moved more than 1 million COVID-19 test kits to cities across the U.S. on behalf of government agencies, and an additional 250,000 N95 respirator masks and other personal protective equipment in partnership with humanitarian aid organizations to as many as 1,000 community health centers and free clinics. Additionally, FedEx said it has expedited delivery of test kits from Indianapolis-based Roche Diagnostics to U.S. labs.Both FedEx and UPS are also using their all-cargo aircraft to deliver face masks, protective gear, ventilators and other equipment to the U.S. and other countries, as they did when the COVID-19 outbreak began in China. Delivery PrecautionsThey have adapted to the new business environment by modifying procedures drivers use for residential and business deliveries. To minimize contact with recipients, both companies have suspended signature requirements for most deliveries. UPS said its drivers validate and record the name of the recipient instead of obtaining a signature. In situations where a shipper requests an adult's signature, UPS requires recipients to present identification with proof of age to the driver.Their airlines also disinfect cockpits, jumpseat areas and aircraft lavatories to keep pilots healthy.FedEx says it promotes social distancing on the job, including at security screening, on employee shuttles and in common areas. Team members are repeatedly reminded by managers, signs and digital monitors about hygiene and cleaning.See more from Benzinga  * Class I Rail Employment Reaches Another Record Low  * Every Coronavirus Supply Chain Disruption Is Different  * Career Tracks: FourKites, Southeastern Freight And Wabash National(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The nearly 600-page proposal would set aside in grants $10 billion for grants to airports, $20 billion for transit systems and about $1 billion for Amtrak.

2020-03-20	2020-03-20 09:00:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Shares Beat Other Transportation Stocks With Amazon’s Help	(Bloomberg) -- In a brutal market rout that has spared almost no corner of the financial market, one American brand is showing extraordinary resilience.Shares of United Parcel Service Inc. have held their own in the past month as other transportation companies plunged amid the global coronavirus pandemic that’s brought daily life to a screeching halt. UPS has been bolstered by its deep ties to Amazon.com Inc.“UPS is participating in the e-commerce ‘boom’ as people don’t go to stores and stay home and order online,” Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in an interview. According to Cowen’s estimates, about 14% of UPS’s volume is Amazon-related versus none at all at FedEx. “In fact, we believe that most of the volume FedEx rejected is being flown by UPS,” Becker said.As travel restrictions expanded and officials in cities around the country urged people to avoid stepping outside unless absolutely necessary, transportation stocks from airlines and car rentals to rails and truckers all declined sharply. The Dow Jones Transportation Average has dropped 35% since the close of trading on Feb. 19, which was when the virus-fueled meltdown began in U.S. markets.In comparison, UPS shares have fallen just 9.8% over the same period, making it the second best performer on the index. The top place was taken by Matson Inc., which transports freight between the continental U.S. and ports in Hawaii, Guam, Micronesia and China.The company’s direct competitor, FedEx Corp., has seen its shares drop about 31% in the last month.UPS, which had $74 billion in revenue in 2019, also has a more dominant position in ground transportation than in the air and is less exposed to Asia compared to FedEx, Becker added. FedEx had sales of about $70 billion for its fiscal 2019 ended May 31.Stay-at-home stocks, or companies that sell products or services that people are likely to use while at home for a prolonged duration, have been outperforming amid the widespread market rout. Netflix Inc. and Amazon are two examples.UPS’s steady financials are also helping. According to Robert W Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford, UPS “possesses some unique potential catalysts in this increasingly challenging operating market,” including a robust 4.5% dividend yield, its ongoing efforts to transform the business and a new, incoming CEO, Carol Tome, who was named earlier this month.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-shares-beat-other-transportation-090000675.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-19	2020-03-19 23:50:39	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	U.S. Borrowers Crowd Market in Week of Jaw-Dropping Outflows	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. investment-grade funds lost a record $35.6 billion this week, an unprecedented figure that dwarfs the fact that borrowers gave the primary market another shot of life Thursday.The sum for the week ended March 18 blows through the previous record outflow of $7.3 billion from last week, according to Refinitiv Lipper. It’s almost hard to remember that seven issuers successfully brought new deals Thursday with such a massive figure reported later in the afternoon.United Parcel Service Inc. and Walt Disney Co. were among those to capitalize on a somewhat better risk tone Thursday, as U.S. credit has been wobbly ahead of an expected stimulus package from Washington. Earlier, investors cheered the European Central Bank’s package of asset purchases, reopening the region’s market with four new debt issues.In both regions, borrowers that have been brave enough to come forward have been among those with the highest credit quality, and tend to be frequent issuers, as has been the case with other rare opportunities for new debt offerings. Financial institutions are especially active in both regions, with Canadian banks leading deals in Europe, and several of the major U.S. banks bringing dollar offerings.The cost to protect U.S. investment-grade debt against default has been on shaky footing all day, seesawing from tightening to widening. By contrast, a similar risk measure in Europe cheapened the most since 2011, as the ECB launched a massive bond-buying program to keep borrowing costs in check.“It was very much needed as the market was clearly unimpressed with what Christine Lagarde had announced at the ECB meeting compared to what other global central banks had delivered,” said John Taylor, a portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein.U.S.The U.S. investment-grade market blew through all statistics this week with a $35.6 billion outflow from mutual funds and ETFs. High-yield funds lost $2.91 billion, smaller than last week’s withdrawal.UPS and Disney led the charge in the primary market, followed by deals from MetLife Inc., Citigroup Inc., Northrop Grumman Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley.

2020-03-18	2020-03-18 19:14:42	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Drivers Received Single Wipe to Clean Vans Before Shifts	(Bloomberg) -- When about two dozen Amazon.com Inc. delivery drivers reported for their shifts Tuesday morning on California’s central coast, their manager passed around a sleeve of disinfecting wipes. He said they could each take only one to clean their vans before starting their routes, according to three people present. The drivers, who work for a company that has a delivery contract with Amazon, thought it was a joke at first. Upon realizing it wasn’t, they got busy figuring out how to use a tiny wipe to clean a van shared with other drivers and packed with boxes touched by untold others. One driver furiously scrubbed her scanner since she touches it frequently. Another wiped down his steering wheel and door handle.“I felt so disposable,” said one of the drivers, who like the others requested anonymity for fear of losing her job. “We’re really worried, and one wipe for a van just doesn’t cut it.”Around the country, drivers who deliver Amazon packages are providing a valuable public service by bringing household essentials to homes and helping consumers avoid stores, potentially minimizing the spread of the coronavirus that has infected at least 7,000 people in the U.S. and killed more than 100. Yet some of these drivers harbor fear and resentment since they see friends and family members urged to stay at home while they are being told to crisscross town at their own peril. Amazon is offering a temporary $2 hourly pay bump that for most of them will total about $500 over six weeks in hazard pay.The coronavirus outbreak poses a challenge of unprecedented severity for Amazon—and it’s hardly the only company grappling with a pandemic that has upended the daily lives of people around the world. The company has announced plans to hire 100,000 people and issue temporary raises to help keep groceries and other essentials flowing. It has set up a $25 million relief fund to pay delivery workers for up to two weeks if they get sick with the virus or miss work due to quarantines. Amazon on Tuesday told suppliers that it would stop accepting shipments of non-essential goods in its warehouses, an effort to keep things such as food and cleaning supplies moving through the system.Some of this will almost certainly help. But Amazon, already trying to keep up with a surge in online orders, depends on the willingness of tens of thousands of contract drivers to show up each day. The company uses United Parcel Service Inc., the U.S. Postal Service and other companies for about half of its deliveries worldwide and in a crisis could likely increase its reliance on the big carriers. But it has the most direct control over its own network of independent drivers who shuttle around in dark blue vans emblazoned with the Amazon smile. Depending on the role, delivery couriers are exposed more often to diseases or infections over the course of their job than most other job types, according to Department of Labor data tracking worker behavior. If enough Amazon drivers get sick, or simply worry about the risk enough to stay home, the Seattle-based company’s logistics machine could struggle to meet its commitments to shoppers.Not all the 12 drivers interviewed for this story were overly concerned about their safety. One in South Bend, Indiana, where there have been few confirmed coronavirus cases, said the pandemic hasn’t changed how he does the job at all. He made one delivery to a nursing home, and the front desk clerk wiped the package with a disinfecting wipe, but other than that it’s been business as usual, he said.“My warehouse manager and logistics manager have been keeping a hand sanitizer station where we all check in and encouraging people to use it,” he said. “There is little risk to me honestly. There aren't any community spread patients yet in my area, so I definitely wouldn't be staying home until that occurs.”It’s also true that some jobs—a grocery clerk, say or an Uber driver—are potentially more exposed to the virus. But several of the other Amazon drivers Bloomberg interviewed worry when customers greet them at doorsteps and in office buildings and are concerned about all of the people who touched boxes and envelopes before they did. One driver noted that when delivering alcohol he is required to get close enough to customers to request their identification. Some are taking their own precautions—one driver in Chicago wears a N95 mask and uses hand sanitizer after every pickup.  The challenge Amazon faces in keeping its frontline workers healthy and willing to work has already become apparent in its warehouses. After a handful of Covid-19 cases were reported in at least three Amazon depots in Europe, unions there this week called for the company to cut shifts and close the facilities for cleaning. At Amazon’s main logistics hub in Italy, where two workers were diagnosed with the disease, absenteeism has hit 30% in recent weeks, people familiar with the matter have told Bloomberg.“The health and safety of our employees and contractors around the world continues to be our top priority,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email. “As communities around the world are requiring social distancing, we’re seeing that our teams—much like grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential services—have a unique role getting customers the critical items they need and this is especially vital for the elderly, people with underlying health issues, and those sick or quarantined. We have implemented a series of preventative health measures for employees, delivery and transportation partners at our sites around the world.”Amazon typically focuses on moving packages as quickly as possible at the lowest cost, but the outbreak requires the company to slow things down and give specific safety instructions to each employee, said Barbara Hoopes, a business professor and logistics expert at Virginia Tech. Even independent contractors in their own vehicles should get instructions specifically tailored to their roles and a kit with hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes and any other equipment needed to improve their safety, she said.“This is the type of business that we want to continue to operate since supply chain is critical for a functioning economy, but the workers are more at risk,” Hoopes said. “Amazon can be a leader in giving employees and contractors instructions on what to do.”Some of the drivers interviewed for this story say that isn’t happening. They’re receiving generic advice about washing their hands and staying home if they are having symptoms but no specific instructions regarding their jobs or how to minimize their risk of exposure. Instead, they describe a haphazard operation where safety takes a back seat to the swift delivery of toilet paper, food and cough medsMuch of what happens with Amazon deliveries is beyond the company’s direct control. It utilizes independent contractors driving their own vehicles to deliver packages as well as employees of separate companies that operate as Amazon delivery partners. So a lot of the people delivering Amazon packages aren’t Amazon employees at all. The California drivers instructed to wipe down their vans with a single disinfecting wipe work for one of the delivery service partners, which have been urged by Amazon to take on more routes to meet demand through the crisis. They say they have instructions to wipe down vans multiple times during each shift but that their employers aren’t providing them with the supplies they need. Some drivers say they have no disinfecting wipes at all. Another driver said his company had only 10 pair of protective gloves one day for about 30 drivers reporting for their shifts.“No one wants to be put in this situation,” said an Amazon delivery driver in Richmond, Virginia. “It’s not fair, but what am I going to do. I have bills to pay.”One driver in Texas supports an elderly mother and two sons, one with a compromised immune system. She goes to work each day to support her family but fears putting them at risk if she brings illness home. She’s hopeful the raises Amazon announced will be paid to drivers like her—her employer hasn’t yet made that clear—but worries about the toll additional hours will take on her immune system since managers are asking drivers to work six days each week.“I’m not even sure I could find another job right now if I decided the risk was too great,” she said. “My mother and son are in a high-risk group so you would think it would make the decision easy, but it’s not, not when my children depend on me.”One driver in Boston stopped making deliveries about two weeks ago due to concerns about the virus. She has a full-time job and drives for Amazon  on the side in her own car for extra money. She’s worried about other drivers who can’t afford to give it up, even if they are feeling ill. Still, she said she’d take the risk out of financial necessity if the economy melts down and she loses her full-time job.“Anyone with a shred of common sense knows you shouldn’t be going to some stranger’s door to deliver groceries right now,” she said. “This system is set up to take care of Amazon’s customers. It’s not set up to take care of drivers.”Another driver in California is worried about his safety but feels good when customers thank him for making deliveries so they can stay safe at home. Some of them seem lonely and eager to chat since they are stuck in their own homes, but he tries to keep the conversations brief and not let people get too close.“I try to get the door as quickly as I can and get away before they see me,” he said. “They try to make conversation and I just try to keep my distance when they do.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-drivers-received-single-wipe-191442270.html?.tsrc=rss

Given that our health-care system is inadequate for the current crisis (due to economic reality and system design), we now need to enlist the help of society’s other powerful systems.  The best way to begin envisioning how major companies can help — especially those with a big physical presence and (potentially idle) infrastructure — might be to start with a specific example: How to expand COVID-19 testing without overwhelming health-care providers and facilities.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/45d5fd59-ec30-3695-ac7f-b131890702f0/consumer-companies-could-do.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-17	2020-03-17 12:30:08	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Big Business Is Helping America Survive the Coronavirus	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When President Donald Trump called several U.S. CEOs to the microphone at his coronavirus press conference last week, it was more than just symbolic. Whether Americans like it or not, Covid-19 is ushering in an era when big business will be more important than ever.As people start reacting to Covid-19, they are looking mostly to the larger businesses for assistance. Costco and Walmart are packed. Amazon and UPS are delivering our packages. For entertainment at home, Americans are relying on Netflix and the cable companies. For information on Covid-19, Twitter is a very useful stop. As hospitals become overcrowded, CVS and Rite Aid may become important as local health centers and sources of community information.It turns out that the larger, more profitable businesses are the ones that have the talent, the command of public attention and the financial resources to adjust to these changing conditions.Big business also has been ahead of the curve when it comes to prediction and adjustment. The NBA postponed its season before most politicians, including the president, realized the gravity of the situation.Only a month ago, there were headlines mocking Silicon Valley for being overly concerned with Covid-19 and for avoiding handshakes. The tech community had a high degree of advance awareness of Covid-19 problems, and it was ready with telework and other adjustments when the time came. The tech world’s penchant for carrying what seemed to be absurdly large surpluses of cash — last year Apple had over $100 billion in cash reserves — now also seems prescient. Apple’s stores are currently closed in most parts of the world.Some of the biggest economic losers from Covid-19 will be economies that rely more on small business rather than big business. The lockdowns in Italy, for example, will be very painful for the large numbers of small, family-run businesses that rely on everyday contact with their customers. The gelato shop and the kiosk and the small bar will be more vulnerable than America’s corporate behemoths. Furthermore, they may be vulnerable to a small number of their workers getting sick.Larger businesses are also easier to assist if necessary. Whatever you think of the forthcoming bailout of the major U.S. airlines, logistically it will not be very difficult to pull off, since the targets are large and obvious and relatively easy to monitor. Banks are willing to lend to them, because they know the government does not contemplate a world without major airlines.It is much more difficult to bail out the millions of small and medium-sized enterprises around the world that will demand assistance. How do you find and track them? How can you tell which have no chance of bouncing back? Government bureaucracies cannot easily deal with those problems, and in turn private banks do not perceive governments to be making credible commitments to these small businesses. By contrast, there are numerous precedents for governmental aid or loans to airlines or other major businesses.Whether Americans like it or not, after the worst of Covid-19 is over, theirs is going to be a nation where big business plays a larger role. The title of my most recent book gives some indication where I stand, and I predict more Americans will come to a new appreciation of big business over the coming months.Business itself, including big business, is increasingly relying on distanced communications. WhatsApp messaging groups are active, while Skype calls are replacing the face-to-face meeting; WhatsApp, of course, is owned by Facebook, Skype by Microsoft. Zoom, whose calls are known for their reliability, is not yet a big business, but I predict it will be fairly soon.Most institutions of higher education are shutting down or postponing their operations. Alternative arrangements are still being worked out, but again I expect big business will play a major role in the transition. Skype and Zoom sessions will replace many a class, and the textbook companies are stepping forward with electronic portals that present classroom materials, interactive exercises and grade student answers. (Disclaimer: Macmillan Worth offers an electronic portal version of my own economics textbook.)Some governments in East Asia have done a good job responding to the Covid-19 crisis. It is hard to say the same for the U.S. or Western Europe. The legacy of that failure is likely to be a further decline of trust in government. And a consequence of that failure is that, when Americans need answers or simply a useful good or service, they are increasingly going to turn to the one institution that can reliably provide them: big business.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tyler Cowen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. He is a professor of economics at George Mason University and writes for the blog Marginal Revolution.

UPS stock has seen recent weakness amid coronavirus concerns which could result in lower volumes but management's guidance of more than $5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, the attractive dividend looks to be safe.Management also guided to $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion of free cash flow this year which would more than cover the $3.5 billion of dividend obligations, the analyst wrote. As such, the company could have cash leftover for some share buybacks.See Also: No Holiday Gift From FedEx, But Some Analysts Still See Delivery Around The CornerIf the business is impacted by lower volumes and free cash flow comes in at the mid-point of guidance, the company would still be able to cover the dividend payment. The cash on the balance sheet serves as a backup if it needs to &quot;dig into their pockets.&quot;Bottom line, UPS's stock is &quot;compelling enough&quot; at current levels to warrant a bullish stance, even in the current environment.UPS Price Action Shares of UPS were trading higher by 4.79% Tuesday at $91.36.

But a loss of 6 cents per share, albeit on revenue of over $91 million, sent shares down anyway.Before earnings, InvestorPlace analyst Louis Navellier was calling the stock &quot;unstoppable.&quot; Over the long run that might be the case.  * Buy the Dip in These 7 Online Advertising Stocks Now But with fossil fuel energy costs falling, and the prospect of a global recession, the near term looks dicey. That's why InvestorPlace's Larry Ramer wrote on March 2 that investors should wait until after coronavirus fears subside to buy the stock. He wrote after taking profits on two months that saw the price move from $3.23 per share to over $5.My own view is that these are early days for Plug Power. Plug Power has been touting the idea of using electrolysis, powered by solar or wind energy, to produce hydrogen. But for now, the primary feedstock remains natural gas. While natural gas is cheap and plentiful, burning it is a cheaper way to use it. Fuel cells aren't quite as green as they seem. An Established NicheThe best news for Plug Power is that it has established a niche for itself in warehousing. Cleaner operations, lower maintenance costs and shorter fueling times all working to its benefit.The problem for small investors is that its customers could be its undoing. Under a 2017 sales agreement, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) won the right to buy up to 23% of Plug Power if its total orders came to $600 million. Such a move would water down the holdings of existing shareholders.Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is another big customer for hydrogen-powered forklifts. It was estimated in 2018 there were already over 20,000 hydrogen-powered forklifts in operation.Going from warehouses to the streets may be tougher. Here, fuel cells must compete directly with natural gas. United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is a big user of natural gas in its delivery vehicles, and those moving between warehouses would be of the same class. Hydrogen is also harder to store than natural gas.While natural gas is a fossil fuel it's often sold as &quot;clean&quot; energy, because it offers lower emissions than oil. The industry works around critics by taking some of its gas from landfills, calling this &quot;renewable.&quot; Fuel Cell Energy also uses landfill gas to power its fuel cells. The Bottom Line on PLUG StockPlug Power is doing much better than other energy or transportation stocks in 2020. The shares fell 9% on March 9 but recovered nearly all that loss overnight, opening at $4.15. Plug Power's market capitalization is about $1.2 billion, on trailing year sales of about $200 million.It means that, for now, the stock is fully valued. This is a speculative stock for younger investors. It could be a 10-bagger, increasing in value by 10 times, assuming the company's five-year plan works. For now that's still just an assumption.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

2020-03-05	2020-03-05 10:00:30	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Nixed ‘Green’ Shipping Proposal to Avoid Alienating Shoppers	(Bloomberg) -- A few years ago, Amazon.com Inc.’s quick delivery team debated doing something radical for the e-commerce giant: asking shoppers to consider the environment.The team building Amazon’s Prime Now same-day delivery service knew that the quickest delivery options tended to be the worst for the planet. A guaranteed one-hour delivery window sometimes meant sending couriers in mostly empty vehicles darting to far-flung neighborhoods, all the while emitting roughly the same greenhouse gas emissions as a fully loaded truck or van. Someone on the team proposed showing customers a “Green” shopping delivery option, a slightly slower delivery speed designed to give Amazon more time to cluster orders together and send out densely packed vehicles, saving on fuel, driver salaries and carbon emissions.The idea was one of at least two instances in recent years when Amazon teams debated telling customers more about the environmental impact of their shipping choices, according to two people familiar with the episodes. Neither was implemented, in part, because of the risk that shoppers would think twice before clicking “Buy Now,” the people say.“It was all efficiency and bottom-line focused,” says one of the people, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter. “If you don’t have top-down goals around sustainability, there are always going to be tradeoffs.”Amazon in the last year has made some big climate commitments, following calls from shareholders, activists and employees to do more to offset the company’s contribution to the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for warming the planet. In September, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos pledged to erase Amazon’s contribution—some 44.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2018—and make Amazon’s business carbon neutral by 2040. Last month, Bezos raised the stakes, saying he would spend $10 billion of his personal fortune on projects to combat climate change.But Amazon’s push to make its operations more climate friendly is at odds with elements of the company’s core business practices, some current and former employees and outside observers say. Bezos’s company is, in many ways, designed to promote consumption. From one-click shopping to one-day shipping, many employees are encouraged to focus on a set of goals geared toward removing barriers to shopping and inventing new ways of pleasing customers before they think to ask. That obsessive focus has helped make Amazon the largest online retailer in the world. It also makes climate activists and sustainability experts—many of whom cheer the company’s bold new goals—skeptical of Amazon’s odds of success.“What they’re trying to do is create a climate and a culture of consumption,” says Raz Godelnik, a professor at the New School’s Parsons School of Design who focuses on sustainability. “That means more products will be manufactured, more products will be shipped, more products will be returned. If you just look at the numbers, it means overall, a zero carbon contribution is not possible.”Amazon says its commitments represent “a very aggressive and important goal.” “Not only are we committed to the Climate Pledge to be net-zero carbon by 2040 . . . we are actively working to recruit others to join us,” a spokesman said in an emailed statement. “We are making significant investments in renewable energy, carbon neutral transportation, sustainable materials, closed-loop systems and resource efficiency improvements to achieve our sustainability goals.”Amazon’s first efforts to address its environmental impact more than a decade ago were designed to cut costs by weeding out waste. Programs to reduce the size of boxes Amazon ships to customers, and eliminate hard-to-open plastic packaging, continue today.  The company also deputized employees to seek out inefficiencies in their day jobs, removing light bulbs from vending machines and, in the case of a Scottish warehouse, shutting off a hot water heater during the summer months.At the same time, the company asserted that online shopping was better for the planet than what came before. “We believe that e-commerce is inherently more environmentally friendly than traditional retailing, and we believe that we will continue to innovate in this area over time,” the company said in a 2011 filing, language Bezos and other top executives have echoed with little change in the years since.The logic makes some intuitive sense: 100 people driving cars to the store to pick up an item is hugely wasteful compared with a single truck that makes rounds to each person’s doorstep.The trouble is, the world is messier than the talking point, people who study logistics and shopping habits say. One shopper might grab the week’s groceries on the way home from work, likely a more efficient trip than arranging for a refrigerated truck to stop by the house. Some online deal hunters wipe out any environmental benefit of online shopping by making a trip to a store to try out a product in person. And others, freed from the need to go to the store, might jump in the car for a trip to do something fun. “The complexity is tremendous,” says Anne Goodchild, who leads the University of Washington’s research on supply chains and logistics.Five months before Amazon announced plans for a zero-carbon future, the company complicated its task, announcing it would make one-day delivery standard for members of its Prime free shipping program. Since Amazon’s previous two-day unlimited shipping guarantee was introduced in 2005, Amazon has been at the forefront of raising expectations that not only should shoppers be able to buy basically anything online, but the stuff should arrive quickly.Researchers say faster delivery speed tends to mean more emissions, either from the waste of a partially empty truck rushing to meet a delivery deadline, or a trip in the belly of a cargo plane from a distant warehouse.“Buying online or not doesn’t account for the main variable,” Goodchild says. “The main variable is how far away did something come from. And then how quickly did you demand that it get to you.”Amazon says that, for its own operations, faster shipping doesn’t necessarily mean more emissions. By staging inventory in depots closer to shoppers and leveraging the massive order volume of the largest online retailer, the company is able to deliver packages more efficiently than outside research would suggest, a spokesperson said. Embedded in that assurance is expectations for ever more growth at Amazon: a bigger slice of retail sales means more deliveries to more neighborhoods, which in turn leads to more optimized routes and, theoretically, fewer emissions.“What they’re saying is if we reach a high enough level of demand for essentially any delivery window, then we can likely do it in a more environmentally friendly manner than anybody else could do on their own,” says Teddy Forscher, who is studying the relationship between online shopping and transportation at the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. Amazon hasn’t released numbers to back up its claims about delivery efficiency, but outside data do support some elements of the company’s premise. In 2019, Amazon packages started their journey to customer doorsteps 25% closer than shipments by other e-commerce companies, according to data from Rakuten Intelligence, which tracks emailed customer receipts. Amazon packages also spend a day less in transit, on average.That effortless shipping makes it possible for people to click “Buy Now” without thinking too hard about the cost, shoppers say. “Amazon makes it really easy to click through things,” says Katie Ferrara, a songwriter in Los Angeles, who gets about two or three Amazon deliveries a week. Most of her orders, from guitar cables to clothing she can’t find in local stores, tend to be single purchases, including the occasional impulse buy. “I know it’s probably not the best for the environment,” she says.When shoppers do try to buy items in bulk, Amazon most often sends them packaged individually, which is partly the result of third-party sellers on Amazon’s site who often mail their own inventory. Among orders containing multiple items, more than 60% come in separate packages, according to Rakuten data covering the first half of last year. For other retailers, orders containing multiple items come in separate packages just 27% of the time. Amazon, which says its deliveries generally emit less carbon than physical shopping trips for the same set of items, is working behind the scenes to make its operations more efficient without customers knowing or having to change their behavior. The company says it expects to receive its first electric delivery truck from Rivian Inc. in 2021, and have 100,000 of them on the road by 2030. The company cites the purchase of electric vehicles, typically more expensive than conventional diesel- or gasoline-powered models, as a sign of its commitment to meet its zero-carbon goal, even if it adds costs. The order may help jumpstart production of fossil-fuel-free delivery vehicles, which has so far failed to keep up with demand. FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc., which each have thousands of electric or alternative-fuel vehicles on the road, both saw their emissions rise in 2018, the most recently reported year, as surging e-commerce orders outpaced their ability to acquire new vehicles.“The e-commerce boom has changed buyer behavior—consumers have become accustomed to getting nearly anything they want, when and where they want it,” UPS said in its sustainability report.UPS, which gives customers the option to offset the emissions associated with their shipments, is among the companies that have decided to enlist customers in making operations greener. In Britain, grocers Ocado and Sainsbury’s both show customers during checkout which delivery slots are better for the environment.Amazon, which left that option on the table with the abandoned “Green” Prime Now window, has experimented with similar concepts that emphasize efficiency, but shy away from some of the environmentally friendly branding.The company last year unveiled “Amazon Day,” an option for shoppers to cluster their deliveries on a single day of the week. The marketing of the new service touts convenience and simplifying shoppers’ busy lives, before noting that the program is “one of many sustainability initiatives” underway. A separate program aimed at efficiency offers customers store credit or discounts if they opt for slower shipping on an in-demand product. The company declined to say how many shoppers use those options.Godelnik, the New School professor, says such behind-the-scenes nudges may not be enough. Amazon may have to involve its own customers, or use its influence to change their shopping behavior, before it will zero out its environmental impact.“Amazon for me is a reflection of business as usual,” Godelnik. “You can talk all day about the climate crisis, but if you see packages come and go, and everything looks normal. Production, consumption. What’s the crisis?”Still, Godelnik, who lives in Princeton, New Jersey, and does most of his shopping on Amazon, doesn’t typically use the company’s no-rush shipping options himself. “I’m very bad at it, I have to admit,” he says. “Prime, it’s just addictive.”To contact the author of this story: Matt Day in Seattle at mday63@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-nixed-green-shipping-proposal-100030943.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-14	2020-02-14 23:41:10	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Axes Delivery Partners in U.S.; Hundreds of Jobs Cut	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is severing ties with small delivery firms around the country -- putting at least 1,300 drivers out of work -- in an effort to eliminate partners that aren’t meeting its standards.Bear Down Logistics, an Illinois company that rapidly expanded over the past two years, is shuttering operations in five states and letting go of about 400 drivers. Delivery Force, an Amazon delivery partner in Washington state, is cutting 272 drivers in Seattle and other cities. Kansas-based RCX Logistics, an Amazon delivery partner with operations in Texas, Alabama and Florida, will eliminate the jobs of more than 600 employees after losing its Amazon contract. Around the country, logistics firms are notifying state officials about facility closures and job cuts, signs that Amazon is culling the herd.The action underscores the challenges of outsourcing deliveries to new, untested companies instead of traditional partners such as United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. It also serves as a warning to Amazon delivery partners that the company is an exacting client willing to cut them off.Bear Down Logistics notified Ohio, Virginia, Minnesota and Illinois that it would close facilities in those states in April, resulting in the loss of almost 280 jobs. Another Bear Down facility near Grand Rapids, Michigan, will also close in April, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. About 120 drivers work at the Michigan facility, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity due to company policies about speaking with the media. The company also has Amazon delivery operations in Wisconsin, the status of which was not immediately clear.“We have a responsibility to our customers and the communities where we operate to ensure these partners meet our high standards for things like safety and working conditions,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in an email. “Occasionally we need to end a relationship with a partner and when this happens we are committed to helping the impacted employees find opportunities with other delivery service partners or to learn more about the thousands of available roles at Amazon delivery stations and fulfillment centers.”Bear Down Logistics, Delivery Force and RCX Logistics didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Amazon in 2018 launched a program encouraging aspiring entrepreneurs to lease vans, hire drivers and build their own businesses delivering packages to its customers. More than 800 such businesses have sprouted around the country with 75,000 drivers, helping Amazon increase delivery capacity. Amazon also has greater negotiating leverage over each small operator than it does with larger delivery partners like UPS, FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service.Drivers working for Amazon delivery partners typically earn less than their counterparts working at larger delivery companies like UPS, which helps Amazon lower costs. One driver working for Bear Down Logistics in Michigan said he earned about $15 an hour delivering Amazon packages, while UPS paid seasonal drivers doing the same work in that area about $20 an hour.A big challenge for Amazon is balancing safety with its efforts to deliver things quickly at the lowest possible cost. ProPublica in December revealed internal Amazon documents showing it prioritized speed over safety in its delivery network, which followed other investigations exposing the injuries and deaths that accompanied Amazon’s quick expansion of its delivery program.The Bear Down experience also shows how hard it is to make a go of such businesses. When Amazon courted entrepreneurs, it touted the prospects of earning $300,000 a year with as little as $10,000 in up front costs, significantly less than most franchise businesses that can cost more than $100,000 to launch.(Updated with job cuts in Florida, Texas and Alabama in the second paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.net;Matt Day in Seattle at mday63@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-ends-ties-delivery-partner-172305882.html?.tsrc=rss

FedEx's stock swings to sharp gains, after Express pairs with Ground for residential deliveries	Shares of FedEx Corp.  surged 3.6% in afternoon trading Friday, swinging from an earlier loss of as much as 1.5%, after the package delivery company said that beginning in March, FedEx's Express business will contract with its Ground business for select, &quot;day-definite&quot; residential deliveries. The move is aimed at increasing efficiencies and lower costs of residential deliveries, as it will reduce the number of delivery vehicles in residential neighborhoods, as e-commerce continues to grow at an &quot;explosive&quot; rate. &quot;This move makes residential deliveries more efficient by putting the right package in the right network at the right cost to serve our customers,&quot; said Chief Operating Officer Raj Subramaniam. Last month, e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc.  told its third-party merchants they can resume use of FedEx's Ground network, about a month after banning its use given the failure to meet on-time delivery standards. FedEx's stock has lost 15.1% over the past 12 months while shares of rival United Parcel Service Inc.  have slipped 3.1% and Amazon's stock has run up 28.7%.

Air Cargo Carriers Implement Coronavirus Protections	The ability to move goods in and out of China by air could hinge on the willingness of freighter aircraft pilots to fly into key industrial cities where the coronavirus is prevalent.  All-cargo carriers are filling some of the lost capacity associated with the pull down of most international passenger flights to China, and are taking protective measures to alleviate concerns of jittery crews.  On Wednesday, the union representing UPS Inc (NYSE: UPS) pilots said it had reached an agreement with the company giving members the ability to voluntarily decide whether to accept flights in and out of China.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/air-cargo-carriers-implement-coronavirus-221705646.html?.tsrc=rss

The Nasdaq Composite led the recovery, but the S&P 500 has now joined its tech-heavy brother by eclipsing January's peak. But bears still hold the upper hand in certain companies. These laggards are locked in downtrends, which makes them all attractive stocks to sell into the strength.Two of the weakest spots right now are metals and energy. I use the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (NYSEARCA:XME), and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLE) to track both areas. Unlike, say, the industrial sector, which only fell a couple percent from its peak during the recent market misstep, XME and XLE were demolished.The former fell 16.7% from its December high, and the latter dropped 15.8%. Support levels were smashed and now loom large as potential resistance zones. And that has me eyeing which stocks in each fund are worth shorting.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere are three of the most vulnerable. Stocks to Sell: Alcoa (AA)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade To say Alcoa (NYSE:AA) has been decimated would be an understatement. AA stock has fallen 89% from its highs, and with the latest downturn now sits below its 2009 low. It's as if the 11-year bull market in stocks never happened. In 2016 Alcoa shares saw a one-for-three reverse split, which boosted its share price. Unfortunately, the fundamentals have deteriorated, plunging AA back into the abyss.We're now going on four consecutive earnings announcements with negative earnings per share. The distribution following January's report was relentless, with Alcoa stock falling 11 days in a row. An oversold bounce finally emerged, and AA has rallied for three days straight and is gapping higher this morning.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends This creates a lower-risk entry for bears looking to game the downtrend.The Trade: Once AA breaks a previous day's low, buy April $17 puts or the April $17/$14 put spread. Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Energy stocks have been abandoned in favor of the tech sector and other industries offering better growth potential. Plunging oil prices certainly haven't helped matters. The latest downturn in companies like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has been particularly steep.The oil giant now is probing its lowest levels since 2010. The price reduction is so extreme that Exxon's dividend yield has risen to a juicy 5.8%. With its long history of failed rallies, it's hard to see how yesterday's bounce will prove anything more than a selling opportunity. The 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages are all cruising lower, and a major old support zone stands atop the stock near $66 and should prove formidable resistance.  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy For Insulation From Volatility And that's if we even get there. Buyers' resolve is being tested as energy continues to move into the red. Consider using a break of a prior day's low as your trigger. Option premiums are expensive, so I prefer spreads over buying puts outright.The Trade: Buy the April $62.50/$57.50 put spread. United Parcel Service (UPS)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade United Parcel Services (NYSE:UPS) rounds out our trio of stocks to sell with a clear bear retracement pattern. While it hasn't suffered as dramatic a downturn as its predecessors in recent years, last month's post-earnings whack was massive. The major support break and volume surge have me betting rallies will be short-lived.The selling pressure is simply too intense.I think yesterday's ramp offers a chance to deploy bearish trades. Implied volatility is high enough to make bear call spreads interesting. They offer a higher probability of profit than buying puts or shorting the stock, so we can profit even if UPS stock treads water for a few weeks.The Trade: Sell the March $110/$115 bear call spread for around 70 cents.As of this writing, Tyler Craig held bearish positions in UPS.

Aviation data firm OAG said there would be more than 25,000 fewer flights operated to, from and within China this week compared with two weeks ago, with 30 airlines halting services.  About half of the air cargo carried globally is in the belly of passenger jets rather than in dedicated freighters, and the flight cuts have made the Chinese market more dependent on freight haulers.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/air-cargo-carriers-china-demand-030311890.html?.tsrc=rss

Analyst Christopher Muir lowered his stock price target by $11 to $65 and cut per-share earnings estimates. Our target is a 17% peer-discount 17.1x our '20 EPS estimate, which we think is warranted by our view of a below-peer three-year EPS growth rate,&quot; the analyst wrote in commentary. &quot;Looking ahead, we see lower segment results in '20 driven by nylon headwinds in T&I and the absence of certain gains recorded in 2019, offset by synergies, cost reductions, and other items.&quot; DuPont said slack demand for nylon will weigh on 2020 earnings. Weak industrial production has been cited by other manufacturers as a headwind this year, including 3M  and UPS .

But UPS’s investments in automation -- designed to cut costs in the long term -- are weighing on the 2020 outlook, which fell short of Wall Street’s expectations.Parcel delivery companies are struggling to keep up with a flood of online shopping that requires faster deliveries seven days a week, as well as extended hours for retailers to ship packages. UPS is moving quicker to meet that demand, especially for small businesses. While those efforts will crank up costs and hurt profit in the short run, Abney said results will improve as soon as next year.“The opportunities are there. Shareholders would expect us to take it,” the CEO said in an interview Thursday. “If the end number is a little bit less than what people were expecting, it’s an investment in the future, but the short-term future.”Stock DropThe shares tumbled 4.8% to $110.19 at 11:42 a.m., the biggest intraday drop in three months.Adjusted earnings will be no more than $8.06 a share this year, the company said in a statement. That trailed the $8.07 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.UPS has dealt with negative investor reaction before. Shares tanked when Abney introduced a three-year, $20 billion spending plan in 2018 to boost automation and purchase new aircraft. The strategy eventually won over investors after the company halted a long slide in profit margins.UPS logged a third consecutive quarter of gains in profit margins. That reversed a slide that began at the end of 2016, when rising e-commerce deliveries jacked up costs. Fourth-quarter operating margin increased to 11.1% from 10.1% a year earlier as the courier emerged unscathed from another record holiday delivery season.Automation helped drive down the cost to deliver a package by 3.2% on an adjusted basis, the company said. Volume for all products in the U.S. surged 9% in the quarter.Amazon EffectUPS’s next-day air volume jumped 26% in the quarter as the company got a boost from Amazon after it broke off business with FedEx last year. Amazon-related sales, which are concentrated in the U.S., rose to about $8.6 billion, or 11.6% of UPS’s total revenue last year.The company also wants to expand sales with large U.S. retailers, Abney said. More than 90% of large retailers are already UPS customers, including Target Corp., Macy’s Inc., Best Buy Co. and Gap Inc., he said. The company is tailoring services to attract more business from them, including extending deadlines for picking up packages from stores for next-day shipment.“We have deepening ties with everyone. We don’t see this as you’ve got to choose one way or the other,” he said. “We’re concentrating on serving the entire e-commerce ecosystem.”The extra spending this year to increase speed and weekend service will shave about 33 cents a share off earnings, the company said, while increased pension costs will subtract another 26 cents.Expanding HubsLower costs for its international operations drove a 3.6% gain in operating profit even as sales fell. Abney said he expects international revenue to rise this year after the U.S., Canada and Mexico approved a revised trade pact and the U.S. and China stabilized tariffs in the first phase of a trade deal. It’s too early to gauge how the coronavirus outbreak may impact trade, Abney said.UPS plans capital spending of about $6.7 billion this year as it builds more automated sorting hubs. Last year, spending was about $6.5 billion. Free cash flow, which is money left over after paying all bills, is expected to be $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion, an increase from $4.1 billion in 2019.Capital expenditures were about 8.8% of sales in 2019. That will trend down to a historic average of about 7% after the spending plan winds down, said Chief Financial Officer Brian Newman on a conference call with analysts.UPS posted fourth-quarter earnings per share of $2.11, compared with the $2.10 average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 3.6% to $20.6 billion, in line with estimates.(Updates with CEO comment beginning in 12th paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Black in Dallas at tblack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Case at bcase4@bloomberg.net, Susan Warren, Tony RobinsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-profit-forecast-falls-short-121849985.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-28	2020-01-28 10:00:36	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEx CEO Sees Vindication Ahead for His Anti-Amazon Strategy	(Bloomberg) -- FedEx Corp. founder Fred Smith, nearing the end of a legendary career, says he’s going to prove himself right one more time.Best known for disrupting the parcel delivery business by introducing overnight service, Smith is now getting disrupted himself by e-commerce and the rise of online shopping. He’s taking a pounding from Wall Street for FedEx’s disappointing performance, while analysts praise archrival United Parcel Service Inc. for reversing a decline in profit margins.Smith is frustrated, defiant, indignant by turn. But most of all he’s confident — as he asserted more than 20 times during a two-hour interview in which he laid out his strategy to master e-commerce and become the fastest, most cost-efficient ground courier. He’s drawing the battle lines, positioning FedEx as a kind of anti-Amazon ally for big-box retailers and pledging that his strategy will soon enable FedEx to overtake UPS.“I will say to you unequivocally: In the next two or three years, I’m firmly of the belief we will pass UPS in terms of size and be the largest by-revenue transportation and logistics” company, Smith said. UPS reports its 2019 financial results Thursday.The 75-year-old founder and chief executive officer is the first to admit his plans haven’t gone smoothly. FedEx’s international business has been plagued by setbacks, including a 2017 cyber attack and a costly air-fleet expansion that was undercut by Donald Trump’s trade wars. Back home, a falling out with Amazon.com Inc. drained $900 million off the courier’s top line.FedEx investors have paid the price. After the shares of both couriers tumbled in 2018, UPS shares gained 20% last year, while FedEx slumped 6.3%. A string of earnings disappointments have driven down FedEx by 43% in two years. Shares rose less than 1% to $149.14 at 11:06 a.m. Tuesday in New York trading.But Smith is nothing if not battle-hardened. The Yale-educated former Marine has been shot at in the jungles of Vietnam and almost bankrupted his family fortune to create an unprecedented express delivery market. He built FedEx while overcoming the 1970s Arab oil embargo, two Middle East wars that stalled growth, as well as the 2008 economic meltdown.“I’ve been through this before, getting smacked when bad things happened in the middle of building things,” Smith said in an interview late last month. “I mean, this is kind of the story of my life.”As the CEO enters his 47th year at the helm, he’s driven more than ever to get his vision across to investors and bring FedEx back on solid footing before stepping down -- a prospect he’s now contemplating.While acknowledging that the company isn’t making as much money as he’d like, Smith promises by mid-year it will be clear that his plan is working.The two biggest parcel delivery companies in North America are forging dramatically different paths as they adjust their business models to the tsunami of e-commerce. Their success will help decide the market war between Amazon and Walmart Inc., and perhaps the future course of the entire retail industry.While UPS is deepening its ties to Amazon, FedEx has broken away, instead working to strengthen its relationship with brick-and-mortar retailers to help them win at e-commerce. While UPS wants to stay neutral with customers, Smith is banking on an us-against-Amazon mentality.“I have this completely iconoclastic — it’s not a belief, it’s a certainty — they are going to disrupt Amazon,” Smith said of traditional retailers. “We came to this fork in the road that we had to ally with one side or the other. They want to become more adept in the e-commerce space, and we intend to allow them to do that.”Another difference is that UPS is relying more on the U.S. Postal Service, especially for Sunday deliveries, while FedEx is taking back about 2 million packages a day that it had been handing off to the government agency for final delivery. With the increased volume, FedEx can better leverage its more than 600 sorting and delivery facilities around the U.S. to help retailers with shipments from stores to residences.Skeptical analysts like Morgan Stanley’s Ravi Shanker aren’t sure that ramping up volume in short-haul deliveries will produce the kind of returns Smith seeks.“He’s trying to put as many boxes through his network as he possibly can and it’s hard to debate that approach as long as he can demonstrate viable returns and improving profitability,” Shanker said. “I think the jury is going to be out until they actually deliver that.”Crown JewelThe push to catch UPS has come at a cost. Since 1995, FedEx’s capital spending has been 9% of sales on average, compared with less than 6% at UPS, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the past decade, FedEx’s average return on invested capital has been 13%, well below its rival’s 24%.FedEx’s ground unit — started two decades ago to counter UPS’s venture into overnight service — has become the crown jewel of Smith’s company. Revenue almost tripled in the last decade, compared with a 75% increase at its Express air cargo business. Profit margins averaged 15% for ground compared with 5.6% for Express. The unit has gained U.S. market share in 19 of the last 20 years, Smith said.A sharpened ground service is a crucial part of FedEx’s strategy in teaming with traditional retailers. To compete on e-commerce, big retailers like Wal-Mart, Target Corp. and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. have improved technology to track merchandise, and to pick, pack and ship from local stores.Retailers’ thousands of neighborhood stores, coupled with FedEx’s network of delivery facilities, should provide an edge over Amazon, which has many fewer facilities and must use aircraft to fly in goods not on hand at fulfillment centers.“We already know how to do this,” said Smith, who notes that more than 90% of the U.S. population is within five miles of a FedEx facility. “That’s why we say with such confidence that we can do it and be the low-cost, high-service provider.”The CEO sees FedEx moving beyond its rough patch this year as the swell of spending subsides and growth makes up for the lost Amazon business. FedEx predicts profit margins in its ground unit will rebound into the teens by the quarter ending in May, after they dropped to 9% for the six months through November.Smith’s confidence isn’t shaken by the recent avalanche of criticism, in part because he says analysts and competitors don’t have all the internal data that he has to show why his plan will work.“Take your best shot,” he said of his critics. “We’ll see who wins in the end here.”To contact the author of this story: Thomas Black in Dallas at tblack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Susan Warren at susanwarren@bloomberg.net, Brendan CaseFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-smith-promises-2020-rebound-100036101.html?.tsrc=rss

Federal Aviation Administration Suggests Remote Tracking For Drones	The proposed regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would make remote tracking possible for almost all drones.  FAA’s proposal comes at a time when drone delivery is gradually becoming mainstream, and companies are in a race to develop drone fleets for e-commerce stores.  United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) said in October it received federal approval to set up a fleet of unmanned aircraft to deliver health supplies and consumer packages potentially throughout the U.S.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-aviation-administration-suggests-remote-050224420.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-12-26	2019-12-26 19:48:33	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Drones Need Tracking Network for Expanded Flights, FAA Says	(Bloomberg) -- All but the smallest civilian drones would have to broadcast radio tracking data to ensure greater safety and prevent terrorism under a sweeping proposal unveiled by U.S. regulators Thursday.The long-awaited draft rules call for a massive new tracking network for everything from toys to larger commercial drones so that law enforcement can spot the devices flying anywhere, from congested urban areas to the most rural zones.The controversial measure by the Federal Aviation Administration, which is subject to public comment and could change before it becomes final, is a key foundation to advance drone-driven commerce, including deliveries of consumer goods by companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Wing and Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Air. The rules would come into full force three years after being finalized.“Remote ID technologies will enhance safety and security by allowing the FAA, law enforcement and federal security agencies to identify drones flying in their jurisdiction,” Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said in a press release.With only limited exceptions for groups such as model-airplane operators, all drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds (0.25 kilograms) would have to broadcast their position and operator’s identity at all times under the FAA proposal.The FAA is suggesting that private companies approved by the agency would set up tracking systems for drones, replicating the existing air-traffic control system for traditional aircraft.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce believes the proposed rule on remote identification of drones “will help ensure the safety and security of the airspace and enable more innovative applications and uses of unmanned aircraft systems such as package delivery and long-range surveying,” according to Tim Day, senior vice president for the group’s Technology Engagement Center.Law enforcement and homeland security agencies had demanded a tracking mandate in response to the growing number of drone threats, including a handful of close calls that halted airline flights near airports, collisions with other aircraft or use of the devices by terrorists around the world.The FAA is attempting to finalize the regulation as soon as possible, said Brandon Roberts, the agency’s acting director of rulemaking. An earlier proposal by the FAA to allow drone flights over people has been held up until a tracking system can be developed.“This is an important building block in the unmanned traffic management ecosystem,” the FAA said in the proposal.The issue has fractured the rapidly growing base of drone operators, at times pitting recreational fliers and different segments of the industry against each other even as the majority of users acknowledge the need for some type of tracking. It also has raised significant concerns about government monitoring of the public.Under the FAA proposal, if drone operators want to operate freely, they would have to both broadcast their identity on a radio frequency that can be monitored nearby and simultaneously upload the information via the internet.In that way, other nearby drones and aircraft can steer clear and local police equipped with tracking devices could identify rogue operators. At the same time, the devices could be monitored from a remote, central system.Drone users can choose a more limited option of uploading the information to the internet only, but they would be restricted to flying within 400 feet of the operator.The agency is proposing that the rules would take full effect three years after being finalized, meaning routine delivery flights and other commercial operations won’t be possible until at least then.Existing drones wouldn’t have to install tracking equipment retroactively, but would in most cases be banned from operation after the rule becomes law. Starting two years after the regulation takes effect, new unmanned devices sold would have to have approved tamper-resistant tracking devices.The costs on the public and the drone industry for the proposed regulation would be an estimated $584 million over a 10-year span. Some drones may be able to comply with just a software change, so those owners may not have to pay anything, according to the agency.The proposal would create exemptions designed for traditional model-aircraft operators, who have been flying at designated sites for decades without posing a safety hazard.Because there is no current method of reliably tracking the devices, existing regulations typically require civilian hobbyists and commercial operators to keep their drones within 400 feet of the ground and within sight. Better tracking would not only allow drones to fly safely over far larger areas, it could also enable a robotic system allowing drones to sense each each and avoid collisions.The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, an industry trade group, applauded the FAA for moving forward on a proposal that had repeatedly been delayed.“The importance of remote ID regulations cannot be overstated, as they are necessary to enable advanced and expanded operations,” said Brian Wynne, the group’s president.The Academy of Model Aeronautics, which represents model aircraft buffs, has argued that its members have their own system of identification, so should be at least partly exempt.SZ DJI Technology Co., the world’s largest civilian drone manufacturer, has touted its own proprietary tracking system, but its not clear whether it would meet the proposed new standards. The company is still reviewing the proposal, said Brendan Schulman, vice president of policy and legal affairs.“As we review the FAA’s proposal, we will be guided by the principle, recognized by the FAA’s own Aviation Rulemaking Committee in 2017, that remote identification will not be successful if the burdens and costs to drone operators are not minimized,” Schulman said in an emailed statement.By contrast, Wing and Amazon want a more formalized technology that can track drones in real time across the nation, similar to how existing radars keep tabs on jetliners now. Such a system is needed to maintain order in skies crowded with drones, they say.The rapid growth in drone use has been a challenge for regulators. More than 1 million people and businesses have registered with the FAA as drone owners and the agency estimates there were 1.3 million of the devices in the U.S.Through June, there have been more than 8,700 reports received by the FAA of drones flying in prohibited areas or in an unsafe manner. There are typically more than 200 such incidents a month when the weather is warmer, according to FAA data.While most incidents are relatively minor, the large numbers indicate that at least some drone users are ignoring the rules. Catching such perpetrators has proven all but impossible.The National Transportation Safety Board has confirmed at least two collisions between a drone and a traditional aircraft: a U.S. Army helicopter hit a small civilian drone in September 2017 near New York City and a small drone grazed a hot-air balloon in Idaho in August 2018.The agency is investigating whether a drone struck a TV station’s helicopter flying over Los Angeles on Dec. 4. The impact damaged areas near the tail of the copter.Another fear is the growing use of drones as terrorist weapons. FBI Director Christopher Wray warned lawmakers last year that drones pose a “steadily escalating threat.”Saudi Arabian officials alleged that drones were used to attack that country’s oil fields on Sept. 14, though they were far larger than the typical civilian drone. Explosive-laden drones were used in an unsuccessful assassination attempt against Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro last year.(Updates with DOT secretary quote, details from the fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Alan Levin in Washington at alevin24@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth Wasserman, Steve GeimannFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drones-huge-tracking-network-expanded-162955689.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-19	2019-12-19 21:41:53	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Is Its Own Biggest Mailman, Shipping 3.5 Billion Parcels	(Bloomberg) -- As Amazon.com Inc. works to speed orders to customer doorsteps before Christmas, the e-commerce giant is touting an accomplishment that would have seemed absurd just a few years ago: Amazon is now its own biggest carrier.In the U.S., delivery contractors and on-demand workers now account for a majority of deliveries to customers, an Amazon spokeswoman said. Globally, “approximately half” of Amazon deliveries are completed by Amazon Logistics, the network the company built in recent years to handle a surge in deliveries that United Parcel Service Inc., FedEx Corp. and the U.S. Postal Service were unprepared to handle.In a press release on Thursday touting the scale of Amazon’s network, Dave Clark, the increasingly influential executive who oversees Amazon’s logistics organization, said Amazon was on pace to deliver 3.5 billion of its own packages to customers this year. That exceeded some analyst estimates. Morgan Stanley earlier this month estimated that Amazon shipped some 2.5 billion of its own packages a year.Amazon has stocked its warehouses for decades, but once relied exclusively on the likes of UPS and FedEx to take packages from those facilities to a customer’s doorstep -- the so-called last mile. The Seattle company began to expand its capacity to move packages on its own following a disastrous 2013 holiday season, when rough weather and logistical bottlenecks led to missed deliveries and angry shoppers.Clark says Amazon now contracts with more than 800 delivery service partners, who employ a combined 75,000 drivers in the U.S. They take packages from some 150 delivery stations located in major U.S. metropolitan areas.That buildout has been marred by controversy, including reports of deaths and injuries as contract drivers speed through neighborhoods around the country.Clark on Thursday was keen to tout Amazon’s safety record, saying last-mile deliveries had traveled more than 800 million miles this year and beat a safety benchmark from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. He didn’t provide data.To contact the reporter on this story: Matt Day in Seattle at mday63@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-own-biggest-mailman-shipping-214153624.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-18	2019-12-18 18:16:51	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Teladoc Stock Is Poised for More Explosive Growth Ahead	Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) continued rewarding investors with the stock uptrend in the last quarter. And for good reason, too. The company posted strong third-quarter top-line results and raised its guidance. Markets view the multinational telemedicine and virtual healthcare supplier as both part healthcare and part technology. By utilizing artificial intelligence and analytics and licensing its platform services, this scalable company touched all-time highs recently. The stock may forge new highs if it raises its guidance yet again.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com In the third quarter, Teladoc reported revenue of $138 million, up 24% from last year. Revenue growth was lifted by global subscription access fees of $119.1 million. This accounted for 86% of its total revenue. It lost 28 cents a share, which is not a concern because the company is building its sales levels and taking market share first. The company forecast Q4 revenue in the range between $149 million and $153 million.For full-year 2019, revenue will be $546 million to $550 million. This is up from its previous guidance of $538 million to $545 million. Teladoc expects total visits topping up to 4.1 million.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVisits rose 45% from last year to 928,000. And utilization rates came in just under 8%, up 17 basis points year-over-year. Strong TailwindsTeladoc benefited from the greatest population expansion in the company's history. When over 17 million people gained access to Teladoc, it lifted total visits and revenue. More importantly, TDOC stock rose because investors expect the company to further entrench its distribution channels. Management added UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) to its platform. That netted 15 million commercial members and gives UNH a fully integrated virtual care offering to its customers.  * 5 Large-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy Teladoc proved it can deliver on a product rollout without any project delays. Its initial launch went through without any issues. The teams at Teladoc and UNH proved they can collaborate successfully. This may lead to more collaborative projects for Teladoc in the future, further expanding its population expansion.In the last quarter, the company saw request for proposal volumes jump 25% year-over-year. This implies product orders will continue increasing as client interest strengthens. Bookings rose around 30% and along with deal sizes increasing, Teladoc is on a positive trajectory. Global GrowthTeladoc launched in the United Kingdom and introduced the market to its first virtual mental health service. It counted on American International Group (NYSE:AIG) for the launch. In Canada, Great-West Life added the Mental Health Navigator service. In the U.S., companies like UPS (NYSE:UPS) and Nationwide Insurance chose Teladoc to give over 100,000 employees access to medical experts. So, the Teladoc medical expert service, which is a virtual center of excellence, should improve health support for those who need it.2020 will benefit from accelerating revenue growth, as management forecasts long-term annual revenue growth between 20% and 30%. And thanks to the customer base getting bigger annually and clients coming from a variety of global locations, TDOC stock deserves richer premiums. Price Target And My TakeawayNine of the 14 analysts who cover Teladoc stock rank it as a &quot;buy.&quot; Their average price target is $85.07. Conversely, the cautious investor may forecast a downside scenario in which revenue growth stalls. Assume that the perpetuity growth rate is 4% and revenue growth falls to 30% annually. In this case, TDOC stock is worth $70.For now, Teladoc investors need not expect growth slowing. The company is gaining momentum and winning bigger contract deals. This will support its historical sales growth rates, sending the stock higher.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

FedEx stock selloff slashing 95 points off the Dow transports price	Shares of FedEx Corp.  sank 9.6% in morning trade Wednesday, to pace both the Dow Jones Transportation Average's  and S&P 500's  decliners, after the package delivery service reported earnings and revenue that fell more than expected and cut is full-year outlook. The stock's price decline of $15.62 shaved about 95 points off the Dow transports's price, which was down 125 points, or 1.2%, despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average's  21-point, or 0.1%, gain. FedEx's woes were also weighing on United Parcel Service Inc. , as the FedEx rival's stock slumped $2.17, or 1.8%, to act as a 13-point drag on the Dow transports.

2019-12-18	2019-12-18 14:45:47	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	For FedEx, It Can Always Get Worse	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It can always get worse for FedEx Corp.Back in June, I wrote that the parcel-delivery company had managed to fall out of a basement window when it issued fiscal 2020 guidance that fell well short of already depressed expectations. Two guidance cuts later, it seems we’ve sunk below the foundation and are in the dirt with the worms.  The latest of these misses came after the close of trading on Tuesday, when  FedEx said it would earn no more than $11.50 a share in adjusted earnings and perhaps as little as $10.25. At the low end of the range, FedEx is facing an earnings slide nearly on par with what it experienced in 2009 amid the financial crisis. What’s worse is that its plan to fix this debacle rests largely on a “ just trust us” defense from a management team that continues to point the finger for its woes at a weak industrial economy and rising e-commerce costs — things that rivals United Parcel Service Inc. and DHL seem to have a much better handle on.The current quarter could still bring more disappointments, with FedEx not calling for a significant rebound in slumping profit margins at its ground unit until the last three months of its fiscal year, which ends in May. But FedEx chief financial officer Alan Graf proclaimed that the company was “at the bottom and we’re going to come up off the mat.” He may be right. Amazon.com Inc. stopped using FedEx to transport its own packages earlier this year and this week announced that it was banning the carrier from shuttling Prime packages for third-party merchants. While FedEx has said the impact to its revenue from the lost Amazon business is small, it’s still been a drag. The upside is that will make the comparisons easier in fiscal 2021. FedEx will also see the volume benefits from its rollout of seven-day delivery service, while a trade deal between the U.S. and China ( should one actually materialize) could boost the industrial sector and global economy. In the meantime, FedEx is reducing capacity at its Express air-delivery unit and plans to cut international and domestic flight hours by as much as 8%. It’s also planning a price increase on large packages in January and is trying to drive more volume from businesses, which tends to be more profitable than the e-commerce shipments it ferries to consumers’ doors.But these feel like the sort of things that should have been announced more than a year ago and could have helped the company avoid some of its present pain. It’s not like FedEx’s challenges only recently sprung up, so it’s hard to fathom how the company could be caught so flat-footed by the November quarter’s disappointments. And FedEx only reluctantly took responsibility for the shortfalls. It fielded three questions from three different analysts on why there was such a giant miss on operating margins before CEO Fred Smith acknowledged on the earnings call that FedEx probably underestimated some of the cost of standing up the seven-day-a-week delivery service. It’s hard to think of a parallel example where management credibility is so low and management seems completely oblivious to that fact, although 3M Co. comes to mind.For all this talk of a bottom, the real turnaround would likely come in fiscal 2022, when management says capital expenditures will decline significantly as it completes a replacement program for aging aircraft and at long last wraps up the costly and lengthy integration of its acquisition of European carrier TNT Express. The decline in spending will be a relief for investors who have been flummoxed by the lack of returns on the billions FedEx has spent upgrading its network over the past few years, but it still doesn’t answer the question of why that payoff has failed to materialize. One argument for FedEx’s severed relationship with Amazon is that as the e-commerce giant expanded its in-house logistics operations, it was only handing off the least profitable packages to third parties like FedEx. Troublingly, FedEx’s average yield in the ground business still declined by 0.1% in the fiscal second quarter even without the Amazon impact, while pricing power in the U.S. express business declined 0.3%.The best-case scenario is that this isn’t a structural shift, but an execution issue. At a company that’s repeatedly struggled with execution over the past few years, that doesn’t inspire a lot of faith.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-12-18	2019-12-18 14:40:18	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEx Sinks as ‘Breathtakingly Bad’ Results Spur Outlook Cut	(Bloomberg) -- FedEx Corp. plunged after cutting its profit forecast for the second straight quarter, as weak international demand hurt sales and the courier ramped up investment to handle soaring e-commerce deliveries.The results for the company’s fiscal second quarter were “breathtakingly bad,” with weakness in both the ground-delivery unit and air-cargo business, said Deutsche Bank AG analyst Amit Mehrotra. Adjusted earnings will be no more than $11.50 a share in the fiscal year ending in May, down from the previous expectation of as much as $13, FedEx said in a statement Tuesday.“Earnings appear to be in free fall, with seemingly little clarity being provided by management as to the duration of the current downturn and drivers of recovery,” Mehrotra said. “We’d characterize these numbers as weaker than even the most bearish estimates.”FedEx’s crumbling outlook is piling pressure on Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith as the company contends with disruptions driven by the rise of online shopping and Amazon.com Inc. FedEx and Amazon, which is building out its own delivery network, ended most of their business ties this year. That’s weighing on FedEx’s sales, which are also suffering from weaker pricing, trade tensions and the timing of Thanksgiving in the U.S.The shares tumbled 8.9% to $148.73 at 9:35 a.m. in New York, the worst drop on the S&P 500 Index. FedEx had advanced 1.2% this year through Tuesday, trailing both the 23% gain by United Parcel Service Inc. and a 27% increase for the S&P 500 Index.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysWhile we knew fiscal 2020 would be a transition year for FedEx, there is a disconnect between management’s expectations and the market it’s operating in.&#92;--Lee Klaskow, freight analystClick here to read the researchE-commerce has been squeezing profit margins at both FedEx and UPS. That’s because home deliveries are typically less profitable than drop-offs at businesses, where drivers can often leave multiple packages with a single stop.But FedEx continues to lag in adapting to the online surge. While UPS has stabilized its margins in recent quarters, FedEx’s margins have shrunk.Amazon FeudFedEx was already reeling this week as its feud with Amazon intensified in the middle of the busy holiday delivery season. Citing poor service, Amazon banned third-party merchants from using FedEx’s services.While FedEx said Amazon’s latest salvo would only affect a very modest amount of business, it acknowledged that the end of most of its business with the e-commerce giant dented sales.Trade tensions also crimped demand from key industrial customers, FedEx said, even as the standoff between the U.S. and China has eased somewhat. FedEx has parked planes, reduced flight hours by 8% and stopped hiring pilots to match air-cargo capacity with slower international demand.Revenue took another blow from the late timing of Thanksgiving. That gave rise to an unusually late start to the peak holiday shipping season, which got into full swing after FedEx’s fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 30. And FedEx said it underestimated the cost of moving to seven-day service.“We’re at the bottom and we’re going to come up off the mat,” Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said on a conference call to discuss earnings.Margin ErosionAfter adjusting for pension costs and integration expenses for the TNT Express operation in Europe, FedEx’s operating profit last quarter plummeted to 3.9% of sales from 7.5% a year earlier. That badly trailed the long-term goal of 10% operating margins.Adjusted earnings fell to $2.51 a share, missing the $2.78 average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales slipped 2.8% to $17.3 billion.Trip Miller, a managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners and FedEx investor, said he would stick with the company as it remakes its business for the next decade.“When you go through a transition like FedEx is you can kind of throw all the numbers out the window,” Miller said. “They’re not going to be pretty.”Smith called the results an anomaly because of the shortened holiday-shipping activity last quarter and the higher costs to change operations at the ground unit.On the call with analysts, he vowed that margins at the division -- which fell to 6.4% last quarter from 11.5% a year earlier -- would rebound to the teens by the quarter ending in May.“We remain highly confident in our strategies, which we believe will begin to bear fruit by our fourth fiscal quarter” he said.(Updates shares in fifth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Black in Dallas at tblack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Case at bcase4@bloomberg.net, Susan WarrenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-sinks-breathtakingly-bad-results-101335855.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-17	2019-12-17 10:00:51	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	The Man Who Built Amazon’s Delivery Machine	(Bloomberg) -- Shortly after being named Amazon.com Inc.’s global logistics chief in 2013, Dave Clark held a conference call with his new reports. During the meet-and-greet, according to a person on the call, Clark described his early-career habit of lurking in the shadows of Amazon warehouses and scoping out slackers he could fire, which earned him the nickname The Sniper. Clark speaks in a monotone and is hard to read, but the message was clear enough: The new boss wanted his underlings to know that he will let little stand in the way of ensuring that customers get their orders on time.The Sniper demonstrated his determination yet again on Sunday, when—at the height of the holiday shopping rush—he essentially fired FedEx Corp. Clark’s team had noticed that FedEx’s delivery performance was slipping and banned third-party merchants from using the logistics giant’s ground network for the rest of the season.Clark has not forgotten the shambolic holiday season of 2013. Just months after he had taken over, a combination of foul weather and logistical bottlenecks derailed holiday deliveries and forced Amazon to issue refunds to irate shoppers. It was an unprecedented setback for a company that puts customers at the center of everything. Determined to prevent a recurrence, Clark has since spent billions of dollars building a sprawling delivery operation that includes a worldwide network of robot-filled warehouses, fleets of planes and delivery vans and hundreds of thousands of workers.The idea was to wean Amazon off its reliance on partners like FedEx and United Parcel Service Inc., which have been loath to invest in extra capacity for the brief holiday period. As of August, according to Morgan Stanley research, Amazon was delivering 46% of U.S. packages bought on its platform and is now shipping 2.5 billion packages a year, compared with 3 billion for FedEx and 4.7 billion for UPS. Some analysts believe the delivery machine Clark has built could one day become an entirely new business and eventually end UPS’s and FedEx’s primacy.Clark’s boss, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, may dream of a future when quick delivery is largely delegated to drones flying through the skies and robots rolling down sidewalks. But Clark inhabits a messier present, where meeting Bezos’s expectations falls mostly to hourly workers who endure long shifts fetching and packing products and driving them to homes. Amazon and Clark insist worker safety is a top priority. Yet Amazon has trailed deaths and injuries in its wake. As soon as the company addresses one problem, a new one emerges.The toll might make some executives more cautious. Not Bezos and Clark. Grappling with stepped-up competition from Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., Amazon earlier this year committed to deliver millions of products in just one day. Clark must honor that pledge during a holiday shopping season that’s almost a week shorter than it was last year, all the while keeping workers safe and customers happy. He’s mostly succeeded for the past two decades, during which holiday season sales have soared 30-fold to $144 billion. Still, some observers think that by growing so much so fast, Amazon is courting disaster.“Nobody has a transportation system designed to handle the kind of growth we’ve seen in e-commerce,” says Marc Wulfraat, who co-founded the logistics consulting firm MWPVL International. “Amazon is just shifting the problem from UPS to itself, but it’s still the same fundamental problem of not having enough capacity. Amazon’s solution is to whip everyone as hard as it can.”Clark grew up with Amazon, taking his first job there in 1999 and quickly rising through the ranks. His longevity has made him a trusted caretaker of the company’s oldest and largest business. Now 47, he’s among more than 20 senior executives on Bezos’s coveted S-team and next year will take on the added responsibility of running the brick-and-mortar operations, including Whole Foods and the Amazon Go chain of cashierless convenience stores. Clark declined to be interviewed for this story.His colleagues describe a demanding manager who is impossible to bluff. During the holidays, Clark’s team meets daily to review metrics about Amazon facilities around the world. Clark can zero in on any signs of trouble since he’s been scanning the same figures for 20 years. A key metric is the estimated delivery time shoppers see when they view a product on Amazon, which is broken down by geography. If the number is moving in the wrong direction, Clark demands an explanation and a solution. The culture is far from pleasant, but current and former insiders marvel at its effectiveness.“Everyone would sweat when Dave asked them a question because usually Dave was right and you were wrong,” says Neil Ackerman, a former Amazon executive who left the company in 2015. “He knows every nook and cranny of the company.”Clark has always been mindful of worker safety, according to people who worked with him. When a Pennsylvania newspaper spotlighted Amazon workers enduring brutal heat in an Allentown warehouse in 2011, Clark backed spending $50 million to install air conditioning at facilities around the country, the people said. Amazon was considering less expensive measures, such as cooling warehouses only in the hottest climates.Clark also distinguished himself by taking big risks, rare in logistics since most executives aren’t allowed to lose money to the extent tolerated at Amazon. A defining moment came in 2012 when Amazon was thinking about buying robot-maker Kiva Systems to make its warehouses more efficient. Workers were walking miles each day fetching products; instead Kiva robots would bring them the products. But the $775 million price represented Amazon’s second-biggest acquisition at the time behind online footwear seller Zappos, so executives were hesitant. Breaking the silence in a meeting, according to an attendee, Clark said, “I only know one way to play poker and that’s all-in,” then pushed an imaginary pile of chips to the center of a conference table.Amazon now has more than 200,000 robots worldwide. Of course, automation brought its own headaches, exposing Amazon to charges that it was looking eventually to kill hundreds of thousands of jobs. Sometimes, the robots mess up. Last year, one punctured a can of bear repellent in a New Jersey warehouse, sending two dozen Amazon workers to the hospital and providing satirical fodder for HBO’s John Oliver. Clark said he was a fan of Oliver’s show, but found the Amazon segment “insulting.”In truth, automation can’t solve Amazon’s insatiable appetite for more delivery capacity. Every holiday season, the company hires legions of temporary workers—this year, it’s bringing on 200,000 of them, double the number in 2018. These recruits are expected to adapt quickly to a fast pace of lifting heavy boxes and hitting exacting metrics. Mistakes happen. In 2013, a temporary worker was crushed to death in a package-sorting conveyor system in New Jersey. Two years later, federal regulators inspected an Amazon warehouse in New Jersey and later fined the company for failing to report at least 26 work-related illnesses and injuries.Clark responded swiftly, mandating more thorough reporting of injuries at all Amazon facilities, according to people familiar with the matter. He believed Amazon could address safety issues in its facilities only if it collected more data, the people said. Amazon attributes this more thorough injury reporting to the findings in a recent report by the Center for Investigative Reporting that injury rates in 23 Amazon facilities are more than double the national average for warehouses. Logistics industry insiders say financial incentives such as safety bonuses discourage accurate injury reporting in the industry, making it difficult to find a benchmark.In 2016, Amazon launched an air cargo operation that helps shuffle inventory around the country to meet growing demand and enable quicker delivery. The move has become a symbol of Amazon’s logistics ambitions and highlights Bezos’ faith in Clark, with planes flying out of more than 20 airports around the country. Amazon keeps expanding the fleet and expects to have 70 planes by 2021.Amazon Air has brought its own set of challenges. Union pilots picket every year outside Amazon’s annual shareholder meeting in Seattle, to protest low pay and staffing shortages that they say result in unsafe working conditions. About 250 pilots, including some who fly for Amazon, staged a brief strike in 2016 before a judge ordered them back to work. In February, a cargo jet hauling Amazon packages crashed as it was preparing to land near Houston and the three people aboard died.The crash remains under investigation and the family of one of the pilots filed a lawsuit against Amazon and cargo carrier Atlas Air. The lawsuit alleges that Amazon contributed to an unsafe work environment by overworking pilots to the point of fatigue. “We remain heartbroken by the loss of Flight 3591 that claimed the lives of two Atlas Air pilots, and a third pilot from another airline that was a passenger,” Amazon said in an emailed statement. “Their families continue to be our top priority.  We do not comment on any pending or potential litigation.”In addition to planes, Amazon spent the past few years experimenting with a new delivery network through regional couriers to reduce its reliance on big delivery partners. Once again, the need for extra capacity has made the company vulnerable to incidents over which it has little control. Home security footage of delivery fails is a staple of local television news. Delivery people have been captured flinging Amazon packages like Frisbees, hurling them like bowling balls, even dribbling boxes like soccer balls toward the front door. In an infamous incident that infuriated Clark, a contract driver was caught on camera defecating in a residential Sacramento driveway.On Twitter, Clark is a self-appointed guardian of Amazon’s reputation. He recently tweeted security footage of a delivery driver dancing after a Delaware customer left him snacks on the front stoop. Two weeks ago, Clark took to Twitter to dispute news reports that Amazon was having delivery problems, saying the company quickly responded to weather disruptions. Clark says the media choose to focus on the relatively few deliveries that go awry when the vast majority go smoothly.The metrics bear him out. Amazon delivers more than 90% of its packages on time, on par with UPS and FedEx, says Sriram Sridhar, whose Lateshipment.com monitors delivery companies. ‘The expectation is for Amazon to be able to pull it off this year because they’ve been slowly building up for this,” he says. “Even if they slip up in some aspects of the last mile, it’s not something they will walk away from because it’s such an important aspect of their business.” Clark also knows that most customers, even the angriest ones who complain on TV news, can be mollified with a refund.Yet the strains on Amazon’s formidable delivery machine aren’t going away. The low U.S. unemployment rate means Amazon’s delivery partners are constantly churning through drivers who sometimes quit mid-route on their first day, prompting a scramble to deliver hundreds of packages. Investors are concerned that the next-day shipping pledge is too expensive. In October, Amazon reported its first year-over-year quarterly profit decline since early 2017 because building new delivery capacity was costing more than expected. The shares tanked but have since recovered. Meanwhile, a barrage of media reports on the collateral damage inflicted by Amazon—warehouse injuries, pedestrians killed by harried delivery drivers—aren’t letting up.Clark exudes confidence in an Amazon video posted on Twitter about his 21st year delivering Christmas cheer, even as his job grows and he’s asked to balance more pieces. Those warehouses where he became known as The Sniper he now smilingly calls “Santa’s workshops.”“It’s all about preparation,” he says, sitting in front of a stack of cardboard boxes emblazoned with the Amazon smile logo. “I think the teams are set up to deliver yet another wonderful holiday season.”To contact the author of this story: Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/man-built-amazon-delivery-machine-100051691.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-16	2019-12-16 21:31:36	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Cuts Off FedEx Ground for Prime Holiday Shipments	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. says third-party merchants can no longer use FedEx Corp.’s ground delivery network this holiday season because it’s too slow -- highlighting the e-commerce giant’s growing power over how products get to shoppers.Amazon sent a message to sellers Sunday night instructing them of the change, according to notifications reviewed by Bloomberg. Some Amazon sellers complained about receiving the change less than two weeks before Christmas when holiday spending is peaking. Their alternatives include United Parcel Service Inc.’s ground service.“It’s insane for them to do this on such short notice,” said Molson Hart, whose company Viahart sells toys on Amazon. “Unless we raise prices, we’re going to lose money on every order we are forced to route away from FedEx.”FedEx, in an emailed statement, said Amazon’s “decision affects a very small number of shippers, it limits the options for those small businesses on some of the highest demand shipping days in history and may compromise their ability to meet customer demands and manage their businesses.”Still, logistics expert John Haber said the company has struggled to deal with seasonal demand and has been handing off some of the load to the U.S. Postal Service.Couriers are under extra pressure because there are six fewer days this holiday shopping season, and package volume is forecast to grow.Amazon’s ban on third-party shippers using FedEx follows a dispute between the two companies, which failed to renew a delivery contract.“There’s a lot of bad blood between the two organizations,” said Haber, who runs Spend Management Experts, an Atlanta consulting firm. He said the feud will benefit UPS, which will have more bargaining power with Amazon.FedEx shares fell about 1% in New York. UPS was up slightly.More than half of all products sold on Amazon come from third-party merchants who pay Amazon commissions on each sale. Many of those merchants also pay Amazon for logistics services like warehousing and delivery, which puts Amazon in competition with FedEx. Merchants have complained to antitrust regulators that the company uses its e-commerce dominance to push them to use its logistics services.Some merchants say that using Amazon warehouses and trucks is faster and cheaper than doing the work themselves. But Amazon increases storage fees in its warehouses during peak holiday shopping months and some merchants prefer to oversee deliveries on their own to avoid these charges.Until now, sellers could use FedEx’s ground service during the season to meet Amazon’s pledge to deliver millions of products in one or two days. They can still use FedEx’s express service for Prime packages, but that’s a costly option.Amazon examines its delivery providers’ performance each year to determine order cut-off times for the holidays.The Wall Street Journal reported the FedEx ban earlier.To contact the reporters on this story: Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.net;Thomas Black in Dallas at tblack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Robin Ajello, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-cuts-off-fedex-ground-213136535.html?.tsrc=rss

The company also asked for a five-year exemption from a requirement that every training location be registered separately under the program's Training Provider Registry, claiming it would place a ""significant administrative burden"" on its in-house training if it were required to register as many as 1,800 UPS locations where a new driver could be trained."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fmcsa-rejects-ups-driver-training-174014256.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-06	2019-12-06 12:30:26	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	The Wrong Way to Fight Porch Pirates	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One consequence of America’s Cyber Monday shopping binge is the imminent arrival of $9.4 billion worth of merchandise on the nation’s doorsteps. And that will cue the annual cries of frustration about porch pirates — along with a raft of local news stories on how to evade them, and a few viral tales of consumers attempting to spook them with booby-trapped packages or glitter bombs.The fixation on thwarting porch pirates is understandable. (I, for one, will confess to being irrationally angry recently when a $27 baby onesie was swiped from my front stoop.) But it is also a flawed way of thinking about a legitimate and persistent problem with e-commerce.The problem is not just theft. It is that shipping giants such as United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp., as well as big retailers, are not moving fast enough to make delivery of online orders more flexible and to turn over more control to shoppers.Consumers and neighborhood associations should spend less time trying to answer the question, “How can we create a world where expensive goods can sit on my doorstep for hours and not get stolen?” Instead, they should be asking, “How can we make it so that expensive goods are not left on my doorstep in the first place?”UPS and FedEx, to be fair, have made strides toward giving customers more options. Each has a network of thousands of access points where shoppers can pick up packages, including at ubiquitous stores such as Dollar General or CVS Pharmacy. Both shippers have apps that allow residents to provide delivery instructions for a driver.Retailers, too, are getting more creative. Amazon.com Inc. now offers the option of choosing a single day each week for all of your recent orders to arrive, making it easier to ensure you’ll be home when your haul is delivered. And both Amazon and Walmart Inc. are piloting services that rely on smart-home technology that allows a driver one-time, secure access to your home.Surely such a service, or some variation of it, will become commonplace within a decade. (After all, there was once a time when it was creepy to get in a stranger’s car, but thanks to Uber and Lyft that’s now ordinary.) For now, though, the choices for consumers are underwhelming or confusing — or, in some cases, both.For example, UPS and FedEx both trumpet the convenience of letting you reroute an in-progress shipment to an access point. But online shoppers aren’t able to fully take advantage because retailers can put restrictions on packages preventing the recipient from redirecting them. This is likely a well-intentioned anti-fraud tactic, but it means access points aren’t the reliable solution they’re cracked up to be.And retailers aren’t always great at steering customers toward desirable secure options. Amazon, for example, routinely tries to nudge me at checkout to try a pickup point that is a 30-minute drive from my home, even though there is a Whole Foods Market with Amazon lockers in walking distance.But there are bigger ideas that could do even more to ensure package security. What if UPS or FedEx were to more routinely provide narrower time windows for drop-offs, or to allocate more workers for nighttime deliveries when nine-to-fivers are likely to be at home? What if retailers allowed customers to choose their shipping provider at checkout, which might force shippers to compete for their loyalty?Such changes would further complicate the “last-mile” delivery challenges the industry has been addressing for decades, and would likely add costs. But these are the same logistics experts and retailers that were able to make speedy two-day delivery standard.  It’s not unreasonable to expect them to innovate their way to giving shoppers more choice.Even if it’s difficult, improved delivery flexibility is a far better remedy for porch piracy than other headline-grabbing approaches. Police departments have experimented with planting bait packages on doorsteps that are outfitted with GPS trackers, potentially allowing them to catch individual thieves. Texas has a new law on the books that makes package theft punishable by up to 10 years in prison.Never mind that there are already laws against theft. These kinds of punitive measures are not useless, but they are likely to be helpful only in a limited area for a limited period of time.The more productive approach is to focus on reducing the unsecured supply of porch treasures. And no one is better equipped to attack that problem than the retailers and shippers. So shoppers should raise their expectations of these companies and demand that they do more.To contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Newman at mnewman43@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-12-02	2019-12-02 10:00:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Tests Cheap Warehouses to Make Cyber Monday Snafu-Free	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.  is gearing up for the online holiday shopping season—super-charged on Cyber Monday—by fine-tuning its sprawling delivery network to ensure orders get to customers on time. To that end, the company is testing a new inventory storage service to help meet holiday demand and its next-day shipping pledge without overcrowding its warehouses or running out of products.The new service, Amazon Storage and Replenishment, lets its merchants stage inventory close to Amazon’s delivery operation so products can be quickly replenished, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. Amazon is trying out the program in Ontario, California, about 20 miles from its closest facilities and has plans to expand the program to other locations around the country, according to the documents.Having spent billions of dollars building a sophisticated network of highly automated warehouses that use robots, conveyor belts and thousands of people to quickly pack and ship products, the company is now turning to a decidedly 20th-Century innovation: cheap warehouse space.Amazon has capacity challenges during the holidays, including Cyber Monday when U.S. shoppers are expected to spend a record $9.4 billion online. Amazon shares warehouse space with merchants that sell their products on its marketplace, and the company has already jacked up its storage fees during peak season to discourage those partners from cluttering facilities with too many products. But that presents the risk of merchants being overly cautious and Amazon losing sales when items run out. It can also frustrate Amazon’s merchant partners when they get stuck with a big bill to stow products that aren't selling. The new service seeks to solve both problems: declutter expensive facilities while having backup inventory close by.“Amazon is trying to figure out how to provide a logistics service merchants will pay for and not end up with warehouses full of items no one is buying,” says Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of New York e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse. “Many sellers are inexperienced in handling this and lose serious money on fees.”The service is the latest effort by Amazon to reach further up the supply chain to control the flow of goods from factories where products are made to customers' homes. By taking more control of logistics, Amazon feels it is less susceptible to the costly delivery snafus it faced in the U.S. in 2013 and two years later in the U.K.Amazon is becoming less of an online retailer and more of a platform and delivery pipeline for online commerce. More than half of all goods sold on the company’s site come from independent merchants who pay commissions on each sale. Amazon keeps examining every leg of the supply chain for ways to make buying something online as fast and affordable as a quick trip to the store.Amazon declined to comment.For Amazon, every holiday represents a race to find new capacity. U.S. shoppers will spend $135 billion online in November and December, representing 13.4% of all holiday sales, up from 12.3% a year ago, according to EMarketer. The shopping season is also shorter this year with six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas than last year.Amazon invited merchants who use Fulfillment By Amazon, its logistics service, to try the new storage and replenishment program this year. For now, the service prohibits shoes and apparel, perishables and hazardous materials.Most attention on Amazon's logistics ambitions to date have focused on the “last mile” delivery of packages to customers' homes. Amazon has historically used United Parcel Service, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx to make deliveries. But it has been expanding its capabilities by creating a network of independent service partners who start their own businesses and hire drivers dedicated to making Amazon deliveries. Amazon also has an Uber-type program called Flex that lets independent contractors make Amazon deliveries in their own vehicles.The new storage experiment shows Amazon trying to control the “middle mile,” a critical stage of logistics connecting factories and ports with stores and shoppers’ homes. As Amazon and other retailers seek to shorten delivery times, the middle mile has to be reconfigured with more inventory stored closer to shoppers. Two-day delivery to most of the U.S. population can be achieved with only four shipping hubs while next-day delivery to the same group requires about 16 hubs, according to logistics experts.Amazon’s push for next-day delivery is costing more than the company expected, tempering the expectations of investors who had become accustomed to Amazon delivering bigger profits. The cheap storage experiment is a way for Amazon to make the most of its existing facilities while it continues to invest in next-day delivery, said Michael Levine, analyst at Pivotal Research Group.“Amazon has not done a big fulfillment center buildout in 18 months,” he says. “This feels like another way to solve the same capacity problem.”The ultimate goal is a future where buying something online is as fast and affordable as a quick jaunt to the store—even during the holiday season rush.To contact the author of this story: Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-tests-cheap-warehouses-cyber-100000139.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-21	2019-11-21 05:58:37	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Trade War Threatens Tech Sectors in China and Silicon Valley	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. While the U.S-China trade war rages on, the tensions are exposing growing rifts between China and Silicon Valley.Leading venture capitalists and startup founders expressed concern over their governments’ fierce differences and the potential fallout. Among the dangers are a decline in cross-border investment, disruption in the supply chain and decreased collaboration in fields like artificial intelligence, wireless technology and cancer research.Signs of trouble are emerging in everything from venture capital to movie-making. Fundraising for dollar-based venture capital funds in China is down 75%, estimates Qiming Venture Partners’ founding partner Gary Rieschel. Olivia Hao, an executive at Beijing-based film production startup Baozou, said it is increasingly hard to make investments or buy other companies in the U.S.“Before, people were impressed when we said we had screenwriters from Hollywood,” said Hao on Wednesday on the sidelines of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Beijing. “Now people say, why aren’t you using more Chinese creators.”China and the U.S. are edging closer to a trade deal but the deteriorating situation in Hong Kong and the U.S. bill on the city’s special status threaten to stall negotiations.The fight to rule the technology sector is at the heart of China-U.S. tensions. Over the last few decades, the two countries have woven together a world-spanning supply chain that helped create innovation like Apple Inc.’s iPhone and propel industries like AI and robotics.American money has flowed into China, lending the capital essential in creating many of the countries’ top technology companies like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Chinese and American engineers have traversed both countries, driving innovation at startups and large companies alike. All of that is under the microscope now that the U.S. is clamping down on Chinese investment in the U.S. and scrutinizing the capital flows between the two countries.“Foreign capital remains the primary provider of early stage risk capital in China,” Rieschel said, adding that “82% of venture capital goes to the U.S. and China, these two countries have to work together in areas like AI.”Increasingly, American tech companies, venture capitalists and startups face a narrow choice on how to deal with China: Either take the country at face value and decide that as a rational business, profits matter more than any kind of moral high ground, or make a conscious decision to stop pursuing business in a country that will require you to adhere to its viewpoints inside -- and outside -- its borders.There are signs that Silicon Valley, which long avoided politics and courted a close relationship with China, is now starting to turn. U.S. venture capital companies and startups are refusing Chinese limited partners and investors. There are suspicions around Chinese startups in the fields of semiconductors, artificial intelligence and robotics who want to do business in the U.S., or try to attract funds from American venture capitalists.A number of Chinese startups also are souring on the view that Silicon Valley is the bastion of innovation.“Of course it will take years for China to catch up on deep tech like chips, but when it comes to areas like logistics and retail, China is moving much faster,” said Spencer Deng, founder of startup Dorabot, which is based in Shenzhen but has offices in Atlanta. “In the last three years, can you name one new innovation that came from Silicon Valley?” he said.Dorabot is working with companies like Walmart Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc. on automated technology.China is also taking steps to reduce its dependency in key areas of technology including in chips. “China’s semiconductor industry is catching up, they will be competitors in the global stage, and it provides a great place for us to invest,” said Neil Shen, managing and founding partner of Sequoia Capital China.The country’s ambition for its semiconductor industry grew in recent years as it spends more on importing chipsets than oil each year. Beijing has injected tens of billions of dollars into its young chip sector to build mega factories and attract top talent as the China attempts to reboot its economy with advanced manufacturing.Note: The New Economy Forum is being organized by Bloomberg Media Group, a division of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.&#92;--With assistance from Gao Yuan.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Shelly Banjo in Hong Kong at sbanjo@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Colum Murphy, James MaygerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trade-war-threatens-tech-sectors-055837519.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-14	2019-11-14 20:27:38	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	3 Industrial Stocks to Buy	This month, the industrial sector finally blasted through a resistance zone that was impenetrable for 18 months. With the ceiling finally felled, the entire space is now basking in record highs. And that makes some industrial stocks attractive buys now.Today we'll highlight three of the best.Breakouts to all-time highs like that seen in the Industrial Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLI) this month are bullish phenomenons for a variety of reasons. First, it signals buyers are willing to pay a richer price than ever before, highlighting their degree of conviction. Second, every single shortseller is losing money, which created a powerful urge to buy back their losing positions. Third, there isn't an existing shareholder on the planet that is losing money. No underwater longs are waiting to get back to breakeven so they can sell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 Throw it all together, and we have a backdrop for increasing demand and decreasing supply. I've scoured the sector and found these three industrial stocks to buy that stand out from the crowd. Industrial Stocks to Buy: Caterpillar (CAT)Source: ThinkorSwim If you agree that stock prices are the best forward-looking economic indicator there is. And, if you believe that Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) stock reflects how investors feel about global growth. Then, the mega breakout in CAT stock last month has to have you beating your bullish drums.The 18-month downtrend for Caterpillar finally ended, and the weekly chart is back into an uptrend for the first time since 2017. This week's market pause has allowed CAT to digest recent gains and begin a pullback pattern that is creating a lower-risk entry. While further weakness would be welcome, it's at a point where dipping your toe in the water could make sense.With implied volatility scraping the bottom of its one-year range, I like buying call spreads. You can purchase the Jan $145/$150 bull call for $2.30 and offers $2.70 of reward if CAT rises above $150 by expiration. UPS (UPS)Source: ThinkorSwim UPS (NYSE:UPS) tagged a 52-week high last week and has since formed a textbook bull retracement pattern. Volume patterns show many accumulation days over the past month and zero signs of distribution. Tack on the upcoming holiday shopping season and a broad market that continues to court record highs, and I see little reason why UPS stock won't keep trucking higher.Like Caterpillar, UPS options carry low implied volatility making long premium plays a cheaper bet than usual. Long calls aren't a bad way to go, but I prefer bull calls for additional leverage and higher probability. If you think UPS can run toward $130 by mid-January, then buy the Jan $125/$130 bull call spread for $1.50.  * 7 Inexpensive, High-Dividend ETFs to Buy The risk is limited to the initial $1.50 cost, and the reward is $3.50. Cummins (CMI)Source: ThinkorSwim The final pick of today's trio is Cummins (NYSE:CMI), which is also forming an interesting pullback pattern. Last month's rally carried CMI stock past weekly resistance and places it within striking distance of last year's record print of $194.18. Its price behavior has mirrored that of CAT, with a price rising above 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages.This week's retreat is bringing CMI closer to the 20-day average, which has been a gathering ground for dip buyers in the past. It could drop for another day or two, so wait for a break above a prior day's high before pulling the trigger.Implied volatility is running hotter for CMI than the previous two trade ideas, so I'm switching it up with a bull put idea. Sell the Dec $170/$165 bull put for around 75 cents. You will pocket the reward of 75 cents if the stock sits above $170 at expiration.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-08	2019-11-08 10:00:07	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Is Accused of Forcing Up Prices in Antitrust Complaint	(Bloomberg) -- In a letter sent to federal lawmakers, an online merchant has accused Amazon.com Inc. of forcing him and other sellers to use the company’s expensive logistics services, which in turn forces them to raise prices for consumers. The 62-page document, reviewed by Bloomberg, lays out an antitrust case that emphasizes harm to consumers—the traditional basis for such cases in the U.S.  Until now, antitrust experts have suggested that Amazon was not vulnerable to such an argument and that regulators would need to find another way to restrain the company’s growing market power. The complaint, based on an analysis of thousands of Amazon transactions over several years involving more than 100 products, turns all of that thinking on its head. It accuses Amazon of “tying” its marketplace and logistics services together, an antitrust violation in which a company uses dominance in one market to give itself an advantage in another market where it’s less established. The letter refers to previous Supreme Court rulings on tying, including one against Kodak in 1992 that said the photocopier manufacturer violated antitrust laws by forcing customers who bought its machines to also use its parts and repair services.“When it comes to Amazon’s dealings with third-party merchants, some of the conduct actually does lend itself to antitrust scrutiny,” said Hal Singer, an antitrust expert and Georgetown University adjunct professor retained by the merchant to work on the analysis. “If you can connect the conduct to some measureable harm, in this case increased prices, that gets you into the antitrust ballpark.”Amazon, in an emailed statement, disputed many of the merchants’ allegations, saying its logistics prices are competitive and its sellers aren’t penalized for using other delivery options. “Amazon has invested tens of billions of dollars in developing a world-class fulfillment network and we offer that network to sellers at highly competitive fees when compared to other options available to sellers. In fact, our research shows other comparable options available to sellers are approximately 50-80% more expensive”  than Amazon services, the company said.The accusations are potentially a significant development in various government inquiries into Amazon’s business practices. The House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel hosted a hearing in July during which chairman David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, grilled an Amazon attorney about its practices. As  part of that investigation, the committee sent surveys to customers of big tech platforms, asking about the state of competition in digital markets and the adequacy of existing enforcement.The merchant, who received that survey, says he can’t pursue an antitrust case himself because he agreed to binding arbitration when he began selling products on Amazon. But he hopes the Federal Trade Commission, which is already interviewing merchants, will investigate or that a logistics company will file suit, alleging it is losing business due to Amazon's practices. The merchant, who said he has paid Amazon tens of millions of dollars in fees in recent years, requested anonymity out of fear of losing business.A spokesman for the House Judiciary’s antitrust committee declined to comment.The merchant’s letter says Amazon raised logistics fees by 20% over the past four years until they cost as much as 35% more than competing services. The merchant claims Amazon pushed him to continue using its logistics or risk being suspended from selling on its platform or seeing his products marginalized on the site. He says using Amazon’s service forced him to boost prices by as much as 12% on more than 100 products he’s been selling on Amazon for years. The allegations directly challenge Amazon’s own testimony that search algorithms determining which products are most prominently displayed are designed to best serve customers, not favor Amazon. The merchant alleges he could offer the same products on Amazon at lower prices and with faster, more reliable delivery if he could handle logistics himself without being penalized for late deliveries. Merchants using Amazon’s logistics services  don’t face penalties for delivery mishaps, which is why many choose to use it even when better options are available, the letter states.Amazon operates an online marketplace, essentially a digital mall where merchants can sell products. Its website attracts 210 million unique visitors each month in the U.S., mostly shoppers looking for products, making it extremely valuable for anyone looking to sell things online. More than half of all goods sold on Amazon come from independent merchants who pay Amazon a commission on each sale. Amazon controls more than 70% of all online marketplace sales in the U.S., more than triple its closest online marketplace competitor EBay Inc., according to Digital Commerce 360.How regulators define Amazon’s market is a key step in any antitrust investigation. Amazon maintains it should be considered in the broadest possible terms, a retailer that attracts about 4 percent of spending in the U.S. The allegations propose narrowly defining Amazon as the dominant online marketplace with few competitors, which makes its merchant customers more susceptible to its demands.The letter alleges Amazon uses its marketplace to push its logistics services called Fulfillment by Amazon. Merchants ship their products to Amazon warehouses around the country and pay the online giant fees for storage, packing and delivery. Amazon has been expanding its logistics operations to handle everything from storing products to shipping them to customers’ homes. Its online store where U.S. shoppers will spend $221 billion this year, according to EMarketer Inc., gives it a big platform from which to build its logistics business. If Amazon can use its marketplace might to build up its logistics business, it wins an advantage over rival services offered by UPS, FedEx and smaller logistics providers.Amazon, in its emailed statement, said “Fulfillment by Amazon is a service that our sellers love—they tell us FBA saves them time, money and the hassle of packing and shipping boxes so they can instead focus on growing their business, creating new products, and even spending more time with their families. They tell us they choose FBA because it gives them peace of mind knowing that shipping logistics and customer service are taken care of 24/7, year-round.”The merchant’s complaint is by no means a sure thing. Tying services and products together alone isn’t illegal. For more than a century, disputes involving railroads, hospitals and big technology companies like Microsoft have asked the courts to determine when tying should be deemed anticompetitive, and it’s a subject frequently debated by legal scholars. The merchant’s complaint points to a 1984 Supreme Court ruling that laid out standards for illegal tying, later used in the Kodak case, which the merchant’s letter says pertains to Amazon.“The essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller’s exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did not want at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms,” the 1984 Supreme Court ruling states.The letter alleges that Amazon uses “carrots and sticks” to coerce merchants to buy its logistics services. Amazon’s control of the marketplace lets it determine which products are most visible on the site. Those using Fulfillment by Amazon are more likely to have their items appear prominently in search results to win sales. Merchants can sell products on Amazon and handle logistics themselves, but many opt to use Fulfillment by Amazon to increase their visibility on the site, a key factor in selling products.Amazon denied its search results favored items it delivers, but said products offered by merchants using its logistics services tend to be more prominent in results. It said that’s not because the search algorithm is biased toward Amazon, but because Amazon logistics “generally provides a better and more reliable experience for our customers than fulfillment through other means,” Amazon general counsel David Zapolsky said in a July letter to the House antitrust panel.The merchant’s letter disputes Amazon’s testimony. Of more than 120,000 Amazon orders handled by Fulfillment by Amazon from Aug. 25 to Oct. 25, fewer than 25% arrived within two days; more than half arrived in about three days and more than 15% arrived in four days, according to the merchant’s analysis. Despite the slow delivery times, Amazon’s logistics fees were 35% higher than other rapid shipping options offered by UPS and the U.S. Postal Service, according to the merchant.The sticks Amazon uses to coerce merchants to use its logistics services are strict penalties, including getting kicked off the platform, for merchants who handle their own logistics. Merchants using Amazon logistics services aren’t penalized when customer orders arrive late, even though they frequently do, since that’s Amazon’s responsibility. Those who handle their own logistics face stiff penalties for even minor delivery mishaps, including being suspended from selling on the platform, according to the merchant.Merchants decide to use Amazon’s logistics, even when more affordable options are available, because it protects them from being kicked off the platform when deliveries are late.“The most intimidating stick in Amazon’s arsenal is the ability to suspend or threaten to suspend sellers,” that don’t use Amazon logistics, the complaint states.&#92;--With assistance from Ben Brody.To contact the author of this story: Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-merchant-lays-antitrust-case-100007662.html?.tsrc=rss

FedEx will accept customer packaging for the program as long as the total shipment weighs less than 50 pounds and cubes out at 644 cubic inches, the person said.  It will likely be expanded across FedEx's customer base either later this year around the time rival UPS Inc.

2019-10-23	2019-10-23 12:59:18	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Caterpillar Shows Worry's Role in Recession	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Caterpillar Inc.’s results show how worry itself can bring on a recession. The industrial bellwether reported its first quarterly earnings decline in nearly three years on Wednesday and cut its full-year profit guidance. It had warned in July that earnings per share were likely to come in at the low end of its previous range, but that was based on an expectation for modest sales growth that seemed overly optimistic. Instead, third-quarter revenue declined in all of Caterpillar’s major business units, including the mining-equipment division that had been a rare bright spot this year amid weakness in its construction machinery operations. The slowdown in shale production as producers prioritize shareholder returns and cost control continued to weigh on sales of fracking pumps. But more than a reflection on any one of those particular markets, this was a macroeconomic story, and a poor one at that. Caterpillar blamed its slumping sales and earnings on customers holding off on equipment purchases. With the trade war, Brexit and increased signs of manufacturing malaise, no one wants to get stuck with a glut of expensive machinery that they can’t sell. So inventories shrank by about $400 million in the third quarter as dealers sold off stockpiles of equipment, rather than replenishing them. Industrial companies ranging from CSX Corp. to United Parcel Service Inc. have offered similar warnings about the extent to which uncertainty is weighing on their businesses, even as parts of the economy remain relatively healthy. This adds to evidence that a trade war resolution may still be able to pull the manufacturing sector back from the brink. Achieving that is, of course, easier said than done.  For now, you’d be hard-pressed to find much news worth celebrating in Caterpillar’s release. The order backlog continued to shrink. Sales for the construction business in Asia declined a whopping 29%, suggesting the competitive pricing that’s eroding Caterpillar’s market share in the area hasn’t abated. At least in the short term, Caterpillar isn’t counting on a turnaround: It expects dealers to continue to wind down their inventory in the fourth quarter amid “global economic uncertainty” and flat demand from the end users of its equipment. In its news release, Caterpillar raised the prospect of curbing production and reducing costs if the weakness persists, which likely indicates job cuts. Such cutbacks, while necessary to respond to declining demand, may only lead to more economic weakness. As has been common this industrial earnings season, investors seemed content to take their hits and keep on chugging along, hoping the worst will soon be behind them. After dipping as much as 7.7% on the 6:30 a.m. earnings release, Caterpillar was actually up slightly by 8 a.m. But such broad-based weakness at Caterpillar should be a reminder that all is not well in the global economy.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

However, we're trying to look beyond the quarterly results and focus on other stocks that are also making waves. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Lyft (LYFT)Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) stock caught a lift on Tuesday after reports began circulating that management is looking for EBITDA profits to surface about a year before analysts currently expect.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe move sent shares higher by 8% at one point, as Lyft stock ran right into its 50-day moving average.On the plus side, the stock is out of that nasty little downtrend. The bad news? The charts still look pretty gnarly.A move above the 50-day could spring Lyft to the $48 area. Not only has this mark played a significant role as both support and resistance, but it also marks the 78.6% retracement. On the downside, see that recent support at $40 holds. Falling below that level puts the October low back on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Shopify (SHOP)We have been cautious on high-growth stocks lately. With Tuesday's continued selloff in the group, that caution has been reinforced.Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) is a great company, but it has a high valuation and hasn't come down as hard as many of its peers. But the technical damage is starting to show. Shares failed to reclaim the 78.6% retracement and 50-day moving average earlier this month.After the rejection, shares ultimately lost the 100-day moving average and channel support (blue line). If it loses the 61.8% retracement, the $286 lows from September are most definitely on the table.Below those lows and we may finally get a test of the 200-day moving average. That also comes into play just above the 50% retracement. Unlike some of its peers, SHOP stock has not hit the down-40% mark. To do so, Shopify would need to hit around $246. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Procter & Gamble (PG)Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) neared its all-time highs on Tuesday, after a top- and bottom-line earnings beat. However, investors are hesitating to bid the stock higher. What gives?Over the 50-day moving average is constructive, as is the stock being over $122.50. Investors may rather wait for a move its prior highs though, which could trigger a rally toward $130. On the downside, consider buying dips into the 100-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line).Below the former and PG will need more time to set up on the long side. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Lockheed Martin (LMT)Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is an interesting one too. After a beat-and-raise quarter, LMT is actually lower on the day. Hmm…If the stock can hold over $371, tempted bulls can hang with LMT. However, a move below Tuesday's low (and thus the notable $370 level and the 78.6% retracement at $365.79) would make the stock a no-touch for the time being.Over $371 and the 100-day moving average, makes a move to the 50-day possible. Above that and $390-plus is possible. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: United Parcel Service (UPS)United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) turned in a mixed quarter, beating on earnings by a penny but missing on revenue expectations. However, management backed its full-year guidance.As such, shares were able to erase a bulk of its early losses Tuesday.The chart for this one is pretty sloppy. I'm not a big head-and-shoulder guy, but this one has all the makings of one. A close below $112 -- which fittingly comes into play near Tuesday's low and the 100-day moving average -- would be a bearish sign for the stock. It puts the $104 to $110 area on the table.Over $116 and the 78.6% retracement, could spark a move to the 50-day moving average up near $117.50. Above that and $120 is on the table.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long cheesy Lyft puns.

2019-10-22	2019-10-22 14:43:45	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	For UPS, Being Better Than FedEx Isn’t Enough	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- United Parcel Service Inc. is offering everything to investors that FedEx Corp. isn’t, and that’s still seemingly not enough.The package-delivery company on Tuesday reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and maintained its full-year profit outlook. That’s a sharp contrast to FedEx’s bruising guidance cut just over a month ago, which the company blamed on a weakening global economy, and analysts blamed on idiosyncratic foot faults. UPS is trimming its capital expenditure budget by $500 million this year and next year, which will help boost its 2019 free cash flow to more than $4 billion. FedEx, meanwhile, is on track to burn cash in fiscal 2020 and Moody’s Investors Service Inc. recently lowered its outlook for the company’s credit rating. Management’s decision to nevertheless leave its $5.9 billion spending budget intact has left investors scratching their heads — particularly because the billions it has spent so far don’t appear to be yielding results.UPS on Tuesday reported another quarterly improvement in its adjusted operating margin, a sign that its own push to invest in newer planes and automated systems is paying off as it manages a deluge of less profitable e-commerce shipments. And yet, the stock fell more than 4% in early trading. The problem is, as much as UPS is widening the execution gap between itself and FedEx, it can’t escape the weakening macroeconomic backdrop.Revenue in the third quarter was marginally weaker than analysts had been expecting, and UPS warned that its profit guidance was contingent on “no further deterioration” in global trade uncertainty or U.S. industrial weakness. No one really knows what’s going to happen with trade relations. President Donald Trump signaled this week that negotiations over a partial deal with China are progressing and could lead to a signed agreement by November, but there’s little indication that the existing tariffs will be rolled back. I, for one, wouldn’t be willing to bet against a further slowdown in manufacturing, given declining shipment volumes at the railroads in the third quarter and decelerating sales growth at the likes of industrial distributor Fastenal Co.Drilling down into UPS’s results, there’s a variety of other nitpick items that take on more importance in a weaker economy. For example, while unit costs improved by 2.5% on an adjusted basis in the U.S. domestic division, the average amount of revenue UPS collected per package in that business declined by about 1%. The third quarter brought a surge in volumes, with FedEx’s decision to stop carrying packages for Amazon.com Inc. in the U.S. likely driving more of the e-commerce giant’s packages to UPS. A weakening yield will raise questions about how profitable that business can ultimately be for UPS, and whether it made the right decision by sticking with a customer that’s also increasingly a competitor.Adding to the jitters, UPS also announced on Tuesday that Jim Barber, chief operating officer and the heir apparent to CEO David Abney, was stepping down. Barber’s departure is a surprise, and it’s always going to raise eyebrows when a leadership change is announced without the simultaneous appointment of a successor. That being said, Abney has made an effort to shake up UPS’s staid culture by bringing in more executives from the outside. Earlier this year, UPS hired a PepsiCo Inc. executive, Brian Newman, to be its chief financial officer. Abney hired his chief transformation officer from Walmart Inc., his chief marketing officer from Xerox Corp. and his supply-chain solutions leader from logistics company DB Schenker. So the departure of Barber, a nearly 35-year veteran, would seem to be setting up an appointment in a similar vein. Grooming an outsider to succeed Abney would further differentiate UPS from FedEx, which is still run by founder Fred Smith and whose top executives have all been there for decades and act like it.UPS is moving in the right direction, even if the economy isn’t.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-10-22	2019-10-22 13:47:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Stamps.com Soars as UPS Deal a ‘Step in the Right Direction’	(Bloomberg) -- Stamps.com Inc. shares rallied Tuesday after United Parcel Service Inc. announced a pact to offer discounted shipping rates to the company’s customer base of more than 740,000.“We long mentioned a new partnership was needed to help lift shares and believe the UPS collaboration is a step in the right direction,” wrote Darren Aftahi, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners.Rates are expected to be as much as 55% below daily rates, including surcharge waivers, he said. The deal should aid Stamps.com volume and margins and add upside to fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 forecasts, Aftahi said, even as the rates are still unlikely to be below legacy United States Postal Service rates.The UPS collaboration marks the first partner Stamps.com has signed since ending its relationship with the USPS in February -- a move that sent the stock tumbling 58%. Less than three months later, Stamps.com cut its year forecasts, sinking the shares another 56%.Shares of Stamps.com rose as much as 24% to $94.49, the highest intraday level since March 6, paring their year-to-date decline to 41%.The pact could be the catalyst necessary to reverse the trend in shares year to date, Aftahi said. He boosted his price target to $85 from $52. His rating remains neutral.(Updates first and fifth graph, and the chart.)To contact the reporter on this story: Janet Freund in New York at jfreund11@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Will Daley, Steven FrommFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stamps-com-soars-ups-deal-113902763.html?.tsrc=rss

The curriculum in the one-week course teaches drivers through “experiential learning” that emphasizes hands-on, “real life” scenarios, now enhanced by virtual reality simulations. Prior to UPS Integrad training, the majority of initial driver training was classroom- and lecture-based. Now, drivers practice delivery methods in a realistic setting on an outside course designed to mimic a small town called “Clarkville USA.” Arrayed with small houses, street signs and even a dog bowl to alert drivers of the presence of a dog, Clarkville provides realism in a controlled environment.In addition to the hands-on training that is key to Integrad curriculum, UPS has added virtual reality driving simulations. The use of virtual reality technology allows students to drive without leaving the building. The intent of the simulations is to help students identify potential hazards by visualizing other vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs and signals, the basis of what a driver needs to drive defensively.A significant portion of UPS Integrad training is focused on safe driving, and is designed to enhance the company’s already strong road safety accomplishments. UPS currently employs more than 10,000 “Circle of Honor” drivers who have driven 25 years or more without an accident.  “The sophisticated UPS Integrad training and our focus on adaptive learning styles will guarantee a new generation of Circle of Honor drivers,” said UPS Integrad Expansion Director Tristan Christensen. To date, more than 7,500 drivers and over 1,500 driver supervisors have completed UPS Integrad training. In 2018, UPSers participated in more than 6 million hours of health and safety training. The company spends more than $230 million annually on all driver training and training resources.The Columbus site joins existing  facilities in Lake Mary, Florida, West Boylston, MA,  Atlanta, McKinney, Texas and Menlo Park, Calif. suburban Chicago, Phoenix, Portland, Ore., and Landover, Md. UPS also has locations in Cologne, Germany and Burton upon Trent, United Kingdom.  About UPS     UPS (NYSE: UPS) is a global leader in logistics, offering a broad range of solutions including transporting packages and freight; facilitating international trade, and deploying advanced technology to more efficiently manage the world of business.

2019-09-20	2019-09-20 09:00:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon’s Emissions Bigger Than Some Rivals, Trail Walmart	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. contributed more greenhouse gas emissions last year than some big competitors in retail, logistics and technology, but less than rival Walmart Inc. and the world’s biggest energy companies, highlighting the growing scale and diverse businesses of the conglomerate.The disclosure by Amazon of its 2018 carbon emissions, 44.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, including purchased electricity and indirect emissions, came Thursday when the company committed to powering all of its business operations by renewable energy sources by 2030, and achieving carbon neutrality a decade later.Amazon’s emissions exceed the reported totals of United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. as well as Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Target Corp. in data compiled by CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project. Amazon’s total is 38% less than rival Walmart, the group said.“It’s a big number,” said Bruno Sarda, president of CDP North America, adding that Amazon’s emissions compare to a large power company. “They probably wouldn’t make the top 50, but when you look at what’s up there, it’s mostly all the large fossil fuel companies.”An Amazon spokesman said the company’s disclosures, which accounted for emissions generated by customer trips to retail stores such as Whole Foods, captured a fuller picture than those of some competitors.Amazon for years has frustrated climate advocates by refusing to participate in increasingly common corporate social responsibility and environmental disclosures. But employees and shareholders have been pressuring the company to change. A shareholder proposal in May requesting an Amazon climate policy failed -- but drew 30% of votes cast.“We’ve been requesting this information from them for 15 straight years,” Sarda said. “They’re just not big fans of transparency, or using frameworks that others have developed to measure their performance.”Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos acknowledged that Amazon had work to do. “We’ve been in the middle of the herd on this issue and we want to move to the forefront,” Bezos said at a news conference in Washington where he encouraged other companies to set similar goals. “We want to be leaders.”Some corporate governance and environmental groups praised the Seattle-based company for the steps they announced on Thursday.“It’s very important when a company like Amazon or Walmart take major steps to be proactive on climate,” said Tim Smith, a director at Walden Asset Management and a longtime advocate of corporate action on issues of social responsibility. “I hope they’re getting the message that they received in the votes in the shareholders meeting, and from their customers, that they expect much of them.”Amazon’s carbon footprint reflects the company’s move from a humble online retailer into a plethora of energy-intensive businesses, including running massive cloud-computing server farms, and, increasingly, hauling its own packages by plane and truck and delivering them to customers’ doorsteps. The figures the company disclosed include emissions produced by Amazon’s own operations, the electricity that powers its facilities and more indirect sources like the cost of producing Amazon’s packaging and electronic devices, among other things.The company’s turn toward transparency on climate issues wasn’t the first time a major technology company decided to go out and grab the mantle of leadership on climate change. Apple has released an environmental impact report with increasing levels of detail for the past decade and stepped into the spotlight during in 2013 when it hired Lisa Jackson, a former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator, as vice president for environment, policy and social initiatives.Apple started submitting investor disclosure information to the U.K. nonprofit CDP in 2014, the same year that CEO Tim Cook publicly snapped at a critic that if he didn’t like the company’s environmental policies he should “get out of this stock.”To contact the reporters on this story: Matt Day in Seattle at mday63@bloomberg.net;Eric Roston in New York at eroston@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-emissions-bigger-rivals-trail-090000198.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-09-19	2019-09-19 19:47:24	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Aspirin-by-Drone Closer in Alphabet-Walgreens Delivery Test	(Bloomberg) -- One of the nation’s largest drug store chains and a shipping service giant are joining forces, with Alphabet Inc.’s Wing to begin a first-of-its-kind drone delivery service in October.Walgreens, FedEx Corp. and Wing, an offshoot of Google that was the first U.S. drone operator to receive partial certification as an airline, will begin the exploratory deliveries in the small town of Christiansburg, Virginia, the companies said in an announcement Thursday.The companies aim to go beyond the small-scale delivery demonstrations that have occurred so far in the U.S., typically under controlled environments conducted over short ranges, they said.“Wing has spent the last seven years developing a delivery drone and navigation system for this purpose,” Chief Executive Officer James Ryan Burgess said in the release. “By delivering small packages directly to homes through the air in minutes, and making a wide range of medicine, food and other products available to customers, we will demonstrate what we expect safer, faster, cleaner local delivery to look like in the future.”Read more: Amazon Poised to Test Chopper-Plane Mashup for Drone DeliveriesThe announcement is a sign of the rapid maturation of the drone industry, as multiple titans of industry race to find their place in what could become a transforming technology. At the same time, the U.S. government hasn’t created a regulatory structure or formal safety standards for small, low-flying drone operations, so such demonstrations continue to be conducted using waivers to existing rules.Wing has conducted demonstrations of how its deliveries would work before, including lowering a Popsicle to a toddler in Virginia last year. But the project with Walgreens and FedEx is designed to send actual merchandise to customers on a far bigger scale.The demonstration project is being conducted near the campus of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg and is associated with the Mid-Atlantic Partnership, one of the groups selected by the U.S. government as testing entities for drone commerce. While there is growing demand for using drones to deliver goods and to perform many industrial functions, the Federal Aviation Administration is still in the process of developing regulations to govern them.Robotic RaceWing is one of the leading companies in the race toward having robotic unmanned craft zip through the sky to people’s homes to drop off goods, and has received waivers to allow longer-range flights.Amazon.com Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc. are also developing their delivery services. A number of smaller companies, including Flirtey Inc. and Zipline International Inc., are either doing demonstration projects or have made deliveries in other countries.The partnership between Wing, Walgreens and FedEx has benefits for all three in the race to exploit the drone economy.Walgreens, a division of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., and other large drugstore chains have seen their sales chipped away at by Amazon and other online retailers, as the convenience of a brick-and-mortar pharmacy a short drive away has been supplanted by a package delivered to a customer’s front door. Amazon has also moved into the prescription drug business, offering patients conveniently-packaged pills through its PillPack unit.Drugstores Fight BackIn response, the drugstore chains have begun offering competing services to defend themselves. Walgreens offers a delivery service for prescriptions, and has partnered with FedEx to use its stores as package drop-off points. It’s also partnered with Kroger Co. on a pilot program for customers to pick up groceries at Walgreens stores.The partnership with Wing gives FedEx leverage to compete against UPS, which is using the small flying devices for revenue-generating health-care deliveries, such as blood samples, within a hospital campus in North Carolina.UPS is also seeking FAA authorization to operate like a small airline and expects to get that designation soon. UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney has said the focus of drone deliveries would be the health-care industry at first, and then expand from there.(Updates with other companies in ninth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Drew Armstrong.To contact the reporters on this story: Alan Levin in Washington at alevin24@bloomberg.net;Thomas Black in Dallas at tblack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Elizabeth Wasserman, Ros KrasnyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-wing-plans-drone-drug-170000378.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-18	2019-09-18 20:22:29	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEx Plunges Most Since 2008 as Outlook Cut Spurs Analyst Scorn	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. FedEx Corp. Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith blamed the company’s disappointing outlook on a weakening global economy dragged down by President Trump’s trade war. Wall Street isn’t buying it.At least five analysts downgraded the shares, taking Smith to task for what Deutsche Bank AG called a series of “missteps’’ in recent years. The shares plunged Wednesday by the most in a decade.FedEx hasn’t moved fast enough to reduce capital expenditures and cut capacity at the air-shipping business, critics said. A $4.8 billion acquisition in Europe has turned into a money pit. And the courier is incurring extra costs to boost efficiency to handle the surge in e-commerce deliveries -- all while cutting longstanding ties with Amazon.com Inc.“While some may view this as the bottom in shares, we don’t see any support until management takes responsibility for recent performance and clearly articulates a credible path to better results,” said Deutsche Bank’s Amit Mehrotra, who downgraded the stock. “In the meantime, share will continue to melt lower, and rightfully so,” he wrote in a report titled “Lost confidence in FDX.”The shares tumbled 13% to $150.91 at the close in New York, the biggest drop since December 2008. United Parcel Service Inc. fell 1.1% while Deutsche Post AG slipped 1.2%.FedEx’s slide wiped out its year-to-date gain. Even before the drop, the shares were already lagging UPS and a Standard & Poor index of U.S. industrial companies.Deutsche Post responded to FedEx’s warning by saying that it hasn’t seen changes in volume trends since its most recent comments in August. UPS said it hasn’t detected a broad-based slump.“UPS has seen softening in some markets as customers react to trade uncertainty, but has not experienced broad dampening,” the Atlanta-based courier said in a statement. “The company continues to manage costs and adapt its network to take advantage of growth opportunities as sourcing patterns shift among markets.”FedEx surprised investors by slashing its profit outlook for the fiscal year ending in May to as low as $11 a share, 25% lower than analysts’ expectations. Smith and his lieutenants also drew fire for a combative conference call late Tuesday.While Smith asserted that “FedEx will unquestionably be the low-cost producer” for domestic air deliveries, the company said the new outlook didn’t count on any additional weakening in the global economy. In other words, there could be more downside.‘Lost Their Way’“They were saying, ‘Yes, it’s tough out there and challenging. These are the actions we’re going to take. Trust us,’ ” said Kevin Sterling, an analyst with Seaport Global Holdings. “They’ve kind of lost their way here for it seems like a year or so. People are becoming more skeptical.”FedEx cited global economic weakness “driven by increasing trade tensions and policy uncertainty,” and the company is hardly alone in feeling anxiety. The Business Roundtable’s CEO Economic Outlook Index fell in the third quarter to the lowest since late 2016, the group said Wednesday.More than half of CEOs said U.S. trade policy and retaliation from other countries had a negative effect on sales over the past year, while a third said it was having a similar impact on hiring.But FedEx took criticism from analysts for sticking with a capital-spending budget of $5.9 billion, including $350 million to finish the work to combine FedEx’s network in Europe with TNT Express, a Dutch-based company it bought in 2016.‘Execution Challenges’Whether those efforts turn into higher profit remains to be seen, said Todd Fowler, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets, who also downgraded the shares.“We anticipate a ‘wait-and-see’ approach with respect to expected margin and earnings improvement given recent execution challenges,” Fowler said in a note to clients.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:“FedEx is facing a number of near-term headwinds on top of the pressures from slowing economic growth.“While fiscal 2020 will be a transition year for the company, we still believe longer-term prospects should turn positive once benefits from TNT and investments in technology and equipment are realized.”&#92;- Analysts Lee Klaskow and Adam Roszkowski&#92;- Click here for the researchTNT is turning into a particular sore spot. An economic slowdown in Europe is hampering FedEx’s effort to turn around operations after what is already a slow, costly integration. Running both the TNT and FedEx networks drives up costs, Sterling said.“This global macro weakness couldn’t hit them at a worse time. They’re kind of getting exposed,” Sterling said. “The international weakness hit them faster than they realized. It was just three months ago that they lowered guidance and now again they’re coming back to do it. The ultimate question is when is the bottom.”&#92;--With assistance from Richard Weiss, Bailey Lipschultz and Tony Robinson.To contact the reporters on this story: Thomas Black in Dallas at tblack@bloomberg.net;Sam Unsted in London at sunsted@bloomberg.net;Chiara Remondini in Milan at cremondini@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Case at bcase4@bloomberg.net, ;Beth Mellor at bmellor@bloomberg.net, Richard CloughFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-shakes-wall-street-faith-133941982.html?.tsrc=rss

The world's biggest parcel delivery firm is among the first to announce its holiday hiring target, which landed on the heels of a Labor Department report showing continued malaise in retail employment, even as wage growth buoys consumer spending.

2019-09-06	2019-09-06 17:44:22	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy: MSFT, UPS and PANW	Riding the next big thing to catch Wall Street's fancy can be tough. But artificial intelligence is one area of undeniable potential. And in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS)  and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) investors are being offered a more intelligent approach to cash in on the artificial intelligence stocks trend. Let me explain.Will cryptocurrencies led by Bitcoin ever really be a thing? And what is the potential for an industry like cannabis? Just as important, how will investing today in a market leader like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) look like a year from now or even five or ten years out? Nobody, and I mean nobody knows. But artificial intelligence is very different.Artificial intelligence or AI is already seamlessly changing the way we see things, work and go about our lives. That last movie on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) which was recommended by Netflix and which you simply loved? AI played a hand. At a business level, AI's machine learning is widely-used to scour through massive troves of data enabling algorithms to recognize otherwise indiscernible patterns and calculate stronger decisions and predictions. As I said, artificial intelligence is everywhere these days.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut what about investing in artificial intelligence stocks? There are no real pure plays, of notice anyways, on this growing technology despite an estimated 44% jump in spending on AI systems to nearly $36 billion this year. But profiting smartly from this boom is still very much possible.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market In the following let's look at large cap outfits Microsoft, UPS and Palo Alto Networks. These three well-entrenched market leaders offer a diversified approach to investing in artificial intelligence stocks--and right now are presenting today's investors' buyable price charts for the long haul. Microsoft (MSFT)Microsoft is the first of our three AI stocks to buy. Along with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), no conversation regarding artificial intelligence stocks would be complete without mentioning MSFT stock. These diversified tech giants have continued to grow on the back of AI. In Microsoft's case the company is pushing the technology into its cloud computing business and consumer offerings.Technically and unlike GOOGL or AMZN shares, MSFT stock is also unequivocally demonstrating bullish strength on the price chart. Microsoft has put together a sturdy basing pattern of around three months which has successfully tested existing uptrend and lateral price support. The price action has MSFT stock in a position of leadership within the broader market and coupled with a supportive-looking bullish stochastics crossover, makes this an artificial intelligence stock to buy on a breakout. UPS (UPS)United Parcel Service is the next of our AI stocks to purchase. UPS stock may not be the first name you think of when it comes to investing in artificial intelligence stocks. Yet using AI to drive efficiencies is huge for UPS and increasingly important in gaining a market edge throughout its business.Technically, UPS is also an artificial intelligence stock that's ready to deliver big-time profits to investors.  * 7 Triple Threat Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Term After recently clearing downtrend and Fibonacci resistance and testing the former barriers for support, shares have broken out of a five-week long consolidation. The price action has put UPS stock into the upper right-hand side of its 20-month long, irregular cup-shaped base and in position for purchase today. Palo Alto Networks (PANW)Cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks is the last of our artificial intelligence stocks to buy. Among other ways to exploit AI, this market leader uses the technology to locate and block malicious behavior on computer networks than would otherwise be possible.Most recently, Palo Alto acquired IoT security start-up Zingbox. The purchase will help improve Cortex, the company's AI-based security platform, by introducing its cloud-based service, advanced AI and machine learning technology into its offerings.And on the PANW price chart, this artificial intelligence stock is looking set for long-term success.Technically, shares of Palo Alto Networks have just finished three months of testing former pattern resistance for support. Now and with September off to a good start following an all-time-high in early 2019, a supportive stochastics crossover and plenty of volatile toiling to free itself from a three-year long corrective base breakout, it's time to buy PANW stock today.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 10:33:23	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Trump's Opioid Deal Has Been a Big Success	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Of all people, you wouldn’t expect President Donald Trump to be shy about taking credit for his achievements. When it comes to China’s role in America’s opioid crisis, though, he’s been uncharacteristically modest. Mail carriers including FedEx Corp., Amazon.com Inc., United Parcel Service Inc., and the U.S. Postal Service were ordered to search for and refuse deliveries of the synthetic opioid fentanyl from China in a tweet-storm last week. “President Xi said this would stop – it didn’t,” Trump wrote, echoing a theme from earlier this month:That’s not the case, the head of China’s narcotics regulator Liu Yuejin told Bloomberg News. Since the country listed all fentanyl-style drugs as controlled substances April 1, in accordance with a December agreement between Trump and President Xi Jinping, there’s been no evidence of new underground fentanyl production and no legitimately produced drugs have ended up in illicit channels, Liu said.One could be tempted to doubt his assertion, after the Chinese government failed to halt such exports since a crackdown brokered under the Obama administration in 2015. But if President Trump listened to his own officials, he’d hear a similar story.“The numbers have dropped precipitously this year, so we’re talking about only pounds of fentanyl that we have encountered so far this year” coming by post from China, Thomas Overacker, an official at Customs and Border Protection, told a Congressional hearing last month. That compares with close to 2,000 pounds of fentanyl cut with other ingredients coming over the U.S. border with Mexico, he said. Traditionally, much of the fentanyl coming from Mexico has been manufactured there using precursor chemicals imported from China – but that, too, appears to be changing.The newest challenge for drug enforcement appears to be Mexican drug cartels moving into the void left as China’s crackdown efforts have halted shipments, Matthew Donahue, a regional director with the Drug Enforcement Administration told the hearing. The administration “is continuing to see a shift from importation of precursor chemicals for the production of fentanyl and fentanyl-like substances to the manufacturing of precursor chemicals within Mexico itself,” he said. “This is an alarming development.”That's echoed by the U.S. Postal Service, too. Some 153 of 185 seizures of synthetic opioids this fiscal year were mailed from domestic post-boxes, rather than sent from foreign countries such as China, Gary Barksdale, chief inspector of the USPS, said in testimony.Why should Trump’s deal with China be succeeding where previous efforts have failed? As we’ve written, the problem in the past has been that China designated individual chemicals as controlled substances. That meant that as soon as a new formula was registered, Chinese drug labs came up with another one to skirt the regulations, leaving officials there and in the U.S. caught in a game of Whac-A-Mole. The December deal, on the other hand, scheduled the entire class of fentanyl-type substances, ensuring a much more comprehensive ban.It’s certainly too soon to roll out the “mission accomplished” banner. As my colleague Shuli Ren has written, China was almost entirely ignorant of its role in America’s opioid-addiction crisis until the Trump-Xi deal was announced last year. Previous breakthroughs have turned into squibs, too: More than half of U.S. deaths from synthetic opioids have occurred since China’s initial crackdown in 2015. In addition, the migration crisis on the southern U.S. border has diverted funding and personnel, and complicated the role of drug enforcement. So it’s possible that even with a diminished Chinese role, America’s opioid crisis persists, with the entire supply chain controlled by Mexican cartels.Still, the early indications of success in reducing shipments across the Pacific count as a significant policy win for the Trump administration. That should be receiving more attention, especially at a time when a proposed $11.5 billion settlement from the Sackler family and its drugmaker Purdue Pharma LP is promising a way to help cover the fallout from addiction to the company’s opioid OxyContin.It could be that 2019 is the year when the U.S. finally started to turn the tide in the opium war ravaging the Trump-voting heartlands of the Midwest and Appalachia. What’s more, the success may be coming as a result of that most improbable activity, cooperation between the U.S. and Chinese governments.That may not fit President Trump’s narrative of an ever-escalating great power contest with Beijing, but it should still count as an unlikely victory for his diplomacy. He should try boasting about it.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-08-27	2019-08-27 18:58:43	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	9 Hot Stocks to Buy Now	[Editor's note: &quot;9 Hot Stocks to Buy Now&quot; was previously published in May 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]It's a different market than it was at the beginning of 2018.It's a choppier, more cautious, environment. That's not a bad thing, however. After a basically uninterrupted post-election rally, several stocks have seen pullbacks that provide more attractive entry points. Others simply haven't received their due credit from the market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile there might be reasons for caution overall -- inverted yield curve, trade war concerns -- more opportunities exist as well.This more and more looks like a &quot;stockpicker's market.&quot; For those stockpickers, here are nine stocks to buy that look particularly attractive. * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow Hot Stocks to Buy Now: Exxon Mobil (XOM)Past year performance: -15.5%Source: Shutterstock I'm as surprised as anyone that Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) makes this list. I've long been skeptical toward XOM. The internal hedge between upstream and downstream operations makes Exxon stock a surprisingly poor play on higher oil prices, as we've seen in recent weeks. Overall, it leads XOM to stay relatively rangebound, as it has been for basically a decade now.With the dividend yield well over 5% and a 14.4 times forward price-earnings (P/E) multiple, Exxon Mobil stock looks like a value play. Meanwhile, management is forecasting that the company's earnings can double by 2025, adding a modest growth component to the story.Obviously, there's a risk that Exxon management is being too optimistic. Years of underperformance relative to peers like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and even BP (NYSE:BP) has eroded the market's confidence. If Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) can lead a true electric car revolution, that, too, could impact demand and pricing going forward. Nathan's Famous (NATH)Past year performance: -25.5 %In this market, recommending a restaurant owner, let alone a hot dog restaurant owner, might seem silly at best. But there's a strong bull case for Nathan's Famous, Inc. (NASDAQ:NATH).Source: FlickrNATH, too, has seen a steady decline since late 2018. The stock touched a 52-week (and all-time) high just over $100 in July 2018. It's since come down about 50%, yet the story hasn't really changed all that much.Revenues grew by just about 8% in fiscal 2018. The company's agreement with John Morrell, who manufactures Nathan's product for retail sale and Sam's Club operations, offers huge margins, while its bottom line continues to grow. Food service sales similarly are increasing. * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow The restaurant business has been choppier, but it remains profitable. The &quot;mostly franchised&quot; model there is similar to those of Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), among others, all of whom are getting well above-market multiples.All told, Nathan's has an attractive licensing model, which leverages revenue growth across the operating businesses. And yet, at 13x EV/EBITDA, the stock trades at a significant discount to peers. Bank of America (BAC)Past year performance: -14.4%Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) trades just several dollars off its highest levels since the financial crisis and has gained over 100% from July 2016 lows. Trading has been a bit choppier of late, and there's a case, perhaps, to wait for a better entry point.Source: Shutterstock But I've liked BAC stock for some time now, and, as I wrote previously, I don't see any reason to back off yet. Earnings growth should be solid for the foreseeable future, given rising interest rates and a strong economy.BofA itself has executed nicely over the past few years. The company's credit profile is solid and its stock has outperformed other big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM).And despite the big run, it's not as if BAC is expensive. The stock still trades at less than ten times 2019 EPS estimates. Unless the economy turns south quickly, that seems too cheap. So it looks like the big run in Bank of America stock isn't over yet. Roku (ROKU)Past year performance: 127%Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) undoubtedly is the riskiest stock on this list, and there certainly is a case for caution. The company remains unprofitable on even an Adjusted EBITDA basis. A 17x EV/revenue multiple isn't cheap.Source: Shutterstock But with more than 28 million active users, Roku is a fast-growing platform deserving of its high-ish multiple. This year, Roku looks to build a true content ecosystem, and from a subscriber standpoint, already has surpassed Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and trails only AT&T (NYSE:T) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA).Again, this is a high-risk play but it's also a high-reward opportunity. * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow Margins in the platform segment are very attractive and should allow Roku to turn profitable relatively quickly. International markets remain largely untapped. There's a case for waiting for a better entry point, or selling puts. But I like ROKU at these levels for the growth/high-risk portion of an investor's portfolio. Brunswick (BC)Past year performance: -35%Down 35% over the past year, Brunswick Corporation (NYSE:BC) is due for a breakout. The boat, engine and fitness equipment manufacturer is trading around $44, and despite a boating sector that has roared of late, the industry leader has been mostly left out.Source: Shutterstock Efforts to build out a fitness business have had mixed results and may support some of the market's skepticism toward the stock. But Brunswick now is spinning that business off, returning to be a boating pure-play. * 6 Big Dividend Stocks to Buy as Yields Plunge Cyclical risk is worth noting, and there are questions as to whether millennials will have the same fervor for boating as their parents. But at eight times forward EPS, BC is easily worth those risks.And if the stock finally can break through resistance, a breakout toward $70-plus seems likely. Pfizer (PFE)Past year performance: -16%Few investors like the pharmaceutical space at this point or even healthcare as a whole. But amidst that negativity, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) looks forgotten.Source: Shutterstock This still is the most valuable drug manufacturer in the world. It trades at just 12.4 times forward EPS, a multiple that suggests profits will stay basically flat in perpetuity. To top it off, PFE offers a 4.2% dividend yield.Obviously, there are risks here. Drug pricing continues to be subject to political scrutiny (though the spotlight seems to have dimmed of late). Revenue growth has flattened out of late.But Pfizer still is growing earnings, with adjusted EPS rising 1.3% last year. Tom Taulli previously cited three reasons to buy Pfizer stock -- and I think he's got it about right. Valmont Industries (VMI)Past year performance: -4%Valmont Industries, Inc. (NYSE:VMI) offers a diversified portfolio business and has been relatively weak across the board of late. The irrigation business has been hit by years of declining farm income. Support structures manufactured for utilities and highways have seen choppy demand due to uneven government spending. Mining weakness has had an impact on Valmont's smaller businesses as well.Source: Shutterstock Valmont is a cyclical business where the cycles simply haven't been much in the company's favor. Yet that should start to change. 5G and increasing wireless usage should help the company's business with cellular phone companies.Irrigation demand almost has to return at some point. And a possible infrastructure plan from the Trump Administration would benefit Valmont as well. * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow Concerns about the tariffs on steel likely have hit VMI, and sent it back to below $140. But many of Valmont's contracts are &quot;pass-through,&quot; which limits the direct impact of those higher costs on the company itself. Despite uneven demand, EPS has been growing steadily and should do so in 2019 as well. American Eagle Outfitters (AEO)Past year performance: -41%American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) is one of the, if not the, best stocks in retail, and that's kind of the problem. Mall retailing, in particular, has been a very tough space over the past few years, and it's not just the impact of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online retailers. Traffic continues to decline, which pressures sales and has led to intense competition on price, hurting margins.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)But American Eagle has survived rather well so far, keeping comps positive and earnings stable. And yet this stock, too, trades at around 11x EPS,. And American Eagle has an ace in the hole: its aerie line, which continues to grow at a breakneck pace.The company's bralettes and other products clearly are taking share from L Brands Inc (NYSE:LB) unit Victoria's Secret. And the e-commerce growth in that business, and for American Eagle as a whole, suggests an ability to dodge the intense pressure on mall-based retailers.In short, American Eagle isn't going anywhere. There's enough here to suggest American Eagle can eke out some growth, and a 3.4% dividend provides income in the meantime.The stock already is recovering, being one of the only on this list with a positive chart over the past year, and AEO stock should continue to perform well. Longer-term, there's still room for consistent growth and more upside. United Parcel Service (UPS)Past year performance: -6.5% United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is going to have to spend to add capacity, and in this space, too, there's the ever-present threat of Amazon.Source: Shutterstock But UPS is an entrenched leader, along with rival FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), and it at worst can co-exist with Amazon. Ecommerce growth overall should continue to increase demand; there's enough room for multiple players in the global market. * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow Meanwhile, the selloff and benefits from tax reform mean that UPS now is trading at just 14 times analysts' 2019 consensus EPS estimate. And the stock yields a healthy 3.44%. Investors clearly see a risk that growth will decelerate, but UPS stock is priced as if that deceleration is guaranteed.As of this writing, Vince Martin is long shares of Exxon Mobil.

2019-08-15	2019-08-15 13:00:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Takes Minority Stake in Autonomous Truck Startup	(Bloomberg) -- United Parcel Service Inc. is taking a minority stake in self-driving truck company TuSimple and conducting test runs with the startup.The undisclosed investment is part of an effort to understand what it would take to produce a fully autonomous truck, said Todd Lewis, who runs UPS Ventures. Developing a computer-driven truck requires advances in areas such as assisted braking and lane-change warnings that also could be used in traditional vehicles, he said.That desire to invest in technologies that serve current needs reflects a change at UPS Ventures, which was formed in 1997 as the Strategic Enterprise Fund. The $150 million fund was renamed and revamped when Scott Price, a former Walmart Inc. executive, was hired in December 2018 as the courier’s chief transformation officer.“We’ve shifted gears into a capability-driven model,” Lewis said. “Not only are we looking to form deeper relationships with our investments, but we’re also equally looking to give them real-life problems to solve and have a real environment to test and scale into.”UPS’s freight forwarding business is providing cargo for hauling between Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, on trucks guided by TuSimple’s autonomous system. A driver and engineer are also on board. The startup, valued at about $1 billion in a $95 million funding round in February, carried U.S. Postal Service trailers between Phoenix and Dallas in May.UPS Ventures has investments in 22 companies in areas such as robotics, blockchain, 3D printing and artificial intelligence and wants to increase that number, Lewis said.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Black in Dallas at tblack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Case at bcase4@bloomberg.net, Tony Robinson, Susan WarrenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-takes-minority-stake-autonomous-130000499.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-14	2019-08-14 17:58:59	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	3 Logistics Stocks to Buy and Sell	Do headlines of a slowing global economy or volatile back-and-forth trade war threats have your attention? It may be time to look at the price charts of logistic stocks Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), FedEx (NASDAQ:FDX) and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) as stocks to buy or sell, and navigate the market and deliver more consistent profits to your portfolio.Today it's all about weaker global economic data out of Europe and Asia which is spooking investors. Yesterday, and quite literally at that, it was a welcome out-of-left field delay on levying certain Chinese goods by the Trump Administration which drove the market smartly higher.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul To say the least, the market's contrasting reactions are challenging. That's where AMZN stock, FDX and UPS shares come in as stocks to buy or perhaps sell short. Despite the dizzying and countering headlines from day-to-day, these three logistic plays are setting up nicely to deliver profits to bulls and bears in the weeks ahead.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Logistics Stocks to Buy or Sell: AMZN StockAmazon is the first of our three logistics plays. The tech and retail behemoth is far from a straight-up delivery company. Still, as AMZN stock continues to build out its own internal business network to bring its packages straight to your doorstep--it's a logistics power to be reckoned with.On the price chart, Amazon's wherewithal isn't as convincing. In fact, the technical picture makes this a stock to buy, but one which could quickly turn into favoring a short on AMZN stock.Currently shares are near a test of trendline, 200-day simple moving average and Fibonacci supports tied to cycle lows from December and March. It's an area where buying into AMZN stock weakness could prove to be a windfall.The flip-side for this stock to buy is Amazon shares have formed a double-top variation relative to last year's high. AMZN stock has also already broken a couple trend-lines over the past couple months. A third failure could get ugly. The AMZN Stock TradeFor this stock to buy I'd suggest waiting for a confirmation of last week's doji low and only buy shares above the pattern high. Appreciably, setting a stop-loss beneath the candlestick makes a world of sense and also makes the case for shorting AMZN stock on a breakdown of key support. FDX StockFedEx is the next of our logistics stocks to buy or sell. The company recently broke ranks with providing service for Amazon. Down the road that could be very hurtful for FedEx. But in terms of the company's entire logistics business, right here and right now, its small change. Nevertheless, there's no denying FDX stock is technically a stock to short.On the price chart, FDX has continued to paint a disturbingly bearish picture. The weekly view shows a downtrend which began in early 2018 and one which continues to weaken. Most recently, shares have broken below channel support within a bearish flag pattern that's formed beneath key price and Fibonacci supports. The FDX Stock TradeWith shares trading slightly below last week's flag breaking doji candlestick, FDX stock is ready for shorting today. For keeping exposure contained off and on the price chart, I'd suggest a blended stop-loss above $168. That works out to risk of around 7.5% and closing the position if shares of FedEx reverse back above the doji and channel resistance. UPS StockUnited Parcel Service is the last of our logistics stocks to buy or sell. And if the UPS stock chart has any say in the matter, this one is readying to deliver big profits to bullish investors. Back in early 2018 and similar to FDX stock, shares of UPS began to waiver technically. Unlike FedEx, by the spring of this year UPS stock cleared downtrend resistance. And it has only gotten better from there.Shares of UPS are now consolidating nicely above pattern and Fibonacci resistance. This sets UPS up as a stock to buy in anticipation of a pattern breakout to fresh all-time-highs in the second half of 2019. The UPS Stock TradeMy recommendation for UPS stock is to wait for confirmation of last week's doji low continuing to hold support. This can be accomplished by purchasing shares above $118 and slightly above Monday's initial trade through of the doji.Alternatively, buying UPS stock through $121.30 and the high of the consolidation is another route bulls can entertain. Either way, using the pattern low to minimize losses and protect one's portfolio from a stock veering off course makes fiscally and technically good sense.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in securities mentioned in this article.

Bond Agencies Lower UPS Debt Ratings, Urging Cash Flow Prudence As Pension Obligations Loom	Two top bond rating agencies have lowered their ratings on the unsecured debt of UPS Inc. (NYSE: UPS), saying the transport and logistics giant may struggle to generate the needed cash to fund sizable capital investments, pension fund obligations, share buybacks and dividend increases without straining its balance sheet.  On August 9, Moody's Investors Service downgraded UPS debt to A2 from A1 with a negative outlook, while S&P Global lowered its rating to A from A+ with a stable outlook.  In a note, Moody's Senior Vice-President Jonathan Root said UPS' free cash flow levels will be pressured through 2020 as the company spends more than in prior years to meet the shifts in shipping and logistics patterns triggered by surging e-commerce demand.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bond-agencies-lower-ups-debt-211917775.html?.tsrc=rss

Annual free cash flow is expected to be pressured through 2020 because of higher capex spending that will offer little opportunity for the company to fund pension contributions, not to mention debt maturities. The outlook remains negative, meaning it could downgrade the credit again in the medium term. &quot;The negative outlook reflects what we believe will remain a challenging operating environment and the compounding effect of prospective material pension funding needs that will render the company reliant upon the debt capital markets, even if share repurchases are further tempered,&quot; Moody's Senior Vice President Jonathan Root said in a statement. UPS shares have gained 20% in 2019, while the S&P 500  has gained 17%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5ca542a1-9002-3e08-8a9a-08b8f2da86de/moody%26%2339%3Bs-downgrades-ups.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-07	2019-08-07 17:11:52	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEx Ends Ground-Delivery Deal With Amazon	(Bloomberg) -- FedEx Corp. is snipping another tie with Amazon.com Inc. as the e-commerce giant emerges as a competitor by building its own shipping network.The ground-delivery contract with Amazon won’t be renewed when it expires at the end of this month, FedEx said in a statement. The decision quickens the company’s retreat from the largest online retailer just two months after FedEx said its Express unit wouldn’t extend an agreement to fly Amazon’s packages in the U.S.“This change is consistent with our strategy to focus on the broader e-commerce market,” FedEx said in the statement. Recent moves to bolster service “have us positioned extraordinarily well” to handle demand, it said. The courier will still have a contract with Amazon for international deliveries.FedEx is reducing its dependence on Amazon as the online retailer builds out a logistics network with hundreds of fulfillment centers and adds next-day air capacity with leased jets. Amazon is also starting a home-delivery service modeled after the contractor-based ground unit at FedEx, which flagged the competitive risk in its latest annual report to U.S. regulators.“We are constantly innovating to improve the carrier experience and sometimes that means reevaluating our carrier relationships,” Amazon said in an email Wednesday. “FedEx has been a great partner over the years and we appreciate all their work delivering packages to our customers.”FedEx dropped 1.6% to $158.57 at 1:04 p.m. in New York. Amazon fell 1.1% to $1,767.39.The pullback is more negative for FedEx than for Amazon, said Satish Jindel, founder of SJ Consulting Group, which provides data and advice to logistics companies.Embracing WalmartAmazon can still rely on United Parcel Service Inc., the U.S. Postal Service, regional carriers and its own growing network to deliver packages, he said. FedEx will seek to make up for the lost volume with traditional retailers such as Walmart Inc., he said.The move is a way for FedEx to “get Walmart to realize that they’re not working with Walmart’s biggest competitor and to have Walmart make FedEx their primary carrier,” Jindel said on Bloomberg Radio.Amazon made up about 1.3% of FedEx’s sales last year. To scoop up more e-commerce business, FedEx announced in May that its ground unit would begin seven-day service in January, deliver more packages that had been handed off to the postal service and invest to handle oversized packages.The Memphis, Tennessee-based company has also signed up more drop-off and pick-up points, including with Dollar General Corp. FedEx is even testing a ground-delivery robot.‘Near-Term Pain’By walking away from Amazon, FedEx is looking to increase its profit margins, even though the company could feel “some near-term pain,” Lee Klaskow, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence in a Wednesday note.“This move is a logical progression after letting its Express contract expire in June,” Klaskow said. The Amazon contract “we believe was a low-margin business.”UPS, the largest U.S. courier, is taking a different tack by continuing its relationship with Amazon. Analysts have estimated that the retailer’s pledge to expand overnight deliveries fueled a 30% spike in UPS’s domestic next-day volume in the second quarter.UPS hasn’t said how much revenue it generates from Amazon, but if the total were more than 10%, the courier would be obligated to disclose the information in regulatory filings. The amount is probably close to that threshold, according to analyst estimates.Some of the ground packages that FedEx handled for Amazon will migrate to UPS, said David Ross, an analyst with Stifel Financial Corp. FedEx’s international deliveries for Amazon are likely very small, he said.Double-Edged SwordAmazon-related revenue as a percentage of FedEx’s total probably fell to less than 1% after the courier’s June decision not to renew the domestic air-delivery deal, Ross said in a note to clients. Ending ground delivery will make FedEx’s Amazon revenue “not worth mentioning,” he said.The surge in e-commerce business has been a double-edged sword for FedEx and UPS by spurring sales growth while squeezing profit margins, since home-deliveries are more costly to handle than dropoffs at commercial customers.In June, FedEx said it was in a “transition year” as it seeks to drive down costs and fix an ailing European business. The company forecast a mid single-digit percentage drop in earnings for the current fiscal year, which ends in May.&#92;--With assistance from Cecilia Esquivel.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Black in Dallas at tblack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Case at bcase4@bloomberg.net, Susan WarrenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-ends-ground-delivery-deal-134142815.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-07	2019-08-07 13:51:54	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEx’s Amazon Freeze-Out Sets Up Delivery Wars	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- FedEx Corp. seems to have finally realized it’s futile to label Amazon.com Inc.’s delivery aspirations as a “fantastical” threat. Now it’s waging an outright war on a company it appears to increasingly view as a competitor.FedEx won’t renew Amazon’s ground-delivery contract when the agreement expires at the end of this month, the company said in statement first reported by Bloomberg News on Wednesday. This follows a June announcement that FedEx would cease U.S. air-delivery services for Amazon.What’s curious is that FedEx was at pains at that time to emphasize that the “strategic decision” to curb its air-delivery relationship with Amazon didn’t affect other business units such as ground or international operations. It’s hard for me to believe that FedEx is simply finding its backbone and holding a firmer line on pricing with Amazon. The company added disclosures in its annual filing about the extent to which Amazon is developing in-house delivery capabilities that may make it a competitor. This could be an attempt to put Amazon in its place.  It reminds me a lot of the streaming wars. Just as traditional media companies were all too happy to pad sliding DVD sales with licensing fees from Netflix Inc. for years, FedEx and rival United Parcel Service Inc. have enjoyed the revenue fruits of the booming demand for e-commerce shipments ushered in by Amazon. But now, FedEx seems to be waking up to the fact that this relationship likely was never a two-way street. Like the media companies who are pulling their content from Netflix and launching their own streaming services, FedEx appears to no longer be keen to give Amazon a valuable base on which to build a rival logistics service. The question is whether it’s too late to turn the tables on Amazon.While Amazon has been moving aggressively to open fulfillment centers, build up a local delivery workforce and rent cargo planes, its network isn’t quite ready for prime time. The company last month said it ended up spending more than the $800 million it had planned in the second quarter to set up one-day delivery for Prime members. The push for speedier shipping was a “shock to the system” for its distribution and transportation network, and there had been some inventory and productivity setbacks, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts. The company also has to contend with the risk of pilot shortages and strikes at the third-party carriers it relies on to support its burgeoning air-cargo operations. Without FedEx as a backstop, the reliability of Amazon’s home-grown logistics operations will be put to a greater test. That said, I remain unconvinced that Amazon really wants or needs to develop a network on the scale of UPS or FedEx. It’s already disrupted the way those companies do business, forcing them to spend billions to retrofit their networks to handle ever-faster delivery times for a surge in e-commerce packages. While Amazon’s logistics operations aren’t ready to stand alone, the company can still lean on UPS and the Post Office. As FedEx itself is so quick to point out, Amazon only accounts for about 1.3% of its revenue.FedEx can’t give up on the e-commerce game entirely, though, and I am highly skeptical that with Amazon breathing down their necks, Walmart Inc., Target Corp. or anyone else is going to be that much easier of a customer when it comes to pushing for lower pricing and faster delivery times. Much like in the battle for video streaming dominance, it seems unlikely there will be any one winner in e-commerce logistics, but there will be plenty of losers, especially when it comes to profit margins.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-07-31	2019-07-31 13:19:58	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	4 Hot Stocks Rallying After Earnings	Wall Street warned that results from this earnings season would be bleak. However, some stocks have pleasantly surprised investors. So far 76% of companies in the S&P 500 index have exceeded profit expectations, which is above the historical average. Average earnings are up just 0.9% from the previous year, as strength in Communications Services names is being offset by the Materials sector. Positive quarterly results have sent a select few’s share prices soaring, with many analysts saying these stocks have the momentum they need to keep rising in the coming months. Here are the 4 stocks flying high after earnings. Snap Inc. (SNAP)After SNAP reported its Q2 2019 earnings on July 23, share prices jumped by almost 12% in after-hours trading. In just the last five days, shares have gained over 14%. The social media app beat the Street’s expectations for not only revenue and daily active users but also posted much smaller EPS losses. Its quarterly revenue increased 48% year-over-year to $388 million, surpassing the $360 million consensus estimate. Daily active users were up 8% year-over-year, reaching 203 million versus the predicted 192 million. Not to mention the company posted an EPS loss of 6 cents instead of 10 cents. Management attributed this user growth to its augmented reality lenses feature. SNAP has also been steadily gaining users thanks to its Android version upgrade which in turn has helped drive the revenue increase.  “Today, more than 75 percent of the 13-34 year-old population in the United States is active on Snapchat, making us larger than services like Facebook and Instagram among this audience, and demonstrating the broadbased appeal of our service,” said CEO Evan Speigel. Five-star analyst, Mark Mahaney, agrees that more growth is in store for SNAP. On July 24, the RBC Capital analyst reiterated a Buy rating while raising his price target from $17 to $20, suggesting 18% upside potential. “SNAP posted Beat and Raise Q2 results, with Revenue and EBITDA strongly better than RBC/Street, with DAUs well ahead of expectations and up the most Q/Q (13MM) since Q2:16. Revenue growth accelerated, DAU growth turned sharply positive, Gross Margin expanded nicely & EBITDA loss narrowed materially – a 4- part Summer Cocktail,” he said. The analyst gets a 24% average return per rating and has a 68% success rate. Another top analyst, Scott Devitt, believes traction from advertising and the company’s investment in improving the app will pay off in the long-run. On July 24, he reiterated his Buy rating and raised his price target from $17 to $19, indicating 12% upside potential. “While Snap plans to continue investing to support its long-term strategic objectives, the company demonstrated meaningful operating leverage during 2Q, highlighting the incremental margin potential of its business model,” the Stifel Nicolaus analyst said. The analyst boasts an impressive 71% success rate and gets a 22% average return per rating.   The Street is cautiously optimistic. SNAP has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus, with it receiving an additional upgrade to a Buy from Jonathan Kees after its earnings release. It has an average price target of $17, suggesting 1% downside.  Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)GOOGL’s strong second quarter earnings release on July 25 caused shares to surge 9% in after-hours trading. The stock is up over 8% in the last three days, and many analysts are saying a slowdown isn’t coming anytime soon. The company beat the consensus estimate of $38.2 billion in revenue, with actual revenue being $38.9 billion. EPS was $14.21, surpassing analysts’ $11.19 estimate. Management says advertising sales and its growing cloud segment drove the earnings beat. Revenue from advertising reached $32.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Its cloud computing and hardware revenue also saw a gain of 40% year-over-year, with it hitting $6.2 billion. While Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have a strong grasp on the cloud computing market, GOOGL is making headway. After former Oracle executive, Thomas Kurian, came on board late last year, its cloud sales and support have drastically improved. In June, GOOGL announced that it would acquire the data platform Looker for $2.6 billion.    On July 26, Raymond James analyst, Aaron Kessler, reiterated his Buy rating and raised his price target from $1,300 to $1,360, suggesting 11% upside potential. “Cloud computing and good, old-fashioned search and advertising, a key element driving our bullishness. We expect search growth to slow to low double digits but mobile monetization and traction in new areas should help sustain solid growth,” he said. The analyst has a 72% success rate and gets an average return of 24% per rating.    Analyst, Stephen Ju, also reiterated his Buy rating and raised the price target from $1,400 to $1,500, suggesting 22% upside potential. “While I was preparing to wait until the first quarter of 2020 to see possibilities for revenue growth acceleration, the narrative now shifts from fears of ongoing deceleration to possibilities of incremental ad budget share capture as the company turns on monetization of its Discover feed and other new products recently announced at Marketing Live 2019 gain adoption,” he said on July 26. The Credit Suisse analyst has a 69% success rate and an average return rate of 20% per rating. The Street’s sentiment remains bullish after earnings. It has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $1,389 average price target, suggesting 13% upside potential. United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)Since its better than expected July 24 earnings release, UPS shares have been surging. Shares were up 9% at the close of after-hours trading on the 24th and have gained 14% in the last five days. In its second quarter, the company generated $18.05 billion in revenue, up 3% year-over-year. Analysts had originally predicted $17.97 billion. Adjusted EPS was $1.96, surpassing the $1.92 consensus estimate. CFO Richard Peretz said, “Our performance was driven by the efficiencies created by investments in our network, the success of ongoing initiatives and our ability to execute in an ever-changing environment. We expect to carry this momentum through the upcoming quarters.”Following the release, Merrill Lynch analyst, Ken Hoexter, upgraded UPS to a Buy and gave the price target a boost, raising it from $115 to $130. He believes share prices could increase by 9% over the next twelve months. “We are impressed that UPS was able to end an 11-quarter decline in its overall operating margin, even with costs related to its automation projects and a big jump in next-day e-commerce business, which has historically dragged on margins. The company’s network transformation and secular gains equal a powerful story,” he said on July 25. UBS analyst, Thomas Wadewitz, said, “We believe that the company's rising visibility of margin expansion and higher earnings should support more upside in its stock. Its solid Q2 results signaled the company can process the strong e-commerce growth while also offering better visibility toward improving its Domestic package margins,” he said. On July 25, he reiterated his Buy rating while raising his price target from $110 to $128, suggesting 7% upside potential.  UPS has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and $124 average price target, indicating 4% upside potential. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG)Chipotle shares gained 4% in extended trading after its earnings release on July 23. The stock has surged 9% in the last five days, with analysts saying more growth is coming.The company reported second quarter revenue of $1.43 billion which beat the Street’s expectation of $1.41 billion. Adjusted EPS was $3.99, much higher than the $3.76 consensus estimate. Same-store sales grew by 10% versus the expected 8.3%. CMG’s impressive revenue growth was driven by an increase in digital sales, up 99% from the year-ago quarter.    Not to mention management increased its full-year guidance for same-store sales, with sales at locations open for at least one year expected to grow at a high-single digit rate, up from a mid-to-high single-digit increase. Analyst, Katherine Fogertey, agrees that CMG has the potential to grow even more in the long-term. On July 29, the Goldman Sachs analyst initiated her coverage with a Buy rating and set a $1,000 price target, suggesting 24% upside. “Our bullish view is based on our expectation that same-store sales trends will remain stronger for longer than the market expects. Our price target is not dependent on multiple expansion, but rather, we take a view that with food safety overhangs in the rear view, the stock performance will be driven by management’s ability to execute on sales driving initiatives,” she said. Another top analyst, Nicole Miller Regan, reiterated her Buy rating and raised her price target from $824 to $900, indicating 12% upside. “We remain confident that Chipotle is positioned to support recent sales momentum and, over time, drive potential upside to consensus expectations. Chipotle has best-in-class metrics across a series of sales, operations, cost margins, marketing, and long-term return categories,” the Piper Jaffray analyst said on July 31. CMG has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and $753 average price target, suggesting 6% downside.

What's Old Is New Again: U.S. Next-Day Air Surge Propels UPS To Solid Second Quarter Results, Best One-Day Share Gain Since '08	For most of the 21st century, next-day air deliveries in the U.S. have wallowed in the transport dustbin, considered an expensive relic of the past as businesses migrated to lower-cost, short- to intermediate-haul ground alternatives.  The numbers were likely skewed by volumes from e-tailer Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) which migrated to UPS after FedEx Corp.

2019-07-24	2019-07-24 14:45:39	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Jumps Most Since 2008 as Expansion Shows Early Success	(Bloomberg) -- United Parcel Service Inc. rose the most in more than 10 years after beating its own profit guidance, an early sign that a three-year, $20 billion expansion plan is paying off by keeping rising costs in check.Chief Executive Officer David Abney had promised investors they’d begin to see benefits later this year from his strategy to reduce residential delivery costs and increase business-to-business packages, which are more profitable. Shares tanked when he unveiled the plan in early 2018.Investors got a confidence boost Wednesday after UPS reported adjusted earnings of $1.96 a share in the second quarter, better than the company’s prediction in April that profit would be “relatively flat” with the $1.94 it reported a year earlier. Analysts had expected $1.93.Shares jumped 8.4% to $114.14 at 10:45 a.m. in New York after earlier rising as much as 9%, the most intraday since Oct. 28, 2008. UPS posted the second-highest gains on the S&P 500 Index, which was little changed overall.Profit margins also improved, UPS said in a statement.“We were really able to bend the cost curve down at the same time that volume and revenue went up,” Abney said in an interview. The results show “we absolutely can get the returns we want on e-commerce.”UPS emphasized its momentum with a slate of new initiatives announced Tuesday, including a move to seven-day deliveries in 2020 and next-day ground service. The courier continued its expansion of package drop-off and pick-up locations, including 6,000 CVS drugstores. Abney pledged to roll out more actions to drum up more business and boost efficiency.The company is under pressure to improve profit margins that have slipped as residential deliveries skyrocket in the e-commerce boom. Longtime customer Amazon.com Inc. has become a rival as the e-commerce giant starts its own shipping service, promising one-day delivery for top customers. UPS expanded its total operating profit margin by 0.3 percentage point.UPS’s new automated sorting hubs are about 35% more efficient than older ones. The courier is also improving its driver-navigation tool. Those productivity gains, coupled with the full savings impact of a voluntary retirement plan beginning in July, should boost profit in the second half of this year, helping UPS meet its full-year earnings target of at least $7.45 a share.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says: “UPS has pulled investments forward to increase technology and automation use to mitigate mix-driven margin compression as part of the company’s transformation plan. Risks to UPS delivering on its 2019 EPS guidance of $7.45-$7.75 are subsiding, in our view, given the strong 2Q performance.”&#92;--Lee Klaskow, Freight transportation analystClick here to read the research.The U.S. domestic business drove second-quarter profit with revenue rising 7.7%, boosted by a 30% surge in next-day volume. Profit margins rose 8% as the new sorting hubs held costs in check. At the supply chain and freight unit, operating profit jumped more than 10% even as sales declined.The international businesses was buffeted by a U.S.-China trade spat and concerns about the U.K. leaving the European Union, which contributed to a 2.7% decline in revenue for the unit. Still, efficiency gains helped adjusted operating profit to increase 1.7%.UPS is in a position to capture the increased demand for next-day delivery that’s being driven by e-commerce, Abney said on a conference call with analysts. The company is adding 11 new aircraft this year and another 11 in 2020. He expressed confidence that UPS had turned around its recent trend of shrinking margins by adjusting its operations to cope with an influx of residential deliveries spurred by online shopping.“We’re becoming, as a company, more agile, and the timing of our investments could not have been any better,” Abney said. “The structural change in the market for next-day delivery is favorable for UPS.”(Updates with profit margin expansion beginning in 10th paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Black in Dallas at tblack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Case at bcase4@bloomberg.net, Susan Warren, Tony RobinsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-jumps-most-since-2008-144539386.html?.tsrc=rss

FMCSA To Delay Compliance Deadlines For Driver Training Rule	Entry-level truck driver training services and state driver licensing agencies (SDLAs) will likely get two more years to comply with new federal training requirements originally scheduled for implementation in seven months.  The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has proposed delaying two provisions in its Entry-Level Driver Training (ELDT) rule from February 7, 2020, to February 7, 2022, according to a Federal Register notice published on July 18.  According to the notice, the extension would give training providers more time to upload driver-specific training certification information into the new Training Provider Registry (TPR) database and SDLAs more time to confirm CDL applicants have complied with training requirements before taking a knowledge or skills test.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fmcsa-delay-compliance-deadlines-driver-162720981.html?.tsrc=rss

The survey of buyers in China, Japan and Thailand appears to support the age-old relevance in Asia of face-to-face interactions in cultivating successful and sustainable relationships.

2019-07-16	2019-07-16 18:06:26	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	5 Transportation Stocks to Buy Now	U.S. equities are continuing to push higher on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average extending its move above the 27,000 level. Better-than-expected results from big bank stocks like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) are fueling ongoing buying interest as the latest earnings season rolls on.This comes despite the ongoing flow of uneven economic data. U.S. industrial production slowed in the second quarter for the first back-to-back decline since 2016. Freight shipments, according to the Cass Index, fell for the seventh straight month. Yet retail sales are strong.With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates later this month, likely fueling another surge in buying interest, I've noticed a number of transportation stocks perking up. This could be an early sign that the market is pricing in an economic rebound, since these companies are on the front lines of the business cycle, moving the people and the goods that make the system work.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Here are five transportation stocks that are worth a look: Transportation Stocks to Buy: Union Pacific (UNP)Shares of Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) are breaking up and out of a multi-month consolidation range to push back towards the highs seen in May. Shares were recently initiated with a buy rating at Goldman Sachs, with a $198 price target translating into a gain of roughly 13% from here.The company will next report results on July 18 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.14 per share on revenues of $5.6 billion. When the company last reported on April 18, earnings of $1.93 beat estimates by six cents on a 1.7% decline in revenues. CSX (CSX)Shares of CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), another railroad, are preparing to exit a four-month consolidation range with a push up and over resistance near the $80-a-share level. Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently initiated coverage with a neutral rating and a $86 price target, but Loop Capital recently downgraded from &quot;buy&quot; to &quot;neutral.&quot;  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy The company will next report results tonight after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.11 per share on revenues of $3.1 billion. When the company last reported on April 16, earnings of $1.02 per share beat estimates by 11 cents on a 4.8% rise in revenues. FedEx (FDX)FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock is rising up and off of support going back to late December, perking up and over its 50-day moving average. Watch for a run at the 200-day moving average, which would be worth a gain of roughly 8% from here. Analysts at Goldman recently initiated coverage with a &quot;buy&quot; rating and added the stock to its conviction buy list.The company will next report results on Sept. 17 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.18 per share on revenues of $17.1 billion. When the company last reported on June 25, earnings of $5.01 beat estimates by 18 cents on a 2.8% rise in revenues. UPS (UPS)UPS (NYSE:UPS) shares have cleared above their 200-day moving average for the first time since April, and are now threatening to break out of a churning, two-year downtrend with a move back towards $118 -- which would be worth a gain of more than 11% from here. The stock also had coverage initiated by Goldman analysts this month, with a buy rating and a target of $123 assigned.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond The company will next report results on July 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.93 per share on revenues of $17.9 billion. When the company last reported on April 25, earnings of $1.39 missed estimates by four cents on a 0.3% rise in revenues. Delta Airlines (DAL)Shares of Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) are taking flight, going vertical after breaking up and over resistance from its November and April highs. This ends a two-year funk going back to early 2018 as the company -- which tops customer satisfaction surveys in a tough industry -- continues to execute well. The airline has been able to avoid the disruptions tied to the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, since it didn't operate that model.The company will next report results on Oct. 10 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.26 per share on revenues of $12.7 billion. When the company last reported on July 11, earnings of $2.35 beat estimates by seven cents on a 6.5% rise in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-16	2019-07-16 08:00:08	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Thieves Love Amazon Prime Day as Much as Shoppers	(Bloomberg) -- Amazon’s Prime Day gives shoppers an opportunity to flex their deal-spotting muscles ahead of Black Friday. It also gives package thieves their own chance to warm up.Although the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas see far more parcel deliveries—and therefore, more brazen from-the-stoop thefts, Prime Day’s limited 48-hour window creates a concentrated opening for “porch pirates” to make their move, said Brody Buhler, managing director of Accenture’s post and parcel industry group.It’s hard to pin down exactly how many cardboard boxes are pilfered from plain sight around the invented summer buying spree, since customers can report thefts to one of three sources—the local police department, the retailer or the mail carrier—and those reports aren’t tallied centrally. But according to research from video-doorbell company Ring, 19% of U.S. households had a package stolen at some point in 2017 with an average value of $140 per package. Nextdoor, a social-networking app for neighborhoods, says user comments about package theft spiked 85% between July 18 and 20 last year, the main delivery period for Prime Day packages.“Criminals know about Prime Day—everyone has access to the internet these days,” said James Crecco, a police captain in Jersey City, New Jersey.The police department in Jersey City partnered with Amazon in December to run a sting operation and track down package thieves after hearing from a swelling number of victims of porch piracy. Within just seven minutes of placing the first package, officers made an arrest and ultimately caught 23 robbers over an 11-day period. The department has been thinking about implementing a similar plan in the days following Prime Day, though Crecco said it was waiting to see if Amazon would partner again before renewing the program.Of course, on-the-porch delivery isn’t a new phenomenon in the U.S., with Montgomery Ward launching its dry goods mail-order business while Ulysses S. Grant was president and Sears, Roebuck and Co.’s iconic catalog serving as America’s consumer bible for a century. But the proliferation of e-commerce brought delivery of goods—and chances to pilfer them—to a whole new level. E-commerce accounted for more than 10% of all retail and food service sales in the first quarter, up from about 3% in 1999, according to the Commerce Department. Orders come in all year long, especially as grocery delivery expands, but they’re concentrated around big shopping events. During last year’s Prime Day, members bought more than 100 million products. Amazon has expanded this year’s extravaganza to 48 hours from 36 last year, with Coresight Research forecasting Amazon raking in $5.8 billion globally in sales, up from an estimated $3.9 billion in 2018.“Criminals know about Prime Day—everyone has access to the internet these days.”And that’s just the orders placed on Amazon itself. With rivals from Target Corp. to one-time mail-order king Sears itself leaning into the event, logistics providers will be extra busy in the coming days.The growth of porch piracy has led a number of states, including California, South Carolina, Michigan and New Jersey, to propose bills for stricter penalties for package thieves. In Texas, the problem became so prevalent that state representatives formed a mail theft task force in 2017 and have since passed legislation that makes certain degrees of package theft a felony. Related: Amazon Workers Plan Prime Day Strike at Minnesota WarehouseWhen packages do go missing, most major mail carriers agree to be liable for about $100, leaving the retailer to refund the remaining dollar amount or send a new item. Accenture finds that 70% of consumers won’t return to an online store after a bad delivery experience, which has retailers putting more pressure on logistics companies to give customers what they want, including tracking and delivery flexibility to ensure their wares arrive unscathed.When online shopping first became popular, the “focus was on price, then it became on free shipping, then fast shipping and now consumer-controlled shipping that can be altered until 10 minutes before the package arrives,” Accenture’s Buhler said. The demand for control over delivery comes from concerns about theft combined with increased demand for convenience, he said.Theft's a pervasive problem, and retailers have tried a variety of deterrents but are still looking for the perfect solution. For instance, to attract grocery customers, Walmart Inc. is experimenting with staffers, sporting wearable cameras, arriving in company-owned cars to unpack food in customers’ kitchens. Others are trying to leave deliveries in shoppers’ garages or the trunks of their cars. But with each new test, questions linger about privacy and efficiency, plus one-off issues like escaping pets or malfunctioning apps that deny the employee entry.Amazon itself offers Amazon Lockers, keyless entry and click-and-collect “counters” to give buyers more ways to control how they receive their orders. Amazon Logistics also gives Prime members the opportunity to track the arrival of their packages in real time and to receive a photo of where the box was dropped, the company said. A spokeswoman declined to comment further or share company data on thefts. Rising fear about package theft has helped usher in a new industry altogether: porch security. Brad Ruffkess, a former Coca-Cola Co. employee, installed security cameras at his Atlanta home and watched two boxes get stolen off of his doorstep within weeks of each other in 2017. Frustrated by the limited protection options available, Ruffkess founded BoxLock Inc., a WiFi-connected lock that lets delivery drivers place packages in secure parcel boxes outside users’ homes.BoxLock launched on Prime Day last year and sold out within hours of being posted to the Amazon website, he said. Other innovations that seek to keep porch pirates from their loot include secure parcel mailboxes, in-home package drops, Nest and Ring cameras, and alternative delivery locations through programs like UPS My Choice.“There’s still a lot more innovation to come in package security as e-commerce continues to grow,” Buhler said. “When it gets up to 20% of total shopping and there are so many more packages on people’s doorsteps, we’ll see even more innovation in protecting deliveries.”Back in Jersey City, a booming waterfront metropolis just over the Hudson River from Manhattan, package theft is evenly distributed among high and lower-income neighborhoods, Captain Crecco said, calling it one of the “rare crimes that crosses every economic demographic.” The trick to stopping it is making sure it’s not so simple to pull off for minor criminals looking for a low-effort pull. “It’s easy and criminals aren’t looking for a lot of work,” he said.To contact the author of this story: Olivia Rockeman in New York at orockeman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Lisa WolfsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/porch-pirates-spot-opening-prime-080008110.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-26	2019-06-26 13:52:37	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEx Sees ‘Transition Year’ as Trade Damps E-Commerce Gains	(Bloomberg) -- FedEx Corp. predicted a “transition year’’ for fiscal 2020, with an improving outlook for e-commerce profits tempered by concerns that international trade tensions will worsen.Revenue per package in the ground-delivery operation rose 2.2% in the quarter ending May 31 as volume growth accelerated to 8.8%, FedEx said in a statement late Tuesday. That signaled progress in the courier’s push to extract higher profits from the surge in home deliveries driven by online shopping.FedEx is stepping up efforts to become the low-cost provider of e-commerce deliveries, paring jobs and partnering with companies such as Dollar General Corp. to add pickup and drop-off sites. But FedEx is struggling to shore up its Express air-delivery division -- the unit most threatened by escalating trade tensions, especially between the U.S. and China.“The utilization of the ground network and the opportunity they feel that they have with e-commerce to significantly grow is the positive that people are taking out of this,” said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners, which owns FedEx shares. “But certainly, we didn’t hear anything positive about China. We didn’t hear anything positive about Europe.”The shares fell 1.1% to $154.21 at 9:45 a.m. Wednesday in New York. The shares had dropped 3.3% this year through Tuesday, while rival United Parcel Service Inc. was little changed and a Standard & Poor’s index of industrial companies advanced 19%.Weak ForecastFedEx has been struggling to keep up with Wall Street’s expectations as the company pours money into making deliveries more efficient and struggles with a cloudy trade outlook.Adjusted earnings for the current fiscal year will drop by “a mid-single-digit percentage” from $15.52 a share in the year just ended, FedEx said in the statement. Analysts were expecting $16.15 in fiscal 2020 -- an estimate that had already been whittled down from $20 about six months ago.“Our fiscal 2020 performance is being negatively affected by continued weakness in global trade and industrial production, especially at FedEx Express,” said Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf.That impact extended a longstanding sense of frustration at FedEx with President Donald Trump’s willingness to stoke trade tensions, said Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith.“Clearly, we’ve been very disappointed over the last few years with the assumptions that we made on the growth in international trade, particularly with the Trump administration,” Smith said on a conference call with analysts and investors. “We have become a protectionist country.”FedEx fired a new weapon in the simmering U.S.-China trade war this week, suing the Trump administration to block enforcement of trade restrictions that have placed the company in Beijing’s crosshairs.The federal lawsuit came after the White House barred U.S. companies from selling technology to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co.While trying to comply, FedEx employees mistakenly flagged packages involving Huawei. Now China is considering adding the courier to a list of so-called unreliable entities.Understanding China’s ‘Unreliable Entities’ Blacklist: QuickTakeE-Commerce ChallengeCloser to home, the next 12 months will be pivotal for FedEx as it seeks to stem the decline in profit margins at the company’s ground unit. Recent moves include extending deliveries to seven days a week and reducing reliance on the U.S. Postal Service.FedEx’s Express business cut ties with Amazon.com Inc. as the largest online retailer muscles into the delivery business. FedEx said it would focus on more profitable customers.The challenge for FedEx -- and UPS -- is that deliveries to homes, where drivers often handle a single package at each stop, tend to be less profitable than business deliveries, where they might pick up or drop off several parcels.“Fiscal year 2020 is in many ways a transition year for FedEx as we continue to reinvigorate our business to capitalize on e-commerce growth and execute significant initiatives to reduce our cost to serve in the U.S.,” said Chief Operating Officer Rajesh Subramaniam.Those efforts are softening the blow from the weak profit forecast for fiscal 2020 -- but the pressure will remain on FedEx to show sustained gains from the rise of online shopping.“FedEx is not out of the woods,” Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a note to investors, “but base expectations are lower and if there is any shift towards a more optimistic macro environment, we expect shares to move higher from current levels.”(Updates stock action in fifth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Karen Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Black in Dallas at tblack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Case at bcase4@bloomberg.net, Tony Robinson, Cécile DauratFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-rises-courier-sees-e-121541286.html?.tsrc=rss

Late Monday, the company filed suit against the U.S. Department of Commerce, saying the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) against FedEx violates common carriers' rights, as it holds FedEx liable for shipments that violate the EAR without requiring evidence that FedEx had any knowledge of violations. FedEx said that while it supports the objective of the EAR, it places an unreasonable burden to police the millions of shipments made every day. &quot;FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency,&quot; the company said in a statement. FedEx's stock, which has now shed 7.0% amid a 3-session losing streak, has dropped 2.9% year to date, while the Dow transports has gained 10.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has rallied 14.3%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9e7113ff-15f1-32da-a554-77b2af1e65b4/fedex-stock-falls-to-pace-dow.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-24	2019-06-24 17:10:57	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon Threat to FedEx Is No Longer ‘Fantastical’	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- FedEx Corp. may finally be waking up to the threat Amazon.com Inc. poses to its business model.The logistics company is offering big discounts to help fill the planes in its Express delivery network with more e-commerce shipments, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter. The deals are being used to woo customers away from rival United Parcel Service Inc., or to convince them to switch from FedEx’s cheaper ground offerings, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter. For some customers, shipping goods via FedEx’s two-day air service may now cost about the same as shipping them through the ground division.(1)A FedEx spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal that the company hasn't changed its pricing strategy, adding that the two-day Express service “has been very successful and continues to deliver tremendous value to small and medium businesses competing in the e-commerce market.” Reports of the discounts come just weeks after FedEx said its domestic Express air-delivery unit was dropping Amazon as a customer to focus on &quot;serving the broader e-commerce market.&quot; FedEx dropped Amazon as a customer for its Express air-delivery unit to focus on “serving the broader e-commerce market.” The charitable interpretation of that move is that FedEx had found a bit of backbone and was holding a firmer line on pricing with Amazon in an effort to bolster its profit margins. The other possibility is that FedEx recognized that Amazon’s efforts to bring more of its logistics operations in house were real, and that it may want to start the process of breaking up with Amazon before Amazon decides to break up with it. While FedEx CEO Fred Smith has repeatedly painted any notion of Amazon disrupting the logistics industry as “fantastical,” his actions increasingly suggest otherwise. The share of capacity devoted to the time-sensitive legal documents and medical supplies that the FedEx Express network was originally built for will likely continue to shrink. But it’s uneconomical for the division’s fleet – which numbered 670 leased and owned planes at the end of 2018 – to fly partially full or not at all. Meanwhile, FedEx expects U.S. e-commerce demand to grow to 100 million packages per day by 2026. It’s been adamant that Amazon only directly accounts for a small percentage of its overall sales. But Amazon has forever changed the world’s expectations around shopping and delivery. So whether or not its own sales are in the mix, FedEx will be forced to drink more deeply from the firehose of e-commerce shipments to keep its network humming along. And that will come at a cost to margins.FedEx’s decision to prioritize shipments from the likes of Walmart Inc., Target Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. gave some analysts hope that it would deliver a greater share of packages to higher-paying business customers and add more density to its delivery routes. But there’s some debate as to whether the Express air-delivery unit as currently constituted still makes sense. Amazon relies on a network of fulfillment and sorting centers close to metropolitan areas to rapidly complete and ship orders, a model that many rival retailers are mimicking in some shape or form as they try to stay competitive. If you’re only going to deliver a package 25 or 50 miles, you’re not going to use a plane to do that. Indeed, when FedEx’s decision to drop Amazon as a U.S. Express customer was first announced, Seaport Global Holdings analyst Kevin Sterling wondered to Bloomberg News whether it was a precursor to the Express unit eventually fading out.Planes still have a role to play: Amazon last week announced an agreement to lease 15 additional Boeing Co. 737-800 converted freighters from General Electric Co.’s jet-lessor arm, adding to an existing agreement for five planes. But FedEx’s reported need to offer discounts to keep the planes it has full calls into question the company’s decision to devote a significant amount of its capital expenditure budget to refreshing its airplane fleet. Management has been clear it’s not expanding capacity at the Express unit, but rather replacing its planes with more efficient options to improve productivity and costs. Downsizing the fleet and reallocating those resources could be a smarter move. The reported pricing cuts – coupled with FedEx’s recently announced plan to offer delivery seven days a week by 2020 and add a fleet of flexible, part-time drivers – reinforce a point both I and my colleague Shira Ovide have long argued: Amazon doesn’t need to steal customers away from FedEx and UPS en masse to be a threat. It’s already forcing both companies to rethink the way they operate. The revenue lost from removing Amazon as an Express customer is relatively minor, but the world the e-commerce giant has created isn’t a hospitable one for the package-delivery incumbents’ profit margins and capital-spending budgets.  (1) News of the discounts weighed on shares Monday, as did a separate shipping issue: FedExhad to issue a second apology to Huawei Technologies over the misrouting of packages, and some reports indicate China is contemplating black-listing it.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

The shortage of pilots is due to several reasons including federal safety measures implemented in 2011 that limited the number of hours a pilot could fly.  Also, as noted in a previous FreightWaves article, additional high barriers of entry for new pilots include the acquisition of a private pilot's license, which often requires a college degree followed by 1,500 flight hours before one can be hired by a commercial airline.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-importance-pilots-e-commerce-153539429.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-24	2019-05-24 15:03:45	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Top 7 Service Sector Stocks That Will Pay You to Own Them	Editor's note: This story was previously published in March 2019. It has since been updated and republished.Despite common economic challenges, services stocks present a viable opportunity. The most obvious tailwind is that American society mostly transitioned to a service-based economy. According to the International Trade Administration, 80% of private-sector jobs are levered to the service industry. More critically, we're really good at what we do.For the past year, President Donald Trump complained bitterly about trade-imbalances with other nations, particularly China. However, the Trump administration never says a word about the services trade, where we enjoy a robust surplus. Naturally, this dynamic boosts the case for services stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer Another favorable factor is that several publicly traded companies in this sector are also dividend stocks. During uncertain phases, these passive-income generating names provide practically-guaranteed returns. Additionally, dividend-payers tend to perform better during bear markets.Finally, the service sector covers a wide range of opportunities. From retail to entertainment to communications, you'll have no shortage of options. Here are seven services stocks that will generate consistent, passive income for your portfolio:Source: Shutterstock  United Parcel Service (UPS)Few service-based companies offer as much upside potential as e-commerce firms. However, popular names like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are not dividend stocks, but rather, operate purely on a capital-gains basis. So the next best thing is the transportation middleman, namely United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS).Of course, the immediate criticism is that Amazon's venture into in-house product mailing solutions will completely disrupt UPS stock. Certainly, the situation looks bad for the courier. However, UPS responded with their own e-fulfillment service, and it has more credibility than Amazon can dream about.While I respect the e-commerce giant, UPS has an established transportation network. In terms of scales of economy, UPS stock easily wins out. Plus, the company pays out a generous dividend yield at 4.2%. You're just not going to get that with most services stocks levered purely to e-commerce.Source: Shutterstock  Penske Automotive Group (PAG)With the advent and later dominance of ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft, the concept of buying cars is steadily becoming archaic. In my first-ever Uber ride, my driver told me his personal forecast: people will stop purchasing cars and transition to ride-sharing full-time.If such a prediction comes true, services stocks like Penske Automotive Group (NYSE:PAG) would simply implode. Although I'm not going to necessarily disagree with my driver -- gotta keep my five-star rating! -- the automotive still breathes.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend One of the main factors keeping PAG stock in the running is practicality. Sure, ride-sharing apps have added options to the mix. However, nothing beats the convenience and cost-savings of driving yourself to your desired destination.With Penske's massive dealership network, they consolidate whatever sales opportunities exist, eating alive the small guys. This stinks if you're on the receiving end of this tactic. However, for stakeholders in PAG stock, they're not complaining, especially because of its 3.54% yield.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr H&R Block (HRB)All services stocks provide important, and often necessary functions to society. However, no one has such an extreme love-hate dynamic like H&R Block (NYSE:HRB). Tax season is always a difficult time for families this time of year. Even if you're due for a refund, you don't like the paperwork involved.Of course, HRB stock makes a case for itself by alleviating this pressure for many families. This year, and moving forward, H&R Block presents an even more valuable service. That's because several taxpayers complained about the complexities and the surprise tax hit they incurred due to new laws.Moreover, the &quot;gig economy&quot; reshaped the labor force, with many (usually young) workers eschewing the corporate ladder for professional autonomy. Usually, though, this implies that these workers are independent contractors, which is a much more complicated tax process than being a run-of-the-mill employee.As such, you can expect HRB stock to significantly rise higher. And if not, the company is among the higher-paying dividend stocks, with a 3.68% yield.Source: Shutterstock  Verizon (VZ)I'm usually not into dividend stocks as they don't fit my risk-taking personality. However, I recently took a shot with AT&T (NYSE:T). To summarize my bullish case for the telecom giant, I only need one &quot;word,&quot; which obviously is 5G.However, AT&T isn't the only name among services stocks to benefit from the next-generation in wireless technology. Rival Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) offers similar fundamental upside. In fact, Verizon won a critical PR victory, becoming the first commercial 5G provider. But other reasons exist why you should consider VZ stock.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Anxious Investors While I'm partial to AT&T as an investment, the company has leveraged itself with aggressive acquisitions. If they don't pan out, T shares will have serious problems. True, VZ stock isn't perfect in this department, but it's more stable than its core competitor.For this stability, you're not missing out that much in terms of passive income. Currently, Verizon offers a generous 4.09% dividend yield.Source: Flazingo Photos Via Flickr BG Staffing (BGSF)Back during the &quot;analog&quot; days, services stocks in the staff-sourcing industry had substantial relevancy. Primarily, organizations like BG Staffing (NYSEAMERICAN:BGSF) provided a useful platform for young workers to get their first professional job. Also, they helped get transitioning workers back on their feet.But with the rise of digitalization, along with social media outlets like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), BGSF stock appears anachronistic. Often times, it's not about what you know, but who you know. Recent technologies have only made this adage frustratingly accurate, depending on your perspective.Still, I like BGSF stock and its chances to work its way out of its long-term funk. As I mentioned with H&R Block, BG Staffing benefits from the autonomous gig economy. Due to various factors such as changing employment dynamics, millennials won't typically stay at one job indefinitely.Admittedly, you'll probably need patience with BGSF stock. But while you're waiting, it's one of the highest-paying dividend stocks, featuring a 5.95% yield.Source: Jeremy Thompson via Flickr Six Flags Entertainment (SIX)Many investors have the mistaken impression that services stocks are boring; indeed, the name itself doesn't generate much excitement. However, this sector doesn't have to induce you into a coma, as renowned theme park Six Flags Entertainment (NYSE:SIX) proves.Famous (or notorious) for its stomach-churning rides, SIX stock has generated long-term gains since its initial public offering. Unfortunately, recent market sessions have offered the same diabolical sensations as you would get riding the theme park's &quot;Full Throttle.&quot;  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential Much of the volatility stems from SIX stock not recovering from its fourth-quarter 2018 earnings report. Although the company handily beat expectations for earnings per share, revenues disappointed against expectations. Six Flags delayed opening new locations in China due to its slowing economy.However, don't forget that revenues have consistently increased over the years. Furthermore, a possible trade deal between the U.S. and China would skyrocket SIX stock. Because of the risks involved, the company pays out a 6.37% dividend yield.Source: ATLAS Social Media via Flickr National CineMedia (NCMI)I concede that National CineMedia (NASDAQ:NCMI) is a tough pill to swallow. The broader market downturn has disproportionately impacted services stocks related to the cineplex industry. After gaining 10% in March it gave back all of that and then some, losing about 4% compared with this time last year.Given the popularity of streaming-entertainment firms like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), National CineMedia seemingly has no chance. However, I'd advise against knee-jerk reactions when assessing NCMI stock. The box office, though a legacy institution, remains very much relevant in the 21st century.How, you may ask? Simply, cineplex operators provide a social experience that streaming-related services stocks cannot. In dying shopping malls, astute developers refocused their efforts to provide event-based attractions for family-oriented Hispanic communities, to resounding successes. Against a comparable backdrop, NCMI stock may receive a similar lift.If nothing else, National CineMedia is one of the most generous, legitimate dividend stocks. With a yield of 9.84%, it's a risky but incredibly attractive proposition.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long AT&T stock.

Packages are inserted at the hub into the UPS air network for next-day or same-day delivery if the parcels are funneled through by the cut-off of 1:30 a.m. With the expansion, the hub will funnel even more parcels into its air operations, supporting fast deliveries to e-commerce customers, UPS said."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-completes-major-modernization-louisville-140448467.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-16	2019-05-16 09:16:06	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	3 Reasons Why The New Delivery Service Program Will Lift Amazon Stock	Perhaps no other company defines this century's digitized economy better than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). By simply mentioning AMZN stock, the U.S. has a game-changing institution that's the envy of the world. But with unprecedented dominance comes fierce criticism and opposition.Source: Shutterstock Especially in the current political environment, it's become routine to blast the e-commerce giant as disruptive and exploitative. Even President Trump -- a man who isn't exactly popular -- went on the offensive against AMZN stock.Admittedly, many of these accusations have a ring of truth to them. But what's also true is that the company has made genuine efforts to revitalize the broader economy. For instance, in its latest bid to bring one-day deliveries to Prime customers, Amazon is funding courier service entrepreneurs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere's the rub: they're asking AMZN employees to step up to the plate.Essentially, management wants some of their workers to quit their jobs and become entrepreneurs. The idea here is that these business owners will grow a delivery fleet to serve only Amazon customers, streamlining a segment of a multi-billion dollar industry. Of course, with e-commerce representing a greater share of all retail sales, this is a viable operation.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Trade War Reignites To further incentivize volunteers, AMZN is offering a very generous offer: $10,000 to help with start-up costs, in addition to three-months' pay. Not only will this move boost the Amazon stock price longer-term, it may finally ease PR pressure. AMZN Employees Have Opportunity of a LifetimeOne of the best investments you could have made was to invest in Amazon stock early on. One meme circulating shows how $1,000 at the IPO would be worth $1.2 million today. Failing that, the next best choice is to partner with the company as it attempts to utterly dominate retail.Given a choice, I'll take the entrepreneurship offer over free shares of AMZN stock. Why? As a non-dividend paying growth name, you can't do much with the equity. Shares will either move higher or lower. But with the delivery-service partnership, you have the ability to control their compensation.Best of all, you don't have to deal with office politics. Your success (or failure) is entirely dependent on you. I believe this is a pivotal reason why entrepreneurs are happier than employees. This happiness segues perfectly into my next point… Partnership Offer Is a Great Deal for Amazon StockAs a former employee of several large corporations, I've experienced private couriers like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) from several angles. Generally speaking, the level of service varies by specific worker or business unit.I've encountered delivery drivers who made it clear that they hated their jobs. And over time, I've noticed less-personable service as a retail customer. Nowadays, the &quot;track my shipment&quot; option that many couriers offer is totally useless because the estimated arrival time window is too big.Most likely, that will change with a dedicated delivery network, eventually driving up the Amazon stock price. I say this because business owners, not employees, will handle the one-day delivery services. If a problem pops up, the managers of that particular route have every incentive to resolve it. If not, the entire business suffers.  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk Because personal pride and reputation is associated with each Prime shipment, I think you'll see better-than-expected performances. You can't say that about FedEx or UPS because each cog is tied to a bigger one. Therefore, on the delivery end, you don't find much motivation for operational excellence. This is an underappreciated tailwind for AMZN stock. AMZN Stock Can Finally Shed Its PR ControversiesAs I mentioned earlier, Amazon stock carries with it many controversies. Primarily, CEO and founder Jeff Bezos has disrupted the retail sector so much that several malls have simply collapsed. In those failures, however, lie terrible human tragedies.In addition, high-profile politicians and social advocates have accused Amazon of being tone deaf. The uproar was so great that ultimately, AOC upended HQ2 in NYC. Plus, you have Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang calling out the company for not paying federal taxes.But with the delivery-partnership program, AMZN can finally attract positive attention. That's because this program is an immediate job creator. True, Amazon has automated thousands of jobs into oblivion. But this partnership opportunity rewards those with a visionary spirit. In turn, these folks can grow their businesses in their communities, sparking a hiring surge.It also does away with the notion that Amazon stock is merely a consumptive entity. This bold strategy levers an accretive effect on communities impacted by either automation or disruption. At the very least, the move forces a nuanced discussion of big business in the 21st century.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-13	2019-05-13 16:41:47	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Robots Are Coming for 1,300 Amazon Warehouse Jobs	Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a massive company and it has an equally massive workforce. The company employs many people at its warehouses, where three factors are converging: shipping costs, the need for greater speed with the move to one-day Amazon Prime shipping, and increased labor costs. The company is now experimenting with equipment that addresses all three of these issues. And it could lead to Amazon job cuts.Source: Amazon New machines rapidly box up orders and label them, building a custom-made box for each order as they do so. At each warehouse where the technology is deployed, there could be up to 24 Amazon job cuts as the robotic equipment replaces humans. Report: Amazon Job Cuts Coming Via Warehouse Order Boxing AutomationReuters published an exclusive report this morning, detailing a program currently being tested at Amazon warehouses. According to Reuters' sources, the company has installed technology at a number of its warehouses that scans the products for an order as they arrive on a conveyer belt, then wraps them in a custom-made box and slaps on a delivery label.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe machines -- called CartonWrap -- are made by an Italian company, and are capable of processing between 600 and 700 boxes per hour. That makes them four or five times more efficient than a human packer. Offsetting this efficiency somewhat is the need to have one employee stationed at the machine to help load custom orders, and another to keep stocking the machine with glue and sheets of cardboard.A warehouse with the CartonWrap machines installed would also need to have a specially-trained technician onsite to deal with jams and other issues. According to the Reuters report, the net gain for Amazon is the elimination of at least 24 positions per warehouse. If the CartonWrap machines are deployed at all Amazon U.S. warehouses, that would represent 1,300 Amazon job cuts.As for expenditures, the costs of the equipment would be recovered within two years. Given the cost of employee wages, that's a substantial win for the company, and a positive for Amazon stock. Benefits for Amazon StockAmong American companies, Amazon has the second-largest number of employees. Wages are a big expense. That cost got even bigger last year when it announced a new $15 hourly minimum wage for all employees. That move reportedly cost $1.5 billion per year, and the resulting hit to AMZN earnings is likely to impact Amazon stock value.The Amazon job cuts would help a bit to offset that increased expenditure.For years, Amazon has had issues where small products were shipped in ridiculously large boxes. This is not only bad PR, but it costs the company more in shipping fees. And shipment costs for a company with Amazon's scale are huge -- big enough that AMZN launched its own delivery service last year, competing with carriers like UPS (NYSE:UPS). The CartonWrap machines customize boxes to minimize wasted space, which means lower cost through carriers -- and more packages on a truck for its own delivery fleet.Finally, in April Amazon announced it would begin rolling out one-day Prime delivery.Amazon stock has been feeling the effect of slowing e-commerce sales, and improving Prime from two-day to one-day service is seen as a way to boost those shopping numbers. But one-day shipping requires orders to be turned around much more quickly. Replacing human order boxers with CartonWrap machines that are four to five times faster would go a long way toward achieving one-day Prime delivery goal. Avoiding LayoffsAMZN has been working to put a positive spin on its role as the country's second-largest employer. Headlines decrying Amazon job cuts would not be the desired outcome. The company has not made the final decision about wide scale deployment of the CartonWrap technology, but if its does there is a plan.An Amazon spokesperson released a statement, telling Reuters:&quot;We are piloting this new technology with the goal of increasing safety, speeding up delivery times and adding efficiency across our network. We expect the efficiency savings will be re-invested in new services for customers, where new jobs will continue to be created.&quot;  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Trade War Reignites Reuters sources say that means the company will count on attrition and shuffling employees to other positions, while playing up the safety angle. That would avoid those Amazon job cuts being reported as actual layoffs and ensure the new robots are a win for Amazon stock on multiple fronts.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-07	2019-05-07 18:52:31	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips	In most cases, trying to pinpoint the best entry spot into a new position is a lost cause. Either a stock doesn't ebb and flow predictably enough, or waiting ends up meaning a trader ultimately misses out on gains. The market's very best stocks have a knack for making prolonged rallies, never pulling back and opening a window of opportunity.There are exceptions, however. That is to say, some stocks are forever rising and falling in a pattern, making long-term net progress, even if not rising in a straight line.  * 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality To that end, here's a rundown of the market's best stocks to buy on a decent dip. They're not necessarily ripe for a purchase right now, but they each sport enough long-term momentum and the right fundamentals to recover from a future stumble as well as they have in the past.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  Click to EnlargeJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock may not always soar to higher highs. But, even when the market environment is lousy and the economy is in shambles, JNJ stock finds a way of hammering out some degree of progress. Its stumbles are always short-lived before yielding to a move above its prior peak.That persistence has everything to do with the nature of its business. Johnson & Johnson sells a mix of prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs like Tylenol and Zyrtec and a variety of medical equipment. Its top and bottom lines don't move in a perfectly straight line, but they broadly move higher all the time.There is a catch with JNJ stock, however. While it can and usually does recover pretty quickly, there's no rhythm or pattern to its pullbacks and rebounds. Verizon Communications (VZ)  Click to EnlargeThe telecom industry is changing. It's getting tougher to be in, as the lines between phone and video -- and now entertainment -- continue to blur.Nobody knows that better than the chiefs at Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), which acquired a struggling Yahoo with plans to use that as a springboard into the streaming video arena. It has not worked out very well, with the company writing down $5 billion last year to adjust for the deteriorating value of its Yahoo and AOL properties.Unlike its biggest rival AT&T (NYSE:T), however, Verizon hasn't taken on too much outside of the telecom realm. Revenue growth has been surprisingly steady, even if income growth hasn't been quite as consistent. It's the erratic bottom line largely responsible for the pullbacks the stock has been dishing out since 2010.  * 10 Vice Stocks to Spice Up Your Portfolio Take a closer look at those lulls though. Just when it looks like the stock's never going to recover, it does. Goldman Sachs Group (GS)  Click to EnlargeGoldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) used to be a titan, and arguably the premier name in the investment banking business. That's not the case anymore. Through a combination of more competition and a lack of effective focus, Goldman lost a step.Investors have taken notice. It was earnings lulls that largely drove the 2011, 2015 and 2018 setbacks for GS stock. Those were big selloffs too. Last year's tumble was almost a 50% meltdown from peak to trough.Those troughs have been great buying opportunities though, since if nothing else, Goldman Sachs can lean on its pedigree while it regroups to restore earnings growth. There's also a support line that appears to be playing a role in the stock's recoveries now. Lowe's Companies (LOW)  Click to EnlargeHardware store chain Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) has always played second fiddle to bigger rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and perhaps hasn't performed as well as it would have liked because Home Depot was forever standing in the way.The second-biggest home improvement retailer is no slouch, however. As long as the economy and housing market are on solid footing, Lowe's is growing too, securing its spot on a list of the best stocks to buy on a dip.  * 7 Tips for Financial Planners to Gain a Competitive Edge The weekly chart of LOW confirms it. The weekly chart also makes clear that this particular stock ebbs and flows in a rhythm, and more often than not, it turns around when it bumps into previously established support and resistance lines. Medtronic (MDT)  Click to EnlargeMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) makes and markets a variety of medical devices, ranging from pacemakers to dialysis catheters to electrosurgical instruments.Yes, as was the case with Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic's business is reliable from one quarter -- and one year -- to the next. The tradeoff is, red-hot growth is incredibly unlikely.It's a dynamic investors generally have a tough time remembering, given the stock's up-and-down action. The market will bid it up to unsustainable values, and when they correct that move, they overdo the downturns as well. The end result is a relatively well-established zig-zag pattern that since 2015 has been framed by equally well-established support and resistance lines.It looks as if MDT shares just pushed up and off the lower boundary of that rising trading range. WEC Energy Group (WEC)  Click to EnlargeThere's rarely a bad time to own a utility stock. While they offer little in the way of growth, they offer much in the way of consistency. They're also solid dividend payers, even if they rise and fall like bonds when interest rates fall and rise.WEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC) isn't an exception to that norm.Yes, it's a bit off the radar. WEC Energy serves only 4.5 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota.  * 7 ETFs for Investors With a Gambler's Spirit That obscurity is the edge investors have, however. It's not overwatched and overinvested the way bigger names like Southern Co (NYSE:SO) and Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) are. That dynamic allows it to move without an unnatural level of buying and selling pressure; instead, moving back and forth in a well-established pattern clearly framed by support and resistance levels. It just bumped into the upper boundary of that ceiling, so investors looking to step in will probably have to wait a while. Dollar Tree (DLTR)  Click to EnlargeDollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) is a curious bird. One would think the deep discounter would thrive when the economy is in shambles and struggle when the economy is thriving.That has not necessarily been the case though. In fact, there has been no apparent link to the economy in a long time for DLTR stock. It just moves higher in any kind of environment, in step with unfettered sales and earnings growth. Last quarter's slight sales lull is the first time since 2014 the top line has shrunk. Before that, it hadn't happened since the end of 2007. That consistency is the key reason DLTR has earned a spot on a list of the best stocks to buy after a pullback.Just for the record, however, the pullbacks Dollar Tree shares are dishing out on a regular basis are uncomfortably big. The trip from the upper edge of a long-term trading range to the lower end of that range last year cut DLTR by about a third of its value. Coca-Cola (KO)  Click to EnlargeConsumers may be steering away from sugary sodas, but that's hardly all Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is anymore. Dasani water, Honest T tea and Zico coconut water are just some of its healthier options that consumers are clamoring for these days. That diverse product lineup is a key reason the company's sales and earnings have been predictable, even if not always moving forward.The beverage business runs (no pun intended) hot and cold, and that can push KO stock higher and lower by quite a bit.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks That Are Bleeding Cash Take a step back and look at the weekly chart though. You'll find that what feels like sizeable pullbacks at the time ends up being opportunities to step into a long-term uptrend right as the lower boundary of a rising channel is met. Micron Technology (MU)  Click to EnlargeShares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) ebb and fall regularly too, but their cycle can take an agonizingly long time to complete. Whereas other names that make for great &quot;buy on a dip&quot; prospects may peel back for a few weeks, Micron shares can slide for over a year.In every case so far, though, the recovery has more than offset the setback.The cycle in question is neither a psychological nor an economic one. It's a tech-based one. The computer memory market is in the nasty habit of over-responding to rising RAM prices, creating too much production capacity that leads to a price-gouging glut. That's what up-ended MU stock in 2018, and again last year.The tough part about using these selloffs is being patient enough to let them run their full course before filing back in. United Parcel Service (UPS)  Click to EnlargeFinally, add United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) to your watchlist of stocks to buy after a major pullback.UPS contends with a variety of headwinds, ranging from economic lulls to fuel prices to competitive pressures. None of them are easy, and all of them are capable of taking a toll on United Parcel Service shares with or without notice. The weekly chart of UPS is visibly, alarmingly erratic.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 Take a closer look at that chart though. While sea-sickening at times, all of the dips since 2009 have been great short-term buying opportunities. Several of them wound up being great long-term entry points. The challenge is just mustering the guts to take the swing, trusting that United Parcel Service is capable of addressing its challenges immediately after they surface. So far, it has been.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Half of Americans Prefer Opening a Small Business to Retirement, According to The UPS Store® Survey	New data from the second annual The UPS Store® “Inside Small Business Survey” reveals that the entrepreneurial spirit remains strong.  What’s more is that the survey found that age is no indicator of entrepreneurial dreams: 54 percent of Americans say that they would rather open a small business than retire, if money or health were not a factor later in life.  Dr. Luke Pittaway, Ohio University College of Business O’Bleness Professor of Entrepreneurship, says this could be attributed to people living longer, healthier lives.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/half-americans-prefer-opening-small-090000414.html?.tsrc=rss

Automated unloaders took years to develop and still haven’t been perfected, reflecting the difficulty of working with an array of packages that are stacked differently from truck to truck.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robots-edge-closer-unloading-trucks-090014434.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-02	2019-05-02 13:45:51	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	3 Mega-Cap Stocks to Trade After Sour Earnings Reactions	After a hideous ending to 2018, this year started out much better. Sentiment on Wall Street flipped positive after the Christmas crash as the fears from the Fed threat abated. Yesterday we rekindled some of it, but this time it was more of a disappointment than fear for cause.Yesterday, Federal Reserve Jerome Powell refused to commit to a rate cut so investors threw a fit in the afternoon. This is different than fearing harmful action from the Fed. After all, they are still dovish and supportive of the economy and when things are going this well we don't need a cut yet.Case in point, we are in the throes of yet another earnings season and, so far, companies have delivered strong results after a tough year for equities in 2018. Some stocks fell on good earnings reports and they deserve attention.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen a company misses earnings estimates it might be the fault of management, but other times, stocks fall for all the wrong reasons. Today we will examine three mega-cap stocks that delivered on their promises yet investors sold their stocks on the headlines.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May Not every falling knife is safe to catch as some will cost you fingers. But in this bullish market, some dips are worth buying. Intel (INTC)Source: Shutterstock Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been a proven company for decades. It survived the Dot Com bubble and helped change our world into what it is today. We now rely more on technology than ever and the speed of adoption is exponential. This is a global trend that is here to stay, so there will continue to be strong demand on INTC products and services for decades.Wall Street hated INTC's earnings last week and the stock tumbled 13% since then. This qualifies as a correction per Wall Street standards. This dip is worth a buy because of two factors. First, this is a cheap company, so there is not a lot of froth to lose. Second, it is now technically falling into a support zone. Both of these facts mean that it will find support sooner rather than later as long as markets in general hold up. If the S&P 500 needs to also correct, then, of course, INTC has more downside to $47 per share. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Source: Shutterstock On the other end of the chip sector spectrum is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). This is the comeback stock that has shined for over a year. It is up 144% in a year which is seven times better than the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) . INTC and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are down -3% and -20%, respectively, for the same period.AMD stock proved to be resilient even in tough times. Last year when the whole market was falling into an abyss, AMD stock delivered positive results. So the thesis to buy it on dips is that it continues to outperform this year too. It is up 45% which is 40% better than the SMH and almost six times better than INTC. Clearly, it is in favor on Wall Street.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Are Worth Your Money But this is a frothy bet from a valuation perspective. AMD's price-to-earnings ratio is almost 90, which is six times more expensive than INTC. But in this case, you get what you pay for from the stock price action perspective. It's down to traders' preferences and timelines as to which to buy: Intel stock or AMD stock. United Parcel Service (UPS)Source: Shutterstock Commerce is becoming more online transaction than in-store. So this puts more demand on shipping. Recently, transport stocks fell back into favor but not so much United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) or FedEx (NYSE:FDX). While the iShares Transportation Average ETF (BATS:IYT) is 8% off its recent all-time high, UPS is almost 22% away from its all-time high.There are specific threats that plagued UPS stock like the driver shortage and other operational challenges. But the bigger elephant in the room is the looming threat of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) entering as their competition. This is the most fearsome competitor to have ever existed so the fears are real. But in the end, as demand for delivery services grows, there will be room for all those competing and UPS will adjust.Furthermore, energy prices have been spiking for weeks and that puts pressure on a big line item in the UPS profit and loss statement. But from here, oil is more likely to fall than rise, so there might be relief from that aspect.Also and after the earnings, the UPS stock price fell into a support zone. The area around $102 per share has been pivotal since November 2013. These are areas where bulls and bears agree on price, so on the way down this creates price congestion, which translates into support. This is not a hard line in the sand but it is a cushion that will help the stock find footing. To fall further below it means that the bears have worse news that is not out yet.The bottom line is that UPS is a proven company, so whatever ails the stock is not symptomatic of a sick company. This is a case of a temporarily broken stock but not the company.In summary, often the negative reaction to earnings is an opportunity to buy a great stock. These are three mega caps that are worth owning on dips. But since we still have headline risks looming, traders should not go all in when buying stocks. Doing it in tranches leaves room for error so we can add and lower the entry costs in case the price goes against the trade.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-05-02	2019-05-02 13:10:15	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Walmart Stock Is in a Great Position as the Shipping Wars Get Underway	The war rages on. On Friday, ecommerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced one-day deliveries would be the new norm for Prime members' purchases made at the website. It was a shot mostly at Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which has been making inroads with its online business, sending Walmart stock down nearly 2% as a result. Shares of Target (NYSE:TGT) suffered too.Source: Shutterstock This is not the old Walmart that let Amazon become the behemoth it has become today, however. Almost as if on cue, the world's biggest brick and mortar retailer fired back with pointed if cryptic tweet that implied something even better was in store for Walmart.com shoppers.Investors, and Amazon for that matter, would be wise to take Walmart's warning seriously.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May  Amazon's AnnouncementThe announcement was made in the midst of Friday's earnings conference call, when CFO Brian Olsavsky responded to a cost-related question: &quot;We're currently working on evolving our Prime free two-day shipping program to be a free one-day shipping program.&quot;An unthinkable feat just a few years ago, Amazon has made one-day shipping possible via the buildout of a vast network of warehouses and fulfilment centers. The company now operates 25 sorting centers and 75 fulfillment centers spanned across the better part of the continent.It also operates its own air-freight fleet of 30 delivery jets, and has used technology to establish in-house delivery options like Amazon Logistics to take care of so-called &quot;last mile&quot; work service providers like the U.S. Postal Service and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) can't or won't handle.One-day shipping was an inevitability, given Amazon's past delivery initiatives that included the use of aerial drones and the current utilization of self-employed, contracted drivers.Walmart doesn't have a comparable logistics network. But, it may not need one to hold its own against Amazon. Walmart's ResponseKudos to Walmart for a quick and clever response to Amazon's move. The retailer's official Twitter account posted Friday evening:&quot;One-day free shipping…without a membership fee. Now THAT would be groundbreaking. Stay tuned.&quot;Current and would-be owners of Walmart stock who've stayed tuned have yet to hear exactly what the company meant, although it's not a stretch to interpret the tweet at face value. The retailer will soon offer free one-day shipping on goods sold through Walmart.com and not charge a recurring annual fee for the privilege.Amazon's one-day shipping deal would presumably only be available to Prime members, who pay $119 per year for the service.Don't dismiss the possibility. While Amazon operated 75 fulfillment centers, Walmart operates almost 4,800 stores in the U.S. alone that can effectively serve as a fulfillment center.GlobalData's Managing Director Neil Saunders commented on Walmart's cryptic plans.&quot;The truth is many retailers can go one better: they can offer same-day pickup from stores. It's more cost effective for them, and many consumers actually prefer it to delivery,&quot; he said.Walmart's curbside pickup has indeed been a hit.Saunders adds &quot;Amazon is not so fortunate. It doesn't have stores that can fulfill in this way, so it has to enhance its delivery options for core customers. That's going to come with a hefty price tag, albeit one Amazon can afford.&quot;Walmart has already put such infrastructure in place. The key to one-day shipping is simply accelerating the process.Target, by the way, already offers same-day delivery of goods ordered online. The Bottom Line for Walmart StockIt's not a reason in and of itself to buy Walmart stock, but it certainly bolsters the bullish case.Walmart.com is still well behind Amazon.com in terms of driving online sales, but it's catching up quickly now that relatively new CEO Doug McMillon has made a point of giving e-commerce its due attention.Early this year McMillon explained his vision of expanding the company's online selection as a means of making its online business more profitable now that its growing in earnest. Last quarter's e-commerce revenue grew another 43% year-over-year, extending a long streak of double-digit growth.Stepping up its war with Amazon.com will bite into that budding improvement, but it's an added expense Walmart has room to add. Indeed, Amazon may have just picked a fight with Walmart it can't actually afford to handle.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-01	2019-05-01 23:01:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Jim Cramer: It's Stupid Is as Stupid Does on a Ridiculous Day in the Market	"Sometimes I wish that stocks were just liked or retweeted positively rather than be bought because some of these moves are so breathtakingly stupid and based on nothing that they might as well be social media playthings.  Seriously, on a day like today with the Nasdaq plummeting but the old blue chips hanging in you see lots of stocks moving for no reason whatsoever other than other slim-reed theses that last as long as a tweet or maybe even shorter.  After all our president embarked on a major economic strategy with a few tweets Tuesday, notably criticizing the Fed because it has ""incessantly lifted interest rates even though inflation is very low."" Trump says if the Fed started cutting rates aggressively ""we have the potential to go up like a rocket."" Given the rigorous analysis about the Fed the president's offering, perhaps it makes sense that stocks should go up or down on happenstance."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/dd3ec9c3-2e28-3b78-b428-51d882654889/jim-cramer%3A-it%27s-stupid-is-as.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-05-01	2019-05-01 18:59:31	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	5 Stocks to Sell in May Before Investors Go Away	It's that time of the year again. When the tulips rise, the sun breaks through winter's chill, and the stock market enters what is seasonally a rough patch. Thus, &quot;Sell in May and go away.&quot;The expectation of some price weakness ahead for the stock market is magnified by the historic rally out of the late-December lows, suggesting some profit taking is due. Moreover, corporate earnings growth has slowed, overseas economic data doesn't look great, and geopolitical tensions are rising.According to the folks at the Traders' Almanac, since 1950 the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained an average of just 0.6% between May and October vs. 7.5% between November and April. So there's pretty powerful evidence to suggest investors take some chips off the table.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks That Are Soaring This Earnings Season If so, consider these five names stocks to sell. Harley Davidson (HOG)Shares of motorcycle maker Harley Davidson (NYSE:HOG) have once again fallen below their 50-day moving average, setting up a possible break below a six-month uptrend that was turned just above its 200-day moving average. This comes in the context of a larger downtrend that started in early 2017.The company will next report results on July 23 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.42 per share on revenues of $1.5 billion. When the company last reported on April 23, earnings of 98 cents per share beat estimates by 11 cents on a 10.1% decline in revenues. Foot Locker (FL)Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) shares are dropping below their March lows, threatening to end a three-year-long uptrend that fizzled out near resistance from a breakdown in early 2017. And this continues a pattern of sideways churn going all the way back to late 2014. Analysts at Citigroup recently resumed coverage with a downgrade and a price target cut.  * 5 Biotech Stocks for a Long-Lived Portfolio The company will next report results on May 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.62 per share on revenues of $2.1 billion. When the company last reported on March 1, earnings of $1.56 per share beat estimates by 16 cents on a 2.8% rise in revenues. Electronic Arts (EA)Shares of video game maker Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) were added to this list of stocks to sell when they were unable to break above its 200-day moving average, and is now rolling lower out of a three-month consolidation range near $100. Watch for a possible test of the late December lows, which would be worth a loss of more 20% from here. Investors are feeling a chill as U.S. spending on video games falls sharply from last year.The company will next report results on May 7 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 99 cents per share on revenues of $1.2 billion. When the company last reported on February 5, earnings of 86 cents beat estimates by 20 cents on an 18.4% decline in revenues. UPS (UPS)Transportation stocks have been weak, with UPS (NYSE:UPS) among the victims falling below a six-month trading range to return to lows not seen since late January. This continues a sideways channel that has plagued the name since late 2016. Fears have focused around the uneven strength of the U.S. economy and competitive pressure from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), its most important customer, who continues to widen its direct shipping presence.  * 10 Times Apple's Hardware Failed Consumers -- And Hurt Its Business The company will next report results on July 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.94 per share on revenues of nearly $18 billion. When the company last reported on April 25, earnings of $1.39 missed estimates by four cents on a 0.3% rise in revenues. 3M (MMM)3M (NYSE:MMM) shares suffered a nasty post-earnings selloff last week, dropping 15% from their recent high. The company reported earnings of $2.23 per share, missing estimates by 27 cents on a 5% drop in revenues. Forward guidance was soft as well. Management is focused on the margins, cutting jobs and buying back shares, while the core business suffers from slow growth, extended margins, and structural issues.The company will next report results on July 25 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.19 per share on revenues of $8.2 billion.As of this writing, the author held no positions in the aforementioned securities.

While the vast majority of shipments move without issue, a recent study commissioned by UPS Capital revealed that 92% of shippers experience some type of loss, damage or delay each year1.  Offering transactional shipment insurance across a variety of transportation modes can help mitigate the financial risks of day-to-day supply chain incidents.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-capital-suite-shipping-insurance-130000121.html?.tsrc=rss

Using UPS to Profit from Job Growth and AMZN’s Success	To receive further updates on this  United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) trade as well as an alert when it's time to take profits, sign up for a risk-free trial of Strategic Trader today.We are recommending a bullish position on United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Labor and consumer spending are connected, and both have been maintaining positive trends over the last quarter. This should be good for consumption, even if business spending is flat.We think there are signs that traders are discounting UPS's value because of last month's lackluster earnings report from FedEx (NYSE:FDX). A similar scenario played out last quarter and led to a strong bullish move just prior to and after UPS's earnings were reported in January.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips UPS Has a Different Market from FDXAt first it may seem like the two companies are clones. It makes sense to make estimates about UPS based on FDX's performance. In fact, UPS and FDX have a lot of overlaps, but each dominates in a different part of the delivery industry. FDX focuses on air services and overnight delivery targeted at business (where spending has been flat). UPS is more of a common carrier with a focus on small package delivery.The U.S. economy is largely driven by consumer spending, so UPS's dominant position in package delivery means they grow with hiring, spending and wages. Although wages have also languished, hiring and consumer spending have continued to be very strong. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s sales growth (assisted by UPS's delivery expertise) has been incredible. We expect investors to start pricing those facts into UPS's share price as we get closer to earnings later this month. Breaking Above Resistance at $112UPS broke above resistance (completing a somewhat choppy inverse &quot;head-and-shoulders&quot; pattern) with the rest of the market on April 1. Since then, the stock has pulled back a little.Daily Chart of United Parcel Service (UPS) -- Chart Source: TradingViewWe expect old resistance at $112 to become new support, and we think it will hold as investors price in a surprise for earnings later this month. We recommend selling puts on UPS now that the stock has come back down a bit. If the stock stays above support, we could get to keep the full premium from this trade.To find out which UPS puts we're selling -- and to get access to our full portfolio of income-generating trades -- consider signing up for risk-free trial subscription to Strategic Trader today.

UPS To Roll Out Major Pricing Revamp As It Benefits From Network Efficiency Steps	According to Rob Martinez, CEO of parcel consultancy Shipware, LLC, employees in UPS' revenue management operations, the group that along with its executive leadership manages the company's pricing initiatives, are currently being trained on the new structure.  The result, he explained, has been both a boost in density and a reduction in the company's unit costs as more packages move through a fixed-cost infrastructure.  The savings are likely to be passed on to shippers in the form of lower rates, although some shippers may see rate increases if the company determines that it is not being properly compensated for its true cost to serve, Martinez added.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-roll-major-pricing-revamp-231929356.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-04-08	2019-04-08 17:08:14	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Kohl’s Stock Isn’t a Good Name to Buy and Hold	Analysts are amazed that Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) is surviving in the age of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). But that doesn't mean everyone should be investing in KSS stock.Source:  Hailey Pollard via FlickrThere are reasons to praise KSS CEO Michelle Gass and say she's worth her $12.3 million pay package. But her success is more a reflection of her competitors' failures than anything else.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Everyone's crowing about the company's performance in fiscal 2019, but it showed almost no growth, and reported less net income than in fiscal 2018. Kohl's did cover the $2.68 per share dividend of KSS stock (which was hiked 10% from the previous year) two times over with its earnings, and KSS stock has a handsome yield of 3.78%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut repeating the trick will be a struggle, and the dividend is the only reason to like KSS stock. Kohl's SuccessGass is a former chief of staff at Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), and mother of the &quot;Frappuccino,&quot; which gets the company $3-$5 for what's basically coffee, milk and sugar. She has been with Kohl's since 2013 and became CEO last year.She is already taking bows.Her success starts with Amazon. People can return the products they bought on AMZN at Kohl's stores, which is great when there's no UPS (NYSE:UPS) stores around. In some  Kohl's stores, consumers can buy Amazon merchandise, like Kindle readers.Then there's the downsizing of the stores, a move whose success is uncertain. Parts of ten Kohl's locations will be given to Planet Fitness (NASDAQ:PLNT), and that number could be increased in the future. Parts of Kohl's stores have become Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) outlets.The idea is to make Kohl's a place that suburban women visit regularly. Increase visits and you increase sales. Gass has recognized that clothing is not a destination, that people don't shop as much as buy, that convenience at least gives her a shot at keeping customers.But this is not a strategy of strength. It's built on weakness. Kohl's can no more make it on its own than Penney's can. KSS has too much real estate. The sharing is mainly a way of paring back its commitment to space without closing outlets. Can Kohl's Grow?The question investors should be asking is whether Kohl's can use this strategy to grow.It depends on what you want to grow.Gass was lucky to inherit a retailer with a strong balance sheet, and she has made the balance sheet stronger, cutting Kohl's long-term debt from nearly $2.8 billion to $1.86 billion. This means the company's operating-cash flow, which came in at $2.1 billion last year, can support the dividend and repurchase KSS stock , making its earnings look better. The Bottom Line on KSS StockMichelle Gass is a good retailer, but she&quot;s a better self-promoter. The strategy she has chosen for Kohl's has led to short-term success, but she has yet to demonstrate that it will enable KSS to grow.KSS stock is still a name that investors buy for income. They can buy the dividend but, unlike with some stocks, they shouldn't just sit on it. KSS is navigating through stormy retail seas, and while it's coping with the waves right now, uncertainty is everywhere in retail.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-04-03	2019-04-03 17:44:44	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Buy the Dip in FedEx Stock	Until early March, the transportation sector as measured via the SPDR S TR/S&P TRANSN (NYSEARCA:XTN) exchange-traded fund had been outperforming the S&P 500 Index. In the wake disappointing earnings from FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), which came on top of lowered full-year guidance at the end of 2018, the ETF and the individual stock were both dragged down. Add to that overall concerns of a slowdown in global growth and you are left with a recipe for negative market sentiment across logistics providers as a whole.As we saw with the brick-and-mortar retail sector, macro concerns over their future weighed heavily on the sector throughout late 2017 and early 2018. When the market came to its senses and realized that not all retail stores would go the way of the dodo, companies like Macy's (NYSE:M) rallied sharply -- almost 100%, in Macy's case.Sometimes when the market perceives situations as horrible and things go from there to merely bad, there is serious money to be made.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMajor issues that have been depressing FedEx stock are either priced in or are short-term, providing far-sighted investors with the opportunity to purchase FDX at a reasonable 13 times earnings (historically, north of 15 times would be more in keeping with the norm). Keep in mind that as recently as last October, FDX traded at $240 per share, or 32% higher than current levels. What's Weighing on FedEx StockOne of the macro issues has been the global growth concern. However, China's recent March PMI numbers should assure the market that the world's second-largest economy is not in dire shape by any means. The official PMI number rose to 50.5, representing a 1.3% growth month-over-month. At least for now, global growth based on the manufacturing indicator may be slowing but is not going negative.  * The 8 Best Stocks to Buy for an April Rally A deterioration in global trade would of course hurt FDX disproportionately, but that risk seems largely unfounded based on the PMI data. TNT & AmazonAnother major worry surrounds the TNT acquisition. It may well have been a mistake, but the worse-case scenario is already priced in at current FedEx stock levels -- namely, a lack of profitability and integration issues. I would add that FedEx appeared to be very disciplined in closing that transaction.United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), its primary competitor, was ready to pay almost $7 billion dollars for TNT, where FDX closed the deal $2 billion lower below $5 billion. I suspect patient investors will see FedEx work through the integration pains -- M&A is rarely smooth with such large companies -- and see good returns on capital for their investment in the business.Another worry is that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be entering the space and eating FDX's lunch. This feel likes a broken record playing over and over again. It's what plagued the retail sector, and now that headline risk has shifted to logistics.While transportation and logistics is a growing part of AMZN's business that FedEx investors should not ignore, the threat is not immediate. The scale of both FDX and UPS is not easily replicated. Amazon's existing network is simply not in the same league and would require a huge capital expenditure push, especially in non-metropolitan areas.It's true that AMZN is pushing forward, like the announcement in February about Amazon Air's fleet expansion, but remember that global transportation and logistics is not a finite pie. It can absorb new players on the domestic and international level while allowing for growth among existing players.Ultimately, this play comes down to current valuation. FedEx stock is pricing in a horrible scenario, but the reality is likely to be merely bad, or even not-so-bad-at-all.As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-29	2019-03-29 14:34:58	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	Amazon’s Profits Are About to Surge — Here’s Why	Over the past several years, the biggest knock against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has been valuation. The bears keep saying that the valuation is too rich and that, when growth slows, Amazon's day of reckoning will come. Despite these persistent bearish calls for a cliff-dive in Amazon stock, all the stock has done over the past several years is go higher, mostly because growth hasn't slowed.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business Source: Shutterstock Over the past 5 years, shares are up more than 400%. Bears won't throw in the towel just yet. At 65 times forward earnings, Amazon stock still isn't cheap by traditional standards -- and there are signs that growth is slowing in the company's core e-commerce business now. As a result, bearish calls for a big Amazon stock correction may grow louder in 2019.But make no mistake about it, the bears will throw in the towel soon -- likely within the next five years. Why? Because over the next five years, the robust revenue growth narrative at Amazon will finally be accompanied by an equally robust margin expansion and profit growth narrative. This will create a surge in Amazon's profits, which will allow the stock to grow into its valuation, and head higher while the valuation compresses to more reasonable levels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIndeed, within the next five years, I think Amazon's profit surge will enable AMZN stock to trade at $3,500-plus prices, with just a 25 forward price-to-earnings multiple.Consequently, I believe the next five years for Amazon stock will be defined by a profit surge that silences bears, creates bulls and broadly reaffirms that this stock has the long-term firepower to more than grow into its valuation. Profit Growth Initiatives GaloreEverywhere you look at Amazon, there are signs that this company is on the verge of a huge multi-year upswing in profits. Consider the following:  * Amazon's low-margin e-commerce business has started to slow, and is now growing at a low double-digit rate. Meanwhile, Amazon's high-margin cloud business is growing at a 40%-plus rate, and the high-margin digital advertising business is growing at a triple-digit rate.  * Within the low-margin e-commerce business, Amazon is driving traffic away from CRaP, or &quot;can't realize a profit&quot;, items in an effort to boost retail margins.  * Also within the low-margin e-commerce business, Amazon is rapidly expanding its private-label business. This business has higher margins than the traditional e-retail business, and also has a long runway for growth ahead.  * On the brick-and-mortar front, Amazon is shuttering what are presumably very low-margin pop-up kiosk stores.  * Within the digital advertising segment, Amazon is making a big mobile-ad push, specifically on the video front. Video ads have among the highest margins in the digital ad world and, thus, will be additive to Amazon's already high digital ad margins.  * Within the cloud segment, Amazon continues to grow at a robust pace, including recently scoring big all-in wins from Lyft and Gogo (NASDAQ:GOGO). So long as this segment continues to outpace the e-commerce segment, margins will head higher.  * Amazon's yet-to-be-launched logistics business, much like the cloud and digital advertising businesses, should be additive to margins. Traditional logistics giants UPS (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) operate at high-single-digit operating margins, versus Amazon's aggregate mid-single-digit operating margin.Overall, Amazon is oozing with profit growth potential -- and all of this potential will likely materialize within the next five years. Amazon Stock Can Grow Into Its ValuationIf Amazon's profits surge thanks to the aforementioned margin expansion tailwinds and initiatives, then Amazon stock won't need a big multiple to trade north of $3,500 in the future.Here's the math. Revenues this year (2019) are expected to grow 18% to $275 billion. Next year, they are expected to rise another 18% to $325 billion. Over the subsequent five years, robust expansion in digital advertising, cloud, logistics, pharmacy, offline retail, and private label should keep aggregate revenue growth around 15%. That would put 2025 revenues at around $650 billion.Over the past two years, ramp in the cloud and digital advertising businesses, coupled with increasing scale in the e-retail business, has driven operating margins from narrowly above zero, to over 5%. Into 2025, similar dynamics will unfold at a roughly equivalent pace, implying that 15% operating margins are achievable by 2025.A 15% operating margin on $650 billion in revenues implies operating profits of nearly $100 billion. Taking out 20% for taxes, that equates to a net profit opportunity of nearly $80 billion by 2025. Based on a big growth average 25 forward multiple -- the sort of multiple Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) have -- that implies a market cap of $2 trillion by 2025.Assuming 550 million fully diluted shares, that's a price tag north of $3,500.In other words, thanks to multiple profit-growth tailwinds and initiatives, Amazon stock has an opportunity to hit $3,500-plus prices within the next several years, while only needing a growth average multiple to do so. Bottom Line on AMZN StockThe biggest knock against Amazon stock over the past several years has been the stock's out-sized valuation.This headwind won't last much longer.  * 7 Mid-Cap Growth Stocks That Could Be the Next Amazon or Netflix Over the next several years, Amazon's profits will surge, and as they do, Amazon stock will grow into its valuation. Bears will be silenced. Bulls will gain more control. And Amazon stock will head materially higher.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN, FB, and GOOG.

2019-03-20	2019-03-20 17:48:18	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEx Earnings Signal a Changing World	FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock is on the investing menu today as the &quot;disaster of the day&quot; and it could take the whole market down with it. The shares are off almost $10 today, or over 5%, after announcing disappointing third-quarter results.The Memphis-based delivery company said it earned $739 million, $2.80 per share, on revenues of $17 billion, against earnings of $2.07 billion, $7.59 per share, and revenue of $16.5 billion a year ago.CEO Frederick Smith didn't try to sugarcoat it, calling the numbers &quot;below our expectations.&quot; He promised new investments to lower costs and return to earnings growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnalysts, however, were left scratching their heads. CNN blamed the Trump trade wars, quoting CFO Alan Graf about FedEx Express' lower international revenue.But there could be another explanation. Growing Competition for FedEx Stock?I'm a regular customer of Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN). So are many neighbors. In years past, I got packages from a mix of U.S. Postal Service employees (especially on Sunday), UPS (NYSE:UPS) trucks and FedEx, I'm now seeing white Amazon trucks every day. During the recent Super Bowl in Atlanta, Amazon offered a subtle reminder of this. It brought out a fleet of dark blue vans for delivery. After the game they went back to the plain white ones.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly FedEx is also facing more competition from UPS, its long-time rival. Over the last year UPS stock is up while FDX has lost 28% of its value.Smith himself said he saw &quot;green sprouts&quot; in the international market, although CNBC called the earnings a warning that global growth is slowing.A closer look at the numbers showed a more complex picture.Costs at FedEx Ground were up as the company launched six-day-a-week service and saw higher gas prices. FedEx International revenues were down, in part, due to weaker international currencies. Global profits were down on lower shipment weights and a customer preference for lower-profit services. Graf said the company is taking the usual responses to slowing business, buying out some employees, limiting hiring, and looking at other cost-cutting measures. FDX Stock a Bargain?Investors should be playing FedEx stock for its dividend, not capital gains. Over the last five years, that quarterly dividend has more than tripled, to 65 cents. Even with the latest miss, it's still covered four times by earnings.If you bought FedEx shares five years ago, when they were at about $135 each, you're currently seeing a yield of 5.2% on that investment, dividing the annual dividend of $2.60 per share by its March 20 opening price. The stock's trailing price-to-earnings multiple stands at just 9.4. The company's market cap of $45 billion is around two-thirds of its expected 2019 revenue of $68 billion.By these conventional measures FedEx is a bargain. It's good for the dividend, even with earnings depressed. The company is still forecasting earnings of over $15 per year, with capital spending of $5.6 billion. Those forecasts assume steady U.S. growth and no further international slowdown. The Bottom LineWhen you are buying dividend stocks for retirement, you look for those covering their dividends with earnings and you buy on weakness, when the yield is highest. FedEx has offered a steady stream of dividends since 2002, and they were not even cut during the last recession.For these investors, FedEx's depressed price today is a real bargain.For younger investors seeking fat capital gains, however, you might want to look elsewhere.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

The implied price decline would shave about 69 points off the price of the Dow transports, which would represent about 0.7% of Tuesday&apos;s closing price. J.P. Morgan analyst Brian Ossenbeck downgraded FedEx to neutral, after being at overweight since at least December 2016, and slashed his price target to $202 from $227. Ossenbeck said he is increasingly concerned that margins will be pressured even if FedEx&apos;s ground business can lower costs fast enough to growth profit.

2019-03-18	2019-03-18 17:31:04	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	FedEx Desperately Needs Q3 Report to Be a Winner	If any investors deserve a break, its the owners of FedEx (NYSE:FDX). Despite the 19% rebound from its late-December low, FDX stock is still down by a third of its early 2019 peak. A myriad of factor ranging from a slowing economy to increased competition to tariff wars have collectively worked against FedEx.Shareholders will get a chance at some relief after Tuesday's closing bell rings. That's when the delivery giant is slated to report its fiscal third quarter numbers.For better or worse, expectations are low. Although sales are projected to improve, analysts are expecting earnings to shrink. If the company can't meet or top lowered expectations, though, a renewal of the selloff could easily be in the cards.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Perspective on FDX StockAll things considered, it could be worse. However, without lowering their buy/sell stance on shares, two different analysts have lowered their price targets on FDX stock within the past two weeks.Earlier in the month Citigroup analyst Christian Wetherbee lowered his price target on FedEx stock from $225 to $210, explaining &quot;We are factoring in a softer outlook for Express related to slower International trends and ongoing profit headwinds from the TNT integration, as well as somewhat lower profit growth at Freight.&quot;  * 7 Small-Cap Stocks That Make the Grade Cowen's Helane Becker lowered her target from $242 to $237, citing an operating environment that's unusually tough. Becker believes Brexit-related woes could weigh on FedEx's International Express unit.Most analysts remain optimistic for the long-haul though. Becker is excited about recent management changes, and anticipates annual earnings growth of between 10% and 15% for the next few years. Wetherbee, who maintains his &quot;buy&quot; rating, noted &quot;real clarity may not be achieved until the company provides a full accounting of TNT, including potentially a write-down, and lays out fiscal [2020] targets in June.&quot;Stephens analyst Jack Atkins is also hopeful for the long haul, pointing out that cost reductions and scaled-back spending plans for 2020 could be used as catalysts to rekindle what Becker considers a stock with a &quot;depressed&quot; forward-looking valuation. It's All About ExpensesThe analysts' discussions are a microcosm of the confusion shareholders face heading into Tuesday's third-quarter report, scheduled for release after the market closes.As of the latest look, analysts are collectively calling for sales of $17.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year. But, those same pros anticipate earnings of only $3.17 per share, down from the $3.72 per share of FDX stock booked in the same quarter a year earlier.The relative success or failure of the company for the quarter that ended in February will largely hinge on expense management.Those headwinds have been blowing for a while, with ongoing pressure from rival United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) remaining in place, but with e-commerce titan Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) now handling more of its own delivery work.The swell of resistance prompted CFO Alan Graf to concede a quarter earlier &quot;These trends, coupled with the change in service mix at FedEx Express, are negatively impacting the segment's financial results.&quot; He added, however, &quot;We remain committed to actively managing costs with a heightened focus on increasing efficiency across the organization.&quot;The effort to achieve efficiency and cut costs is in contrast with investments from FedEx as well as UPS to increase capacity. Noteworthy how disparate the results of its different divisions -- Freight, TNT, Express, etc -- have been, and will likely continue to be. Looking Ahead for FedEx StockWhile challenges remain, at a forward-looking P/E of 10, those challenges may already be fully factored into the price of FDX stock.Investors expecting Amazon to act on the often-rumored acquisition of FedEx, however, may not want to hold their breath. Aside from the company's $47 billion price tag and the potential antitrust concerns such a deal could spawn, culturally and logistically, the two entities aren't an ideal fit. Such a pairing would certainly help Amazon solve its &quot;last mile&quot; problem, but integration and wrestling control of FedEx away from founder and CEO would be significant if not impossible hurdles to clear…… not that the matter would come up during the earnings call, except perhaps in the Q&A portion after official statements from the company are made.Whatever's in the cards on the acquisition front, investors have to assume FedEx will have to grow its way out of its current slump. That's not happening in a big way just yet. For the year now underway, analysts are modeling a per-share profit of $15.99, up modestly from the year-ago bottom line of $15.31.Cost-management will remain critical for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Fifth Fatal Crash in 10 Years Revives Concern About Cargo Planes	While no cause has been identified for that crash, which killed all three people aboard, it has revived concerns that safety standards for such things as mandatory sleep breaks for pilots or fire safety regulations are more lax on the cargo airlines than their passenger counterparts.

Instead, the company says that it will be expanding its business to work with other shippers, such as UPS (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX).&quot;At this point we've decided to discontinue our shipping partnership with the USPS so that we can fully embrace partnerships with other carriers who we think will be well-positioned to win in the shipping business in the next five years,&quot; Kenneth Mcbride, Chairman and CEO of Stamps.com, said in a statement obtained by CNBC.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat may be most damaging about this Stamps.com news is what it does to the company's outlook for 2019. Stamps.com says that it is only expecting earnings per share between $5.15 to $6.15. for the year.That may not seem bad at first, but putting it in perspective really shows why STMP stock is falling so hard today. The company's earnings per share for the full year of 2018 came in at $11.78. This change will also have it easily missing Wall Street's earnings per share estimate of $10.79 for the full year of 2019.  * 9 High-Growth Stocks to Buy Now for Monster Returns The Stamps.com news also includes its revenue guidance for 2019. The company is expecting revenue for the year to come in between $540 million and $570 million. This is also a blow to STMP stock by being well below analysts' revenue estimate of $685.40. million for the full year of 2019.STMP stock was down 56% as of noon Friday.

FedEx and UPS stocks sink, after analyst says Amazon taking business in-house could weigh	Shares of FedEx Corp.  sank 3.0% and United Parcel Service Inc.  shed 1.3% in midday trade Friday, bucking the gains seen in the broader market, after fellow transportation company XPO Logisitics Inc.  said its largest customer is curtailing about two-thirds of its postal injection business. XPO declined to comment on who the customer was, but J.P. Morgan analyst Brian Ossenbeck said the loss of business is likely Amazon.com Inc.  taking capacity in-house.

2019-01-30	2019-01-30 20:12:36	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	5 Industrial Stocks to Buy	"In 2018, even the brightest industrial stocks weren't the best stocks for investors. The industrial sector had a rough year, as concerns about China and potentially slowing growth led investors to flee the space.

Indeed, as Barron's pointed out, the S&P 500 Industrial Sector Index lost 16% in 2018 -- erasing some $350 billion in market value. So far, however, 2019 has been better. The index is up over 9% already YTD, as cyclical concerns have faded.

Those concerns may rear their head again -- and investors still need to be cautious with the sector. But for those investors who are looking for the best industrial stocks, these five all fit the bill.

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



And with some help from the broad market and the economy as a whole, this time around they could be big winners for the rest of the year -- and beyond.

### 3M (MMM)

The case for 3M (NYSE:MMM) is pretty simple. The diversified manufacturer has been one of the best buy-and-hold industrial stocks in the market for years now. 3M isn't immune to the economic cycle, to be sure, but over its 117-year history, it has seen all sorts of economic environments.

No matter what has come, over most multiyear periods, MMM stock has delivered market-beating, double-digit annual returns. Of late, however, that hasn't been the case. MMM has pulled back from early 2018 highs -- and actually is down about 22% over the past year.

But after a solid Q4 report on Tuesday morning, 3M looks to be on track. And under $200, the stock trades at a reasonable 18.5x the midpoint of 2019 EPS guidance. A 2.8% dividend adds income as well.

MMM isn't going to be a torrid grower. But I've recommended it in the past as one of the best stocks to buy for young retirees -- and at this price, investors of all ages at least should take a long look.

### GMS (GMS)

Drywall and building products distributor GMS (NYSE:GMS) was hammered in 2018, as were many housing-related plays. But GMS stock, along with the sector as the whole, has started to recover in 2019. And there's more room to run, one reason GMS is one of my largest personal positions.

There are risks here. GMS has a heavily indebted balance sheet. It has exposure to new residential construction -- which already has slowed noticeably -- and commercial construction -- which could slow if the economy turns.

But there are real rewards here, too. I highlighted GMS last year as a small-cap stock that could double, and at $19, that's still the case. The stock trades at less than 6x forward EPS estimates, and growth and margin expansion have continued of late. GMS is looking to pay down debt, which should further de-risk the story and help the equity value going forward.

  * 7 High-Dividend Stocks Yielding More Than 5% (Plus a Bonus) 



Again, caution needs to be exercised here: this is a high-risk play. But the valuation and the opportunity for further growth, multiple expansion and deleveraging mean that GMS could be one of the best stocks in the market, particularly if investors get more aggressive in 2019.

### United Parcel Service (UPS)

Investors simply don't trust United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) anymore, and with some reason. UPS stock basically has been &quot;dead money&quot; for five years now. Long-running worries remain that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) eventually will compete with both UPS and rival FedEx (NYSE:FDX).

But it seems too early to write UPS off just yet. Earnings still are growing. A massive capital spending boost catalyzed by tax reform should drive savings in the future. And a 3.6% dividend yield should continue to rise for at least the next few years.

Here, too, there are risks. A macro downturn wouldn't help the cause, and Amazon is a worthy competitor should it more aggressively enter the space. But at around 13x earnings, at least some of those risks are priced in. And there's reason to think UPS, near the lower end of its multiyear range, should have at least one more rally in it.

### DowDuPont (DWDP)

In December, I called DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP) one of 15 2018 losers that would be among the best stocks for 2019. And indeed, DWDP has bounced nicely, rising almost 20% off December lows and almost 12% so far in 2019.

At $58, the gains likely aren't over. DowDuPont still has value to unlock as it breaks itself up into three companies in the coming years. Index moves and investor impatience likely led to at least some of the selling pressure in 2018 (though cyclical worries about the chemical sector didn't help), which should further ease in 2019-2020 as the process plays out.

  * 7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019 



It's worth remembering that investors cheered the initial plans, only to forget about their benefits amid growing concerns about macro growth. As investors are reminded of the opportunity -- and perhaps become less worried about the risks -- DWDP should continue to climb.

### Honeywell (HON)

Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) executed a pair of spinoffs itself last year, distributing shares of Resideo Technologies (NYSE:REZI) and Garrett Motion (NYSE:GTX). Since the spins, and amid the saga at rival General Electric (NYSE:GE), HON stock seems almost forgotten.

It shouldn't be. Even the slimmer Honeywell looks like one of the premier industrial stocks in the market. Valuation isn't compelling perhaps, with HON trading at 18x forward EPS and yielding 2.3%. But Honeywell continues to grow nicely, and its diversified portfolio (both in terms of products and geographies) provides some protection to upheaval in individual markets.

Like 3M, Honeywell is going to trade with the cycle -- and that's a risk. But like MMM, HON stock has been a long-term outperformer. For investors who still trust the cycle and are looking for a set-it-and-forget-it type of play, Honeywell stock might be the right choice.

As of this writing, Vince Martin is long shares of GMS Inc. He has no positions in any other securities mentioned.

This morning I am recommending a bullish trade on United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), the package delivery company.

The transportation sector, as represented by the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (NYSEARCA:XTN) has recovered nicely from its December lows, and UPS has followed. I think there's one major factor at play.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Falling Oil Prices

I mentioned in another trade recommendation that oil prices are low because of increased production and falling demand. Well, thanks to production cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, prices have recovered slightly, as you can see in the chart below.

Daily Chart of Crude Oil Futures -- Chart Source: TradingView

But in that chart you'll also see some resistance at around the $55 level. When I recommended a bearish trade on Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE), I said that production cuts won't protect oil prices against slowing demand.

Considering this overhead resistance at the $55 level, I don't expect oil prices to break out in the short term.

Lower oil prices help transportation stocks like UPS cut their costs. They spend less on fuel for their trucks. If oil prices remain low, UPS's share price could keep going up.

### Overcoming Resistance

Looking at the daily chart, we see some resistance at UPS's 50-day moving average (MA). The stock gapped up on Friday and tapped its 50-day MA yesterday before closing just under $103.

Daily Chart of United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) -- Chart Source: TradingView

Even as oil prices recovered in January, UPS has continued rising. I think there is a strong fundamental outlook for the stock, and if it overcomes resistance at the 50-day MA, it could keep going. We could make a big profit off a bullish play, so I'm recommending a calendar call debit spread.

Using a spread order, buy to open the UPS Mar. 15th $105 call and sell to open the UPS Feb. 15th $106 call for a net debit of about $1.00.

A debit spread is simply a way to lower the cost of buying options, as the option that you sell to open (short) helps offset the cost of the option that you buy to open. Therefore, this call debit spread is a way to lower the cost of buying bullish call options. Many brokers will require the use of margin and/or a set amount of reserved capital to execute a debit spread; contact your broker directly for specific requirements.

### NYSE:UPS

View full report here!

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is negative 
  * ETFs holding this stock are seeing positive inflows 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for UPS with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting UPS.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Positive

ETF activity is positive. Over the last month, growth of ETFs holding UPS is favorable, with net inflows of $21.97 billion. This is among the highest net inflows seen over the last one-year and the rate of additional inflows appears to be increasing.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Negative

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Industrials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Negative

The current level displays a negative indicator. UPS credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels for the past 1 year, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

The world's biggest package delivery firm - known for  eliminating most left turns on routes as part of a years-long  effort to cut driver miles, fuel use and accident risks -  expects to have the new UPSNav technology in most of its U.S.  drivers' hands by 2020.  The move comes as UPS and rivals ranging from FedEx Corp  and the U.S. Post Office to Amazon.com Inc's  logistics unit grapple with surging e-commerce deliveries and  the high cost of taking goods the ""last mile"" to shopper  doorsteps."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-navigation-tool-aims-save-144812580.html?.tsrc=rss

[$$] UPS, FedEx tumble as analyst warns of Amazon Air risk	shares on Tuesday, as Morgan Stanley warned that investors have yet to fully account for growing competition from the ecommerce giant’s freight delivery service.  Amazon has sought to expand its own shipping operations, both on the ground and in the air, to cut freight costs and speed up deliveries of its customers’ orders.  The moves — in addition to an order of 20,000 Mercedes-Benz vans for ground deliveries — could reduce Amazon’s reliance on logistics companies such as UPS and FedEx, whose networks have been strained by growing ecommerce shipments.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3b4f3885-2f1d-39a7-8047-3b7ed61b9963/%5B%24%24%5D-ups%2C-fedex-tumble-as.html?.tsrc=rss

2018-10-19	2018-10-19 18:28:09	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	The 25 Biggest U.S. IPOs of All Time	"Initial public offerings (IPOs) are the process companies use to tap the public stock markets for capital. They usually involve early-stage businesses that are looking for fresh fuel for growth; many are small opportunities, but a few have mammoth potential. IPOs aren&apos;t guaranteed tickets to riches, as implosions such as Pets.com and Webvan proved. But they can produce explosive returns, and in a hurry. Through the end of September, 38 offerings had produced returns of 50% or more. One thing 2018 has lacked, however, is the mega-deal - an offering such as Facebook (FB) or Alibaba (BABA) that sets the world on fire. That should change in 2019.  Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of ride-hailing service Uber, says the company expects to execute an IPO next year. &quot;Uber is a widely known brand that connects with millions of consumers and they have also received large amounts of capital from investors over the years,&quot; says Scott Coyle, CEO of ClickIPO, an online platform that allows retail investors to purchase IPOs. No wonder then, that 
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> reported that proposals from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley valued the company at more than $120 billion. Given that IPOs often raise about 10% to 15% of their projected worth, that could be a $12 billion-$18 billion raise. Where would that rank among America&apos;s biggest IPOs? Today we&apos;ll look back on the 25 biggest deals in U.S. history, as measured by money raised.

2018-09-10	2018-09-10 15:56:40	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	6 Companies That Invest in Themselves	For most of the past decade, investors have embraced the idea that companies should pay them first--via fat dividend checks or stock buybacks that bump up investors&apos; share of company profits--rather than funneling cash back into the business. But investors are starting to get jazzed about capital spending, too, whether it&apos;s the opening of a new data center, the retooling of an aging manufacturing plant, or increased spending on tech to boost competitiveness and help a business grow. Since the start of 2016, a basket of stocks of companies investing the most for growth--which includes capital expenditures (or &quot;capex&quot;), and research and development, have gained a cumulative 63%, compared with just 34% for firms that are returning cash to shareholders, according to Goldman Sachs data through early July. Capital expenditures are on the upswing as many companies take advantage of savings from a lower tax rate and a more favorable depreciation schedule. The increase is not surprising, considering that the average age of corporate &quot;fixed&quot; assets--buildings, equipment, office furniture and the like--is now 16.3 years old, according to Strategas Securities. The last time assets were that old was back in the 1960s. For 2018, capex spending by S&P 500 companies could climb to an estimated $690 billion, up 10% from 2017 and the highest dollar amount since 2014, predicts Goldman Sachs. That makes it a good time to buy into companies that are investing in themselves, like these six firms SEE ALSO: 53 Best Dividend Stocks for 2018 and Beyond	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-companies-invest-themselves-144617617.html?.tsrc=rss

( FDX) this year, things are beginning to look up for United Parcel Service Inc. ( UPS).  By up, we mean the stock could rise 30% based on the $137 price target given by Bernstein analyst David Vernon, who is optimistic about the company’s recent agreement with the Teamsters labor union that he thinks will contribute to slower wage growth.  In recent negotiations with the Teamsters union, UPS secured a deal that would limit the number of hybrid drivers (i.e.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8cc60a7d-0f1a-310e-b3e6-f3b8248561e9/why-ups-stock-can-rise-30%25.html?.tsrc=rss

( FDX) are down 10.7% and 8.3% respectively in the first half of 2018, compared to the S&P 500's 2.3% gain over the same period.  Last week, Seattle-based e-commerce giant Amazon launched a program to support entrepreneurs launching local delivery startups.  In June, UPS announced a five-year contract with the Teamsters union, potentially paving the way for Sunday delivery, increased employee pay and offers of more flexibility within UPS's cost structure by adding ""hybrid drivers."" While new hybrid drivers have been a source of contention between the parties, Bernstein's David Vernon writes that an agreement to limit the growth of them to 25% of the total number of full-time carriers is better than expected."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8394dcd4-14c4-31ec-a3b2-5a5806b5b986/ups%2C-fedex-to-outperform%3A.html?.tsrc=rss

First, UPS: The company announced an agreement late last month with its Teamsters union, and while we have scant details on that ongoing negotiation, Vernon writes that we are getting more information about hybrid drivers, one of the bones of contention between the two parties.  UPS and the Teamsters agreed to protect existing full-time package jobs and limit growth of hybrid drivers to 25% of the total number of full-time carriers, which Vernon writes is better than he hoped, and that Sunday delivery options are in the works for the future.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5d7a7edf-4935-3769-ae24-b3e1f845006f/ups%2C-fedex-shares-carry-upside.html?.tsrc=rss

The program gives entrepreneurs, i.e. Amazon Delivery Service Providers (DSPs) a management fee to hire drivers, rather than Amazon doing it directly.  Naturally, United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) fell on the news, as investors fret about Amazon turning from blessing to curse for the delivery giants.

FedEx Earnings: Delivering Disappointment	Shares of FedEx (FDX) fell on Wednesday, following the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings report—but are things really as bad as the Street seems to think?

During the company's conference call, FedEx shaved $100 million off its capital expenditure guidance, to $5.8 billion, and it also boosted its U.S. economic outlook to 3% for the year, up from 2%.	http://finance.yahoo.com/r/68fb9622-8f32-38ad-b2bf-887cc6229c2e/fedex-earnings-the-whole-package-1521668191?mod=yahoobarrons&ru=yahoo&yptr=yahoo&.tsrc=rss

2018-03-06	2018-03-06 16:20:00	UPS	United Parcel Service, Inc.	UPS Can Still Pack a Punch	Shares of United Parcel Service (UPS) are climbing on Tuesday, thanks to an upgrade from Stifel.  Analyst David Ross raised his rating on the stock to Buy from Hold, although he lowered his price target by $6, to $121.* He writes that the move comes after the stock's recent selloff, which he believes has made an attractive entry point for investors.  Ross thinks that the package and general freight markets both remain strong, and that assuming that Amazon.com (AMZN) remains a big and profitable customer--and that UPS's teamsters don't go on strike or gain significantly higher pay in their long-term contract negotiations this summer--UPS looks oversold.  The Amazon news hit peer FedEx (FDX) as well, on worries that it could push down package pricing, but analysts also see those concerns as overblown.  Stifel isn't the first firm to argue that UPS's selloff is overdone (although others are less convinced).	http://finance.yahoo.com/r/0c5d9cb1-500e-37dc-9b67-d8bc718a08bc/ups-can-still-pack-a-punch-1520353251?mod=yahoobarrons&ru=yahoo&yptr=yahoo&.tsrc=rss
