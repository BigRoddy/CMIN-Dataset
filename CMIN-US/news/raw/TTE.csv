Moody's expects the company to maintain its strong credit metrics, with a low gross debt to assets ratio of around 30% and a fixed-charge coverage ratio (FCC) above 4x.  The pandemic has further enhanced occupier demand, driving growth in asset value and market rent, which has supported TBBR's credit metrics as the company drew on its credit facilities as it increased its capital spending on developments.  The rating agency believes that TBBR's operating environment will remain strong over the next 12-18 months considering the currently unfulfilled occupier demand, the supply constraints stemming from land scarcity, long planning processes, and high investments required, and continued investor appetite for the asset class in the UK.The company relies on drawing capacity under its committed revolving credit facilities (RCFs), supplemented by periodic equity raises, to fund its growing development pipeline with a targeted average annual spend of GBP200-250 million over the medium term.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tritax-big-box-reit-plc-103008109.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-09	2021-03-09 21:57:00	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	APA Corporation Provides Update on Keskesi East-1 Discovery Well in Block 58 Offshore Suriname; Drillship to be Released as Planned	HOUSTON, March 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- APA Corporation (Nasdaq: APA) and Total S.A. (NYSE: TOT) today updated the operational status of the Keskesi East-1 discovery well offshore Suriname. As announced on Jan. 14, 2021, Keskesi East-1 discovered oil, volatile oil and condensate in the Upper Cretaceous-aged Campanian and Santonian intervals and, subsequently, continued drilling toward deeper Neocomian-aged targets. As drilling progressed, the well encountered substantial pressure increases that APA and Total determined could ultimately exceed the capabilities of the wellbore design and pressure control equipment. Consequently, the partners decided to conclude drilling operations at Keskesi before reaching the Neocomian targets. Information gathered from this well will be used to design a wellbore and drilling program that will ensure a safe test of the deep Neocomian targets in future exploration and/or appraisal operations. The additional drilling at the Keskesi East-1 well encountered hydrocarbons in the Lower Cretaceous interval and a carbonate depositional system above the top Neocomian target, both of which help to validate the partners’ geologic models. While encouraging, this data does not reveal specific information about the Neocomian targets themselves. With the completion of operations at Keskesi East-1, the Noble Sam Croft drillship will be released as planned. Pursuant to the terms of its joint venture agreement, APA transferred operatorship of Block 58 to Total S.A. on Jan. 1, 2021. APA holds a 50% working interest in Block 58 and Total holds the remaining 50% working interest. About APA APA Corporation, through its consolidated subsidiaries, explores for and produces oil and gas with operations in the United States, Egypt and the United Kingdom and exploration activities offshore Suriname.

Here is Benzinga's preview of the company's release. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Sell-side analysts expect Total's EPS to be near $0.43 on sales of $39.32 billion. In the same quarter last year, Total announced EPS of $1.19 on revenue of $49.28 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on TOT The Wall Street estimate would represent a 63.87% decline in the company's earnings. Sales would be down 20.21% from the same quarter last year. In comparison to analyst estimates in the past, here is how the company's reported EPS stacks up: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 0.03 -0.19 0.66 0.98 EPS Actual 0.29 0.02 0.66 1.19 Revenue Estimate 39.36 B 39.25 B 39.41 B 36.06 B Revenue Actual 33.14 B 25.73 B 43.87 B 49.28 B Stock Performance Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 12.88%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders won't be happy going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Total is scheduled to hold the call at 08:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.

2021-01-19	2021-01-19 11:31:55	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	Oil Giant Total Inks $2.5B Deal For 20% Stake In India’s Adani; Shares Gain	Total SA has inked an agreement to buy a 20% stake in the world’s largest solar developer, for $2.5 billion as the French energy giant shifts to renewable energy production. Shares rose 2% in Tuesday’s pre-market trading. Total (TOT) said that the investment in India’s infrastructure platform, Adani Green Energy, includes investments in LNG terminals, gas utility business, and renewable assets across the region. As part of the agreement, the French energy company will get a 50% stake in Adina’s portfolio of operating solar assets. Going forward, Total and Adani seek to position themselves at the forefront of India’s shift to renewable energy. For Total, the partnership with Adani will be a key contributor to the company’s target of reaching 35 gigawatts of renewable power capacity by 2025 and adding 10 GW per year afterwards. “This agreement is an important step in our alliance with the Adani Group in India and our common vision and goals with respect to the importance of access to low carbon energy in India,” Total CEO Patrick Pouyanné commented. “Given the size of the market, India is the right place to put into action our energy transition strategy based on two pillars: renewables and natural gas.” In a separate statement, Total announced that it has issued €3 billion in perpetual subordinated bonds, out of which, €1.7 billion will be allocated for the acquisition of the Adani stake. The remainder of the proceeds from the bonds will be used to finance its development strategy in general, and acquisitions in renewables, in particular. “With a weighted average coupon of 1.875%, this issuance that was very well received by investors will allow the Group to finance its development in renewables at a reduced capital cost,” Total said. As part of its goal to get to net zero by 2050, Total is building a portfolio of renewables and electricity businesses that could account for up to 40% of its sales by 2050. At the end of 2020, the French energy giant had global gross power generation capacity of 12 GW, including close to 7 GW of renewable energy. Shares in Total have been hit hard dropping almost 19% over the past year as the coronavirus pandemic pushed energy prices down and significantly impacted demand. Looking ahead, the average analyst price target stands at $50.10 and implies 13% upside potential to current levels. Scotiabank analyst Paul Cheng recently lifted the stock’s price target to $46 from $44 amid expectations that major oil stocks are set for a recovery as oil prices rebound. Although the analyst has a positive outlook on the large oil companies, he maintained a Hold rating on TOT for now. Overall, Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus shows 2 Buy ratings versus 4 Hold ratings.

It’s been a terribly challenging market for the commodity and other fossil fuels the past several years. But 2020 has taken the proverbial cake.
Production wars, a global pandemic wrecking further havoc on weakening demand trends and Wall Street’s optimistic knack to price in an alternative energy future utopia have crushed oil stocks. One need look no further than the spring’s sub-zero futures pricing for a product once known as black gold.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). In oil’s place, these stocks and many others within the broader alternatives market have flourished. Some like Tesla have even rightfully become household names. And it could always get worse for fossil fuels and oil stocks, but extinction?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Despite increasingly possible and more competitive greener alternatives, even with wider consumer approval of a carbon free energy market, the reality is oil, even in a pandemic, is still everywhere. Petroleum-based products drive more than just our cars, it’s in all sorts of household goods, including our toothpaste.
The arguments against oil investment are well known. But when it comes to the fossil fuel industry right now, off and on the price charts, hedged spread strategies look like a solid opportunity for today’s investors entering 2021.


					7 Retail Stocks That Will Benefit From 2020’s Holiday Shopping Season				

Here are 3 big oil stocks to bull trade today:
Chevron (NYSE:CVX)
Total SE (NYSE:TOT)
Enbridge (NYSE:ENB)
I wouldn’t say it’s time to back up the truck in oil stocks. But given Pfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) and Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) very promising Covid-19 drugs, tomorrow may be a bit more like yesterday, in a good way. And along with encouraging price charts and a partisan Congress intent to stop any packaged Green New Deal dead in its tracks, hedged contrarian positions in the following three oil stocks looks like a good cause bullish investors can get behind.

Oil Stocks to Buy: Chevron (CVX)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The first of our oil stocks to buy is Chevron. The blue-chip is now the only Dow Jones component with exposure to the energy sector following an August decision by index administrators to reduce industry exposure and replace Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) with software giant Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).
The Dow decision was in large part based on XOM’s lower stock price as the index’s construction is price-weighted. But it’s also common knowledge CVX stock has slightly superior fundamentals. CVX has also helped its shareholders by making a smart decision this year to reduce its dividend and move more aggressively to cut costs.
Technically, Chevron’s advantages are now being complimented by a price chart demonstrating sure signs of bottoming. After a somewhat iffy undercut double bottom which broke trend support in March, shares of this oil stock have formed a well-supported higher-low pattern. Coupled with a monthly candlestick price confirmation this month and bullish stochastics setup, CVX is an oil stock to buy today.
Favored Strategy: January $72.50 / $90 collar

Total SE (TOT)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The next stock of our oil stocks to buy is Total SE. U.S. investors may not be familiar with Total; unlike Chevron, you won’t find this French-based, ‘supermajor’ oil company’s gas stations in your neighborhood. But if investors are interested in parking some capital in the energy space, it may prove a big mistake to exclude TOT stock.
Aside from a fairly strong balance sheet and well-supported dividend like Chevron, Total has shown a genuine commitment to making renewables part of its energy business. Notably, the company wants to generate 15% of its energy sales vis-à-vis “electrons” rather than fossil fuels by 2030. It also maintains a long-term interest as the largest investor in U.S. solar outfit SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR).
In lieu of Total’s greener ambitions, TOT offers a modest hedge away from the fossil fuel market and maybe even larger exposure towards renewables for investors buying this particular oil stock today. Technically, Total is fairly interchangeable with what’s transpired in CVX this year. And again, that price action is looking bullish for investors with an eye on the road ahead.

Favored Strategy: Long February $35 / $45 collar

Enbridge (ENB)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The last of our oil stocks to buy are shares of Enbridge. ENB is another international outfit, and a less familiar but very influential player in the industry.  Based in Canada, this company is one of the largest midstream outfits in North America. And by the looks of last week’s stronger-than-expected Q3 results, in spite of the challenging environment, Enbridge is doing a lot of things right, which has both analysts and investors paying attention.
Technically, shares of ENB have weathered a battered fossil fuel market better than most and performed decidedly stronger than CVX and TOT the past few years. It hasn’t always been pretty of course and as with its peers, March was particularly ruthless for shareholders. But this oil stock has formed a more commanding bullish high-level double bottom base on the price chart since peaking in late 2014 alongside the top in the oil market.
One minor cause for concern right now is how Enbridge’s stochastics have turned lower in oversold territory. Price action has also pulled back inside a monthly pullback pattern that was confirmed this month. However, given the larger pattern’s bullish tendencies, a slightly shorter-term collar, which can be restructured to offset some of today’s technical uncertainty, looks like a good way to approach this oil stock.
Favored Strategy: December $27.50 / $30 collar

(NYSE: TOT) today provided an update to the technical evaluation of the Kwaskwasi-1 discovery well offshore Suriname.  As previously announced, Kwaskwasi-1 discovered hydrocarbons in multiple stacked targets in the upper Cretaceous-aged Campanian and Santonian intervals. The well encountered 278 meters (912 feet) of net oil and volatile oil/gas condensate pay. The shallower Campanian interval contains 63 meters (207 feet) of net oil pay and 86 meters (282 feet) of net volatile oil/gas condensate pay. The Santonian interval contains 129 meters (423 feet) of net pay. Fluid samples from the Campanian validated the presence of oil with API gravities between 34 and 43 degrees.Since the discovery announcement on July 29, 2020, the Noble Sam Croft drillship has gathered reservoir and other technical data in the Santonian. The company was able to successfully retrieve rotary sidewall cores but was unable to collect representative fluid samples from the reservoir due to conditions caused by cementing operations, which were required to mitigate increased pressure below the base of the Santonian formation. Hydrocarbon shows were observed in the Santonian reservoirs, and the results of the formation evaluation indicate the presence of oil.The Noble Sam Croft has commenced operations at the Keskesi East-1 exploration well approximately 14 kilometers (9 miles) southeast of Sapakara West-1. The Keskesi well will test upper Cretaceous targets in the Campanian and Santonian.Apache holds a 50% working interest in Block 58 and will continue to be the operator through the completion of the Keskesi well. Total S.A. holds the remaining 50% working interest.About ApacheApache Corporation is an oil and gas exploration and production company with operations in the United States, Egypt and the United Kingdom and exploration activities offshore Suriname.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “continues,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “guidance,” “may,” “might,” “outlook,” “possibly,” “potential,” “projects,” “prospects,” “should,” “will,” “would,” and similar references to future periods, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future plans, expectations and objectives for Apache’s operations, including statements about our capital plans, drilling plans, production expectations, asset sales, and monetizations. While forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and analyses made by us that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, whether actual results and developments will meet our expectations and predictions depend on a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results, performance, and financial condition to differ materially from our expectations. See &quot;Risk Factors&quot; in our 2019 Form 10-K and in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&quot;SEC&quot;) for a discussion of risk factors that affect our business. Any forward-looking statement made by Apache in this news release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Apache undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future development or otherwise, except as may be required by law.Cautionary note to investors  The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable, and possible reserves that meet the SEC's definitions for such terms. Apache may use certain terms in this release, such as &quot;resources,&quot; &quot;potential resources,&quot; &quot;resource potential,&quot; &quot;estimated net reserves,&quot; &quot;recoverable reserves,&quot; and other similar terms that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit Apache from including in filings with the SEC. Such terms do not take into account the certainty of resource recovery, which is contingent on exploration success, technical improvements in drilling access, commerciality and other factors, and are therefore not indicative of expected future resource recovery and should not be relied upon.

Todd raised his rating on BP and Shell to Overweight from Neutral, while lowering his rating on  (CVX) (CVX) to Neutral.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d80cc2a5-33c7-37ea-9f13-db9729bc3e51/want-to-make-money-on-oil.html?.tsrc=rss

The Mero field is located 180 kilometers off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, in the prolific pre-salt area of the Santos Basin.The move comes after the decision to develop the Mero 1 vessel, which is expected to start operating in 2021 and the Mero 2 vessel slated to begin operating in 2023. Both of which have a liquid processing capacity of 180,000 barrels per day.“The decision to launch Mero 3 marks a new milestone in the large-scale development of the vast oil resources of the Mero field – estimated at 3 to 4 billion barrels. It is in line with Total's growth strategy in Brazil’s deep-offshore, based on giant projects enabling production at competitive cost, resilient in the face of oil price volatility,” said Arnaud Breuillac, Total’s President of Exploration & Production. “The Mero project will contribute to the group’s production from 2020 onwards, and we are targeting a production of 150,000 barrels per day in Brazil by 2025.”The Mero field has been in pre-production since 2017 with the 50,000-barrel-per-day Pioneiro de Libra FPSO. The Libra consortium is operated by Petrobras (40%) as part of an international partnership including Total (20%), Shell Brasil (20%), CNOOC Limited (10%) and CNPC (10%).Total has been present in Brazil for over 40 years and has more than 3,000 employees in the country. The energy company, which produces and markets fuels, natural gas and low-carbone electricity, has 100,000 employees and is active in more than 130 countries.Shares in Total have been hard hit dropping 29% so far this year as the coronavirus pandemic pushed oil prices down, while energy demand is weak. Looking ahead, the $49.14 average analyst price target forecasts 24% upside potential in the shares in the next 12 months.Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd today raised the stock’s price target to $50 (27% upside potential) from $47 and maintained a Buy rating.Overall, Wall Street analysts share Todd’s bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy consensus rating shows 6 Buy ratings versus 1 Hold rating.

But that's where we are with Graf Industrial (NYSE:GRAF). GRAF stock has been getting a lot of attention lately.Source: Shutterstock No doubt, there are special circumstances in play here.Graf is what's known as a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). These so-called blank-check companies have no operations at all but are created in the short term with the plans to merge with a private enterprise to take it public.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAccording to SPACInsider, 43 SPACs have gone the IPO route so far this year, and 59 companies did so last year, including sports betting site DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) and Richard Branson's effort to privatize space flight with Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE).  * 15 Growth Stocks That Are Being Propped Up By Low Rates Graf raised $225 million in its IPO in 2018. Things got a little interesting in mid-April, when Graf issued a news release announcing it was negotiating with a polypropylene recycling company to take it public.The company was later identified as PureCycle Technologies. Graf spoke glowingly about what it called a groundbreaking recycling process that separates contaminants from plastic waste &quot;to transform into virgin-like resin.&quot;If you read the materials, you would think that Graf was all-in on plastics recycling and that the company had a true passion for green efforts that made its collaboration with PureCycle a natural fit.But the deal fell apart. Just a month after Graf's announcement, PureCycle was celebrating a new partnership it signed with Total (NYSE:TOT). That's a deal that actually makes sense because both PureCycle and Total are in the plastics business.And like a spurned lover, Graf went off looking for a new suitor. Now it's found one. A Cloer Look at GRAF StockThe new company that's caught Graf's wandering eye is Velodyne Lidar, which is a pioneer in driver-assistance technology that is already backed by Ford (NYSE:F), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Nikon (OTCMKTS:NINOY).The companies announced their partnership on July 2, in which Velodyne will emerge as a wholly-owned subsidiary. After the deal closes in the third quarter of this ear, Graf would be renamed Velodyne Lidar and be listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker VLDR.Velodyne founder David Hall and its initial investors will retain an equity interest of 83% in the new company, which is expected to have an initial market cap of $1.8 billion.Velodyne is best known for making radar-like systems for self-driving vehicles. The technology, known as lidar, involves using lasers to generate 3-D images of the environment, and is already used by Ford and Mercedes-Benz.Velodyne CEO Anand Gopalan said the Graf deal will pay off for investors.&quot;Partnering with Graf Industrial will provide the opportunity to enhance our leading position in the lidar and sensor markets broadly around the world, creating new and exciting opportunities for our customers and employees. We will continue to focus on executing our strategic plan to deliver strong and disciplined growth, while realizing attractivThe Vale returns through prudent capital management.&quot;Graf stock, which was at around $10 per share six weeks ago, is now around $17.50. The Bottom Line on Graf StockThe self-driving vehicle business is certainly more attractive than plastic recycling. And it's a lucrative business.Marketwatch reports that the self-driving car market is expected to expand by a compound annual growth rate of 36% through 2023, resulting in revenue of $173 billion.There's no doubt that Velodyne will be an interesting business when it launches, but I'm also confident that there's no value to be made between now and when the deal launches and VLDR stock hits the exchange.For now, investors are advised to sit this one out. VLDR is a name to watch when we head into the fourth quarter.Patrick Sanders is a freelance writer and editor in Maryland, and from 2015 to 2019 was head of the investment advice section at U.S. News & World Report.

2020-07-06	2020-07-06 04:00:00	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	As Big Oil Stumbles, Total Manages to Stay on Its Feet	(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s oil giants came into 2020 promising shareholders they can “do it all” -- maintain generous dividends, keep the crude flowing and make a historic shift toward clean energy. Only one of them may succeed.Since the coronavirus pandemic wiped out oil demand, Royal Dutch Shell Plc shocked investors with its first dividend cut since the Second World War, while BP Plc announced 10,000 jobs cuts and the sale of its chemical business as debt soared. But Total SA has so far weathered the storm, and investors are confident Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne can avoid his rivals’ stumbles.They see the French company as an early adopter of clean energy, with multi-billion investments in solar, wind and batteries, but also a rare haven in an industry shattered by the slump in energy prices.“Total has probably the best balance sheet among the majors,” having spent its money wisely in recent years, said Laurent van Tuyckom, who manages high-dividend funds at Degroof Petercam Asset Management in Brussels. “We’re much more cautious on other heavyweights of the industry.”Total has taken steps to mitigate the effect of the downturn. It has cut costs, suspended a plan to increase its dividend by 5% to 6% per year, halted share buybacks, and given investors the option of taking the final quarterly dividend for 2019 in shares instead of cash. It also announced a plan to eliminate 1,000 jobs in France at a petrochemicals unit, and potentially more abroad.Those measures will save $7.5 billion this year, meaning the company can fund its major oil and gas projects, invest as much as $2 billion in low-carbon assets and keep paying its dividend even if oil remains at about $40 a barrel, Pouyanne has said. The payout will rise again when the economic situation has normalized, maybe from 2022, he said.Asset managers are confident Total can maintain its payout until the markets starts to recover. Most investors seem to agree, as the French company has the lowest dividend yield among its European peers, even after Shell’s two-thirds cut.Its peers are not so well placed. Eni Spa’s dividend is “more challenged than most peers at lower commodity prices,” said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Europe Ltd. JPMorgan said a cut to BP’s dividend is “well flagged”, particularly after Shell’s cut in April.Total can defend its dividend “even in an adverse scenario which would see the barrel staying around $40” said Regis Longlade, deputy chief executive officer of AG2R La Mondiale Gestion d’Actifs, which owns shares in Total and Shell. “It’s one of the most robust investment case in the industry. Total has one of the lowest breakevens in the market.”Total now needs less than $25 a barrel to cover its annual expenditure excluding the dividend payment, a drop of more than 75% compared to what it needed back in 2014. It is benefiting from spending cuts initiated since the previous down turn five years ago and investments in low-cost barrels. Its upstream operating expenditure has almost halved since 2014 to $5.4 a barrel, the lowest among the five supermajors, according to Total. Its gearing -- a measure of indebtedness -- has also halved.Writedown WoesYet Total may not be immune to another feature of the current downturn -- multibillion dollar asset writedowns. Last month, BP announced as much as $17.5 billion of charges, its biggest in a decade, saying it expects the pandemic to accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy. Shell soon followed, warning that it expected a writedown of $15 billion to $22 billion.“BP has made a major step forwards with its writedowns and the issue of financial risks linked with fossil energies,” said Aurelie Baudhuin, head of socially responsible investing research at Meeschaert Asset Management. “That will inevitably spill over to the entire industry one way or another.”Total should follow that example, by giving more details on its roadmap to net zero emissions, and broaden its ambitions to incorporate a worldwide scope, said Baudhuin. Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship, EOS at Federated Hermes also wants Total to follow BP, which “recently changed their management and accounting assumptions to be consistent with a Paris-aligned outlook on demand.”More Work NeededPouyanne is keeping pace with his rivals in the transition to clean energy. While Shell has set the ambition of becoming the world’s biggest power producer in 2030, Total has spent billions on electricity assets and plans to have more than 25 gigawatts of gross renewable generation capacity by 2025. It is targeting carbon neutrality for all its production and energy products used by its customers in Europe by 2050 or earlier.Total bought French battery maker Saft Groupe SA in a 950 million-euro ($1 billion) deal in 2016. It further diversified into power in 2018 with the 2-billion euro acquisition of Direct Energie SA, France’s third-largest utility. It recently announced plans to build batteries for electric vehicles in France and China, expanded in the power sector in Spain, India and Qatar, and announced its first deal in offshore wind in the North Sea.All these factors make Total one of the most attractive investments in the industry, especially since it trades at a discount to its peers, said AG2R’s Longlade.“Its low breakeven, its gearing among the lowest in the industry, and the ability of its management to adjust quickly to the crisis would justify that Total trades at a premium,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-stumbles-total-manages-040000899.html?.tsrc=rss

They’re guarding Africa’s biggest investment: a $23 billion project to export Mozambique’s natural gas from an area increasingly besieged by an Islamist insurgency.Companies led by Total SA will pump the gas from wells about 40 kilometers (25 miles) offshore, cool it to temperatures below minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit so that it turns to liquid, then ship it to electricity plants from France to China. The consortium is about to finalize almost $16 billion in project financing -- another record for the continent.“The work is immense,” said Ronan Bescond, the 44-year-old French chemical engineer who Total chose to lead the project after a career of nearly two decades at the company. “The first cargo of LNG must be in 2024. And we are on the right track,” he said to a handful of reporters in a prefabricated room at the site 32 kilometers south of the Rovuma River that marks the border with Tanzania.The obstacles facing a project that’s expected to transform the impoverished southeast African nation are huge.To achieve the target of first production for an undertaking worth billions of dollars more than Mozambique’s entire economy, developers need to move thousands of tons of equipment through territory thick with Islamic State-aligned insurgents. At one stage, a Covid-19 outbreak saw the Total site accounting for three in four of the country’s confirmed infections. All this as natural-gas prices plunged to near 25-year lows.Militants who first pledged allegiance to IS in 2018 have carried out increasingly brazen attacks this year.Deadly RaidLast week, they raided Mocimboa da Praia for a third time, and occupied the town for as long as three days. It’s a crucial supply hub just 60 kilometers south of the project site and the closest port.At least eight workers for Total subcontractors Fenix Construction Services Lda died when their vehicle was ambushed in the attack, the company said in a statement. Three workers are still missing, it said.Before the gas discoveries and insurgency, the remote coastline was more famous for luxury tropical island resorts. Last month, one of the nearby hotels offered a discount price of $19,820 a night to hire out an island as a refuge from the coronavirus.The private military company that Mozambique hired in April to provide air support to government troops in the form of helicopters fitted with machine guns has struggled to quell the violence. Lionel Dyck, the founder of Dyck Advisory Group, the firm the government employed, declined to comment when contacted by mobile phone.IS WarningGovernments including South Africa, the U.S. and Portugal have indicated willingness to help fight the insurgency.“The insurgency is a challenge but we’re happy that our defense and security forces have been playing their role,” Max Tonela, Mozambique’s energy and natural resources minister, told reporters during the June 19 site visit. “We all as Mozambicans must fight against this evil that comes from external attacks.”About 1,300 people have died in the violence, with a further 220,000 displaced since the first attack three years ago, which also took place at Mocimboa da Praia.For the second time, IS referred directly to the projects in a weekly newsletter this month. The group said that it would be “delusional” to think that the government could protect the investments, and warned other countries against getting involved.The marginalization of young men in a region that’s predominantly Muslim and 1,900 kilometers away from the capital, Maputo, has helped lead to radicalization that’s fueled the insurgency, according to researchers including Saide Habibe at the Maputo-based Institute of Social and Economic Studies who have studied the origins of the fighters.Total’s project will hire 14,000 people at peak construction, of which at least 5,000 will be Mozambican and many from the region, Bescond said at the briefing, wearing a surgical mask, as all visitors to the site must do to prevent another outbreak of the coronavirus.The financial rewards are worth the cost to the government of the soldiers patrolling the vast compound and snipers on its perimeter fence -- Total’s estimate is $50 billion in direct and indirect revenue over 25 years for the $15 billion economy.(Updates with details of attack in eighth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/africa-biggest-investment-takes-shape-040000814.html?.tsrc=rss

BP's dividend now yields over 10%. That seems to be hugely attractive for a large, diversified oil company.Source: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com Indeed, that yield is the highest among the largest oil producers, even for investors willing to look overseas for oil stocks. The dividends of Italy's Eni S.p.A. (NYSE:E) and France's Total S.A. (NYSE:TOT) are close to that of BP, but neither European company's yield is over 10%.The market, however, is aware of BP's dividend and is pricing BP stock accordingly. This isn't a case where investors have a wonderful opportunity to get double-digit annual returns, excluding share-price appreciation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRather, the BP stock price implies a very real expectation of a dividend cut. News last week suggests that such a cut is likely to occur -- and could arrive in a hurry. A Massive WritedownIn a press release last week, BP detailed its rather muted outlook for global oil prices. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the industry is well-known: oil futures even briefly went negative in April.  * 10 Consumer Stocks to Buy to Ride the Post-Covid-19 Wave But BP expects the pandemic to have a long-term impact as well. As the company wrote:bp's management also has a growing expectation that the aftermath of the pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system, as countries seek to 'build back better' so that their economies will be more resilient in the future.And so BP lowered its long-term outlook for oil and gas prices. For Brent crude, the company now expects prices of $55 per barrel, versus its previous forecast of $70. And BP now predicts that Henry Hub natural gas prices will stay below $3 per mm Btu (million British Thermal Units).That more negative view of the future will lead to significant charges in the present. BP anticipates that its second-quarter results will include impairment charges totaling $13 billion to $17.5 billion.That's obviously a huge sum. And it suggests that there will be significant near-term pressures on BP's dividend. A Dividend at RiskThe writedown will significantly reduce BP's equity. That, in turn, will increase its &quot;gearing,&quot; or its ratio of equity to debt.As one analyst told Bloomberg, BP's gearing could near 50% after the writedown. That may become the highest such figure among the large oil firms.More importantly from a near-term perspective, the figure is well above BP's long-term target of just 20% to 30%. And so it seems likely that debt reduction will become a priority for the company.The problem is that, in this environment, it's exceedingly difficult for BP to cut debt. Its 2020 cash flows are taking a hit from depressed oil prices. Asset sales will be difficult for the company at a time when nearly every other oil producer is looking to protect its own balance sheet. And the writeoff itself suggests that BP has significant acreage where drilling won't make economic sense in this &quot;new normal.&quot;That leaves a dividend cut  and cutting explorations budgets as the only near-term debt- reduction strategies. BP's dividend distributions cost over $8 billion annually. That means the company can at least start to tackle its debt load, which was $51.4 billion net of cash at the end of Q1, by cutting its dividend.The reason BP stock has a dividend yield of over 10% is not because the market isn't paying attention. It's because investors believe, for good reason, that a dividend cut is on the way. The Case for BP StockAll that said, I'm not completely bearish on BP stock. I've recommended the name in the past. And it's possible that the selloff went too far.One blunt way to make that argument is to compare the writedown to the decline of BP stock so far this year. The $17.5 billion figure at the high end of the projected writedown range sounds enormous. But BP stock has lost about $45 billion of market value so far this year.For several reasons, it's too simplistic to argue that the size of the writedown should match the decline of the company's market capitalization. But an investor can argue that lower oil prices are priced into the shares,  at least to some extent. Meanwhile, oil bulls might see BP's higher debt load as a relatively positive: it could cause the shares to climb further if BP's updated projections prove too conservative.Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) still seems to have significant strategic questions and a lengthening history of substandard returns. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is a solid operator, but its stock probably is the most expensive among the large oil producers  across a variety of metrics.So there's a case for BP stock as a nice combination of execution (which had been solid since the Deepwater Horizon tragedy) and value at these levels.But that case can't include the dividend. Not at this point. BP's dividend is at significant risk, and investors should prepare accordingly.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

The French energy company has been speaking with potential advisers about a divestment, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.Arkema SA has separately started gauging interest in its plexiglass business, which could fetch about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) for the French chemical producer, people familiar with the matter said. The company has sent potential bidders so-called teaser documents with an overview of the Altuglas International division, according to the people.Companies have been seeking to offload peripheral businesses in a bid to boost returns and fend off criticism from activist investors. Carveouts by European companies hit a record last year and could rise further in 2020 as firms seek to weather the after-effects of the coronavirus pandemic, a top Credit Suisse Group AG dealmaker said last week.Streamlining OperationsSome chemical producers have been able to ride through the crisis relatively unscathed, particularly those making products like cleaning solvents and protective sheets which are seeing increased sales. A gauge of European chemical companies has risen 1.8% over the past 12 months, bucking the 5.4% decline in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Solvay SA is also exploring a sale of two units as Chief Executive Officer Ilham Kadri pushes ahead with efforts to streamline the Belgian chemical maker, people with knowledge of the matter said. The potential divestments include a unit that works with the compound strontium carbonate, which could fetch around 150 million euros, and another making chemicals used in shampoo and dishwashing products, the people said.The volume of dealmaking globally has fallen 47% this year to $991 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Some shelved deal processes have been revived in recent weeks, with Bridgepoint preparing to restart a bidding process for Iberian agrochemical business Rovensa, Bloomberg News reported this month.Sasol SaleArkema’s Altuglas sale is attracting initial interest from private equity firms including Advent International, Rhone, SK Capital Partners and Triton Partners, the people said. The business produces polymethyl methacrylate-based plastics, which are used in car parts like headlights as well as building materials. Colombes, France-based Arkema hasn’t decided when to seek first-round bids and could wait until after summer to formally solicit offers, one of the people said.Beyond Europe, Sasol Ltd. is attracting interest in a large stake it’s selling in the Lake Charles chemical complex in the U.S. The South African company has received offers from Ineos Group Ltd., Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. and LyondellBasell Industries NV for the holding, which could fetch more than $2 billion, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.All the companies’ deliberations are at an early stage, and there’s no certainty the suitors will submit bids, the people said.Representatives for Total, Arkema, Advent, Rhone, SK and Triton declined to comment. A spokesman for Solvay said the chemical group has a clear plan to unlock value and regularly receives approaches, particularly after last year’s strategy update. He declined to comment further. A spokesman for Sasol said the firm’s asset disposal process had yielded “good interest from strong contenders.”(Updates with index performance in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-solvay-pursue-chemical-divestments-135811397.html?.tsrc=rss

This comes in the middle of earnings season, and results there have been, as expected, grim. On a positive note, however, investors seem to be taking the bad news in stride. There’s a general belief that the COVID-19 epidemic and its effects are now baked in – that we know the worst is happening, but we also know it’s temporary. As several states move toward reopening and loosening lockdown restrictions, with some encouragement from the Trump Administration, investors are starting to look toward 2H20. Whether a recovery will be a steep V-shape, or a shallower slope is up for debate, but anticipation of a recovery helps to buoy market sentiment.The upshot here is mixed signals. Macroeconomic signs – the jobs report, the earnings results – are flashing bright warning lights that we are in a recessionary event. But at the same time, investor sentiment – which is by nature forward looking – is generally positive and is boosting the main stock indexes. It’s potentially a buying environment, as long as investors don’t mind shouldering the clear risks.We’ve opened up the TipRanks database, finding three stocks whose profile justifies the entry risk in today’s unsettled conditions. All three have recently beaten their earnings forecast, and are backed by several analysts, enough to earn a “strong buy” consensus rating. And better yet, for income-minded investors, all three of these stocks show high and reliable dividend yields. Fidelity National Financial (FNF)First on our list is a $7 billion player in the mortgage industry. Fidelity National Financial provides analysis, leverage, title insurance, and underwriting services in the commercial and residential mortgage service market. 2019 was a good year for FNF – the company beat the earnings estimates in each quarter of the year.Fidelity has started 2020 on a similar note, with a strong Q1 earnings report, that beat the forecast and grew substantially year-over-year. EPS came in at 73 cents, 32% above the estimates and up an impressive 69% from Q1 2019. The earnings were more than enough to cover Fidelity’s quarterly dividend of 33 cents per share. At $1.32 annualized, this dividend yields 5.1%, more than 2.5x the average dividend found among S&P listed companies. Fidelity has been gradually growing its dividend for the past two and a half years. The payout ratio of 45% indicates that the dividend is safe – current earnings easily cover it, and there is plenty of room for further growth.Reviewing this stock for Stephens, 5-star analyst John Campbell sees a clear path forward: “…we continue to favor FNF as we believe that it offers up the best/most attractive title franchise valuation, it has a clear catalyst with the potential significant FGL accretion, and it has the best operators at the wheel as the industry ventures into what is likely to be a treacherous NT road ahead.”Campbell’s Buy rating is accompanied by a $43 price target that suggests a 69% upside potential for the stock. (To watch Campbell’s track record, click here)FNF shares have underperformed the markets so far this year. The stock is down 45%. But after the strong earnings, this makes the stock attractive – it is priced at a discount, has plenty of room to grow, and offers a high dividend return.Fidelity National’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold set in recent weeks. This stock is currently trading for $25.35, and the average price target of $37 implies an upside of 46%. (See FNF stock analysis on TipRanks)First American Financial (FAF)Next up on our list is an insurance service company, First American Financial. FAF specializes in title and lenders insurance, as well as property and casualty policies. The company also deals with asset dispositions, commercial due process, foreclosures, and trustee services. While these services are hardly household essentials, they are mainstays of the financial world, and FAF brought in $6.2 billion in top-line revenue in fiscal 2019.While First American’s Q1 earnings fell sequentially by 41%, the $1.06 reported beat the forecast by over 10%. It was also up 43% yoy. Revenues were also up year-over-year, by 8.4% to $1.4 billion.The solid earnings underly a reliable 44-cent quarterly dividend that FAF has raised 3 times in the past four years. The payment annualizes to $1.76, and gives a yield of 3.8%, nearly four times higher than can be found in Treasury bonds.Writing for Compass Point, analyst Chris Gamaitoni writes, “We continue to believe that First American's ability to confidently guide to profitability in this environment coupled with a low-risk balance sheet and benefiting from refinance volume will lead it to appreciate as a ""safe haven"" in the current environment.”Gamaitoni’s $74 price target indicates a 60% upside and bolsters his Buy rating on the stock. (To watch Gamaitoni’s track record, click here)All in all, First American has received 5 analyst reviews in recent months, including 4 Buys and 1 Hold, making the consensus rating a Strong Buy. FAF shares are selling for $46.38 and have an average price target of $58.60, more cautious than Gamaitoni’s but still suggesting a healthy 26%. (See First American stock analysis at TipRanks)Total SA (TOT)The final stock on our list is a giant of the oil industry. Total SA boasts a $90 billion market cap, even after falling 29% in the current bear cycle. The company shows the high revenues and profits typical of Big Oil, with an annual top line exceeding $200 billion and earning above $11 billion. Even the current period of low prices won’t fully derail TOT’s overall performance; the company is big enough to pad the hit, and the product always has a market.Slack demand in Q1 did have an impact on earnings, however. The 66 cents per share was 20% higher than expected, although it was down 44% year-over-year. On a positive note, Q1 was the third consecutive quarter that saw earnings beat expectations.Total SA pays out a reliable dividend to shareholders, and even though market conditions are volatile the company announced an increase in the dividend payment effective in Q2. The new payment, 74.75 cents per share quarterly, will annualize to $2.99 and give a yield of 8.5%. The recently announced dividend increase is a sign that company management is confident in their ability to continue returning profits to shareholders. It is also a good sign for investors interested in an oil play.Ryan Todd, of Piper Sandler, sees Total SA as well-positioned for future gains. He writes, “…while the release was largely devoid of transformative updates, a further pruning of FY20 capex and opex targets, a relatively more constructive near-term downstream outlook, and operational momentum following its 1Q beat should be enough given the relative underperformance in the equity vs. its European peers over the last month.”Todd puts a $45 price target on TOT shares, along with a Buy rating. His target implies an upside potential of 29%. (To watch Todd’s track record, click here)Wall Street’s analyst corps has sent in 9 reviews on TOT, with a breakdown of 8 Buys to 1 Hold. The stock has an average price target of $43.52, which suggests a 25% premium from the $34.81 current trading price.

The oil company’s Board of Directors declared an interim dividend stable at 0.66 euros per share, adding that it will be paid in cash exclusively. Shares rose 3.9% to $34.87 in pre-market U.S. trading.“The Group is facing exceptional circumstances: the Covid-19 health crisis, which is affecting the world economy and creating major uncertainties, and the oil market crisis, with the sharp drop in oil prices since March,” said Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanné. “In an environment where prices fell by more than 30% on average during the first quarter, the Group’s cash flow decreased by 31% year-on-year to $4.5 billion and return on equity stood at 9.8%.Pouyanné said that Total now anticipates 2020 production between 2.95 and 3 Mboe/d, a reduction of at least 5% from 2020 forecasts, reflecting the voluntary curtailment measures in Canada, the exceptional quotas announced by OPEC, lower local demand for gas and the situation in Libya. In addition, plant utilization rates and sales have been on average 50% below normal since mid-March, with uncertainty about the timing of a return to normal, he said.Retail network sales were down 10% year-on-year due to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis. To combat the oil price crisis triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, Total on March 23, announced an action plan to cut its planned investments for 2020 by more than 20% to $15 billion.

2020-05-05	2020-05-05 09:01:10	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	Oil Giant Total Targets Carbon Neutrality in 2050	(Bloomberg) -- Total SA set out bolder commitments to eliminate most of its carbon emissions by 2050, while curbing spending on oil and gas projects due to the crude-price slump.The French company’s commitment to invest more in clean energy, despite a sharp drop in profit as the coronavirus hammers fuel demand, illustrates the enduring pressure on oil giants from investors and society to tackle long-term environmental challenges.After a weak round of first-quarter earnings, oil supermajors have been forced to slash spending, curb production and even reduce their dividends in some cases. It could get worse in the months ahead as the public health crisis destroys as much as a third of global energy demand.“While responsibly taking on the short-term challenges, the group continues to implement its medium and long-term strategy,” Chief Executive officer Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement on Tuesday.Total’s shares rose 6% to 32.32 euros at 10:22 a.m. in Paris, almost three times the gain in France’s benchmark index.Playing CatchupTotal has invested billions of dollars in recent years in batteries, wind and solar energy, but it is also catching up with European rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Repsol SA, which have already set ambitious climate targets.The French company aims to have net-zero emissions from its own worldwide operations, known as scope 1 and 2, by 2050 or sooner. It’s targeting carbon neutrality for all its production and energy products used by its customers in Europe -- known as scope 3 emissions -- by 2050 or earlier.Total wants to cut the average carbon intensity of energy products used worldwide by its customers by at least 60% by 2050, with intermediate steps of 15% by 2030 and 35% by 2040.That’s similar to pledges made by its European peers, who have also reiterated their commitment to the transition to clean energy despite being under immense financial pressure due to a historic slump in oil and gas prices.Total, which currently allocates more than 10% of its capital expenditure to low carbon electricity, will increase that share to 20% by 2030 or sooner.The company had stakes in 3 gigawatts of renewable-power capacity at the end of last year, and is targeting 25 gigawatts by 2025. It recently took stakes in giant solar projects in India and Qatar, and has expanded clean power in Spain, the U.K. and France.Oil CutsTotal’s first-quarter adjusted net income fell 35% from a year earlier to $1.78 billion, the company based near Paris said. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast $1.57 billion on average.To ease financial pressures, the company decided to reduce its overall investments this year to below $14 billion, down from a March target of less than $15 billion and a February target of $18 billion. The company maintained its goal of spending as much as $2 billion in low-carbon power in 2020.It will cut operational spending by more than $1 billion, a deeper reduction than a target of $800 million set back in March, and expects to save at least another $1 billion in energy costs.Total also offered to pay part of its final 2019 dividend of 68 euro cents in shares, known as the scrip, rather than cash. It set the first quarter dividend at 66 euro cents, unchanged from a year earlier.“The key questions are how long Total intends to utilize a scrip dividend for, and also how far it is willing to push the balance sheet to maintain the dividend as it stands,” RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria wrote in a note. “While this is not ideal, and clearly destroys value over the long term –- given the recent sell-off, we think the market will take some relief in Total not cutting its headline dividends like peer Shell.”Royal Dutch Shell Plc last week surprised the market by reducing its payout for the first time since at least the Second World War. Norway’s Equinor ASA also slashed its dividend and Exxon Mobil Corp. froze it for the first time in 13 years.Citing lower global demand and the turmoil in Libya, the company now expects oil and gas production of between 2.95 million and 3 million of barrels per day, a reduction of at least 5% from its initial forecast.Liquefied natural gas deliveries may be deferred in the second and third quarters, while the drop in oil prices will hurt long-term LNG contract prices from the second half, Total said.“Given the actions that Total is taking, we see the company as being well-positioned to weather the downturn,” Lydia Rainforth, analyst at Barclays, wrote in a note.(Updates with analyst comment on scrip dividend in 16th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-giant-total-targets-carbon-063615361.html?.tsrc=rss

To be sure, there are plenty of things to be worried about: Evidence of a prolonged economic shutdown, chaos in the energy markets, and concerns a quick fix for Covid-19 is not forthcoming. None of this has helped the energy stocks.As a result, a number of dividend stocks look vulnerable here as a prolonged economic disruption increases the likelihood of payout cuts and further selling pressure.Here are four I think investors should avoid at all costs:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A)  * Petrochina (NYSE:PTR)  * Total SA (NYSE:TOT)  * BP(NYSE:BP)Now let's delve into exactly what makes each of these energy stocks a bad pick right now. Dividend Energy Stocks at Risk: Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-A, RDS-B)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comShares of Royal Dutch Shell are languishing below their 50-day moving average, looking set for a retest of their mid-March lows as crude oil prices continue to suffer amid a global oversupply situation. Shares currently pay nearly an 11% dividend, but that doesn't look likely to persist as wells are capped and production volume falls as storage tanks top off.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week The company will next report results on April 30 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 56 cents per share on revenues of $55 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 30, earnings of 74 cents per share missed estimates of 80 cents on a 19% drop in revenue. Petrochina (PTR)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comShares of Petrochina as also drifting lower after suffering a 35% decline from their early January high and capping a drop of nearly 60% from the highs set in late 2018. Shares were recently downgraded to ""sell"" by analysts at Citigroup. JPMorgan also recently downgraded to ""neutral."" Currently, the stock pays a 6.7% dividend yield.The company reported fiscal 2019 results in late March, with revenues rising 6% year-over-year. The company recently pulled its capital spending targets for the first time since 2015 amid a volatile and uncertain environment. Last year, the company spent nearly $42 billion, up 12.5% over the prior year. Total (TOT)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comTotal shares, which currently pay a dividend yield of 8.4%, are following a similar pattern to the others shown here, failing to retake its 50-day moving average. Cowen's Jason Gabelman recently warned that Total along with BP had the highest exposure to probable production cuts -- at roughly 8% vs. 4%. So, earnings could be very sensitive to top-line swings in output that could affect payout ratios.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip Separately, the company along with Apache announced a significant oil discovery at its Sapakara West-1 well offshore Suriname, a project that is jointly owned. The project drills to a depth of 20,700 feet. Shares were recently downgraded to ""neutral"" by analysts at Morgan Stanley. BP (BP)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comBP shares, which pay a 10.8% dividend, are also currently below their 50-day moving average and look vulnerable to a return to the mid-March low which would be worth a loss of 30% from here. Not only is the company heavily exposed to production cuts, but the Wall Street Journal recently reported that the $5.6 billion sale of some of its assets to Hilcorp Energy is threatened by a drop in liquidity and fears over the health of the energy industry.The company will next report results on April 28 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 25 cents per share on revenues of $79.6 billion. When the company last reported on Feb. 4, earnings of 13 cents per share beat estimates by three cents on a 6% drop in revenues from the prior year.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-25	2020-02-25 15:46:37	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	Total Hiring to Boost Offshore Wind Teams in Denmark and U.K.	(Bloomberg) -- French energy company Total SA is hiring in the U.K. and Denmark to prepare to compete for government contracts for offshore wind farms.The move adds to evidence of oil majors seeking to enter the wind business as governments everywhere look to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and spur cleaner forms of energy.The Paris-based company is preparing to bid into an auction due to start later this year for an offshore wind farm in Denmark with an expected cost of about 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion), according to a job post on the company’s website. Giant renewable-power projects at sea are drawing increased interest from energy companies of all kinds, especially oil majors that are attracted by the scale of investment and security of returns.Total has spearheaded the oil industry’s move into renewables by pushing more than $5 billion in technologies from batteries to onshore wind and solar farms since 2015. It has yet to win an offshore wind tender.The French company had stakes in 3 gigawatts of renewable-power capacity at the end of last year. It’s seeking to double that in 2020 and targets 25 gigawatts by 2025.The Danish project, known as Thor, is set to be between 800 megawatts and 1,000 megawatts, located about 20 kilometers (12 miles) off Denmark’s west coast in the North Sea. Developers who want to bid for the project will qualify later this year and then submit bids.Total is also hiring a number of people in the U.K., with job descriptions that include design and engineering for fixed-bottom or floating offshore wind projects in the U.K. and internationally. Last year, Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said the company planned to participate in an upcoming auction for offshore wind sites in Scotland.A spokesperson for Total had no immediate comment. &#92;--With assistance from Francois de Beaupuy.To contact the reporter on this story: William Mathis in London at wmathis2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net, Lars PaulssonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-hiring-boost-offshore-wind-154637269.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-13	2020-02-13 14:01:31	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	Piper Sandler: These 3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Have Plenty of Growth Ahead	Markets started 2020 with a 5% gain on the S&P 500. It's a fine cap to start the year, but will it last? Not so sure; Wall Street is predicting a far more modest run in 2020, with the end-year targets averaging just a 2% gain.The outlook reflects relative risk assessment, rather than depression. With the coronavirus outbreak, and a US Presidential election just nine months away, 2020 is starting out with plenty of uncertainty on the horizon.That uncertainty has investors worried, and when investors get worried they look for a safety net in their investment strategy. It’s a draw that naturally pulls them to dividend stocks. Dividend stocks don’t offer the same high share appreciation as growth stocks, but they do offer a steady income stream. And when markets are volatile, a steady income stream is a hot commodity.With this in mind, analysts from Minnesota-based investment firm Piper Sandler have tagged three energy stocks as particularly noteworthy, offering investors a valuable combination of high dividends, and even higher upsides. Using the Stock Comparison tool from TipRanks, we can look at these three tickers, side by side, comparing their attributes. All are Buy-rated with dividend payouts exceeding 5%, and show an upside between 20% and 45%.Black Stone Minerals (BSM)We’ll start with Black Stone, a Houston-based oil and gas exploration and development company. Black Stone controls over 20 million acres across 40 states, but the bulk of its operations are in the South (Alabama-Mississippi, Louisiana-Arkansas, Texas-Oklahoma) and the Northern Plains (Montana-North Dakota). The company also has a presence in the Appalachian gas fields of Pennsylvania and West Virginia.Black Stone’s ability to continue making money in the current environment was clear in the last quarterly report. The company beat the earnings forecast by 10%, reporting 32 cents per share on revenues of $137.4 million. The free cash flow reached $89.2 million, marking the fifth quarter in a row of FCF gains. BSM reports Q4 2019 on February 24 and is expected to show 26 cents EPS.Investors should note the rising FCF. Black Stone has used that money, at least in part, to fund a high dividend. The company pays out 30 cents per share quarterly, or $1.20 annually, which may not sound like much – but the yield is impressive at 11.4%. That’s almost 6 times the average yield among S&P companies. The payout ratio is 93%, indicating that BSM pays back most of its profits to shareholders – and that the payment is sustainable in current conditions.Piper Sandler analyst Pearce Hammond looks at BSM in the context of the gas industry generally, and draws a bullish conclusion. He writes, “While natural gas headwinds might intensify further in coming months, we believe this negativity is largely reflected in the unit price and there is a favorable risk/reward tradeoff... Most important, nothing cures low prices like low prices, and we expect declining natural gas drilling combined with further demand growth to result in improving natural gas s/d fundamentals over the next twelve months.”In short, Hammond sees BSM in position to grow this year, and puts an $18 price target behind his Buy rating. That target indicates a 75% upside potential. (To watch Hammond’s track record, click here)Black Stone’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is derived from 2 recent Buy reviews – and 3 Holds. Opinions are mixed on this stock, but note that even the low-ball price target estimate is higher than the current share price. The average target, $14.90, suggests room for 45% upside growth. (See Black Stone stock analysis on TipRanks)BP PLC (BP)Our next stock is a $123 billion staple of the oil industry, BP. This is the sixth largest oil and gas company globally, and brought in over $300 billion in calendar 2018 revenues. The low prices plaguing the industry through 2019 pushed hard on the bottom line, however, and BP’s 2019 profits were down 21%.At the same time, despite the slip, the $10 billion profit reported beat the forecast of $9.7 billion. Looking ahead, there are indications that production cuts by OPEC – in the range of 500,000 barrels per day – could help improve the supply-demand situation in 2020. Should OPEC be successful in its moves to push prices back toward $60 per barrel, companies like BP would see immediate gains. That would be a welcome change from the 13% price drop in Brent crude over the past 12 months.Despite the low prices and decline in profits, BP has maintained its dividend. The company announced a 63-cent quarterly payment this month, making the annual payout $2.52 and the yield a strong 6.6%. BP has been raising the dividend payment modestly over the past 4 years.Writing on the stock after the earnings report, Piper Sandler's Ryan Todd reiterated his $47 price target and Buy rating. He was particularly impressed by the dividend, writing, “…while 2020 guidance was largely in line, capex again at the low end of the guided range combined with success to date on disposals should set the stage for a coming ramp in shareholder distributions… the [dividend] raise was modest, [and] represents the second sequential (annual) bump to the dividend and management’s commitment to growing shareholder distributions going forward.”Todd’s price target suggests a 26% upside to BP shares. (To watch Todd’s track record, click here)BP is another Moderate Buy, according to the analyst consensus view. The stock has received 2 Buy ratings and 1 Hold in recent weeks. Shares are priced at $36.54, and the average target of $45 implies an upside of 23%. (See BP stock analysis on TipRanks)Total SA (TOT)Our final stock on the list, like BP, is a ‘Supermajor,’ one of the few giant companies that collectively are called “Big Oil.” Total has a $128 billion market cap, brings in some $200 billion in annual revenue, and sees more than $11 billion in net profit.Where BP has been facing lower quarterly earnings, TOT’s quarterlies are rising. In Q4, the company saw $1.19 EPS, for a 1% year-over-gain and a 5% sequential gain. The rising earnings came even as total revenues slipped. The top-line number was down 6% year-over-year, to $49.3 billion – another indication of the impact low prices have on the sector.Total’s oil production in the fourth quarter was 3.113 billion barrels per day, up 8% from the year before, while gas production showed a 4% gain to 7.264 billion cubic feet. The company saw an 8% decrease in realized oil prices, and a 25% drop in gas prices, over the course of 2019. Total ended Q4 2019 with $27.4 billion cash on hand, essentially flat year-over-year.The company has been using its cash to boost shares, with a $1.75 billion share buyback in 2019. Going forward, management expects to buy back $2 billion worth of shares in 2020. These buybacks are part of a planned program, in place for the 2018 to 2020 time horizon, totaling $5 billion.Along with share buybacks, TOT pays out a reliable quarterly dividend. The annualized payment, at $2.93, makes the yield 5.99%. For investors, the best feature of the dividend is the payout ratio. At 51%, it’s high enough to show a company commitment to paying back shareholders, while not so high to spark worries about sustainability.Analyst Ryan Todd, quoted above on BP, also reviewed TOT. He believes that this company is the best option for investors looking for an oil play, writing, “While not immune to macro headwinds, the combination of above average production growth and high-margin project starts managed to hold earnings flat YoY in a peer group showing material declines – outperformance that we expect to continue in 2020. We continue to view Total as best positioned to support both top-line growth and upside to growing shareholder returns.”Todd reiterated his Buy rating on the stock, and set a $68 price target. His target suggests a robust 36% upside for Total over the coming 12 months.TOT is the only stock in this list with a Strong Buy analyst consensus. This rating is based on 4 Buys and 1 Hold set recently. The stock is trading at $49.81, and the average price target of $67.31 indicates room for 30% upside growth potential.

2020-01-27	2020-01-27 09:24:15	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	Oil Traders Made Billions in 2019 as Conflict Shook the Market	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s largest energy traders enjoyed one of their best ever years in 2019 as pipeline outages, dramatic changes in ship fuel regulations and Middle East conflicts shook up the global oil market.The bonanza extended beyond the independent traders like Vitol Group and Trafigura Group Ltd. to the in-house units of oil giants Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and BP Plc, which made billions of dollars in profits.“By all accounts, 2019 was among the best years ever for the energy trading industry,” said Marco Dunand, the chief executive of Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., one of the five largest independent oil traders.For the independents, the bumper year all but guarantees a fat bonus season for a group of companies that’s largely owned by their executives and senior staff. For the European oil companies, the trading boom will help Shell, BP and Total to weather a tough year in other parts of their business.In interviews with senior traders and top executives, the consensus is that the industry benefited from a lucky mix of factors in the oil market. Recent investments in trading natural gas, power and liquefied natural gas also started to bear fruit.First, a series of supply outages boosted the premiums that oil refiners pay over the benchmark price for some crudes. Early in 2019, Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuela, disrupting flows. Then, Russian shipments into Europe via the key Druzhba pipeline were halted after oil was tainted with a corrosive pollutant. And in September, Saudi exports were hindered after a terrorist attack against the country’s most important petroleum facility.Some traders also profited from the so-called IMO2020 rules that force the world’s merchant shipping fleet to use fuel with a lower sulfur content. The rules have upended the oil-refining and maritime industries, causing gyrations in the price of fuel-oil and marine diesel.The results provide some breathing room for a sector that’s under assault from falling margins. Brent crude, the world’s most important benchmark, traded in a relatively narrow range of $52.51 to $75.60 a barrel through the year.Vitol, Glencore, Shell, BP and Total all declined to comment on their results.The trend was already clear in the results of Trafigura, which reports earlier than others due to a fiscal year ending in September. Trafigura said its oil unit delivered a record gross profit of $1.7 billion last year.$1 Billion YearElsewhere executives also expect a stellar year, even as they caution that they haven’t yet audited their financial statements or decided on the final writedowns against 2019 results. The oil-trading unit of Glencore Plc., for example, enjoyed its best ever result, according to people familiar with the matter. One person said Glencore expects to report earnings before interest and taxes of more than $1 billion in oil trading.At Gunvor, chief executive Torbjorn Tornqvist said 2019 was “up there among the best years ever” for the trading house, in part thanks to its expansion into LNG, super-cooled natural gas that can be transported by vessel. “We have a good year across the board.”Vitol, the world’s largest independent oil trader, expects to report earnings near $2 billion, one of its best results, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mercuria also enjoyed a “very good year,” its chief executive said.Inside Big Oil, it was also a trading bonanza. Although better known for their oil fields, refineries and pump stations, Shell, BP and Total also run in-house trading businesses that are larger than the better-known independent dealers. Shell alone trades the equivalent of 13 million barrels a day of oil, dwarfing the nearly 7.5 million barrels a day at Vitol.For BP and Shell, 2019 was one of the best years ever in trading, making several billions dollars, according to two people familiar with the matter. Shell alone made at least $1 billion in fuel-oil trading linked to the IMO2020 changes.The results came despite mounting legal and regulatory pressures on some of the biggest trading houses. Glencore is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. Meanwhile, Vitol and Trafigura had their Geneva offices raided by Swiss prosecutors as part of a bribery investigation in Brazil. And Gunvor had to pay $95 million in Switzerland to settle a case that saw a former employee pay bribes to secure oil deals in the Republic of Congo and Ivory Coast.&#92;--With assistance from Andy Hoffman, Jack Farchy, Ronan Martin and Francois de Beaupuy.To contact the reporter on this story: Javier Blas in Davos at jblas3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Will Kennedy at wkennedy3@bloomberg.net, Emma Ross-Thomas, Helen RobertsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-traders-made-billions-2019-092415373.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-22	2020-01-22 18:49:04	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	Oil CEOs at Davos Debate Tougher CO2 Cuts as Pressure Mounts	(Bloomberg) -- Sign up here to receive the Davos Diary, a special daily newsletter that will run from Jan. 20-24.The bosses of some of the world’s biggest oil companies discussed adopting much more ambitious carbon targets at a closed-door meeting in Davos, a sign of how much pressure they’re under from activists and investors to address climate change.The meeting, part of a World Economic Forum dominated by climate issues, included a debate on widening the industry’s target to include reductions in emissions from the fuels they sell, not just the greenhouse gases produced by their own operations, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The talks between the chief executive officers of companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Chevron Corp., Total SA, Saudi Aramco, Equinor ASA and BP Plc showed general agreement on the need to move toward this broader definition, known as Scope 3, the people said, asking not to be named because the session was closed to the press. The executives didn’t take any final decisions.Shell and Aramco declined to comment. Media representatives for Chevron, Total and BP weren’t immediately able to respond to requests for comment. Equinor confirmed its CEO Eldar Saetre attended the meeting.Climate FocusTargeting Scope 3 emissions would be a big shift for an industry that produces the bulk of the world’s planet-warming emissions, once that could eventually require them to sell far less oil and gas. The simple fact that the industry’s top executives were considering it underscored how climate concerns suddenly came into focus in Davos this year.For the first time, environmental risks occupied the WEF’s top five long-term concerns. Business leaders from BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink to Allianz SE boss Oliver Baete used their platform at the event to focus on sustainable investment. The two highest-profile attendees at the forum -- President Donald Trump and climate activist Greta Thunberg -- made headlines as they staked out opposing positions on the issue.The oil and gas executives debated a document produced by the WEF on “neutralizing emissions at the pump,” a reference to the gasoline and diesel sold to customers. There’s an urgent need to shift the industry’s target from production to emissions from end users, said one person.Several companies have already set targets for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gases, which come directly from pumping and refining hydrocarbons. Yet these account for less than 10% of total emissions from the life cycle of oil and gas. Some of their pledges have also focused on curbing emissions intensity -- the amount of carbon dioxide released per unit of energy -- which wouldn’t necessarily lead to a reduction in the volume of greenhouse gases produced if a company’s output is growing.Among major energy groups, only Shell, Total and Madrid-based Repsol SA have publicly announced that they are either targeting or monitoring Scope 3 emissions.The Spanish company made the boldest move, promising net-zero emissions in 2050 by diverting investment into wind and solar power. Shell has taken more modest steps, pledging to offset the greenhouse gases produced by fuel sold to drivers on their loyalty-card programs in the U.K. and Netherlands.Eni SpA Chairman Emma Marcegaglia said in a Bloomberg TV interview that the company is committed to becoming carbon neutral on a Scope 1 and 2 basis by 2030. The Italian oil and gas giant is in discussions about Scope 3 emissions, but needs more guidance from the government on how to do so, she said.Other companies, notably U.S. majors Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron have so far resisted specific pledges to cut total emissions, with the latter focusing instead on the carbon intensity of the energy it produces. BP CEO Bob Dudley, who retires later this year, has agreed aims for Scope 1 and 2 gases but in the past opposed a Scope 3 target.“We need to reduce our carbon intensity, everyone in the industry agrees on that,” Dudley said in an interview in Davos. However, he cautioned that shareholders and companies were using multiple definitions of Scope 3 emissions. “We need to get a common definition” so the industry “can work together in a powerful way.”(Updates with Aramco comment in fourth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Laura Hurst, Francois de Beaupuy, Matthew Martin, Francine Lacqua and Mikael Holter.To contact the reporter on this story: Javier Blas in Davos at jblas3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Rakteem KatakeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-chiefs-davos-debate-tougher-112515264.html?.tsrc=rss

A joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and Qatar Electricity & Water Co. will hold the remaining 60%.Like many of its oil-rich neighbors, Qatar, the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, is pushing into solar power and other forms of renewables for its local energy needs. Al-Kharsaah will be able to supply about a 10th of Qatar’s power when it starts supplying at full capacity in the first quarter of 2022, Al-Kaabi said.Marubeni will invest about $95 million in the plant, for 20.4% of the total project, while Total will contribute about $91 million, for a 19.6% share, Al-Kaabi and Total Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said at a news conference. Siraj Energy, the Qatari joint venture, will own the rest.State-run Qatar Petroleum, where Al-Kaabi is also the chief, wants to build four new gas liquefaction plants, known as trains, and is negotiating a possible partnership with energy majors. Qatar will decide this year whether it wants international partners to help expand the North Field, its part of the world’s largest gas deposit, Al-Kaabi said last month in Kuwait.The agreement with Marubeni and Total “has absolutely nothing to do with the North Field bidding process,” he said.

2019-12-02	2019-12-02 13:29:31	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	OPEC Output Falls Before Meeting Amid Further Unplanned Losses	(Bloomberg) -- OPEC’s crude production fell before ministers gather to discuss their strategy for next year, though more by accident than design.Angola, which has been suffering a decline for the past four years, saw output slide to the lowest in more than a decade. Iran’s production, already squeezed to the lowest since the 1980s by U.S. sanctions, dwindled even further.Total output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries consequently slipped by 110,000 barrels a day to 29.7 million a day last month, according to a Bloomberg survey of officials, ship-tracking data and estimates from consultants including Rystad Energy AS and JBC Energy GmbH.The group and its allies, a 24-nation alliance known as OPEC+, will meet in Vienna this week to consider output levels for the year ahead. Though the coalition -- which pumps about half the world’s oil -- cut supply by 1.2 million barrels a day this year, it’s forecasting a renewed surplus in early 2020.Iraqi Oil Minister Thamir Ghadhban said on Sunday that OPEC+ could consider deepening the cutback by 400,000 barrels a day. However, his comments conflict with signals from the rest of the group, and data for November showed that Iraq had again failed to deliver any of the curbs it promised under the existing deal.Saudis SteadySaudi Arabia, the group’s biggest member, indicated last week that it’s tired of shouldering most of the burden of the curbs while others -- such as Iraq, Nigeria and Russia -- fail to live up to their promises.The kingdom kept production steady last month at 10.01 million barrels a day, the survey showed. While it’s still cutting far more than obligated under the terms of the OPEC+ deal, output is up from the levels produced for most of this year.The decline in the group’s overall volumes last month was instead the result of unintended disruptions, which have beset many OPEC members for several years.While Angola started pumping from a new ultra-deep offshore project this summer -- the Kaombo unit operated by Total SA -- the West African nation has struggled to make up for years of under-investment at aging oil fields. Output fell last month by 60,000 barrels a day to 1.28 million a day.Iran has also been under strain this year as U.S. President Donald Trump pressures Tehran to renegotiate an agreement on its nuclear program by squeezing the economy with sanctions. Iranian production fell by 40,000 barrels a day to 2.07 million.Despite the losses, OPEC’s total output remains higher than the levels it expects will be needed in the first half of next year. If the group holds at 29.7 million barrels a day, the surplus would amount to about 650,000 barrels day, potentially pushing prices lower and hurting members’ revenues.To contact the reporter on this story: Grant Smith in London at gsmith52@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Amanda JordanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opec-output-falls-meeting-amid-132931940.html?.tsrc=rss

Some stocks go up more than that, some go up less. Some years are better for stock returns, some are worse. So what can you do you increase your odds of getting a great return on your stock investment?I've got one word for you: Dividends.Buy a stock with a great dividend yield -- significantly higher than what the average S&P stock pays -- and you've gone a long way towards ensuring that your total profits in a given year are at least average, and maybe significantly above average.With this goal in mind, we've employed the Stock Screener at TipRanks to dig up for us a few likely candidates -- stocks paying generous dividend yields of 5% or better, and stocks scoring a &quot;strong buy&quot; rating from Wall Street analysts to boot.Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)First up is oil and natural gas pipeline operator Enterprise Products Partners, and of the three this one offers income investors the biggest dividend yield: 6.8%. EPD is also one of the biggest players in its industry, owning and operating pipelines for the transport of oil, gas, and petrochemicals stretching some 49,000 miles in combined length, with storage and processing facilities besides.Little wonder that Evercore ISI analyst Dan Walk calls EPD a &quot;bellwether&quot; for the midstream energy industry. In a recent research note, Walk hailed EPD's earnings beat in its recent Q3 earnings announcement, arguing that &quot;EPD's scale and integration across the value chains of all three hydrocarbon streams provide unmatched flexibility to adapt to an ever-shifting environment.&quot; The analyst was particularly impressed by EPD's decision to expand its pipelines, adding potentially as much as almost 1 billion barrels per day in transportation capacity for the business.As a result, Walk reiterated an Outperform rating on EPD stock along with a $32 price target, which implies about 25% upside from current levels. (To watch Walk's track record, click here)Wolfe Research analyst Keith Stanley was also enthusiastic, noting that EPD is forging &quot;full speed ahead&quot; with its &quot;superior integrated, demand-driven growth platform,&quot; even as rivals have &quot;pulled back.&quot; Echoing Walk's sentiment, Stanley rates the stock an Outperfom, while maintaining a $33 price target.Overall, the Street sentiment on EPD stock is similarly positive, with three out of three analysts who have issued ratings on the stock in the last three months rating the stock &quot;buy.&quot; With an average price target of $33.33, these analysts see 29% upside in the stock over the next 12 months -- before counting the dividend. (See EPD stock analysis on TipRanks)Total (TOT) Farther up the oil industry food chain we find French oil giant Total, a true giant of the industry with annual revenues approaching $180 billion. Total's 5.3% dividend yield -- more than twice as generous as the average dividend on the S&P 500 -- is no slouch either.In a recent research note, Cowen analyst Jason Gabelman predicted that Total's production growth &quot;should exceed peers significantly over the next three years... with materially better cash margins... and rising FCF.&quot; The analyst noted that in Q3, Total &quot;beat&quot; on earnings and generated $6.6 billion in free cash flow as well -- $1.2 billion more than Street estimates had predicted -- even as the company stood fast to its promises to invest in capital spending and continue buying back shares.Gabelman forecast that by the time December 31 rolls around, Total will have grown its full-year earnings 8% in comparison to last year, and that the company is on track to do nearly as well in 2020, growing earnings a further 7%. Although valued at 15.2 times trailing earnings today, Gabelman believes these numbers put the stock squarely in &quot;buy&quot; territory at a current-year P/E ratio of 12.4 and a forward P/E ratio of just 11.6.Similarly, 10 out of 10 analyst ratings published on Total in the last couple of months have rated Total stock &quot;buy.&quot; On average, analysts see Total shares climbed 22% over the next year, to an average target price of $66.12 -- again, before factoring in the 5.3% dividend. (See TOT stock analysis on TipRanks)Outfront Media (OUT)Taking a sharp right-hand turn out of the oil patch here at the end, we turn our attention now to Outfront Media, whose stock in trade is... billboards, as well as ads posted on mass transit and other &quot;mobile&quot; advertising assets. And if billboards don't sound particularly sexy to you, then perhaps this fact will: Outfront Media pays its shareholders a monster 5.8% dividend yield -- nearly triple the yield on the S&P 500.Commenting on Outfront's earnings results earlier this month, Wolfe Research analyst Marci Ryvicker was impressed at the company's ability to grow revenues by double digits year over year in TRADITIONAL MEDIA (Her emphasis, not ours). Q3 sales came in 11.7% higher than in the year-ago quarter, led by revenues from transit advertising, up 20%.Admittedly, next quarter looks to be a bit slower on &quot;toughening comps.&quot; Nevertheless, Ryvicker notes that if management succeeds in growing revenues by mid-to-high-single digits, as it's promised to do, it's probably going to eclipse Street predictions for 5.4%. growth.Analysts are starting to warm to this story, though, with four out of five polled in the last three months rating Outfront stock a &quot;buy.&quot; Consensus targets call for the stock to rise 28.2% over the next 12 months to $32.25 per share -- but Wolfe's Ryvicker is even more optimistic than that. Wowed by the company's ability to grow traditional media sales in a digital world, she's set a price target of $36 -- 43% more than the stock is worth today.

A large majority of members present voted against a government-backed proposal to delay until 2026 the end of palm oil's tax advantages, giving companies like oil major Total more time to phase out the use of palm oil in biofuels.  Late on Thursday, the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament, had agreed to extend the tax breaks, but following strong pushback from environmentalist MPs within President Emmanuel Macron's ruling LREM party, the government agreed on a second vote.	https://news.yahoo.com/1-french-parliament-vote-again-145856628.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-30	2019-10-30 08:13:16	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	Total Profit Beats Estimates as It Boosts Output, Cuts Costs	(Bloomberg) -- Total SA’s third-quarter profit beat analyst estimates and cash flow held firm, as the French giant offset lower oil and gas prices by boosting production and cutting costs.The positive result mirrors that of British rival BP Plc, which also used a strong refining performance to offset weaker crude prices caused by the U.S.-China trade war and a flood of American shale output.“The group continues to achieve solid results” despite weaker prices, Total Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement on Wednesday. The company is accelerating dividend growth and is on track to buy back $1.75 billion of its shares this year, he said.Reaping RewardsAdjusted net income fell 24% from a year earlier to $3.02 billion, said the company based near Paris. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast $2.77 billion on average.Total is reaping the rewards of growth from new projects and acquisitions, while also shedding barrels with higher production costs through asset sales. The company said it has reduced the price at which it can cover spending, excluding dividends, from cash flow to less than $25 a barrel, well below current international prices of about $60. Cost cuts will exceed $500 million in 2019.Operating cash flow before working capital changes, a measure of oil majors’ ability to keep paying generous dividends and investing in growth, held steady despite falling energy prices. It fell just 3% in the third quarter to $6.85 billion.It’s “a resilient set of numbers on earnings and cash flow” and “a genuine beat to market expectations,” RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria wrote in a report. “In the midst of the sector seeing material earnings downgrades, Total stands out as having a relatively resilient portfolio, visibility on earnings and a shareholder-friendly remuneration plan.”Like its peers, Total is under pressure from investors to boost returns. BP shares fell 3.8% on Tuesday despite earnings that beat estimates, as investors’ hopes of a dividend increase this year were dashed. As announced in September, Total’s interim dividend for the third quarter will rise by 6% year on year to 68 euro cents. It plans to boost its payout by 5% to 6% annually in the coming years, up from a previous plan for 3% growth.Total shares rose rose 1.1% as of 9:11 a.m. in Paris to 48.18 euros, beating gains in France’s benchmark index.New ProjectsOil and gas production climbed 8.4% from a year earlier to 3.04 million barrels equivalent a day. Thanks to project startups in the U.K. North Sea, Norway and Brazil, output is on track to grow by 9% for the full year, the company said.Sales of liquefied natural gas grew 20% in the quarter to 7.4 million tons, helped by the ramp-up of projects in Australia and Russia, and the start of the first liquefaction plant at Cameron LNG in the U.S. Cash flow from Total’s integrated gas, renewables and power segment jumped by 53% to $848 million.The downstream division benefited from better petrochemicals margins in Europe and rising sales of gasoline and other petroleum products. The unit generated almost $2 billion of cash flow in the third quarter, up 14% from a year earlier, and is “well positioned” to generate close to $7 billion of cash flow this year, the company said.(Updates with analyst comment in seventh paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Francois de Beaupuy in Paris at fdebeaupuy@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Helen RobertsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-profit-beats-estimates-boosts-071730755.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-14	2019-10-14 12:20:56	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	Total Makes $600 Million Bet on India Gas With Adani Stake	(Bloomberg) -- French energy giant Total SA is spending $600 million to expand its presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing natural gas markets.Total agreed to purchase a 37.4% stake in India’s Adani Gas Ltd., a distributor of the fuel that’s developing import terminals and a national chain of vehicle-filling outlets. The deal gives the French company a footprint in a market where annual liquefied natural gas demand will hit 28 million tons by 2023, making it the fourth-biggest importer of the fuel, according to BloombergNEF.Total is the latest energy major seeking to expand in India, where population growth and economic development are luring some of the biggest oil and gas producers. In August, Reliance Industries Ltd. said Saudi Arabian Oil Co. may buy 20% of its oil-to-chemicals business at an enterprise value of $75 billion.“Energy needs in India are immense,” Total Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement. “The natural gas market in India will have a strong growth and is an attractive outlet.”Total has recently made several investments to beef up its presence in LNG. It agreed to take over a Mozambique LNG project earlier this year as part of a deal for Anadarko Petroleum Corp.’s assets in Africa. It has also absorbed Engie SA’s upstream assets, boosted its investment in Tellurian Inc. and its Driftwood LNG venture, and plans to sanction a new gas-export project in Papua New Guinea.“Total’s investment in Adani is undoubtedly a show of faith in India’s gas demand growth,” Nicholas Browne, a Singapore-based analyst at Wood Mackenzie Ltd., said in an email. Gas consumption will almost double to 106 billion cubic meters by 2030, with LNG meeting about 55% of the demand growth, according to the consultant.Adani, whose shares jumped 9.5%, the biggest one-day gain since May, is developing the Mundra and Dhamra LNG import terminals in India. It plans to expand its distribution network in the next decade to about 6 million homes and 1,500 retail outlets for natural gas vehicles.Total said the acquisition will cost about $600 million taking into account its divestment of another Indian LNG terminal earlier this year.Total will make the purchase through a tender offer to public shareholders for as much as 25.2% and the residual shares from the Adani family, Adani Gas said in a statement to stock exchanges. The Times of India reported in June that Total was close to buying a 30% stake in Adani for more than $800 million.(An earlier version of this story corrected gas-demand figures in sixth paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: Debjit Chakraborty in New Delhi at dchakrabor10@bloomberg.net;Stephen Stapczynski in Singapore at sstapczynsk1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Serene Cheong at scheong20@bloomberg.net, Dan Murtaugh, Aaron ClarkFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-buy-37-4-adani-031217993.html?.tsrc=rss

The most heavily sought after areas in the Thursday auction directly border Brazil's so-called pre-salt area, a coveted zone in which billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt beneath the ocean floor.  The biggest move came from a France's Total SA, which, in a consortium with Malaysia's Petronas and Qatar Petroleum, dropped 4.029 billion reais for one block abutting the pre-salt area.	https://sg.news.yahoo.com/1-bp-shell-among-bidders-121352850.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-08	2019-10-08 10:45:39	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	Big Oil Is Selling Dirty Assets, But They Aren’t Going Away	(Bloomberg) -- When BP Plc announced its historic exit from Alaska, Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley pointed to an extra perk from the $5.6 billion sale: a significantly lower carbon footprint.Cutting emissions is important for Dudley, partly because influential shareholders are forcing BP to align its spending with climate goals. But there’s a catch.Hilcorp Energy Co., the buyer of the Alaska assets, plans to pour more money to boost production there than BP would have, according to Dudley. That could end up making the carbon problem worse than it was.The BP boss and his counterparts at the world’s biggest oil companies are caught in a dilemma. Investors are demanding they adhere to the goals of the Paris climate accord, while continuing to generate the mounds of cash that make them among the biggest and most consistent dividend payers.To strike a balance, one of the strategies for the executives is to sell high-cost and high-carbon projects. But that may only offload the emissions problem on to another company.“If one asset just passes to another and still operates at its maximum capacity, OK that may have helped the profile of that individual company, but does that actually do anything on a net effect of reduced emissions?” said Adam Matthews, the director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England Pensions Board. “That’s a legitimate question.”Oil Sands, CoalBP is not the only one passing on the responsibility. Royal Dutch Shell Plc divested its carbon-intensive Canadian oil-sands business in 2017 that is now operating under a new owner. Total SA sold its interest in a similar project, which was dormant, to a buyer looking to revive it. Miner Rio Tinto Plc exited coal by selling some of its assets to Glencore Plc, which plans to keep running them for years.The companies’ actions will be discussed when hundreds of executives gather this week at the Oil & Money conference. The event, which saw noisy protests from pressure group Extinction Rebellion outside its London venue on Tuesday, will change its name to Energy Intelligence Forum next year in a nod to climate change and the energy transition.While the asset sales help reduce costs, Dudley, Shell’s CEO Ben van Beurden and Total’s Patrick Pouyanne will also need to show they’re committed to the environment and not just offloading their responsibility.Still, for some investors selling the high-carbon projects makes the companies more resilient to future climate legislation, and that’s a step in the right direction.If companies can use the funds from the sale of carbon intensive projects to develop lower-intensity production, that’s a “decision that we are generally supportive of,” said Nick Stansbury, head of commodity research at Legal & General Investment Management, one of the largest shareholders of major oil companies.Big ChallengeOil executives say their big challenge is to cut emissions while continuing to supply energy to a growing global economy. Shutting down production can create shortages that could boost prices, reduce affordability and even encourage the start up of new projects.Also read: Norway’s Huge New Oil Project Clashes With Growing Climate FocusTo tackle the “radical changes” required to keep global warming at a safe level, demand for low-carbon energy would have to rise dramatically, said Tal Lomnitzer, a senior investment manager at Janus Henderson Investors. It would have to be aided by government policy changes and involve social pressure, he said.“A much faster transition is technically possible but actors need guidance,” Lomnitzer said. “It’s likely to arrive from the populace and then be expressed via bans, taxes and incentives.”The oil companies support a tax on carbon as a way to discourage emissions, and are promoting natural gas as a cleaner fuel. France’s Total applies a carbon price internally in its assessment of projects, a spokeswoman said, as do others like BP. Qatar, the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas exporter, started a carbon capture and storage project as part of an effort to address concerns about climate change, Energy Minister Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi said Tuesday.Investor pressure is also forcing the oil majors to increase spending on green energy. They’re building wind and solar projects, boosting electric-vehicle infrastructure and reducing the amount of gas they release into the atmosphere. But these investments are still a fraction of overall expenditure.“The transition from Big Oil to Big Energy will certainly take time,” said Rob Barnett, an energy policy analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “But we do see things headed in that direction.”(Updates with protests in the eighth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Isis Almeida, Francois de Beaupuy and Kevin Crowley.To contact the reporter on this story: Kelly Gilblom in London at kgilblom@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Rakteem Katakey, Amanda JordanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-selling-dirty-assets-230100475.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-10-07	2019-10-07 07:31:12	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	CNPC Quits Flagship Iran Gas Project as U.S. Sanctions Bite	(Bloomberg) -- China National Petroleum Corp. is no longer a partner in Iran’s biggest natural gas project, and the Persian Gulf nation will develop Phase 11 of the giant South Pars field on its own, Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said.CNPC was the only international partner left in the project, after Total SA of France withdrew last year when U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear accord and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Phase 11 was the biggest infrastructure development project with major foreign participants that Iran arranged after the accord took effect.The Chinese company was “dismissed” from the project, Zanganeh says, according to the ministry’s Shana news service in a report that gave no explanation for the dismissal. Iran’s Petropars Ltd. will take over CNPC’s stake and be sole participant in Phase 11, he said.A CNPC spokesman in Beijing didn’t immediately reply to phone calls and a text message request for comment on Monday, a national holiday in China.Iran had awarded Total, CNPC and Petropars a contract in July 2017 to develop Phase 11 of South Pars, its part of the world’s largest offshore gas field. Total, which initially held a 50.1% stake, pulled out in August 2018. CNPC had a 30% share in the project, while Petropars held 19.9%.“We had intended to attract foreign capital for developing the project,” Zanganeh said. “Petropars was supposed to learn from other companies in the consortium.”International energy companies have been reluctant to work in Iran since the U.S. reimposed curbs on the country, due to their concerns that Washington might blacklist them for engaging with the Islamic Republic. China remains one of the biggest buyers of Iran crude oil, in spite of U.S. sanctions.Phase 11 will produce 500 million cubic feet a day of gas by March 2020, Zanganeh told reporters on Sunday, suggesting that the project is ahead of schedule. It was due to start up in 2021, according to a statement Total issued when it was awarded the development contract.CNPC’s role in the project had been uncertain for several months. The company had not carried out any of its share of the work, Zanganeh said in February. It was still in negotiations to remain a partner as recently as August, according to the head of Iran’s Pars Oil and Gas Co.(Updates with no immediate comment from CNPC in fourth paragraph; minister’s comment in sixth.)&#92;--With assistance from Sarah Chen.To contact the reporters on this story: Arsalan Shahla in Tehran at ashahla@bloomberg.net;Verity Ratcliffe in Dubai at vratcliffe1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nayla Razzouk at nrazzouk2@bloomberg.net, Bruce StanleyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-cnpc-quits-flagship-iran-210000873.html?.tsrc=rss

Like peers, Total has been under pressure from investors to boost shareholder returns and prioritize the most profitable projects amid slowing global economic growth and mounting concern about climate change.Growth in oil, gas and power businesses will increase cash flow by more than $5 billion by 2025 with oil at $60 a barrel, according to Total. The interim dividend for the third quarter will rise by 6% year on year, it said.“These decisions reflect the board’s confidence in the group’s ability to deliver profitable and sustainable growth in the coming years,” Total said in the statement. It reaffirmed its “strong discipline on investment and cost” and its ability to maintain “gearing” -- a measure of indebtedness -- below 20%.Total’s shares were trading 0.2% lower at 48.59 euros at 9:56 a.m. in Paris on Tuesday. The muted reaction may be due to the fact that the company didn’t specify whether it would pursue share buybacks beyond the $5 billion repurchase planned in the three years through 2020, according to Ahmed Ben Salem, an analyst at Oddo BHF in Paris.Total, which is holding an investor day later on Tuesday, will update analysts on its strategy, including the planned $8.8 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp.’s assets in Africa. The company is also expected to detail progress on oil and liquefied natural gas projects in countries such as the U.S., Uganda, Brazil, and Papua New Guinea. To reassure investors, the French major pledged in July to sell $5 billion of assets in the 2019-2020 period.(Updates with company and analyst comments from fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Francois de Beaupuy in Paris at fdebeaupuy@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Helen Robertson, Christopher SellFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-accelerate-dividend-growth-063733476.html?.tsrc=rss

His decision to review and possibly renegotiate the agreement, which was signed in April, has drawn criticism for raising the specter of “sovereign risk” and potentially scaring off foreign investment.Read a QuickTake on how Papua New Guinea has grappled with the LNG industryThe nation’s petroleum minister, Kerenga Kua, said in a statement Tuesday that Total has made new commitments, detailed in an Aug. 30 letter, that are mostly “substantial new concessions on potential future benefits not previously available to the country under the signed agreement.”It’s the government’s position “that the Papua LNG project be allowed to proceed in accordance with the terms of the related gas agreement,” Kua said in the statement. “But which terms must be interpreted and applied in accordance with the Total letter and the related expectations of the government and the state.”Total said it welcomed the decision to honor the gas agreement, calling it “a positive signal for foreign investment in the country.”Moving AheadFinalization of the Papua LNG deal is necessary for talks to resume on the related Exxon-led P’nyang project. Once those are concluded, both ventures, which will share infrastructure, can progress to front-end engineering and design work. The partners are competing with a wave of LNG projects around the world aiming to start up next decade.After reviewing the agreement and meeting in Singapore for talks last month, Total rejected the government’s request to renegotiate the financial terms of the deal, which was signed by Marape’s predecessor, Peter O’Neill.According to Kua, Total committed to preparing a detailed plan for how the project will use local content, building third-party access points for the project’s pipelines, engaging in future negotiations for the government to buy stakes in the pipelines and evaluating the use of LNG tankers owned by the nation’s state oil company, Kumul Petroleum Holdings Ltd.Oil Search shares ended Tuesday in Sydney up 2.1%. The benchmark ASX 200 Index fell 0.1%. The company traded ex-dividend Tuesday, meaning buyers won’t be entitled to the 5-cent dividend payment due Sept. 24.Kua also said he and the mining minister have been instructed to draft new resource laws that ensure Papua New Guinea will receive early cash flow from future mining and petroleum projects and relieve the state of burdensome expensive loans.Currently the government gets most of its gas revenue through Kumul, which has to buy multi-billion dollar stakes in projects, often borrowing at higher interest rates than its international partners.(Updates with Total comment in fifth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Dan Murtaugh and Stephen Stapczynski.To contact the reporter on this story: James Thornhill in Sydney at jthornhill3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/papua-guinea-honor-lng-deal-073248512.html?.tsrc=rss

The decision removes uncertainty over the plan to double liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the Pacific nation that arose after new Prime Minister James Marape came to power in May promising to win more benefits for the impoverished country.  The Papua LNG gas agreement is one of two agreements needed for Total and its partners, Exxon Mobil Corp and Oil Search Ltd, to go ahead with the LNG expansion plan.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-papua-guinea-decision-total-012634720.html?.tsrc=rss

The government, led by James Marape, earlier this month suddenly called for talks with Total to revise the Papua LNG gas agreement, one of two needed for Total, Exxon Mobil Corp and their partners to go ahead with two major projects.  Neither Total nor the government have disclosed the status of talks, but Total's partner in Papua LNG, Oil Search Ltd has said the companies believe the agreement, signed with Marape's predecessor, Peter O'Neill, should be honoured.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/papua-guinea-opposition-leader-urges-090350235.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-26	2019-07-26 01:04:57	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	Total's PNG Gas Plan Faces Fresh Test as Deal Changes Proposed	(Bloomberg) -- Papua New Guinea’s petroleum minister said he’s completed his review of a recent natural gas agreement with Total SA and will recommend changes, creating a potential hurdle for the delayed $13 billion effort to double the nation’s exports of the fuel.The potential changes cover both regulatory and commercial terms of the so-called Papua LNG agreement and must be approved by the National Executive Council before submitting them to venture partners, which include Exxon Mobil Corp. and Oil Search Ltd., Kerenga Kua said in an interview Thursday.Kua said he’ll send his findings as soon as Monday to the council, a top policy making body, and expects a revised agreement with the companies completed within six weeks. In response, Total’s Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne pushed back against any potential overhaul.“All issues are capable of discussion and compromise,” Kua said. “Even though we may have our wish list and they may have their wish list, finding the middle ground where all of us can benefit is an important principle.”Oil Search shares added 0.6% to A$7.09 as of 10:43 a.m. in Sydney and are headed for a 6.3% rise this week. The Australia-based producer declined to comment. Exxon didn’t respond to requests for comment.“We are confident that it’s in the best interest of PNG to respect the agreement that has been signed in order to move forward with the project,” Pouyanne said on a conference call Thursday. “We expect the new government to respect” the deal signed by its predecessor, and Total has “many” LNG projects in its portfolio.Political Flash-PointSeparately, Newcrest Mining Ltd., Australia’s top gold producer, and Harmony Gold Mining Co. said they are facing a hurdle with the development of the $5.4 billion Wafi-Golpu gold-copper project in PNG amid heightened political uncertainty. The delay in permitting is associated in part with legal proceedings between national and provincial authorities and the PNG government continues to signal support for the project, Newcrest said in a statement Thursday.Liquefied natural gas exports have developed into a political flash-point for the country as its existing venture, the Exxon-led PNG LNG project, has been criticized as not benefiting the domestic economy as much as expected. The nation’s new prime minister, James Marape, swept to power in May amid a wave of criticism of the Papua LNG deal signed by his predecessor. He tasked Kua with reviewing the agreement after appointing him petroleum minister in June.“For too long we have allowed external forces to dictate the direction we take,” Marape said Thursday at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. The government must work with its partners “to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of our resources.”In the interview, Kua described the suggested changes as a “short list,” but declined to provide specifics. He said he’s been in communication with the partner companies.“We haven’t rejected the signed agreement,” he said.The review has delayed plans to double gas exports from Papua New Guinea, which involves a $13 billion expansion across separate but interlinked projects. Talks on the second gas agreement, for the Exxon-led P’nyang venture, won’t begin until the Papua LNG deal is revised, Kua said.Oil Search said last week that it expects front-end engineering and design work on new LNG production units to be pushed back pending those agreements. That may move a final investment decision until as late as 2021, which puts the expansion projects at risk of greater competition for building resources and customers, according to analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein.Marape said his government assembled a group of advisers to assess the country’s resource laws to find the right balance between encouraging foreign investment and boosting local involvement in the sector.(Updates with share price in 5th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from James Thornhill, Francois de Beaupuy and Ranjeetha Pakiam.To contact the reporter on this story: Stephen Stapczynski in Singapore at sstapczynsk1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, James Herron, Rakteem KatakeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/totals-png-gas-plan-faces-083119033.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-23	2019-07-23 10:53:02	TTE	TotalEnergies SE	Big Oil’s Dealmaking CEO Spends Billions to Ride Out Turmoil	(Bloomberg) -- If you’re offered the job of running one of the world’s largest companies, you don’t usually have just an hour to decide if you want it. But that was the challenge Patrick Pouyanne faced when the chief executive officer of oil giant Total SA died suddenly in a plane crash almost five years ago.The jarring transition, amplified by sharp contrasts between the personal and professional styles of the two men, set the tone for Pouyanne’s leadership of the French company. It’s been marked by bold deal-making in the face of external turmoil, but also criticisms about a hard-charging style that’s ruffled some feathers.The 56-year-old engineer couldn’t have become CEO in more challenging circumstances. His predecessor Christophe de Margerie -- known for his easy charm and a well-groomed mustache -- had been enjoying three years of crude above $100 a barrel. Within months of taking over, Pouyanne was confronted with a global oil slump that eventually took prices below $30.“It’s hard to completely realize what it means to go from the top five of the company to becoming the boss,” Pouyanne told Bloomberg News in an interview in his office on the 44th floor of the company’s headquarters near Paris. In the worst industry downturn in a generation, Total’s 100,000 employees were suddenly his responsibility. “The way people look at you changes deeply, both within and outside the company.”Pouyanne rose to the challenge. Since the start of 2015, his first full year as CEO, Total’s oil and gas output has jumped 30% following a string of acquisitions. The company’s total return to shareholders over the period was 45%, outshining European rivals Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Eni SpA, though short of BP Plc’s 49% return, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“He’s proven to be a very strong leader,” said Jason Gammel, an analyst at Jefferies LLC. “After a great tragedy, he’s been able hit the ground running and really made the impression on the company.”For all that success, Pouyanne’s management style has left a less favorable impression on some people.In the past year, he mocked a French junior environment minister who had called Total’s major gas discovery in South African waters bad news for the environment. He labeled a proposal for France to fully switch to renewable gas by 2050 as “not very serious,” in front of Engie SA CEO Isabelle Kocher -- the plan’s main proponent. He sparred on Twitter with the boss of Electricite de France SA about the future of energy.Unlike most Western executives, he refused to boycott a business conference in Saudi Arabia in the wake of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying he’d rather continue to work openly with long-standing partner Aramco than do business behind the scenes.‘Eruptive Temper’“A lot of people fear him” and working with Pouyanne can be stressful, said Thierry Defresne, the representative of the CGT union in Total’s refining division.He recalled the CEO -- who has an imposing physical presence -- storming out of a workers’ committee meeting because he didn’t want to sit through hours of presentations that had already been given as printouts.“His eruptive temper is just the tip of the iceberg,” Philippe Sauquet, Total’s head of gas, renewables and power, said in an interview. “What’s important is the rest, his deep thinking and his absolute commitment to the company. People who know him get over it.”Pouyanne himself attributes this reputation more to his job title than his own nature. “Regardless of your personality -– Christophe probably had a different one –- people who enter a CEO’s office are always bit nervous,” he said. “You just have to be aware of it, and make sure that people speak their mind.”The other criticism of Pouyanne is a tendency to micro manage. During the downturn, he deprived site directors of their ability to make their own hiring decisions, said Defresne. After a series of accidents, the CEO personally decided that everyone working at any height above 1.5 meters (5 feet) should wear a safety harness, he said.“He’s struggling to trust people to implement his decisions,” Defresne said.The Deal-MakerPouyanne is a “strategist and a perfectionist” who wants to be involved in everything that matters for the company, said Sauquet. It’s a management style that, despite the criticism, has some notable successes.After securing a new 40-year oil concession agreement in Abu Dhabi three months into his tenure, the CEO followed with the $7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil in 2017, making Total the second biggest operator in the North Sea. A few months later, he made a bold move into Libya, spending $450 million to acquire Marathon Oil Corp.’s assets in the war torn country.Most recently, he jumped into the middle of the takeover battle for Anadarko Petroleum Corp., agreeing to buy the explorer’s African assets for $8.8 billion from Occidental Petroleum Corp., which had just prevailed over Chevron Corp. in a bidding war. Through all this activity, the Total CEO has kept an unusually tight rein over his deals, mostly relying on in-house experts to assess potential targets and sometimes making the first approach himself.“You have to be quick and to be discrete,” said Pouyanne. He already knew Anadarko’s assets fit well with Total’s portfolio, so he put together a team of about 10 people including Total’s Chief Financial Officer Patrick de La Chevardiere and the Head of Legal Affairs Aurelien Hamelle to handle the deal.“Several bankers had approached Vicki Hollub for other companies,” but Pouyanne said he contacted the Occidental CEO directly. “The fact that I personally wrote the email, she took that as a commitment.”Acquisitions haven’t just focused on oil. In 2016, he surprised investors by spending almost 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to buy Saft Groupe SA, a French battery maker. He further diversified into power in 2018 with the 2-billion euro acquisition of Direct Energie SA, France’s third-largest utility. That’s another deal where Pouyanne made the first approach directly, said Jacques Veyrat, a French entrepreneur who sold his 33% stake in the utility to Total.Pouyanne is a good deal-maker because he “thinks quicker than most people,” and is “a lot more straightforward than other French bosses,” said Anne-Marie Idrac, a former trade minister who’s been on Total’s board since 2012.Career ChangePouyanne and his wife, also an engineer by training, have four grown-up kids with a scientific education. The executive, who likes tennis and skiing, says he spends his time “trying to understand” what competitors are doing, and adds that remaining “agile” is key for the company.His penchant for moving fast and making bold decisions shows in his early career choices. He started in government, holding various administrative positions through the 1990s in departments including the Ministry of Industry and the office of the prime minister. In 1997, he joined Elf Aquitaine -- an oil company soon to be acquired by Total -- because in the private sector “you can take actions, you are judged on results.”He was posted first to Angola, then Qatar. Climbing the corporate ladder has taken him all over the world -- he was president of global refining and chemicals before becoming CEO -- visiting 130 or 140 nations so far. He plans to spend some time in Rwanda this summer to “see gorillas,” and has the ambition of visiting every country on the planet.“I take advantage of my holidays to discover the world, which allows me to step back from the frenzy that we live in,” he says, having recently traveled to Botswana, following the announcement of the Anadarko deal.Allies and critics alike say Pouyanne’s leadership style has evolved. He’s learned to listen more and “doesn’t mind if people open their mouth” and challenge him, said Defresne. He tests his ideas -- sometimes through texts in the middle of the night -- and can change his mind to improve a business plan or a deal, Sauquet said.“Of course I changed since I became CEO, everybody evolves with time,” Pouyanne said. “The future isn’t simple, we have plenty of challenges like climate change or geopolitical instability, but we also have the ability to be resilient, to innovate and be creative.”(Updates with personal details on Pouyanne in 23rd and 26th paragraphs.)To contact the reporter on this story: Francois de Beaupuy in Paris at fdebeaupuy@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Christopher SellFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-dealmaking-ceo-spends-040000515.html?.tsrc=rss

U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014 ban U.S. nationals and companies from helping organise long-term funding for some major Russian firms, including Novatek.  When the U.S. and the EU imposed sanctions on Russia, executives with foreign passports at companies affected including Novatek - the country's largest non-state natural gas producer - and state bank VTB handed over responsibility for organising new debt or equity issuance to colleagues without EU or U.S. passports.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/putin-gives-russian-citizenship-novateks-141835848.html?.tsrc=rss

Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, fell more than 10% last week to trade at the lowest levels since the summer of 2017 amid concern that a slowing world economy, coupled with record output from the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia, would continue to offset the 1.2 million barrel per day output cut agreed by OPEC members earlier this month in Vienna.  Against that backdrop, which has seen crude fall more than 38% since its early October peak, the United Arab Emirates energy minister told an industry conference Sunday that OPEC could re-visit its production cut agreement if it doesn't have an impact of prices.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6df94351-a999-30a7-a43d-35c7bf575dca/oil-prices-drift-lower-as-us.html?.tsrc=rss

The Fed's decision to lift its benchmark Fed Funds rate for the fourth time this year, while signalling two more hikes in 2019 and the continuing run-off of its $4 trillion balance sheet, has raised concern among global investors that tighter financing conditions in the world's largest economy will hamper growth prospects both at home at elsewhere.  Energy investors, in particular, are worried that a corresponding fall in oil demand will be compounded by record output from the world's largest producers, adding to a glut in global crude that will offset plans by OPEC to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day next year.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3f99c47c-941b-3e96-a1b9-67c0c97afd3e/oil-continues-plunge-to-fresh.html?.tsrc=rss

(clne) plunged 17% in morning trade Thursday, putting them on track for the biggest one-day loss in 20 months, after Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov turned bearish on the natural gas company, citing concerns over valuation after the ""excessive euphoria"" over the equity investment made by Total S.A.  (tot) The stock had rocketed 94% since the companies announced a strategic partnership and equity investment before the May 10 open.  Molchanov cut his rating to underperform from market perform, saying the rally has pushed the valuation to levels well above its peers, and that's assuming Congress revives the tax credit for natural gas fuels, which Molchanov said was far from certain."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/12ada706-edbe-39d9-96eb-12a7a5c7e1a8/clean-energy-fuels%26apos%3B.html?.tsrc=rss

The agreement, which was signed by Total in Mr. Macron and Mr. Putin’s presence Thursday evening, comes amid the White House’s attempts to isolate the Russian economy in response to Mr. Putin’s alleged meddling in U.S. elections and military interventions in Ukraine.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1c199a3a-6760-30e6-a83f-1b2ee2cdd26f/%5B%24%24%5D-macron%E2%80%99s-outreach-to.html?.tsrc=rss
