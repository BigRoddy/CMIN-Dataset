2021-04-22	2021-04-22 12:58:27	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Wall Street Roundup: Bullish & Bearish Calls Of The Day	With continued volatility in the market, TipRanks brings you the latest analyst action on some of your favorite stocks to help you navigate through the ups and downs. Let’s take a closer look at the top bullish and bearish calls of the day and see what market pundits are recommending. Upgrades 1. EMS-Chemie Holding AG UBS analyst Patrick Rafaisz upgraded EMS-Chemie (EMSHF) to Buy from Hold and increased the price target to CHF 850 from CHF 500, citing the company’s “reinvention as an EV play”. Rafaisz believes that the company’s content per eclectic vehicle might be as much as 10% higher than in a comparable internal combustion engine platform. The Wall Street community is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 1 Buy and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $926.04 implies 4.1% upside potential to current levels. 2. Crispr Therapeutics AG Jefferies analyst Maury Raycroft upgraded Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) to Buy from Hold and increased the price target to $172 from $165 based on the belief that the company’s renegotiated deal with Vertex Pharmaceuticals creates a large market opportunity and is “a win-win”. Furthermore, following the pullback in shares from the year-to-date highs, Raycroft sees a buying opportunity for the stock. TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 94% Bullish on CRSP, compared to a sector average of 69%. 3. Federal Signal Corp. Raymond James analyst Felix Boeschen upgraded Federal Signal (FSS) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $45 as the analyst suspects “the combination of a broad-based demand recovery in key verticals (street sweepers, dump bodies, safe digging trucks) is accelerating quicker than the market appreciates even before contemplating potential infrastructure bill benefits.” Furthermore, Boeschen believes “FSS would be among the biggest beneficiaries in our coverage given its substantial exposure to public revenues and industrial/ transportation infrastructure – particularly as we surmise FSS’s numerous capacity expansions (organic + M&A) over the last years have set the stage to profitably absorb incremental volumes.” Despite the upgrade, TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that confidence in Federal Signal is currently Negative, as 3 hedge funds decreased their cumulative holdings of the stock by 187,000 shares in the last quarter. 4. Cerecor Inc. Maxim Group analyst Jason McCarthy upgraded Cerecor (CERC) to Buy from Hold and maintained a price target of $7. In a note to investors, McCarthy said that the data released in early March related to the CERC-002 antibody indicates significant progress, and a licensing agreement with Kyowa Kiring aids the potential for the antibody in inflammatory-related conditions. Furthermore, the analyst believes that Cerecor’s CERC-007, which is targeting IL-18 and initially developed for multiple myeloma, should be a differentiating factor in a “crowded space”. The consensus rating among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 3 unanimous Buys. The average analyst price target stands at $6.67 and implies upside potential of 163.6% to current levels. 5. UnitedHealth Argus Research analyst David Toung upgraded UnitedHealth (UNH) to Buy from Hold and maintained a price target of $450 following the company’s “strong” 1Q earnings beat and upward outlook revision for fiscal 2021. According to Toung, in the first quarter, the company’s managed care segment reflected strong membership growth, while the Optum unit had a robust backlog. Furthermore, UnitedHealth’s top-line growth and margin expansion are the driving factors for ROI, the analyst added. UnitedHealth scores a 9 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations. Downgrades 1. Allison Transmission Holdings Raymond James analyst Felix Boeschen downgraded Allison Transmission (ALSN) to Hold from Buy. While Boeschen continues to “appreciate ALSN’s leading EBITDA margins/FCF profile in the wake of rising input costs across the complex, we see cyclical tailwinds forming (municipal budgets, tight freight market, oil & gas recovery) and we continue to believe that Allison’s role in alternative powertrains could be underappreciated anchored by its recently introduced E-GEN product lineup and extensive testing with its current customer base. We simply see little end in sight to what feels like a pervasive ‘multiple debate’ given the threat electrification could pose on Allison’s leading share/margins in the long-term.” The stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 1 Buy, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $42.80 implies 3.2% downside potential from current levels. 2. Lynas Rare Earths Limited Canaccord Genuity analyst Reg Spencer downgraded Lynas Rare Earths (LYSCF) to Hold from Buy and maintained a price target of A$6.25. Spencer cited the company’s valuation as the reason for the downgrade following the December quarter’s production results that were in line with analysts’ expectations and sales that were impacted by shipping issues. Furthermore, the analyst reduced his modelled utilization rates for 2021 to justify the continued transport and shipping issues. TipRanks’ Stock Investors tool shows that investors currently have a Very Negative stance on Lynas Rare Earths, with 6.4% of investors decreasing their exposure to LYSCF stock over the last seven days. 3. Jack In The Box Inc Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Mullan downgraded Jack In The Box (JACK) to Hold from Buy but increased the price target to $119 from $115. Mullan views the company’s risk/reward as “the most balanced it has been in quite some time.” Following the stock’s recent rally, the analyst is making a “negative call,” and “trying to exercise some discipline”. TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that confidence in Jack In The Box is currently Very Negative, as 7 hedge funds decreased their cumulative holdings of the stock by 241,400 shares in the last quarter. 4. Independence Realty BTIG analyst James W Sullivan downgraded Independence Realty (IRT) to Hold from Buy. In a note to investors, Sullivan said that though he has a positive stance on the company’s peer group-leading revenue growth for the Sunbelt markets, the valuation on the shares currently seems “stretched”. Furthermore, the analyst believes that Independence Realty Trust is currently “fairly valued” but should continue to perform well. The Wall Street community is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 3 analysts suggesting a Buy and 2 analysts recommending a Hold. The average analyst price target of $16.38 implies 1.6% downside potential to current levels. 5. Home Point Capital Merrill Lynch analyst Mihir Bhatia downgraded Home Point Capital (HMPT) to Sell from Buy and decreased the price target to $10 from $16 based on his cautious outlook on the mortgage origination sector. Bhatia believes that margins will remain under pressure, given a less favorable interest rate environment and rising competition. Furthermore, the analyst expects “solid” 1Q results but foresees the remainder of the year to be challenging. Home Point Capital gets a 1 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score ranking system suggesting that it is likely to underperform market expectations.

2021-04-16	2021-04-16 12:09:49	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	UnitedHealth 1Q Results Top Estimates; Raises Outlook	UnitedHealth Group reported 1Q results that beat consensus estimates. The health care company posted first-quarter EPS of $5.31 that came in ahead of analysts’ estimates of $4.38. Revenues in 1Q were $70.2 billion, up 9% year-on-year. Analysts were expecting revenues of $69.3 billion. UnitedHealth Group’s (UNH) CEO, Andrew Witty said, “The unique combined capabilities of Optum and UnitedHealthcare and the unwavering commitment of our people continue to helpadvance the way care is delivered, improving results for those we serve and shareholders.” The company’s Optum business reported 1Q revenues of $36.4 billion, up 10.8% year-on-year with revenue-per-consumer growing 31% year-on-year. Revenues from Optum made up around 93% of UNH’s total revenues in 1Q. OptumHealth served 99 million people at the end of 1Q compared to 96 million in the same quarter a year ago. United Health increased its earnings outlook for FY21 and expects it to be in the range of $17.15 to $17.65 per share, with adjusted EPS expected to land between $18.10 and $18.60 per share. The EPS outlook also includes around $1.80 per share “in potential net unfavorable impact to accommodate continuing COVID-19 effects, such as: testing and treatment costs.” (See UnitedHealth stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the earnings results, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper raised the price target from $375 to $425 and reiterated a Buy on the stock. Halper stated in a note to investors, “Similar to 4Q20, UNH’s results included a significant impact from positive prior period development (PPD). We appreciate the company’s conservatism when it estimates its claims expense. Most of the PPD was related to care deferral activity in 2H20.” “We maintain our above-consensus estimate at $18.50 [for FY21] noting that consensus of $18.19 will certainly be increasing. With 2021 off to a good start, we maintain our long-held view that UNH should be a core holding in all large-cap growth portfolios, given the company’s diversification, stable growth and healthy free cash flow generation,” Halper added. The consensus rating among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target stands at $415.64 and implies upside potential of 6.6% to current levels.

Over the last many years, you have heard us discuss our ambition to build high performing systems of care, including an aim to reinvent healthcare delivery, which is the first of our five strategic growth platforms. The foundations for those efforts are in our primary and multi-specialty care practices. OptumCare entered 2021 with over 50,000 physicians and 1,400 clinics. Over the course of this year, we expect to grow our employed and affiliated physicians by at least 10,000.

New business opportunities are substantial with momentum towards managed care adoption by states and RFP activity accelerating this year and next. And while the economic effects of COVID-19 impacted UnitedHealthcare’s employer-sponsored growth in 2020, we are encouraged by the positive market response to the new highly consumer-centric offerings we have been discussing with you in recent months. Among these are digital first, on-demand, and physician-led products each provide deeply aligned modern, personal, and coordinated-care experiences and save people up to 20% compared to traditional offerings.

As a reminder, a typical Oak Street center can serve approximately 3,500 patients at full capacity, implying that our quarter-ending portfolio of 67 stand-alone centers has the capacity to care for approximately 235,000 patients, which is over 3.5x the actual patients on our platform in Q3.

The healthcare giant’s 4Q sales rose 7.5% to $65.5 billion year-on-year, exceeding consensus estimates of $65.1 billion. Shares closed at $350.84 on Jan. 20. UnitedHealth (UNH) posted 4Q adjusted earnings of $2.52 per share, which beat analysts’ estimates of $2.40 per share. The company’s 4Q net EPS (earnings per share) of $2.30 fell from the $3.68 posted during the same quarter last year. Its adjusted EPS of $2.52 per share declined from $3.90 in 4Q19. This decline in earnings per share was largely related to higher healthcare costs due to Covid-19, the company said. For FY20, revenue rose 6% to $257.1 billion year-on-year, led by a 21% uptick in sales at its Optum business. Optum is UnitedHealth’s information technology-enabled health services business that serves different dimensions of the healthcare system including care providers, life sciences companies, and consumers. (See UNH stock analysis on TipRanks) UnitedHealth’s CEO, David S. Wichmann, commented, “We are grateful for the human spirit and resolve of our people, including our 125,000 clinicians who, with other frontline health care workers, demonstrated extraordinary collaboration, compassion and innovation.” The company affirmed its FY21 earnings outlook and expects net earnings of between $16.90 to $17.40 per share and adjusted net earnings of between $17.75 to $18.25 per share. According to UnitedHealth, this outlook includes a negative impact of approximately $1.80 per share due to Covid-19 that included testing and treatment costs and people deferring healthcare in 2020. Following the 4Q results, Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and set a price target of $375. “The company’s Optum business is a nice complement to its core managed care operations and continues to account for a large share of earnings,” Wiederhorn commented in a note to investors. Furthermore, UNH’s vertical integration strategy strengthens the company’s competitive positioning across many areas of the healthcare landscape.” Overall, analysts are bullish about the stock and the consensus is a Strong Buy with 16 analysts suggesting a Buy and 2 analysts recommending a Hold. The average price target of $396.44 implies 13% upside potential to current levels.

2021-01-06	2021-01-06 12:10:51	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	UnitedHealth to Purchase Change Healthcare for $8 Billion	(Bloomberg) -- UnitedHealth Group Inc. agreed to purchase Change Healthcare Inc. in a deal that values the health technology company at about $8 billion.UnitedHealth will pay $25.75 per share in cash, the companies said Wednesday, a 41% premium over Change Healthcare’s closing price Tuesday of $18.24. Including more than $5 billion in debt owed by Change Healthcare, the deal amounts to $13 billion.The deal will combine Change Healthcare with UnitedHealth’s OptumInsight unit to offer software, data analytics, technology and other services to the health-care industry.The acquisition is one of UnitedHealth’s largest and is another step in expanding the company’s health services business under its Optum division. The companies said the combination would help simplify services around medical care to improve health outcomes and lower costs.Both businesses inhabit the complex behind-the-scenes space of U.S. health care, where companies determine what medical care is appropriate and provide services to move information on claims and payments between insurers, medical providers, and patients.“Together we will help streamline and inform the vital clinical, administrative and payment processes on which health care providers and payers depend to serve patients,” Andrew Witty, president of UnitedHealth Group and chief executive officer of Optum, said in a news release.Change Healthcare rose 39% in premarket trading at 6:56 a.m. in New York. They had gained 16% in the past 12 months through Monday. UnitedHealth fell 2.3% in premarket trading.Broadening ReachIn recent years, UnitedHealth has broadened its reach well beyond health insurance. Through its Optum division, the company increasingly delivers medical care directly to patients and sells consulting, technology, and data to other health-care entities.Change Healthcare’s CEO, Neil de Crescenzo, will lead the combined business unit as the CEO of OptumInsight, the companies said. Nashville, Tennessee-based Change Healthcare has about 15,000 employees, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.OptumInsight is the smallest business unit in the Optum family by revenue, yet it has the highest operating margins of the company’s reported segments, exceeding 20% in each of the last three full years.The OptumInsight business accounted for about $2.8 billion in revenue in the three months ending Sept. 30, according to filings, or about 4% of the company’s total. That includes revenue from outside clients as well as “affiliated customers” within UnitedHealth Group. Change Healthcare reported revenue of $756 million in the same period.The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2021. Private equity funds affiliated with Blackstone Group Inc. that own about 20% of Change Healthcare’s common stock have agreed to vote in favor of it, the companies said. It’s expected to boost UnitedHealth’s adjusted earnings per share by $0.50 in 2022, the companies said.The acquisition is the second major health-care deal in the first week of 2021.

2020-11-19	2020-11-19 14:42:56	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Understanding UnitedHealth Group's Unusual Options Activity	"On Thursday, shares of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $344.57.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-11-20  * Strike Price: $340.00  * Volume: 215  * Open Interest: 1461Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday  * Analyzing UnitedHealth Group's Unusual Options Activity(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-13	2020-11-13 10:40:16	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Muddy Waters Takes on Michael Klein, and SPACs	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Carson Block of Muddy Waters Capital LLC made his name as a short seller targeting obscure Chinese companies. His latest critical report locks horns with some of the cream of the U.S. financial and business establishment, while taking aim at their beloved new fad: the special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.This is shaping up to be quite the fight.Block launched a short attack this week on MultiPlan Corp. The U.S. health-insurance data analytics company went public last month after merging with Churchill Capital Corp. III, one of former Citigroup rainmaker Michael Klein’s four listed SPACs.It’s not clear whether Block will win the argument that MultiPlan’s shares and debt are significantly overvalued. His assertion that SPAC sponsors extract excessive fees is worth a hearing, though.The Churchill deal valued MultiPlan at $11 billion, including its borrowings, and was one of the largest ever involving a SPAC. MultiPlan’s previous owner, private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, has kept a big stake in the business. H&F was just the latest in a string of private equity firms to own the company. Block contends that MultiPlan’s business has been in decline for several years and could be about to lose its biggest health-insurer client, UnitedHealth Group Inc., which accounts for 35% of its revenues. UnitedHealth is developing a similar analytics tool in-house. “In the great present-day money grab known as SPAC promotion, egregious mistakes will be made,” Block wrote in his typical take-no-prisoners style. “A business model that incentivizes promoters to do something — anything — with other people’s money is bound to lead to significant value destruction on occasion.”MultiPlan delivered a long rebuttal of Block’s claims on a Thursday investor call, arguing that its UnitedHealth relationship is expanding and that the latter’s Naviguard health-care analytics product is no substitute for MultiPlan’s. It also denied using creative accounting to conceal deteriorating performance. Its shares didn’t recover, however, extending their decline this week to 28%.SPACs have raised about $60 billion in North America this year but investors have become more circumspect lately about companies that go public this way. The IPOX SPAC index, a benchmark for this type of equity finance, has declined 12% since a September peak.  I’ve written before about how the pressure for SPACs to deploy investors’ money, plus the competition among SPACs to strike deals, could lead to poor returns. Coming soon after the short-seller takedown of another SPAC-backed company, hydrogen truck group Nikola Corp., it’s no wonder MultiPlan investors have been unsettled.In fairness, MultiPlan is (unlike Nikola) a long-established business, with almost $1 billion in annual revenue — although its sales have declined since 2017.Klein has raised more than $4 billion from investors for his various SPACs, putting him in the upper echelons of SPAC sponsors. Tech billionaire Michael Dell and Saudi Arabia’s wealth fund have invested in the MultiPlan transaction, according to the prospectus, while Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs, is a partner of the Churchill sponsor via her venture capital and philanthropic organization, Emerson Collective.Klein is in the process of raising a fifth SPAC and has formed a high-caliber brain trust, called Archimedes Advisors, to consult with and help source deal opportunities. Among these advisors are Jony Ive, Apple’s ex-chief designer, and Alan Mulally, former chief executive officer of Ford Motor Co. They both have a financial interest in the success of the SPACs, according to a disclosure.Those involved in Klein’s first SPAC, which acquired scientific-data company Clarivate Analytics in 2019, have almost trebled their money (not including any return from share warrants). In contrast, MultiPlan’s shares are now more than 35% below the price at which Klein’s third SPAC purchased them.It would be surprising if Klein had failed to do sufficient diligence on MultiPlan, as Block alleges, because he’s known the company for years. Klein advised Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway on a potential bid for MultiPlan several years back, he told investors recently (Buffett didn’t bite).(1)This time around, Klein’s former employer Citi helped advise on the MultiPlan deal, along with Klein’s own boutique investment firm, M. Klein & Company. His advisory firm was paid about $30 million for advising on the transaction, about half of which was paid in MultiPlan stock (and is subject to vesting conditions) and another $8 million was donated to charity, according to the prospectus.The SPAC sponsors — Klein’s firm, various financial partners and the brain trust — received 27.5 million MultiPlan shares, worth $172 million at current prices, effectively for free. Their total holdings could almost double if warrants to purchase further stock become exercisable.At least Klein is subject to a performance hurdle on his one-third portion of the founder shares, as well as a chunk of the share warrants. They’ll only vest if the stock rises above $12.50 for 40 trading days during the next four years. Currently the stock is at about half that level, so he’s got work to do. The sponsor shares are also locked up until 2022.At this stage, MultiPlan’s stock-market performance is probably more of a worry than the investors’ potential rewards. A comprehensive rebuttal to Block from Klein, who’s a MultiPlan director but didn’t take part in the investor call, would be a good place to start making amends to his powerful friends.(1) Klein told an investor call he’d spoken to executives representing 65% of Multiplan’s revenue base who told him Multiplan was critical to their operations.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.

2020-11-06	2020-11-06 15:24:56	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Analyzing UnitedHealth Group's Unusual Options Activity	"On Friday, shares of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $347.01.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-12-18  * Strike Price: $380.00  * Volume: 346  * Open Interest: 757Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

UBH case provides class-wide relief for patients with mental health and substance use disordersRuling is a stern warning to insurers that do not base decisions on generally accepted standards of mental health careLOS ANGELES, Nov. 04, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A federal judge has ordered court-appointed supervision and 10-year injunctions for health insurance giant United Behavioral Health (UBH), a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH). After its employees complete court-ordered training on generally accepted standards of behavioral health care, UBH will be required to reprocess 67,000 mental health and substance use disorder treatment claims that it illegally denied over a six-year period. Psych-Appeal is co-counsel to the plaintiffs in this class action.The November 3, 2020, remedies order is the latest development in the landmark mental health class action, Wit v. UBH. Having previously found that UBH breached its fiduciary duties to over 50,000 insureds by denying their mental health and substance use claims based on pervasively flawed medical necessity criteria, Chief Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California determined that, for a 10-year period, UBH must exclusively apply guidelines developed by nonprofit clinical specialty associations.“This order brings us one step closer to final relief for UBH insureds subjected to years of systematic misconduct,” said Meiram Bendat of Psych-Appeal and co-counsel for the plaintiffs, who uncovered the UBH guideline flaws. “The federal court has sent a clear message that when insurers promise to evaluate mental health claims pursuant to generally accepted standards of care, they will be held accountable to those standards. Profit motives will not be allowed to infect the claims administration process.”In 2008, Congress passed the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. While the federal law requires parity for mental health and substance use benefits, it also allows insurers to evaluate claims for medical necessity. However, by developing or purchasing their own medically necessary criteria, insurers have been able to circumvent parity in favor of financial considerations and prevent patients from receiving the type and amount of care they actually require. Some states, like California, have swiftly responded to the court’s findings in Wit and recently enacted strict legislation to close this loophole.Wit et al. v. United Behavioral Health and Alexander et al. v. United Behavioral Health, were brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) in 2014, certified in 2016 and tried in October 2017. On March 5, 2019, Judge Spero ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, a watershed moment that is changing the mental health parity landscape in the United States.The remedies ruling affects UBH insureds who were denied outpatient, intensive outpatient and residential treatment from 2011 to 2017. Only ERISA participants and beneficiaries are class members in this lawsuit. The statute does not allow plaintiffs to collect punitive monetary awards. Non-ERISA insureds, such as government employees, who were denied coverage under the same flawed guidelines, are required to rely on regulators to hold UBH accountable.“The next step in mental health parity is now firmly in the hands of state and federal governments,” said Bendat. “It is up to our elected officials to enforce the parity laws that exist and implement new measures, such as SB 855 recently passed in California.”Psych-Appeal and Zuckerman Spaeder were appointed class counsel by the federal court and represent plaintiffs in several class actions against other insurers.About Psych-Appeal  Psych-Appeal is the first private law firm in the United States exclusively dedicated to mental health insurance advocacy on behalf of patients and providers. The firm is recognized as a national leader in the area of mental health parity, spearheading numerous high-profile cases and collaborating with The Kennedy Forum and The Saks Institute for Mental Health Law, Policy, and Ethics.

2020-10-23	2020-10-23 17:13:54	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Why GoodRx Stock Is Now a Screaming ‘BUY’	"When GoodRx (NASDAQ:GDRX) stock debuted in September, its price immediately leaped 60%, peaking at $57 in early October. Regular investors couldn’t have bought shares at any reasonable value, so I wrote GDRX stock off as “yet another high-priced 2020 IPO.”
Source: II.studio / Shutterstock.com

	
Shares, however, have since declined to a more reasonable $52. At this price, it’s time to take a serious look into this game-changing company.
That’s because, in April, the federal agency responsible for Medicare changed its guidelines on telemedicine reimbursements. With insurers now required to cover remote doctor visits at parity, the floodgates for telehealth companies like GoodRx have finally opened. And with its high-growth strategy and proven executive team, GoodRx is in pole position to become the next Amazon of healthcare.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
GoodRx Stock: From Pharmacy to Telehealth
As I’ve emphasized before, investments with 1,000% potential returns need three key things:
A growing market.
A proven product or management team.
A catalyst that tells us, “why now?”
The fourth qualification — price — is also essential, but depends more on market size.
Miss one of them, and you end up with either 1) a well-run but slow-growing company or 2) a high-potential firm that goes nowhere.
Fortunately for investors, GoodRx hits all three qualifications for a 1,000% returner. The company was founded in 2011 by former Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) engineers, and its flagship product, an online prescription price comparison tool, already has almost 5 million monthly users. The firm is highly profitable, and its telehealth marketplace opened at just the right moment in history.


					7 Airline Stocks to Buy on Pelosi Stimulus Hopes				

So, for those who are tired of high-priced, money-losing IPOs, here’s why GoodRx stock looks different.
Reason No. 1: CMS Gives GoodRx Stock A Real Catalyst
With new technologies, people should always ask: “Why now?”
That’s because innovations often need the right environment to grow. Video sharing sites like ShareYourWorld.com (founded in 1997) wouldn’t have worked until high-speed broadband came around in the mid-2000s.
And in medicine, mail-order pharmacies and telehealth companies have been around for years. Pharmacy benefit management (PBM) company Catamaran had a large mail service pharmacy, which UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) eventually bought in 2015 for $12.8 billion. Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC), a telemedicine company, has been around since 2002. Yet, telehealth still makes up just 1.5% of the healthcare market.
And that’s why catalysts are so crucial to high-growth companies like GoodRx.

Covid-19 Creates a Catalyst
In April, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) created a flurry of new reimbursement regulations to allow doctors and patients to stay home. Under Section 1135 waivers, healthcare providers can now provide virtually all non-physical services online. That includes everything from new patient visits to wheelchair management training.
And where Medicare goes, the rest of insurance follows.
As private insurers realign billing practices to mirror Medicare, investors should expect both supply and demand of telehealth medicine to skyrocket. And that’s where GoodRx comes in.
Reason No. 2: GoodRx and a Growing Market
Today, GoodRx earns money from its prescription drug price comparison website. Users can search for the cheapest drug providers, and GoodRx receives a commission from PBMs for the referral. It’s an extremely lucrative business (earning the company eye-popping 36% margins in 2019) and growing revenues at 50% per year. Independently, GoodRx might be worth $20 billion in that space.
Then something even more interesting happened. In April 2019, the company acquired telehealth company HeyDoctor, and in March 2020, it launched the GoodRx Telehealth marketplace.
These additions couldn’t have come at a better time. In 2018, Americans spent $335 billion on prescription drugs, according to the CMS. And a large portion is still covered by insurance, reducing the usefulness of GoodRx’s price comparison tool. On the other hand, physician services took in $564 billion, which makes it a far broader market for telehealth. And that doesn’t include possible telehealth applications, in-home healthcare ($102 billion annual spend), other personal care ($552 billion) or nursing care ($168 billion).
If GoodRx can turn its highly efficient marketing funnel toward acquiring telehealth customers, the company could become worth multiples of its current valuation.
Reason No. 3: Strong Product, Strong Management
The numbers paint a flattering picture of the online health company. GoodRx has been profitable since 2016, an impressive feat for a fast-growing software company. It’s consistently kept R&D and administrative spending under control, using just 3.7% of revenues on overhead costs. And its share-based compensation of just $3.7 million in 2019 also indicates a focus on shareholder value. Recent IPO Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), by comparison, awarded $78.3 million in share-based compensation in 2020, despite generating just 68% of GoodRx’s revenue and negative profits.
And what about its actual product? App reviews are overwhelmingly positive, with users applauding the company over their prescription drug savings. GoodRx needs excellent customer experiences to keep its pipeline of referrals up.

What’s GoodRx Stock Worth?
Here’s where investors should rightly worry. The company’s monthly users dropped from 5 million in March to 4.2 million in April when the coronavirus pandemic took hold. Though users have steadily climbed back to 4.9 million, it’s a reminder that GoodRx must fight for repeat customers. (Mail-order pharmacies, on the other hand, generate endless income streams from chronic prescriptions).
There are also other concerns: Single-payer healthcare reform could instantly sink the GoodRx pharmacy franchise — users would no longer have a reason to price-compare drugs. A stronger competitor could also derail the online healthcare firm’s growth.
And that makes GoodRx challenging to value. A traditional two-stage DCF model that grows revenues to $9 billion by 2030 pegs the company at a $34 billion enterprise value, or $92 per share. That’s an 84% upside. However, raising the discount rate (a measure of risk) to 11% drops fair enterprise value to $20.2 billion, or $52 per share.
A more aggressive approach might use a venture-capital (VC) method of market sizing. It’s less precise but gives better insight into untapped markets. Currently, analysts expect the global telehealth industry to grow 23.4% annually through 2026. Suppose we assume that U.S. telehealth grows faster at 55% (thanks to the CMS rule change). That suggests a $142 billion market by 2026, or 2.5% of total healthcare spending. If GoodRx receives a 12% “take rate” and obtains a 30% market share, it would earn $5.1 billion from telehealth revenues alone. Adding another $4 billion from pharmacy services and a 8x price-sales (PS) multiple puts value at $72.8 billion, or almost $200 per share.
All this means that GoodRx still has a lot to prove. Even though it hits all three “high-growth” company points, we won’t know for years if it’s the next successful Amazon or the next failing Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK). But until then, it could be worthwhile to make a small wager. Because in the world of high-growth investing, it just takes one winner to make your portfolio shine.

2020-10-14	2020-10-14 13:24:54	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	UnitedHealth Reports 3Q Profit Beat Led By Optum Growth	UnitedHealth beat quarterly profit expectations as the US healthcare giant saw continued growth, led by its Optum unit, while underlying business performance remained strong. Shares are up 1.1% in Wednesday’s pre-market trading session.UnitedHealth (UNH) said adjusted earnings of $3.51 per share in the third quarter dropped 10% year-on-year, but exceeded analysts’ estimates of $3.09 per share. Revenues for the quarter grew 8% to $65.1 billion year-on-year, beating the Street consensus by $1.15 billion. The company noted that total sales were driven by a 21% increase in revenue from its Optum unit, which manages drug benefits and offers healthcare data analytics services.The third quarter medical care ratio (MCR) - percentage of premiums paid out for medical service – stood at 81.9% compared to 82.4% last year. Analysts were expecting a loss ratio of 83.55%.UnitedHealth said its year-to-date return on equity of 28.9% reflects continued strong operating performance and the temporary impact of care deferrals earlier in the year.Looking ahead, the company expects “future periods will reflect the resumption of more typical care patterns and continued COVID-19 treatment and testing costs, against the continued backdrop of an uncertain economic recovery”.On the back of third-quarter results, UnitedHealth raised its full year earnings per share outlook for 2020 to $15.65 to $15.90 per share from $15.45-15.75. The company now expects 2020 adjusted net earnings of $16.50 to $16.75 per share compared with $16.25-16.55 per share previously.Shares in UNH have climbed 13% year-to-date, and the stock has a bullish Strong Buy analyst consensus. That's with an average analyst price target of $350.32 (5.7% upside potential).Oppenheimer analyst analyst Michael Wiederhorn reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $353 price target, saying that the company's Optum business is a nice complement to its core managed care operations and continues to account for a large share of earnings.“Given the pandemic and large consumer assistance measures, there were a number of moving parts this quarter, but UnitedHealthcare drove the beat, driven by the MCR of 81.9% as the decline in utilization more than offset the impact from financial assistance,” Wiederhorn wrote in a note to investors.

2020-09-25	2020-09-25 21:05:03	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: RAD, NCLH, PENN, UNH	After a tough week, stocks put together a decent rally on Friday. Let's look at a few top stock trades going into next week, the last week of September.  Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Rite Aid (RAD)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comRite Aid (NYSE:RAD) shares are under significant pressure for the second straight day. The stock ended the day down about 9% on Friday, after falling almost 18% on Thursday on earnings.The stock made a decisive close below the September low on Thursday and the selling is continuing on Friday. Now, there are two levels to keep an eye on.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat puts the March low in play at $9.24, followed by the December gap-fill at $8.36.  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy on Robinhood Now On the upside, investors must see if RAD stock can reclaim $11. If so, it puts the 20-day moving average in play, followed by the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. However, at current levels shares are sort of in no man's land until it can either reclaim some higher levels or decline further.  Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comOn Monday, Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) gapped below the 50-day moving average, then struggled to reclaim that mark all week.On Friday, though, Norwegian gapped higher by more than 13% and reclaimed the 50-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line). Reclaiming a key area is attractive, but this one is no layup.From here, let's see if bulls can reclaim the 20-day moving average. If so, it puts the $18.75 area in play, followed by the 23.6% retracement at $19.48. Above that opens the door to a possible rally toward the 200-day moving average and the June high near $27. On the downside, however, be cautious on a close below the 50-day moving average. Below this week's low (at $14.15) puts the August low in play at $12.56. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Penn National Gaming (PENN)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comPenn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) has been volatile lately. No, it's not because of the volatility in the overall market, but rather, thanks to a secondary offering. In fact, shares had been holding up well before that news.For now, though, shares are rebounding and reclaiming the 10-day moving average. On the upside, I want to see if shares can back push up to $75. That's around the two-times range extension and the current all-time highs.Above that may open the door to a longer term price target near $96.50 -- the 261.8% extension.  * 3 Small-Cap Stocks To Buy For Large Cap Potential On the downside, a break of the two-day low at $62.25 and the 161.8% extension could put the 50-day moving average in play. Below that may open the door to a larger correction down toward $40. To get to $40 would likely take a broader market correction as well. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 4: United Health (UNH)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) has been under pressure this month. However, it's been carving out a low near $292 this week. Look at the last five days of action. Shares had a responsive bounce back to $300 on Monday. Then slowly churned its way down toward $290 and gave us a doji stick on Thursday, which can be indicative of a reversal. Once we got the doji-and-up -- when UNH took out Thursday's high (the doji day) on Friday -- momentum began to return. Buyers drove it to the 10-day moving average, where we now wait for a decision. Above $300 opens the door to the 50-day moving average. Above that and $320 is on the table. If UNH can't reclaim the 10-day moving average it keeps $290 and the 200-day moving average in play. A close below the 200-day moving average could put $275 on the table, the double-bottom low from May and June.

2020-09-25	2020-09-25 15:51:34	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Why Centene Is the Most Important Healthcare Stock	On the surface, Centene (NYSE:CNC) seems to be the healthcare stock most threatened by today's politics. In fact, it and CNC stock may be the least threatened. By making a profit on Medicare and Medicaid contracts, Centene has transformed health care in a way that goes beyond politics.Source: Shutterstock While Centene has transformed America's largest industry, it has done relatively little for investors lately. Over the last two years, shares are down 23%. The stock opened for trade Sept. 24 at $55 per share. That's a market cap of $31.8 billion, a price-earnings ratio of just 17.5. It's worth barely one-third its annual revenue of $91 billion.Founded in 1984 by a hospital bookkeeper, Centene has become a giant under Michael Neidorff, who became CEO when the company was doing $40 million in business per year a quarter-century ago.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Centene's Secret SauceThe secret sauce of Centene is no secret. It's called managed care. Non-profits like Kaiser Permanente have been all about managed care for years. Neidorff simply brought the model to the for-profit market.  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy on Robinhood NowUnder managed care, costs are controlled by owning clinics and other facilities which deliver it. Managed care also focuses on prevention, on keeping patients out of the hospital. About 75% of America's medical bills come from chronic conditions, diseases like diabetes and heart disease. By staying on top of patients, with preventive care and careful monitoring of medications, Centene keeps people out of the hospital.This lets Centene make a small profit on Medicare and Medicaid contracts, despite constant political pressure to cut those costs. This is a business its rivals don't touch, except for &quot;Medigap&quot; plans that enhance Medicare.For the second quarter of 2020 Centene earned $1.2 billion, $2.05 per fully diluted share, on revenue of $27.7 billion. Revenue was up 50%, and profits up 250% from a year earlier, thanks to its acquisition of Wellcare, a $17 billion deal that closed in January. Why the Fall of CNC Stock?Investors are down on Centene for what seem like good reasons. Its margins are lower than those for traditional insurers like United Healthcare (NYSE:UNH), Cigna (NYSE:CI) and Humana (NYSE:HUM). But its business model is more sustainable.While its rivals were losing customers during the pandemic, Centene added 1.1 million of them. Its model lets it consistently price policies on Healthcare.gov for less than rivals, and deliver more care.The fact Centene is an Obamacare winner is why investors have been dumping the shares. The death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg sent shares down nearly 10%. Investors believe the law will soon be declared unconstitutional and Centene will lose that business. Even if it isn't, many believe Democrats will replace Medicare with a government-run plan.Both sides of the argument are wrong. Managed care delivers better care for less than conventional insurance. If the exchanges are closed, Centene will find other ways to get that business. The Biden healthcare plan, meanwhile, doesn't call for people to only be offered a state-run Medicare. It suggests consumers be able to buy into Medicare. The easiest way to do that would be through Centene. The Bottom LineWhile investors have soured on Centene, analysts haven't.There are seven following the stock on TipRanks and five say &quot;buy&quot; it. Their average price target of $78.21 is 42% ahead of its current price. The 20 Centene analysts covered by Marketbeat also have a consensus rating of &quot;buy&quot; with a price target of $83.Personally, I like Centene for the same reason many analysts now like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). By linking the income of payments to the outgo of clinics, they have built a better health care mousetrap. Managed care works, politics be damned.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

2020-09-04	2020-09-04 13:01:02	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Return On Capital Employed Overview: UnitedHealth Group	UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) posted Q2 earnings of $8.90 billion, an increase from Q1 of 92.18%. Sales dropped to $62.14 billion, a 3.54% decrease between quarters. In Q1, UnitedHealth Group brought in $64.42 billion in sales but only earned $4.63 billion.What Is ROCE? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in UnitedHealth Group's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. In Q2, UnitedHealth Group posted an ROCE of 0.13%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on UNHReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For UnitedHealth Group, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q2 Earnings Recap UnitedHealth Group reported Q2 earnings per share at $7.12/share, which beat analyst predictions of $5.18/share.See more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday  * Return On Capital Employed Overview: UnitedHealth Group(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-03	2020-09-03 13:58:51	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	A Tale of 3 Dow Jones Stocks; 2 to Buy and 1 to Avoid	The Dow Jones Industrial Average, long the key index of the stock market’s overall movements and health, has been holding above 28,000 for two weeks now. The index hasn’t seen these levels since late February – it’s rise now is being taken as an indicator that the Dow is moving to catch up with the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ, both of which are regularly setting new record levels.With the Dow clearly back on an upward trajectory, now is the time to start looking at the component stocks; after all, an index is nothing more than the sum of its parts, and while it maybe useful as an analytical tool, those parts have something to say, too.So now let’s tell a tale of three stocks on the Dow, showing how some parts can move up, and others down, while the index as a whole gains. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, we lined up the three alongside each other to get the lowdown on what the near-term holds for these Dow players.Coca-Cola Company (KO)The first stock on our list, Coca Cola, is a long-time favorite of investing great Warren Buffett. Buffett is not shy about his opinions, and his love for Coke, as an investment and a product, is well documented. He has said of the latter, If I eat 2700 calories a day, a quarter of that is Coca-Cola.”Regarding Coke as an investment, however, Buffett’s insight is keen: “No business has ever failed with happy customers… and you’re selling happiness.” Coca Cola has a great brand built up around its flagship drink, one that it has used to promote a much wider portfolio of products. The company makes and distributes over 350 different brands in 200 countries around the world. Late last month, Coke announced that it will be streamlining its management structure, to improve efficiency during and beyond the pandemic.The COVID pandemic, however, has hit Coke hard. Social lockdowns kept customers home and stores closed, while trade and restrictions disrupted both supply and distribution chains. It was a retailer’s nightmare. EPS managed to beat forecasts in Q1, but fell off 33% in Q2. Since Q4 of last year, revenue has fallen sequentially from $9.1 billion to $8.6 billion to $7.2 billion.Even during the pandemic, Coke kept up its regular dividend payments. The company next declared payment date is October 1, which will be the third payment at the current level of 41 cents per common share. Coke has an 11-year history of gradually raising the dividend, which is currently yielding 3.3%.Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers sees a clear path forward for Coke. He writes, “Management changes give us greater confidence in KO's ability to exit the current pandemic in a stronger position than from which it entered. If successful, we see them helping to enable significant cost efficiencies already directionally envisioned in DB estimates, while at the same time driving quicker decision-making and less overlap/redundancy with local bottling operations… this new organizational structure should also allow KO to better unlock and uncover new revenue opportunities, particularly in its less scaled beverage categories…”In line with his optimism, Powers rates KO stock a Buy. Meanwhile, his $55 price target suggests a 7.5% upside growth from current levels. (To watch Powers’ track record, click here)Overall, with 10 analyst reviews, including 9 Buys and a single Hold, KO has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus. This Dow standard is currently selling for $51.19, and the average price target of $54.7 implies a 7% upside. (See KO stock analysis on TipRanks)UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Next on our list is UnitedHealth, the world’s largest provider of health insurance policies. UNH brings in more than $240 billion in annual revenues and boasts a market cap of $304 billion. With over 130 million customers signed up around the world, UnitedHealth has the customer base and the deep pockets to weather the pandemic. United Health’s Q2 results show how the company has met the challenges of COVID-19. EPS surged 91%, to $7.12, on $62 billion in revenue. The company credited a historically low medical loss ratio of 70% for the big jump in earnings, and maintained its full-year guidance of $16.25 to $16.55 per share.Looking ahead, UNH warns that Q3 may see a rise in business costs. Paradoxically, this will come from an increase in business. As lockdown and distancing policies ease, the company predicts that more customers will catch up on deferred medical treatments, resulting in an increase of claims to be paid.Frank Morgan, 5-star analyst with RBC, was impressed with UNH’s second quarter: “The quarter dramatically exceeded Street expectations and were within range of our estimate... With inpatient, outpatient, physician office, pharmaceutical, and other activity continuing to show signs of recovery in 2H20, mgmt maintained FY20 guidance, however we believe this could prove conservative.”In line with those comments, Morgan rates UNH stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $384 price target. The target implies a 20% upside for the coming year. (To watch Morgan’s track record, click here)UnitedHealth’s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 17 reviews, breaking down to 15 Buys and just 2 Holds. The shares are selling for $321.58, and the average price target of $350.35 suggests room for a 9% upside in the next 12 months. (See UNH stock analysis on TipRanks)American Express (AXP)The last stock on our Dow list, American Express, has a less bullish outlook. Amex, based in New York City, is one of the world’s best-known financial service providers, and its credit cards, charge cards, and travelers’ checks have long been ubiquitous. The company’s marketing reflects this, and until 2005 the company’s charge-card slogan was ‘Don’t leave home without it.’The pandemic, however, by reducing commerce, took a heavy toll on the company. Quarterly revenues have slid almost 25% since the start of the year, and are down to $6.1 billion. EPS fell a dramatic 85% in Q2, dropping from $1.98 per share to just 29 cents. Yet, that number was far better than the 13-cent EPS forecast.Falling revenues, sliding earnings, and a share price that has yet to recover – all of these underly the recent caution that Wall Street is expressing on Amex. Writing for Compass Point, William Ryan says, “In 2021, we are still expecting a slower recovery at AXP relative to other issuers as T&E spending trends take longer to recover than other categories… Shares of AXP have historically traded between 12x-16x, and we believe it is fair to value the company on the lower end of this range due to the disproportionate impact that lower T&E spending is having on AXP relative to other issuers… We believe revenue will remain suppressed as spending volume stays at lower levels in the near future until the environment is more conducive for T&E to recover.”Ryan rates AXP shares as Neutral (i.e. Hold), and his $85 price target, suggesting a 20.5% downside to the stock for the coming year, indicates just how little confidence he has. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)Ryan’s caution is typical. Of the 19 analyst reviews on this stock, 11 are Hold and 3 are Sell, against 5 Buys. The average share price, at $102, suggests a 5% downside from the current share price of $107.28.

2020-09-02	2020-09-02 20:08:56	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	How to Profit From the Momentum Behind UnitedHealth Stock	The healthcare sector is at the heart of the novel coronavirus. Consequently, names like UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) have enjoyed more investor interest than usual. Bulls are now hoping UNH stock will break out into new all-time highs. Therein lies the opportunity to own this stock.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com If you already hold long positions, than you are safe to wait out the current battle. The trigger for UNH stock to start a new leg higher would be if shares pass $325. If you are not already long, that move past $325 should serve as your cue to start buying shares.Conversely, if shares start to fade, a move toward $300 would represent another great buying opportunity. Why? There is support at least $15 below current prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd, if by any means the bears take charge and get UNH stock down to the $290 level, treat that as a third opportunity to add or initiate a long position. Don't Overthink It: UNH Stock Is CheapUNH stock is fundamentally cheap, with a price-earnings ratio of just 17.6 times. Also, given that its price-sales ratio is just 1.2 times, there is hardly any froth in the current stock price.In other words, unless something major happens to the company, owning UnitedHealth at these levels is not likely to be a financial mistake. It also means that owners of UNH stock should have the confidence to shrug off periodic corrections and maintain their positions.  * 10 Long-Term Stocks to Buy to Profit From Secular Trends This is important for investors to know, because the entire stock market seems a little frothy now. Factoring in political unrest, you should expect some shake-ups in the market over the next few weeks.However, at least when it comes to UNH stock, there is no need to worry. Buyers have come in at every dip, and it will take something significant to break this bullish trend.However, there is one thing that is important to note. If bulls lose $303, sellers could take over and drive shares down another $15. This would still be within the support zones I outlined above, so it is not a long-term issue.Simply put, UNH has strong support which emboldens the bulls to work on their upside momentum. There is not much reason to worry about downside risk here. A Move in UnitedHealth Is ComingSource: Charts by TradingView The recent price action is getting tighter, indicating that a move is coming. For now, the direction of that move is unclear. The battle lines are between $303 and the new all-time high. Any breach of either of those lines should carry some momentum.So what should you do? The opportunity is to either chase the breakout or buy the dip, whichever comes first. Those who know how to use options have the opportunity to sell the October $250 put and collect $2.20 for it. This way, you do not even need a rally to profit, and the stock can fall 20% before you lose any money. The break-even from this would be $247.80.It is important to remember that regardless of how good the story looks for UNH stock, it trades inside of an entire stock market. If that finally corrects then it will drag UNH with it. Therefore, at these altitudes, all investors should be humble with their assumptions. Taking partial trades is better than loading up all at once.On the date of publication, Nicolas Chahine did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2020-08-06	2020-08-06 18:24:47	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Return On Capital Employed Overview: UnitedHealth Group	UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) posted Q2 earnings of $8.90 billion, an increase from Q1 of 92.18%. Sales dropped to $62.14 billion, a 3.54% decrease between quarters. In Q1, UnitedHealth Group earned $4.63 billion, whereas sales reached $64.42 billion.What Is Return On Capital Employed? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in UnitedHealth Group's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. In Q2, UnitedHealth Group posted an ROCE of 0.13%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on UNHROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows UnitedHealth Group is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For UnitedHealth Group, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q2 Earnings Recap UnitedHealth Group reported Q2 earnings per share at $7.12/share, which beat analyst predictions of $5.18/share.See more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) is the country's dominant health insurance company. Over the last five years UNH stock has risen nearly 30% per year, its dividend rising from 50 cents to $1.25 per quarter. That's about 50% better than the average Nasdaq stock.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com A secret to its steady gain is pessimism. Headline writers are always afraid it's about to fall out of bed. Commentary on its June quarter earnings, delivered July 15, was typical. Net earnings were $3.38 billion, $3.60 per share, on revenue of $60.6 billion.Yes, UNH stock crushed expectations on earnings, journalists wrote. But guidance was low, revenues were short, the virus spells trouble, and the stock fell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat sound you hear is opportunity knocking. The Secret Sauce of UNH StockUNH's secret sauce is technology.The company's Optum unit used the sweet, sweet cash of the Obama-era stimulus to integrate a suite of applications into its electronic health record. It bought a pharmacy benefit manager, now OptumRX, giving it visibility on drug costs. Optum has helped it move profitably into managed care, which is what &quot;insurance&quot; buyers really want.  * 15 Growth Stocks That Are Being Propped Up By Low RatesOptum's venture arm lets it get into new niches as they appear. In April, the company bought AbleTo, which does mental health services remotely, for $470 million. Optum's venture arm had put money into the company just last year.When trends emerge in the market, Optum matches them. Some 230,000 diabetic customers are getting Fitbits and glucose monitors to keep them out of the hospital.  The &quot;pilot program&quot; will then be rolled out to self-insured customers.That's another part of UNH's secret. For many big employers, health insurance isn't insurance. Self-insured companies pay UnitedHealth to manage their programs. They pay UNH's cost of care, plus a premium. Think of it as a general contractor for health. It's one reason the company can steadily bring 5% of revenue to the net income line. A Loud DownsideYet most of the headlines you read about UNH are negative. You read about their getting sued for moving money around, or gouging patients on prices.The fact is that UnitedHealth would prosper even in a Medicare for All scheme because it has the technology to manage it. Such a system would give OptumRX more control over drug prices, encourage it to buy or sign alliances with more facilities, and bring in millions of customers. The alternative would be to stand up a federal system all at once, a wildly expensive and complicated task.Besides, managing Medicare and Medicaid contracts has become a profitable market niche. UNH is a big player in Medicare Advantage plans. AARP is practically a marketing arm of UnitedHealth. The Bottom Line on UNH StockNumbers don't lie.UnitedHealth is a bargain stock and Wall Street professionals know it.The company's dividend of $1.25 per share looks small. The current yield is just 1.64%. But it grows steadily and it's affordable. The price-earnings ratio remains a market-trailing 17. UnitedHealth entered the pandemic with $21 billion of cash on the books, and its cash flow from operations has doubled over the last five years.A retirement fund manager who puts some UNH stock in her plan is giving employees a base on which to build. Holders are practically a who's who of institutions and large mutual funds.UNH stock isn't a thoroughbred. It's a good draft horse. It's not flashy but it does the job. It's liquid, so institutions can treat it like a bank. They can get in when things look tough, then get out when there's something else they want to chase.You can do the same with your retirement account.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

2020-07-16	2020-07-16 17:16:40	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Covid Leaves Its Mark on Three Health Giants	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Health-care earnings season is firmly here, with reports now in from three pillars of the sector: pharmacy giant Walgreen Boots Alliance Inc., health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. and drug-and-device conglomerate Johnson & Johnson. Against the backdrop of a global pandemic, each had a singular quarter. And while experiences varied given the different niches each of the companies occupy, taken together they present a comprehensive picture of the outbreak’s impact on the industry and the risks it still poses.Walgreens, the first to report on July 9, was the hardest hit in many respects because its pharmacy counters are surrounded by retail offerings that were affected by economy-slowing efforts to contain the virus. The results also point to big trans-Atlantic differences in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. A stringent U.K. lockdown led to enormous sales declines at the company’s stores there. Varied and often shorter U.S. shutdowns kept North American sales comparatively high. Margins fell on both sides of the pond as people spent more on essentials and less on makeup and skincare products.Though the drug side of the business was more resilient, pharmacy volume fell worldwide alongside doctor visits and hospital admissions. The sales impact in the U.S. was muted by price increases and sustained sales of costly specialty medicines, but the quarter was a notable disruption to years of volume growth. The patchwork U.S. response may have been a temporary boon on the retail side, but the resulting resurgence in cases makes the next few months uncertain.Even if short-term disruptions abate, long-term concerns remain. Some of the company's business shifted online, but it couldn't begin to make up for the decline in foot traffic. That's not entirely a pandemic specific-issue; it was an existing trend that’s been accelerated by the disease. Walgreens is fighting back by investing in digital offerings and in-store clinics, but those efforts will take time to bear fruit.While unfortunate for pharmacies, slowing health-care consumption boosted the bottom line of health insurers as UnitedHealth demonstrated Wednesday. The company’s medical-benefit ratio — the portion of premium dollars spent on health care — declined steeply as a result of delays in elective surgeries and other care. Much of that money flowed into a historic insurance profit, some of which will be rebated to consumers under Obamacare provisions. It’s a good sign for others in the same business but is quite concerning for providers.UnitedHealth doesn't expect this boost to last. People will eventually go back to the doctor, in some cases incurring extra costs if conditions have worsened. The company is already seeing signs of a rebound in visits, though renewed Covid case growth could still derail this shift. There haven't been enormous drops in employer-based insurance yet, but there are early signs of declining coverage from the rounds of layoffs caused by the Covid recession . More will lose their insurance going forward, especially if the U.S. can't control the virus. Some will shift to Medicaid or the individual market offered under Obamacare, but those are less reliable and profitable businesses.Johnson & Johnson, a company that makes the drugs and consumer products sold by Walgreens and devices used in many of those surgeries that have been delayed, felt the slowdown differently and its results Thursday showed it. Drug sales increased, though gains were muted by Covid-19 related downturns in diagnosis and treatment. Strong sales of over-the-counter products such as Tylenol and Listerine couldn't overcome a decline in skin health and beauty products on the consumer side. And revenue from devices plunged.Despite the big hit to several businesses, the company boosted its sales and earnings guidance for 2020. The update was based entirely on a positive shift in the company's expectations for its devices. J&J believes that the worst is past for that business and the pandemic. Procedures are coming back, executives said on its Thursday earnings call, and they think that any second wave is unlikely to be as bad because of better preparation and knowledge. The company acknowledged a still-high level of uncertainty and some concern about U.S. case growth. If unemployment rises and insurance coverage falls, its business could suffer. But it’s holding on to optimism for now.If J&J is wrong about the the trajectory of the pandemic, it will be able to adjust. Other product-focused companies with finances that aren't as robust and have more U.S. exposure, or less product diversity — and that's many of them — won’t have it as easy. Health-care businesses are both more exposed to and sheltered from the pandemic. Even these three giants won’t come out unscathed or unchanged.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2020-07-15	2020-07-15 20:45:20	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	5 Top Stock Trades for Thursday: MRNA, AZN, AAL, BYND, UNH	It was a bumpy morning on Wednesday, with equities gapping up, moving lower and then rebounding back on the day. With that in mind, let's look at a few top stock trades leading the way.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Moderna (MRNA)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) surged higher on the day, but was not able to hold onto all of it gains. Shares were up as much as 16% on Wednesday, but failed to close over the May high.Earlier this week, shares burst over the $68 to $70 area, but Wednesday's gap-up vaulted MRNA to new highs. At least, temporarily.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow let's see if we can get a close over $87, the May high, and take out the July high at $88.37. Above puts the 123.6% extension in play at $91.62.  * 8 Presidential Election Stocks to Buy in Case Trump Wins Again If shares fill the gap down toward $75, though, it technically puts $68 to $70 in play. Below that puts the 50-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line) on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: AstraZeneca (AZN)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) also caught a pop on the day, ending the day up 7.5%.Shares were wedging into a tighter and tighter range, which is now resolving to the upside. Unlike Moderna, AZN stock is clearing the May high at $57.44 and holding this mark.If AstraZeneca closes over the May high and takes out Wednesday's high currently at $58.84, it puts the 123.6% extension in play at $62.46.Should AZN stock dip, however, I don't want to see it lose this session's low. Otherwise, it could fill the gap and retest its 20-day and 50-day moving averages, as well as prior wedge resistance. Although, that very well could be a buying opportunity for nimble bulls. Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: American Airlines (AAL)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAmerican Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has been very volatile over the last few months. Just look at the way shares made new lows in May -- unlike almost every other stock at that time -- before surging almost 200% in a matter of weeks.Now down considerably from those highs in June, shares are back on the move on Wednesday. AAL stock climbed more than 16% on the day, as it rallies into a cluster of moving averages.If it can clear all of these marks -- with the 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages between $12.69 and $13.25 -- it puts two gap-fills on the table. Those come into play around $15 and $16, respectively, provided it can clear the tw0-week high at $14.29. Above that may put the 50% retracement on the table, near $19.50, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.  * The 7 Best Pharmaceutical Stocks That Go Beyond the Covid-19 Chase Should these moving averages act as resistance, see if American Air fills the gap down near $11.50. Below $11 is a bad sign for bulls. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Beyond Meat (BYND)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) was moving nicely on the day. However, it still has to prove itself to the bulls.While $125 is acting as support -- after previously serving as resistance in January and February -Fwedn BYND still faces its 20-day and 50-day moving averages. Further, it has downtrend resistance (blue line) just overhead.A move over $143.50 clears all of these marks, and puts the recent highs near $160 to $165 on the table. Below $125 could create issues for the bulls in the short term. Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: UnitedHeath (UNH)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) looked like it was ready to run after it delivered an earnings beat before the open. However, shares were rejected from the $310 level.On the plus side, $300 was prior resistance and seems to be holding as support, as shares look very ready to burst over $310 and run. If they do, it could put the 123.6% extension in play all the way up at $333.On the downside, there is ample support between $290 and $300, including the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, as well as uptrend support (blue line). Some investors may prefer to wait and see if they can get a dip-buy in the $290s as opposed to buying now and hoping that $300 holds.Below all of these support zones could put the $275 mark and the 200-day moving average on the table.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-07-15	2020-07-15 11:36:32	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	UnitedHealth Reports Earnings Beat With Strong Optum Performance	Healthcare giant UnitedHealth (UNH) has reported its second quarter earning results with Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of $7.12 beating Street estimates by $1.88. Similarly GAAP EPS of $6.91 easily topped consensus expectations by $1.73.However revenue of $62.14B fell short of estimates by $1.4B, despite rising 2.5% year-over-year, as growth in serving public-sector and senior programs was partially offset by commercial enrollment declines.According to UNH earnings were substantially higher than anticipated due primarily to the unprecedented, temporary deferral of care in the company’s risk-based businesses. UNH expects these results will be offset in the quarters ahead by the assistance measures already taken, the resumption of deferred care and future COVID-19 cost and economic impacts.Encouragingly, Optum second quarter revenues and operating earnings of $32.7 billion and $2.2 billion surged from $28 billion and $2.1 billion a year ago, led by earnings growth at OptumHealth. Indeed, OptumHealth served approximately 97 million people in the second quarter, compared to 95 million a year ago, while revenue per consumer served grew 25% year-over-year driven by continued growth in value-based care arrangements.Meanwhile UnitedHealthcare public-sector and senior program revenue, including Medicare and Medicaid, grew by 7% year-over-year in the quarter and by nearly 600,000 additional people served year to date, while commercial revenue was impacted by economic-driven member attrition.As the pandemic advanced, access to and demand for care was most constrained from mid-March through April, began to recover in May and approached more typical levels by the end of the second quarter, UNH said. Indeed, due to the Covid-19 related deferral of care, the Q2 medical care ratio declined to 70.2% from 83.1% last year.Cash flows from operations were $10 billion or 1.5 times net income in the second quarter and $12.9 billion or 1.3 times net income year to date. At the same time, the operating cost ratio of 16.1% in the second quarter of 2020 increased from 13.9% in the same period last year, primarily due to the health insurance tax, COVID-19 response efforts and business mix.Looking ahead, the company stuck to its 2020 earnings per share outlook of net earnings of $15.45 to $15.75 per share and adjusted net earnings of $16.25 to $16.55 per share.During the second quarter, UNH returned $1.2 billion to shareholders via dividends, while the debt to total capital ratio was 40.9% at quarter end. “Return on equity of 33.7% for the first half of 2020 reflects continued strong core operating performance and the temporary impact of care deferrals experienced during the second quarter 2020” the company stated.Shares in UNH have climbed 5% year-to-date, and the stock has a bullish Strong Buy Street consensus. That’s with an average analyst price target of $337 (9% upside potential). Shares are currently flat in Wednesday’s pre-market trading.

2020-07-14	2020-07-14 18:11:10	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Dow Jones Stocks That Look Strong Despite Market Uncertainty	The investing world is abuzz with talk of bull rallies and the skyrocketing NASDAQ. Despite the coronavirus crisis, the tech-heavy index is up more than 15% so far this year, and shows no signs of stopping. It’s a clear message of investor confidence.Not so fast, however. The Dow Jones, long the go-to metric for stock market followers, has not matched the tech sector’s performance. The Dow, composed of 30 blue-chip stocks in finance, industry, manufacturing, and retail, has indeed recovered from its winter crash – but its recovery has taken a shallower angle than the NASDAQ’s.However it’s not all doom and gloom. Despite the Dow’s relative underperformance, the stocks composing the index are among the market’s most stable. These are companies with proven record of longevity and success – that’s how they were picked for the index in the first place – and even in today’s rocky investment climate, they feature Buy ratings, healthy upside potentials, and general approval from Wall Street’s analysts. There are certainly compelling stocks to be found in the index. You just have to know where to look. Here we turned to TipRanks database to pinpoint the best Dow Jones stocks out there right now -- at least according to Wall Street's pros. Let's take a closer look. UnitedHealth Group, Inc. (UNH)We’ll start in the healthcare sector. It’s no surprise, really, that the world’s largest health insurance provider, with last year’s revenues exceeding $242 billion and yielding a net profit near $14 billion, is doing well in the wake of a global pandemic. UNH has deep pockets, and over 130 million insurance customers worldwide.Where most companies saw earnings fall in 1H20, UNH’s Q1 results, while slightly lower sequentially, were in line with the company’s previous four quarters (higher than one, lower than three). The real earnings story is the forecast for Q2, which is forecast to show a sharp spike, and a sequential gain from $3.72 to $5. Increased sign-ups as the uninsured race to shore up their health coverage are boosting business strength, and UNH has issued guidance for full-year 2020 EPS of $16.25 to $16.55, above the previous estimate of $16.22.The general quality of UNH stock – its gains, and the company’s solid business position – led Leerink analyst Stephen Tanal to rate the stock a Buy along with a $360 price target. (To watch Tanal’s track record, click here)Backing his stance, Tanal writes, “UNH possesses the managed care industry’s most powerful combination of national breadth and local depth – factors that beget sheer scale and the industry’s greatest resources (UNH expects to generate $19.25 billion of operating cash flow in 2020), as well as local economies of scale – and provide a platform for significant enterprise earnings growth…”Overall, UnitedHealth has 14 recent analyst reviews, breaking down to 13 Buys and 1 Hold, making the analyst consensus rating on the stock a Strong Buy. Meanwhile, the average price target of $337 implies an upside potential of 10% for the coming year. (See UNH stock analysis on TipRanks)Nike, Inc. (NKE)From managed health care we move to retail – where Nike, of course best known for its sneakers, is a major name in athletic wear and leisure/sports apparel. The company’s skill and success in branding are legendary; Nike’s ‘swoosh’ is one of the few corporate logos instantly recognizable without any caption at all.That strong foundation helped Nike to weather the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the company beat forecasts for CYQ1 as North American and digital sales made up for losses in China. Q2, however, brought trouble. Sales in the North American market tumbled during the lockdown policies, and the company saw EPS fall to a 51-cent per share net loss. On an interest note, online sales continued to grow, by 75%, and made up 30% of total revenue. Nike’s website saw increased traffic from customers looking for indoor workout gear – sneakers and sweats.Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser is blunt in his rating of NKE stock. “Buy Nike,” he says, adding, “We think short-term headwinds are masking NKE's long-term potential. Investors should look past the challenges that NKE will face over the next two quarters and focus on the unmatched global strength of the Nike brand, digital prowess, best-in-class customer engagement, unrivaled product innovation, and fortress balance sheet.”In line with that outlook, Poser set a $130 price target, implying a robust 35% upside over the coming 12 months. (To watch Poser’s track record, click here)Wall Street’s analyst corps agrees with Poser on NKE. The Strong Buy analyst consensus rating on Nike’s stock is based on 22 Buys, 3 Holds, and a single Sell set in recent weeks. The average price target is $110.70, suggesting an upside of nearly 15% for the next this year. (See NKE stock analysis on TipRanks)The Goldman Sachs Group (GS)Last on our list of buy-rated Dow stocks is the Goldman Sachs Group, one of Wall Street’s storied names. The international bank holding company specializes in asset management, trading and investments, and securities services. Goldman provides services mainly to institutions: corporations, other banks, and government entities, but also to some high net worth individuals.The coronavirus hurt Goldman in the first quarter, and the firm saw EPS fall by 39%, to $3.11. At that, however, it did beat the forecast by over 9%. Revenues, at $7.77 billion, were down 14% sequentially; but that result was at the mid-point of the past four quarters’ results. While the first quarter was bad, Goldman had the resources to survive – and the bank is looking at improved EPS for Q2, and is expected to beat the estimate of $3.84 per share.Goldman is one of the market's most reliable dividend players. The company maintained its $1.25 common stock dividend through the crisis months, paying out in March and June. The annualized payment of $5 per share gives a yield of 2.43%, somewhat better than the ~2% average found among S&P-listed companies, while the payout ratio of 40% shows that the payment is fundamentally sound.Analyst Mike Mayo, writing from Wells Fargo, believes that Goldman can meet the challenges of the current environment. He writes of the company, “Our confidence is reinforced since GS has many levers it [can] pull and much of these types of moves are within its control. This includes more aggressive actions which both can increase short-term earnings and free-up capital, such as by harvesting private equity investments.”Mayo puts a $255 price target on GS, suggesting a strong 21% one-year upside, and backs up his Buy rating. (To watch Mayo’s track record, click here)Overall, Goldman gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 9 Buys and 6 Holds. The stock is selling for $210, and the average price target, at $231.86, implies it has room for 10% upside growth this year.

2020-06-28	2020-06-28 16:26:14	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Fed Reveals Bond Purchases Including AT&T, UnitedHealth, Walmart	(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve bought bonds issued by companies including AT&T Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Walmart Inc. as part of its emergency lending program set up in response to the pandemic, according to new disclosures.On June 16, the U.S. central bank began purchasing securities of individual issuers as part of a broad index it created to include companies that were eligible for the program.The disclosures, posted Sunday, showed that of the $207 million of purchases made on the first day of buying, about 21% were of debt issued by firms in the consumer non-cyclical sector, while 15% were of consumer cyclical debt and 10% were of technology debt. Issues rated below investment grade comprised 3.6% of the securities acquired.In a separate disclosure, the New York Fed released the composition of the broad index the central bank is using to conduct the purchases. Fed officials have said the goal of the buying is to maintain liquidity in the market for corporate debt, so that issuers are able to access capital despite the deep economic downturn created by the pandemic. The index is comprised of almost 800 issuers.In mid-May, the Fed began buying exchange-traded funds invested in corporate debt as it readied for outright purchases. As of Tuesday, the Fed had amassed $8.71 billion of assets including ETFs and individual securities through the program, known as the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility.On June 17, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told the House Financial Services Committee that the central bank would reallocate purchases of ETFs toward individual debt securities through the index it created.“Buying cash bonds is going to form the primary mode of support over time by which we support market function,” Powell said during the hearing. “Over time, we will gradually move away from ETFs.”The program is set to expire on Sept. 30.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-reveals-bond-purchases-including-162614185.html?.tsrc=rss

How Many Millionaires Are in the U.S.?Phoenix MI is tracking the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which could make for a very different landscape going forward. But last year, at least, the good times continued to roll. Indeed, a record 6.71% (or 8,386,508 out of 125,018,808 total U.S. households) can now claim millionaire status. That's up from 6.21% in 2018 and just 5.81% in 2017.Note well that to be considered a millionaire by the standards of wealth research, a household must have investable assets of $1 million or more, excluding the value of real estate, employer-sponsored retirement plans and business partnerships, among other select assets.Although California and New York have a great deal of millionaires in terms of raw numbers, they don't have the highest concentrations of rich households. It turns out there are numerous states with higher percentages of well-off households, several of which probably will surprise you.And don't forget that between living costs and taxes, a million dollars goes much further in some states than others.Here's a look at the millionaire rankings for all 50 states (plus the District of Columbia), based on the percentage of millionaire households in each. Just for good measure, we're also providing important tax and cost-of-living information.

2020-05-18	2020-05-18 13:30:31	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Ray Dalio Picks Up These 3 “Strong Buy” Stocks	"COVID-19's impact has been crippling, but something positive may come from the pandemic. Billionaire Ray Dalio said in a live LinkedIn interview that in terms of the broader historical context, the recent economic downturn should be “relatively brief,"" and could spur significant societal progress. This would include a worldwide “restructuring” lasting approximately three to five years.“I know that’s a long time, but it’s not forever. The human capacity to adapt and invent and come out of this is much greater,” Dalio commented. He added, “I think we should be very excited about the new future. We’re now in a wonderful revolution in terms of the capacity to think and use that in a way. I would say that is absolutely the most treasured thing in the future.”Still making sure to account for the unknowns, Dalio has been diversifying his investments across geographic locations, asset class and currencies throughout the ongoing public health crisis.  Looking to Dalio for investing inspiration, we used TipRanks’ database to find out if three stocks the billionaire recently added to the fund represent compelling plays. According to the platform, the analyst community believes they do, with all of the picks earning “Strong Buy” consensus ratings. Let’s jump right in.Philip Morris International (PM)Cigarette and tobacco manufacturing company Philip Morris has become known as a “sin stock."" However, regardless of its product portfolio, Dalio sees plenty of upside in store.Recently, the billionaire’s fund acquired a new position in PM, snapping up 67,447 shares. The value of this new addition? More than $4.9 million.Turning now to the analysts, the stock boasts a strong fan base, which includes Piper Sandler’s Michael Lavery. He doesn’t dispute the fact that there are some headwinds facing the company. “PM expects near-term iQOS new user acquisition to be about 50% lower than it originally planned due to social distancing measures that have shut iQOS stores and made it harder to engage with consumers,” Lavery stated.That being said, the company has already surpassed Lavery’s expectations, which were cut to near-zero. The analyst even says that if PM can maintain the pace of its customer acquisition, there could be upside to his estimates. The analyst added, “We expect HeatStick volume growth of 20% in 2020E (1Q20: +45%) and believe 90-100 billion sticks in 2021 is still achievable.”While lower duty-free volumes and down-trading in Indonesia could take a toll on second quarter EPS, Lavery remains optimistic. “We remain bullish on PM's strong long-term outlook, and we expect nicotine demand to remain resilient near-term (particularly in times of personal stress),” he explained.It should also be noted that PM has had to grapple with patent infringement claims from British American Tobacco (BAT) and a transactional currency hit. Speaking to the first issue, Lavery said, “We reviewed BAT's six patents named in its U.S. complaint, and it is difficult to handicap an outcome, but a third-party reviewer of patents generally did not give BAT's relevant ones here very high marks.”As for the latter, Lavery points out that about $100 million of the currency hit in the first quarter of 2020 was driven by the revaluation of euro or dollar denominated payables in markets like Russia, but he doesn’t foresee another event of this magnitude happening again.Based on all of the above, Lavery kept an Overweight rating on the stock. He did reduce the price target from $98 to $95, but this still implies shares could climb 40% higher in the next year. (To watch Lavery’s track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, other analysts are in agreement. 7 Buys and 2 Holds add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. In addition, the $83.56 average price target brings the upside potential to 23%. (See Philip Morris stock analysis on TipRanks)UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Hoping to help people live healthier lives and make the healthcare system work more efficiently, UnitedHealth Group offers a wide range of healthcare products and insurance services. While the late-March acceleration of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a somewhat lackluster quarter, Dalio believes the company’s future is bright.To this end, Bridgewater went in on UNH. In a purchase valued at $5,481,000, Dalio’s hedge fund scooped up 21,977 shares.Five-star analyst Michael Wiederhorn agrees that UNH is moving on to bigger and better things, noting that its Q1 performance was relatively solid. “Overall, UNH produced strong results and seems well-positioned to navigate the COVID pandemic due to a relatively stable top-line, a diversified business mix and a dominant position across its businesses.”Wiederhorn tells investors that management thinks the slowdown in non-COVID-irelated utilization, which was driven by highly constrained elective care and will be offset by the late-year pent-up utilization, will have a significant impact on MCR in the second quarter. As a result, despite some uncertainty surrounding COVID-19's impact, UNH maintained its full year 2020 EPS guidance of $16.25-$16.55.Adding to the good news, Wiederhorn argues that its Optum segment has a strong standing within the market. Expounding on this, he noted, “Trends at Optum remained solid, and management did note that even OptumHealth should be positioned to hold up relatively well due to its reliance on risk-based contracts, accounting for two thirds of revenues. Both OptumRx and OptumInsight have strong pipelines (though the timing of meetings was disrupted) with the latter of particular interest as companies look to improve the economics and delivery of healthcare.”Even though commercial enrollment could be hampered by elevated levels of unemployment, higher Medicaid should partially offset this. Additionally, UNH is in the early stages of pricing and benefit design for 2021, with its plans possibly including pricing for COVID-19 testing and a potential vaccine.Bearing this in mind, Wiederhorn maintained an Outperform call and $343 price target. Should this target be met, a twelve-month gain of 18% could be in the cards. (To watch Wiederhorn’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, other analysts also like what they’re seeing. With 12 Buys and 2 Holds, the word on the Street is that UNH is a Strong Buy. At $326.23, the average price target indicates 12% upside potential. (See UnitedHealth stock analysis on TipRanks)Accenture PLC (ACN)Dalio’s third recent addition, Accenture, provides management and technology consulting services and solutions to help its clients, which inhabit almost every industry, create lasting value. With the company relying on a new strategy, Dalio thinks it has set itself up for success.Not wanting to miss out on a compelling opportunity, Bridgewater pulled the trigger on 27,763 shares, giving it a new position in ACN. Looking at the value of the new holding, it comes in at more than $4.5 million.When it comes to the analysts, they are also singing the company’s praises. Writing for BNP Paribas, analyst Ben Castillo-Bernaus argues that COVID-19's disruption has presented investors with an opportunity to buy a “high-quality” IT service company, with ACN trading well below historical five-year average EBIT multiples.“Accenture remains ‘best in class’ and the recent weakness is an opportunity to gain a position in this IT Services global leader delivering 40% returns on capital,” Castillo-Bernaus stated. He added, “Accenture has been a pioneer in developing ‘the New’ with 65% of revenues now coming from high growth Digital, Cloud and Security services.”As for what makes the company so successful and allows it to continuously take market share, Castillo-Bernaus points to its investments in new technologies and growth areas. To back up this conclusion, the analyst cites its EUR1 billion investment in training each year and EUR800 million investment in R&D all while delivering margin improvements every year. On top of this, ACN conducts smaller-scale M&A, with it working alongside the companies before an acquisition to limit any potential deal failures.Castillo-Bernaus also noted, “We believe Accenture has customers that spend more than $100 million annually, with 98% of Accenture’s top 100 clients having been clients for more than five years. These ‘sticky’ relationships help Accenture maintain high margins and high returns as Accenture has a high number of ‘sole source’ wins where it does not even see competition in RFPs.”That being said, the company has started using a new approach. It will now organize itself by Strategy & Consulting, Interactive, Technology and Operations instead of by verticals, and the results will be reported geographically for these segments. “We believe it is too early to tell what kind of impact these changes will have, but Accenture has a positive track record of occasionally tweaking its growth strategy in order to best deliver on the opportunities ahead,” Castillo-Bernaus commented.It should come as no surprise, then, that Castillo-Bernaus joined the bulls. Along with an Outperform rating, he initiated coverage by setting a $215 price target. This target conveys the analyst’s confidence in ACN's ability to surge 17% in the next twelve months.In general, other Wall Street analysts have also been impressed. ACN’s Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 13 Buys and 2 Holds assigned in the last three months. However, the $195.29 average price target suggests modest upside potential of 6%.

2020-05-18	2020-05-18 06:24:39	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Microsoft, UnitedHealth Launch Back-to-Work Covid-19 Screening App	Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) have teamed up to roll out an everyday free screening app for coronavirus symptoms as more and more employers are planning to reopen their businesses and are subject to stringent health requirements.Th app, also known as ProtectWell, allows employers to offer workers a simple screening tool designed for everyday use. The smartphone app includes an AI-powered health care bot that asks users a series of questions to screen for Covid-19 symptoms or exposure. If risk of infection is indicated, employers can direct their employees to a streamlined Covid-19 testing process that enables closed-loop ordering and reporting of test results directly back to employers.“As businesses begin to reopen, employers will need to monitor and manage their workforce for Covid-19 symptoms to help ensure those at risk of spreading the virus stay home until cleared by medical providers,” said Judson Althoff, Microsoft’s executive vice president of worldwide commercial business.The screening app uses the clinical and data analytics of UnitedHealth combined with Microsoft’s artificial intelligence and analytics capabilities. The smartphone app, which will be powered by Microsoft Azure, will be available to all U.S. employers at no charge. Microsoft said it plans to deploy ProtectWell for its U.S.-based employees.For privacy protection, UnitedHealth will maintain control over protected health care data and will manage opt-in and consent requirements needed from app users. Microsoft will not have access to identifiable information shared via the app.Shares in Microsoft have soared 35% in the past two months and were trading at $183.16 on Friday. UnitedHealth shares have recovered after declining to a multi-year low on March 23 and are now trading around their start-of-year level at $290.96.Five-star analyst Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley reiterated the Buy rating on Microsoft’s stock with a $198 price target, saying that he forecasts the company to generate double-digit top-line growth in the near term.“Based on the focus from senior management and strong secular tailwinds behind Security spending, we expect these installed base and data advantages to lead Microsoft into new markets like DevSecOps, IoT Security, and Data Privacy,” Weiss wrote in a report to investors.TipRanks data shows that overall Wall Street analysts are almost unanimously bullish on Microsoft’s stock. Twenty-two out of the 23 analysts have Buy ratings and 1 has a Hold rating adding up to a Strong Buy consensus. The $198.67 average price target provides investors with 8.5% upside potential in the shares in the coming 12 months.

Indeed, the U.S. hasn't seen such a torrid increase in the ranks of millionaires in more than a decade.They can thank record levels for stock prices.&quot;The 7% rise in millionaire households in 2018 is the strongest rate of growth in that market since the financial downturn 10 years ago,&quot; says David M. Thompson, managing director at Phoenix Marketing International, which tracks the affluent market. &quot;The growth in capital markets in 2018 clearly lifted many more households into the millionaire ranks.&quot;Total households in the U.S. with at least $1 million in investable assets have increased by 534,000 in the past 12 months, Thompson notes. In the past decade since the financial crisis, the number of millionaire households has grown by more than 2 million.As a result, 6.21%, or 7,698,765 U.S. households out of 123,942,960 total households, can now claim millionaire status. That's up from only 5.8% a year ago. To reach that lofty level, you must have investable assets of $1 million or more, excluding the value of real estate, employer-sponsored retirement plans and business partnerships.When imagining where America's millionaires live, most people probably think of California and New York. But although those states have their fair share of millionaires in terms of raw numbers, they don't have the highest concentrations of rich households. It turns out there are numerous states with higher percentages of well-off households than New York or California, several of which probably will surprise you. And don't forget that between living costs and taxes, a million dollars goes much further in some states than others.Here's a look at the millionaire ratings for all 50 states (and the District of Columbia), based on the percentage of millionaire households in each. Just for good measure, we're also providing important tax and cost-of-living information.

2020-05-08	2020-05-08 10:10:40	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Reasons to Think Carefully Before Betting on UnitedHealth	Despite incredible relevancy toward the novel coronavirus pandemic, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) was hardly immune to volatility. At one point, UNH stock was down over 33% for the year.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com However, in late March, shares began picking up momentum. It wasn't the only one, with other managed care organizations, such as Anthem (NYSE:ANTM), Cigna (NYSE:CI) and Humana (NYSE:HUM) enjoying similar upside.But can you trust this sector given growing concerns about economic stability?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn one hand, the case for UNH stock and its peers appears to have fundamental justification. Unlike other crises that we have suffered in the modern era, the novel coronavirus is a black swan event that has impacted all of us to a significant degree. In this manner, it's completely dissimilar to localized events, such as the 9/11 attacks or an incident that only impacts certain people, such as the housing crisis of the mid-2000s.  * 7 A-Rated REITs to Buy NowNo, the coronavirus is a microbiological threat from which no one can assume they're safe. Undoubtedly, this caused many consumers to open their eyes toward upgrading their medical care. If enough people do this, it could provide a boost to UNH stock.Furthermore, UnitedHealth delivered an earnings beat for its first quarter with an earnings per share of $3.72. Consensus estimates called for EPS of $3.65. Revenue, though, missed slightly at $64.42 billion, whereas analysts had targeted $64.67 billion.Although a very positive outcome considering the circumstances, we're walking through uncharted territory. Thus, it's not unreasonable to believe UNH stock could suffer more turbulence until we get a hold of the true status of our economy. Here are three other reasons why investors need to be careful with UnitedHealth. UNH Stock Has a Flawed Coronavirus CatalystAlthough I understand why many analysts have a bullish take on managed care companies, I believe that they're exaggerating the positive impact of the coronavirus. Yes, the pandemic has caused people to examine their insurance policy and their overall preparedness. But that doesn't necessarily equate to a mass conversion toward UNH.First, the membership metric missed Wall Street's expectation by 2% in the first quarter. This shortfall likely indicates that the growing number of the unemployed, along with broader fears about economic sustainability have negatively affected UnitedHealth.Second, the coronavirus is a rare, one-off event. The last incident like this to hit the U.S. was the H1N1 pandemic, which infected millions and killed approximately 17,000. But this outbreak happened over a decade ago. Frankly, it's not worth adjusting your insurance policy (especially to a premium policy) to address a situation that occurs so infrequently.Not only that, your chances of getting Covid-19 are very slim. Roughly speaking, there are 328 million people in the U.S. At time of writing, there are 1.26 million total cumulative cases of coronavirus here. Thus, we're talking about a disease that has only impacted less than 0.4% of the population.Don't get me wrong - I'm not minimizing this pandemic. But I just don't see the impetus for UNH stock. Sure, people will forever remember the coronavirus, but I doubt they'll switch or upgrade insurance policies over it. The Pandemic Is a Negative for InsurersAs you know, the rising cost of health care has been a vexing issue for patients along with the electorate. However, not having access to health care is a scarier thought for many folks. That's why for those of us that can afford it, we put up with the escalating costs.If you believe the above bullish argument for UNH stock, then you're assuming the outbreak provides an incentive for UnitedHealth. Clearly, the collective health risk has caused people to examine their coverage with &quot;what if&quot; scenarios. But I don't think an outlier is enough to convince people to pay more money for premium care.Indeed, I look at it from the opposite angle. When the coronavirus broke out in a substantial way and disrupted our health care networks, people were incentivized not to visit the hospital or primary care clinic. With so many sick people and medical professionals often working without adequate protection, you were taking huge risks to subject yourself to that environment.Yet at the same time, you were paying your monthly bills as if nothing happened. This then causes people to examine the extreme cost of paying for protection against an event that might not occur.If anything, I see a catalyst for supplemental insurance companies like Aflac (NYSE:AFL), which covers more common unexpected events, such as a broken limb. Because it's supplemental, people can choose whatever services they wish to enhance their overall coverage profile. But besides that, the concept of a bump up in premium covered care doesn't strike me as plausible in this environment. It's All About the EconomyThe Department of Labor will release its April jobs report today. I don't need to know what the number is to know that it's terrible. On Wednesday, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) released its employment stats, which showed that the private sector shed more than 20 million jobs.Current projections call for the April jobs report to disclose 22 million employment positions lost. That would mean a decade's worth of jobs have evaporated in a span of weeks. It's a staggering thought.And in this paradigm, it's incredibly difficult to reconcile how UNH stock will thrive. Generally, UnitedHealth plans cost more than other coverage programs. Perhaps the first wave of unemployment numbers didn't impact UNH because they disproportionately affected lower-income workers.But if this economic malaise continues, it's inevitable that higher-wage earners in business services and management roles will get the axe. In my opinion, it's already happening. Either way, the middle class cannot avoid the coronavirus. And that would present huge challenges for UNH stock for which I'm not interested in staking my money.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

2020-05-08	2020-05-08 09:16:03	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	CVS Health Beats Estimates, Market Yawns	CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) beat market estimates for sales in its May 6 report but the share fell 5% anyway. The CVS stock price has eked out a 3% gain since its mid-March low, while the S&P 500 index is up 5.1% in the same seven or so weeks.Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat report? Earnings of $2.01 billion, $1.53 per share fell short of estimates for $1.70 a share of earnings. But revenue of $66.75 billion was well ahead of estimates for $62.61 billion.Revenue gains were strongest on the insurance side of the house, the former Aetna. Earnings gains were strongest in what it called the retail and long-term care segment, which includes its in-store clinics.Initial reports had earnings of $1.91 a share, which would have beat even the whisper number. This was adjusted income, including some non-GAAP items related to the Aetna deal and amortization of intangible assets. Is the Aetna Deal Working?CVS Health made itself unique in 2018 by paying $69 billion for Aetna. At the time, Aetna was one of four large health insurers left behind by the growth of United Healthcare (NYSE:UNH).The deal came about after the four laggards were kept from merging with each other by the Obama administration. The other three -- Cigna (NYSE:CI), Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) and Humana (NYSE:HUM) -- remain independent. Only Humana has outperformed UNH over the last two years, but the others have all outperformed CVS.  * 7 A-Rated REITs to Buy Now CVS is now larger than UNH in terms of annual revenue, $256 billion to $240 billion, but has less than half of its new rival's net income. The goal has been to deliver managed care through CVS pharmacies and, eventually, better value from insurance operations. That goal has yet to be achieved, although UNH has moved into managed care in recent years, following CVS' lead.For investors, this has given CVS stock a better performance than Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), formerly its drug store doppelganger. Over the last two years CVS shares are down 4%, while Walgreens is down by more than a third. But health insurance, by itself, remains a better business. Pandemic's Front LinesPartly because of the Aetna deal, and partly due to its niche in pharmacy, CVS can afford its 50 cents per share dividend payout during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Its full-year guidance on earnings remains unchanged, at $5.47-$5.60 per share diluted and $7.04-$7.17 per share adjusted.During the first quarter CVS Health saw both higher prescription and in-store revenue, and lower benefit costs. April results show a &quot;new normal&quot; of lower merchandise sales and higher pharmacy sales.Patients are focused on Covid-19 and putting off dealing with other medical problems. CEO Larry Merlo expects the second quarter to represent a &quot;trough&quot; in results. But that's much better than the disaster other retailers are predicting.  * 9 Online Retail Stocks Profiting From Social Distancing Analysts are divided on how to look at this. Some warn of mounting costs and a retail collapse, telling growth investors to avoid the stock. Others see a promising technical chart, a stock poised to move higher. Still others see a cheap insurer trading at less than 10 times earnings, half what UNH is selling for. Bottom Line on CVS StockMy own view on CVS stock is that the managed care era it was built for has yet to appear.Health insurers are raking in profits under Trump, and anger at this fueled the rise of Bernie Sanders. His failure to beat Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination, in turn, gave more fuel to the insurers. Biden is considered friendlier to the industry.But within the industry, managed care is the trend. CVS stores and clinics should, over time, give it lower costs for chronic care. Other insurers must pay third parties for this care. That's why I have been recommending CVS for over a year. It's why I finally bought shares for my own retirement account.That investment has delivered a tiny, but real profit, and a dividend yield of 3.3%, easily beating a U.S. government bond. In the present market, which still may be taken down by a second wave of coronavirus infections, that's value worth buying.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

2020-04-23	2020-04-23 20:43:07	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Microscopic Gains Under Looming Covid-19 Data	Stocks started Thursday off in impressive fashion, but that strength wilted throughout the day as market participants digested more bad economic data and headlines and reports that novel coronavirus cases are rising in Texas and that nearly 14% of New Yorkers carry symptoms of the illness. Those are the second- and fourth-largest states, respectively.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 fell 0.05%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17%  * The Nasdaq Composite inched lower by 0.01%  * For the first time in awhile, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) was the Dow's top performer, adding 3% today.Thursday is jobless claims today and suffice to say, the latest numbers aren't good, but they were less bad. Last week, 4.43 million Americans applied for jobless benefits, bringing the five-week tally to a staggering 26.5 million. The prior week's figure was also revised lower to 5.24 million. However, the problem areas include some of the largest states.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;California reported the most initial claims last week, at an unadjusted 533,600, down from 655,500 the prior week. Florida was next, followed by Texas at 280,400, up slightly from the prior week,&quot; reports Bloomberg.  * 7 Real Estate Stocks to Watch as the Long-Term Impact of the Virus Looms Peak unemployment claims were probably notched a couple of weeks, but the outlook is still dismal as some economists believe the U.S. rate of joblessness is heading for 20%.To some extent, stocks fought off that ominous prediction as 18 of 30 Dow members were higher in late trading. Apple NewsApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) didn't do much today despite reports that the company is aiming to sell Macs powered by in-house semiconductors next year. Reports indicate Apple will unveil at least one Mac next year with its own chips and this could be a growing theme across Apple's product line because the company is searching for new processors as an avenue for setting itself apart from rivals. Microsoft RumorsApple wasn't the only Dow Jones tech name subject to the rumor mill today. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closed slightly lower -- more a testament to today's sluggish action than anything else -- amid rumors that the company is planning a big-time game reveal sometime soon. For now, it's a rumor, but it makes sense because video game hardware makers, including Microsoft, are expected to launch new consoles later this year. Not Reacting to Bad NewsWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is one of the poster children for coronavirus equity erosion, but the stock traded modestly higher despite another day of challenging headlines. This time around, it was Standard & Poor's downgrading Disney's credit rating to &quot;A-&quot; from &quot;A&quot; while keeping a &quot;negative&quot; outlook on the rating.&quot;Disney's theme parks won't likely return to normal capacity utilization at the same rate as the overall economy even after stay-at-home restrictions are eased and the theme parks are allowed to reopen,&quot; said the ratings agency. Another Wild Day for OilOil notched another epic rally, this time it was 20% intraday gain, helping Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) into the Dow winners circle. Speculating as to long oil upside will last is tricky, but it pays to remember this is coming against the backdrop of weak demand and poor economic data.Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayMaking near-term equity market upside something of a dubious proposition is that, as FactSet points out, global economic data is slack, meaning Covid-19 is hampering more than just the U.S. and Chinese economies.&quot;Analysts surveyed by FactSet are now forecasting a 2.9% contraction in U.S. GDP in 2020; this compares to the 1.8% expansion predicted at the end of February,&quot; according to the research firm. &quot;The Eurozone economy is expected to shrink by 4.8% in 2020 while the UK is projected to see its economy contract by 4.9%. China's GDP is expected to grow by just 2.2%, the country's slowest GDP growth since official records began.&quot;Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-04-15	2020-04-15 20:58:14	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	4 Top Stock Trades for Thursday: GS, C, ROKU, UNH	Stocks slipped in the opening minutes of Wednesday trading, but clawed back some of those losses by the close. With that in mind, let's look at a few top stock trades for Thursday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Goldman Sachs (GS)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is one of the few bank stocks rallying after reporting earnings. The stock traded down just below $170 after reporting its quarterly figures, but has since rebounded from those lows. Don't feel like you've missed the boat, though. Now we have levels we can trade against. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the downside, we have a low of $169.15 to measure against. On the upside, there's clear resistance near $184. If shares of Goldman Sachs can clear resistance over $184, it could fill the gap up toward $190. Above that and there is a plethora of major moving averages up between $205 and $210. On the downside, watch for a move back down to $169. Below that opens up the potential for another test of $150. Below that technically puts the $130 March low in play, but let's not get ahead of our skis.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Citigroup (C)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAs for Citigroup (NYSE:C), shares are down almost 4% after reporting its first-quarter earnings results. That's more in-line with how its peers are trading at the moment. The stock continues to get rejected from the $47.50 area, which was the low from the Q4 2018 selloff. That's not a great sign for the bulls to be honest, but not all hope is lost. Ideally, the stock will stay north of $140 and build out a longer term, less volatile base. That would be a constructive silver lining to the way shares have been trading lately. Below $140 opens the door to a retest of the $35 to $36 area. On the upside, we need to see Citi clear $47.50. Above puts a run to $51 in play.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Roku (ROKU)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) continues to move really well, adding to Tuesday's big gains with Wednesday's rally, which came despite the decline in the broader market. Shares reclaimed and held the 50-day moving average and are making new highs on the week. However, Roku could run into some resistance between $118 and $123. There it runs into prior multi-quarter support, as well as the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. Above this zone opens up the stock to a run to $130-plus. A pullback likely puts the $100 level and the 50-day moving average back in play. From here, see that uptrend support (blue line) continues to act as support. If it fails, $80 is not out of the question, no matter how well this company is doing.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: UnitedHealth (UNH)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is seeing a solid bounce after reporting earnings on Wednesday. The move is catapulting UNH stock over a key resistance point near $265. That zone was multi-year resistance and clearing it gives the stock solid momentum. If it can continue higher, bulls will look for a test of $300 resistance. This is a level UnitedHealth could not break through in late-2019 and early 2020, despite trying multiple times over several months. On the downside, look for UNH to hold $265 as support. Below puts $252 to $255 in play, where the stock will find its 50-week and 100-week moving averages. Below that and $230 is possible.

2020-04-15	2020-04-15 20:43:43	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Stocks Doomed By Dour Economic Data	One of the big themes emerging due to the novel coronavirus outbreak is the effect of the virus on economic data and how equity markets are reacting to that news. As Wednesday's market action suggests, poor economic data is likely to be met with ugly stock market response.  * The S&P 500 dipped 2.20%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.86%  * The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.44%  * With economic data taking center stage, it wasn't surprising that cyclical names endured harsh punishment today as Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) was the blue-chip index's biggest loser, sliding 8.92%.It's no mystery as to why Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) were among the worst Dow offenders today. Earlier Wednesday, the Commerce Department said March retail sales fell 8.7%, the worst decline since 1992. Even Walmart (NYSE:WMT) wasn't spared by the retail carnage, posting a modest loss. The report deals an unsurprising but still severe blow to the thesis that consumer demand could prop up the U.S. economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFurther pressuring Home Depot was an early look at April homebuilder sentiment, which looks extremely dour. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index resides at its lowest levels in eight years.  * 7 Bank Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Heats Up The New York Fed's general business conditions index plunged a staggering 56.7 points to a negative (yes negative) reading of -78.2. As a result, each one of the Dow's industrial components with the exception of Boeing (NYSE:BA) traded lower today.In late trading, 25 of 30 Dow stocks were in the red. Healthy EarningsUnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) was one of the Dow's lone bright spots today, trading higher after the managed care provider reported first-quarter earnings of $3.72, topping the consensus estimate of $3.65 a share. The company confirmed 2020 earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $16.25 and $16.55. Looks Like Good News Is ComingProcter and Gamble (NYSE:PG) was another Dow winner a day after the company said it's boosting its quarterly dividend by 6%. The company has one of the longest payout increase streaks in the U.S., but this increase was bigger than expected. Additionally, P&G said it will report earnings this Friday, moving its release date up from April 21.It's just speculation, but it wouldn't be surprising if this report is good and/or contains positive guidance. After all, if bad news was coming, P&G probably wouldn't be in a hurry to reveal it. Giddy for GoldmanGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was another Dow winner today despite reporting a 46% drop in first-quarter earnings. Goldman said it earned $3.11 a share, well below the $3.35 per share analysts expected. Revenue checked in at $8.74 billion, topping the $7.92 billion estimate.Investors appeared to look over the glum broad results, opting to focus on robust bond trading revenue. The bank said it allocated $937 million for sour loans in the January through March period. Cheaper Isn't Always BetterIt can be argued that with many things, cheaper probably isn't ever better and that may explain the market's lack of enthusiasm today for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company said today it's rolling out a new iPhone SE that costs just $399, its cheapest model launch in two years.The new SE launch has some pros and cons. The primary drawback is that it won't feature 5G capabilities at a time when the world is transitioning to that wireless system. Conversely, some buyers like smaller phones, of which the SE is one, and it could serve as a springboard to entice users to eventually purchase pricier Apple products. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIf today's economic data wasn't bad enough, there's a strong chance it will get worse tomorrow with another look at weekly jobless claims. The consensus estimate for initial jobless claims last week is 5.46 million.If that number is accurate or is exceeded, that means when combined with the previous three weeks of unemployment claims, all of the jobs gained in the U.S. since the end of the 2008 global financial crisis will be wiped out.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 445 points, or 1.9% to close at about 23,507 and the S&P 500 index  retreated 62 points, or 2.1% to end the session at roughly 2,783. The Nasdaq Composite index  fell 123 points, or 1.4% to close near 8,393. The Commerce Department said that retail sales fell 8.7% in March, versus the 7.1% decline expected by economists in a MarketWatch poll, while the Federal Reserve said that industrial production also fell more than expected last month. Efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 did not begin in earnest in much of the country until late March, leading analysts to predict that the economic impact in April will be even more severe. In company news, Dow component UnitedHealth Group  saw its shares rise 4.1% after it reaffirmed its 2020 earnings guidance, while shares of banks Citigroup  and Bank of America  fell 5.6% and 6.5%, respectively after each reported steep declines in profit and revenue during the first quarter.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d2b3ec4a-0177-3fd7-bc0b-32f660219755/dow-closes-400-points-lower.html?.tsrc=rss

During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.For those who don't have the time to tune in live or listen to the podcast, Benzinga will highlight one stock that merits further discussion. This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation.Fundamentals are playing a role in Wednesday's price action: there is no better fundamental information to evaluate an issue than its most recent earnings report. With its first-quarter beat, UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE: UNH) is trading higher in a bad tape, making it the PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day.UnitedHealth's Q1 Beat Before the open, the health insurer reported an 8-cent first-quarter EPS beat, along with a slight sales beat.UnitedHealth did not provide any forward guidance. With the COVID-19 pandemic putting an enormous strain on our health care system as well as the entire economy, and the outcome still unknown, it doubtful that many companies will be providing forward guidance.UnitedHealth's Price Action: From February High To March Low Being one of the top components in the S&P 500, the issue was perched at its all-time-high at $306.72 on Feb. 19. UnitedHealth made its all-time-closing high on that same day at $305.31. It gave investors plenty of time to sell it over $300.View more earnings on UNHThe issue made seven consecutive daily highs between $302.51 and $306.72 from Feb. 12 through Feb. 21.When the index went to its sell-all mentality, UnitedHealth shares suffered too. Just as the index bottomed on March 23, so did the shares of the issue at $187.72. That low coincides with its October 2017 low of $186.UnitedHealth Along For The Ride On The Rally -- And Then Some While the index took some time to recover half of its losses from the February swoon, UnitedHealth accomplished that feat in only three days when it surpassed $247, reaching $257.96 on March 26. After a five-day retreat to $226.03, the issue was off to the races once again. On Tuesday, UnitedHealth reached its post-recovery high of $273.07 and ended the session at $270.50.UnitedHealth's Great Day In A Bad Tape Wednesday's rally is especially impressive considering the broad market is down and UnitedHealth is in the green by by 3.43% as of the time of publication. After a much higher open, it peaked at around 10 a.m. at $281.66 and reversed course. The ensuing decline took the issue to just above Tuesday's close ($270.50) before roaring back to a new high of $282.99 as of 1 p.m.The stock was trading at $279.77 at the time of publication. UnitedHealth Moving Forward UnitedHealth has a few areas of resistance, such as the pair of highs at the $285 area from March 6 ($284.97) and March 11 ($285.24). If the market continues its upward projectile, those multiple highs over $300 are not too far away.For investors who are attempting to lock in or protect gains in the issue, a breach of Wednesday's low ($270.68), which matches Tuesday's close ($270.50), may signal more downside in what has been amazing rally.

Beijing said it had updated the WHO in a “timely” manner.South Korea’s ruling party may have won an outright majority in the biggest election since the pandemic spread around the globe. Indonesia is set to bring 34 million people under a partial lockdown, while India may ease some curbs as the economy faces its first contraction since 1980.Key DevelopmentsVirus Tracker: Cases reach 1.99 million; deaths top 127,000China’s data on symptom-free cases reveals most never get sickScientists weigh immunity; hyped Malaria pill doesn’t help in studyTrump backs off ‘total authority,’ says he’ll consult statesIMF calls for yet more stimulus after contagion starts to abateBofA Joins Rival Banks in Setting Aside Billions for Loan Losses (6:57 a.m. NY)Bank of America Corp. joined two big rivals in setting aside billions of dollars for loans likely to sour amid an almost total U.S. economic shutdown. Profit plunged 45% as the company allocated $4.76 billion for loan losses, the most since 2010, as businesses and households reel from the coronavirus pandemic.The bank follows competitors JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., which posted their highest provisions in a decade Tuesday. The three lenders have collectively stashed away more than $17 billion to cover defaults.Banks are trying to get ahead of loan losses they expect to come from the pandemic bringing large swaths of the global economy to a virtual standstill. While defaults haven’t yet spiked in a meaningful way, bank efforts to build up their reserves show they’re bracing for a severe recession.UnitedHealth’s Witty to Help Lead WHO Vaccine Effort (6:20 a.m. NY)UnitedHealth said Andrew Witty, the chief executive officer of its Optum health-services business, will take a leave of absence to help lead a World Health Organization effort to speed up development of a Covid-19 vaccine. Witty will return at about year-end, the company said in a statement. David Wichmann, UnitedHealth’s CEO, will oversee Optum during Witty’s appointment at the WHO, which is effective April 20. Witty was previously CEO of drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Amazon Threatens to Suspend French Deliveries (6 a.m. NY)Amazon.com Inc. threatened to stop activity at its fulfillment centers in France after a court order banned the sale of non-essential goods, concluding the retailer isn’t doing enough to protect staff from the pandemic. The company was given 24 hours to comply with the ruling to reduce its activity to sell only essential items such as food and hygiene products, and to upgrade its health security procedures.The company faces fines of 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for each day’s delay. Amazon said it was considering lodging an appeal but such a move wouldn’t suspend the order that will be enforced on Wednesday early afternoonChina’s Data on Symptom-Free Cases Reveals Most Never Get Sick (6 a.m. NY)China for the first time publicized a breakdown of people testing positive for the coronavirus without outward signs of being sick, revealing that those among them who remain symptom-free throughout infection are in the majority.Among 6,764 people who tested positive for infection without showing symptoms, only one fifth of them -- 1,297 -- have so far developed symptoms and been re-classified as confirmed cases, China’s National Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said at a briefing in Beijing Wednesday.Iran’s Daily Death Toll Drops Again (6 a.m. NY)Fatalities from the virus in Iran reached 4,777 as the country’s toll decreased for the fourth consecutive day with 94 deaths overnight. Total infections reached 76,389 after 1,512 tested positive since Tuesday.Spain Cases Rise, Deaths Decline (5:45 p.m. HK)Spain reported the biggest increase in the number of confirmed cases in six days on Wednesday, while the daily death toll declined. There were more than 5,000 new infections in the 24 hours through Wednesday, taking the total to 177,633, according to Health Ministry data. The number of fatalities rose by 523 to 18,579, compared to Tuesday’s increase of 637.Health Minister Salvador Illa said this week that Spain has already passed the peak of what is Europe’s most extensive outbreak. While the situation at many hospitals and intensive care units has improved, severe restrictions on movement are still in place.South Korea Leader Set for Win in Election During Pandemic (5:32 p.m. HK)South Korea’s ruling party may have won an outright majority in parliament in elections held Wednesday, exit polls showed, giving President Moon Jae-in fresh momentum to reshape the virus-ravaged economy.The country was holding the biggest election since the coronavirus pandemic spread around the globe -- and it might spur other world leaders with good poll numbers to follow suit.India May See First Contraction Since 1980 (5:29 p.m. HK)Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to extend the mandatory stay-at-home to 40 days against the originally announced 21 days will result in a direct output loss of more than 8%, according to some economists including Sonal Varma of Nomura Holdings Inc. That’s prompted Varma and Kunal Kundu of Societe Generale GSC Pvt. to revise their forecasts for the year to March 2021 to a negative 0.4% and negative 0.1% respectively.The country is planning to ease some curbs to revive the stalled economy. India will allow makers of information technology hardware, farmers and industries in rural areas to resume operations after April 20. Amid a lockdown that’s been extended to May 3, the government will lift restrictions to allow e-commerce companies, goods movement by roads, as well as restart port and air cargo operations.Belgian Fatalities Include Almost 2,000 Unconfirmed Cases (5:20 p.m. HK)Belgian health officials disclosed for the first time the split between deaths following confirmed infections and fatalities in nursing homes that can only be linked with probability to the coronavirus.

Belgium reported 2,454 new cases on Wednesday, taking the total to 33,573; fatalities rose by 283.Portugal to Keep Containment Measures in Place (5:13 p.m. HK)Prime Minister Antonio Costa said containment measures have to stay in place at the moment as the country tries to limit the coronavirus outbreak. The economy was never entirely shut, Costa said in comments broadcast by RTP.Europe Drafts Plan to Get People Back to Work (5 p.m. HK)The European Commission says companies and workers won’t get back to business-as-usual until there’s a vaccine or a cure for Covid-19. In the meantime, the European Union’s executive has drawn up plans for a partial lifting of restrictions in an effort to mitigate the economic devastation.The roadmap unveiled by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday seeks to coordinate a gradual exit from the lockdowns that the bloc’s 27 member states imposed last month to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus. The commission has warned that the easing may be temporary as it will “unavoidably” lead to a spike in new cases that could threaten healthcare systems again and lead to a reinstatement of the confinement rulesU.K. Insurers Plunge (4:51 p.m. HK)U.K. insurers plunged for second day as the Financial Conduct Authority says there are clear cases where firms should pay claims to small and medium-sized enterprises for business interruption from the outbreak. While the U.K. FCA said on Wednesday that most policies will likely not be covered, it added that there are “policies where it is clear that the firm has an obligation to pay out.”Earlier, Peel Hunt slashed price targets for Hiscox, Beazley and Lancashire, forecasting hundreds of millions of dollars of coronavirus exposure.Germany Likely to Extend Lockdown Measures Until May 3 (4:42 p.m. HK)Germany is set to agree on an extension of nationwide lockdown measures until at least May 3 as the government debates with regional leaders on how to gradually relaxing restrictions on public life in the coming weeks. Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to announce the agreement later on Wednesday, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.The number of new cases in Germany fell for a sixth day on Wednesday. There were 2,138 new infections, the lowest increase this month, bringing the total to 132,210, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The country has been in recession since last month but a recovery is expected in the second half, the economy ministry said in its latest monthly report.Coronavirus Spurs Record Drop in Oil Demand (4:05 p.m. HK)Global oil demand will plunge by a record 9% this year due to coronavirus lockdowns, thwarting efforts by OPEC+ to contain the resulting glut of crude, the International Energy Agency said.A decade of demand growth will be wiped out in 2020, when consumption will slump by just over 9 million barrels a day, the agency said in its monthly report. April will suffer the hardest hit, with fuel use contracting by almost a third to the lowest level since 1995.Cases in Russia Increase by 16% (4 p.m. HK)Confirmed cases rose by 3,388 in the past day, Russian consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor reported. New daily cases exceeded 3,000 for first time and have almost tripled from last week. The death toll reached 198 with 28 people dying overnight.Hyped Malaria Pill Doesn’t Help Clear Coronavirus in Study (3:43 p.m. HK)Hydroxychloroquine, the 65-year-old malaria drug that President Donald Trump has praised, appeared not to help patients get rid of the pathogen in a small study. The pill didn’t help patients clear the virus better than standard care and was much more likely to cause side effects, according to a study of 150 hospitalized patients by doctors at 16 centers in China. The research, which hasn’t been peer-reviewed, was released Tuesday.China Slams Trump’s WHO Move (3:40 p.m. HK)China criticized Trump’s move to temporarily halt funding to the WHO and pledged to support the global health body. Trump said he ordered the move because the WHO took China’s claims about the coronavirus “at face value” and failed to share information about the pandemic as it spread.China has “serious concerns” about the decision and called on the U.S. to fulfill its responsibilities, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a briefing on Wednesday. “This U.S. decision will weaken the WHO’s capabilities and undermine international cooperation,” Zhao said. The U.S. move attracted criticism from health policy experts as well as Bill Gates, who warned that cutting off funds “is as dangerous as it sounds,” and said the world needs the WHO “now more than ever.”The Associated Press earlier reported that it obtained internal documents showing Chinese officials waited six days in January before President Xi Jinping warned the public of the dangers of the outbreak. The delay allowed millions of people to travel from the epicenter in Wuhan to elsewhere in the country and the world, the report said. While China’s Zhao said he hadn’t seen the report, Beijing updated the WHO in a “timely” manner and called accusations the government wasn’t transparent “unfair.”Indonesia Set to Bring 34 Million Under Partial Lockdown (3:22 p.m. HK)Indonesia expanded a partial lockdown to more areas near Jakarta, the epicenter of the country’s coronavirus cases, as authorities stepped up efforts to restrict movement of people ahead of the nation’s biggest festive season next month.More than 15 million people living in some cities adjoining the national capital were brought under large scale social distancing rules on Wednesday. The stringent measures include a ban on public gatherings of more than five people, religious and social events and mandatory use of masks. Residents of other satellite towns near Jakarta will implement the partial lockdown on Friday and Pekanbaru, the first city outside the main island of Java, will roll out the measures on Saturday. That would take the total number of people under tighter social distancing rules to 34 million, official data show.HK, Japan Visitor Numbers Slump (3:15 p.m. HK)The number of daily visitors to Hong Kong fell to below 100 on average in the beginning of April amid travel restrictions introduced by the government, the city’s tourism board said.Visitors to Japan in March slumped to levels not seen since its economic heyday in the 1980s after the pandemic shut down global travel, an early sign the impact the drop will have on retailers that thrived on tourist spending. Visitors in March fell 93% from a year earlier to 193,700 people, the steepest drop on record, figures from the Japan National Tourism Organization show. That’s the fewest since 1989, the year when the Nikkei 225 stock average hit its all-time high.U.S. to Boost Payment for Abbott’s Test (2:39 p.m. HK)The U.S. government will nearly double the amount it pays hospitals and medical centers to run Abbott Laboratories’ large-scale coronavirus tests, an incentive to get the facilities to hire more technicians and expand testing that has fallen significantly short of the machines’ potential.Abbott’s m2000 machines, which can process up to 1 million tests per week, haven’t been fully used because not enough technicians have been hired to run them, according to a person familiar with the matter.Sweden Adds $35 Billion to Spending Cap (2:23 p.m. HK)Sweden unveiled a budget proposal that reverses years of fiscal parsimony as the government tries to prevent an all-out economic crisis as a result of the virus. The Social Democrat-led administration is raising its cap on how much it can spend by 350 billion kronor ($35 billion), to 1.74 trillion kronor, it said Wednesday. Sweden’s response to the pandemic remains controversial. It left much of the economy open and has a higher death rate than its Nordic neighbors.Separately, a fresh analysis published by the central bank on Wednesday showed that Denmark needs 250 billion kroner ($37 billion) between April and the end of July to help pay for the economic fallout of Covid-19. Though the estimate is “subject to great uncertainty,” the debt office at the central bank said the new financing need is about 200 billion kroner more than previously predicted.France to Give Support for Air France-KLM in Days (1:56 p.m. HK)Air France-KLM will receive support from the government in a “matter of days,” according to French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.Speaking on RTL radio on Wednesday, Le Maire said the former flag carrier needs backing from government because planes are grounded. Le Maire also said “a large part of our economy is functioning.” The amount of French industry that has restarted has risen from 50% to close to 60%, he said.Austria Undertakes More Random Tests (1:55 p.m. HK)Austria will carry out a second round of random tests to get a clearer picture of total infections, after a first study in early April concluded there were about 28,500 cases in the country, more than triple the official number at the time.The study of 2,800 residents will take nose and throat swabs between April 21 and April 25 to find live infections, and will be followed by anti-virus tests, according to the country’s statistics office.Trump’s Signature to Appear on Stimulus Checks (11:01 a.m. HK)President Donald Trump’s signature will appear on the $1,200 checks being mailed to low- and middle-income households in coming weeks, according to two officials familiar with the decision. Typically, a civil servant’s signature would appear on regular government benefit checks or one-time economic stimulus payments.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-cut-funding-reopening-plans-223001680.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-03	2020-04-03 20:47:16	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Ides of March Linger as Jobs Report Punishes Stocks	Equities slumped to finish the week as the Labor Department's March jobs report was far worse than expected, prompting speculation that next few monthly employment updates will be as bad or even worse because of the coronavirus pandemic.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 sagged 1.51%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.69%  * The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.53%  * Managed care provider UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) was the Dow's worst-performing component today, shedding 4.55%.Getting back to the aforementioned jobs report, the Labor Department said 701,000 jobs were lost last month, well above economists' forecast of 100,000. That projection was probably on the light side given that the last week of March brought more than 3 million jobless claims and that the coronavirus has led to a hiring freeze across multiple industries.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat can't be debated is that March 2020 was the first month of lost jobs on a net basis since 2010. The jobless rate increased to 4.4%. Adding to the pressure on equities today is the pricing in of more bad jobs reports to come. As was noted here yesterday, first-time jobless claims spiked to a record 6.6 million last week, setting the stage for potentially dour April employment update.  * 7 Telecom Stocks That Are Worth a Close Look With jobs being one of the most economic reports in the U.S., 28 of 30 Dow stocks were lower in late trading. Bank BoondoggleIn late trading, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) was tussling with UNH for worst-performing Dow stock. In the case of JPM, this appears to be a symptom of overall market weakness and reports that the bank, along with plenty of its rivals, would be unable to accept applications for the Small Business Administration's (SBA) stimulus loans. However, JPM said later in the day it is in fact taking those applications. Oil RetreatFoul jobs numbers have a tendency to weigh on oil prices. After leading the Dow yesterday, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) gave back some of those gains today. Analysts are tepid on oil stocks in general, but some are pointing to Chevron's ability to protect its dividend as a positive sign.&quot;While the cuts don't completely close the post-dividend outspend, the clear commitment to protecting the balance sheet, and thus the dividend, in this environment should be rewarded and we continue to see Chevron as best positioned to weather this downturn,&quot; said Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. in a recent note to clients. 3M Mask Dilemma3M (NYSE:MMM) was supposed to be one of the beneficiaries of increased demand for medical supplies, including surgical masks, due to the coronavirus. However, the company ran afoul of the White House by exporting some of those needed products, earning Twitter rebuke from President Trump and a loss of more than 3% today.&quot;We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks,&quot; the president tweeted. &quot;Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing--will have a big price to pay!&quot;To be fair, the company released a statement this morning highlighting the humanitarian implications of breaking export chains of medical masks to Canada and Mexico, as well as the potential for retaliation that could cause &quot;the net number of respirators … available to the United States [to] actually decrease.&quot;To be fair, the Dow company has been increasing production to meet increased demand, but being hit with the Defense Production Act (DPA) is still a bad look. Disney DingedDisney (NYSE:DIS) continues its run of being one of the worst-performing Dow names as the stock dropped 3.19% on news that its furloughing some theme park workers and that the pandemic is forcing a reshuffle of its movie lineup. So if you're waiting on the next &quot;Mulan&quot; installment, you'll be waiting until July. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIf this week's volatility wasn't enough for investors, more turbulence could be coming as the big banks, including JPM, kick off first-quarter earnings season in earnest in a couple of weeks.For those focusing on next week, market direction will remain beholden coronavirus headlines, meaning the U.S. desperately needs to flatten the curve and do so soon.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-03-26	2020-03-26 20:36:21	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Jobless Claims Surge, but so do Stocks	In a sign that markets can and do anticipate bad news, sometimes efficiently baking it in before it becomes official, stocks soared again Thursday even as jobless claims across the U.S. swelled to 3.28 million last week, or quadruple the prior record.Source: Provided by FInviz  * The S&P 500 advanced 6.24%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 6.38%  * The Nasdaq Composite added 5.60%  * Believe it or not, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was again the Dow's leader, surging 14% while adding to a stunning rally that has seen shares of the troubled aerospace giant almost double in just a week.Technically speaking, the Dow is out of a bear market, a nearly unthinkable thought just a few days ago. Using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA) as the gauge because one cannot invest directly in an index, data indicate DIA is 21.63% above its recently printed 52-week low.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStill, there's plenty of work to be done because DIA needs to add more than 25% to get back to its 52-week high.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem Investors will take the gains, however, as Thursday marked yet another day of broad-based advances in the blue-chip index with 28 of 30 components higher in late trading. Apple AngstUsually on big up days like this for the Dow, investors expect a big contribution from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). To be sure, the iPad maker was higher by about 3% in late trading, but that put it toward the bottom of Thursday Dow winners.The cap on Apple's Thursday upside was easy to spot: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, one of the stock's biggest supporters, cut his price target on the name to $350 from $400 while noting delivery of 5G iPhones could be pushed back to December.&quot;Having one of its most important iPhone launches in its history into a consumer environment still recovering from the impact of this unprecedented COVID-19 dark storm would be a risky decision that likely gets shelved until [the] holiday season in our opinion,&quot; said Ives in a note to clients. Test TalkFor once, we can discuss United Healthcare (NYSE:UNH) outside of the lens of political risk. The managed care provider was higher by more than 6% late Thursday, putting it in the upper tier of Dow winners, on news that the company is working on a self-administered coronavirus test. Sympathy PlayIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) impressed again in what appears to be a sympathy play scenario. Although Intel doesn't directly compete with Micron (NASDAQ:MU), the latter's strong fiscal second-quarter earnings, a period including some of the coronavirus situation, boosted the stock today, taking the rest of the semiconductor sector along for the ride. Extending its GainsAfter being one of the primary Dow coronavirus victims, Disney (NYSE:DIS) is steadying, ranking as one of the best-performing names in the index over the past week.Importantly, the stock is extending gains it started accruing earlier this week after Moffett Nathanson analyst Michael Nathanson spoke glowingly about the international prospects for the Disney + streaming service.With theme park and movie theater revenue essentially ground to a halt because of the coronavirus, Disney needs to give investors something to be excited over the near-term and Disney+ growth could be that elixir. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayAs noted earlier, equity markets often function as leading indicators and that may prove encouraging with the coronavirus remaining an issue for the global economy. With the exception the weekly jobless claims numbers, most of the data investors have been considering are from February.&quot;In terms of what will happen with the U.S. economy, we can see the slowdown happening in real time,&quot; notes Sara Potter of FactSet. &quot;However, due to the lag in official economic statistics, our ability to measure the economic impact is delayed. We're just receiving February data now, and everything was still relatively rosy then.&quot;The last several days of equity market price action could be suggesting stocks already prepared for the worst when it comes to March's economic data.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014. As of this writing, he did not hold any of the aforementioned securities.

On Wednesday, UnitedHealth Group revealed the results of a peer-reviewed large-scale study that provided the science behind the decision to switch to the less-invasive sample collection method.  The self-swab process doesn't change where FDA-approved testing can happen -- this expanded guidance only applies to the method of collection, meaning at-home swab-based PCR tests that many startups had hoped to bring to market are still on hold.	https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/study-behind-updated-fda-guidance-shows-self-swab-tests-are-as-effective-as-those-done-by-clinicians/?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-11	2020-03-11 20:19:40	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Running From Coronavirus, A Bear Market Beckons	Stocks started Wednesday off on all the wrong notes, a situation that only got worse after the World Health Organization (WHO) officially called the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic, news that gave sellers good reason to punish equities and riskier assets.Source: Provided by FinViz  * The S&P 500 dipped 4.89%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 5,86%  * The Nasdaq Composite swooned 4.70%  * Extending a tailspin of epic proportions, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was far and away the Dow's worst-performing stock today, plunging 16.79%.In late trading, the Dow was residing about 20% below its February record, fitting the technical definition of a bear market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo be sure, coronavirus uncertainty is crippling financial markets and perhaps exacerbating today's declines was a surprising level of silence on the issue from the White House.In fact, things have gotten so bad that, for the second time in a month, Goldman Sachs is paring its year-end S&P 500 estimate, essentially calling for the end of a bull market that was already on thin ice.  * 9 Recession-Proof Stocks to Disinfect the Coronavirus These ominous headlines were greeted with a predictable result: in late trading none of the Dow's 30 stocks were higher. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) was the only member of the blue-chip index not lower by at least 3%. Boeing: Bad to WorseRegular readers of this space know that Boeing frequently makes appearances and rarely with good news. That theme continued today as the aerospace giant was slammed after the company said it's going to draw down the entirety of a $13.8 billion credit revolver. That news comes after Boeing said it had already taken $7.5 billion from that instrument.The original loan was $13 billion from Citigroup, but some other lenders tacked on $800 million and it could be boosted as high as $14.5 billion if other banks join in on the &quot;fun.&quot;Unfortunately, Boeing has morphed from a 737 Max story to coronavirus story because of declining demand and weakness among airlines. If orders for the 787 Dreamliner fall precipitously, which could happen in a recession, Boeing stock could be in for even more severe punishment.Boeing's Wednesday woes again weighed on United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which was also among the worst Dow offenders today. Apple ConcernsRecently, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has looked somewhat less worse for the wear than the broader market, but that doesn't mean the iPhone maker has been immune from COVID-19-induced strife. As expected, the virus is going to have some impact on Apple and at least one analyst is confirming as much.In a note out earlier today, BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan trimmed 2020 delivery estimates on iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watch and accessories.The analyst lowered his Apple earnings estimate to $12.57 a share, from $13.29 while cutting his price target on the stock to $320 from $350, but he did reiterate a &quot;buy&quot; rating. Don't DowIn this case, I'm referring to Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW), a name that has been one of the worst-performing members in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for some time. Down almost 54% from its 52-week, Dow notched a double-digit loss today after the company said it expects sales to fall by $400 million in the current quarter due to the coronavirus. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayGood news is currently in short supply, but for those looking for some green shoots, it's worth noting that amid all the downward revisions to S&P 500 estimates that are currently taking place, many of the banks behind those forecasts are speculating that a new bull market will be born later this year.That's some time to wait and even those projections are imperiled by lack of clarity on when the COVID-19 situation will be resolved in the U.S. Until that happens, there's a significant headwind in front of the economy and riskier assets.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

Reminding investors and those affected by the coronavirus that politics are always at play, Senate Democrats appear to be leaning toward a package that includes paid sick leave and extended unemployment benefits.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe president also said there will be targeted help for the airline and cruise line industries, the latter of which drew some criticism from some market observers because cruise operators are not essential to the U.S. economy the way airlines are.  * Buy the Dip in These 7 Online Advertising Stocks Now Criticism aside, 26 out of 30 Dow stocks were higher in late trading, good for the best ratio in some time. Be Careful With OilWhile Tuesday's rally in equities could be the start of something more substantial, it's hard to envision that being the case with oil. Yes, crude spiked today, but this appears to be more dead cat bounce than end of a bear market. After all, it's hard to get excited about a commodity when demand for it is waning and supply is increasing.Specific to Dow components, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), yes, those stocks were among the index's winner's today, but the concerns about those companies' dividends aren't going away.If anything, those worries are being amplified after rival Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) said earlier today said it's cutting its dividend for the first time in 30 years. No, this isn't a modest reduction: it's an 86% slash that could portend more dividend reductions from the energy sector. Politics Part IIIt's not Super Tuesday, but several states, including delegate-rich Michigan, are holding presidential primaries today. With that, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) was among the Dow winners today.The managed care provider hasn't been perfect, but this month, it is performing less poorly than the S&P 500. That steadiness coupled with its pop today could be seen as UNH stock telling the market that the Sen. Bernie Sanders campaign is on life support. Should former Vice President Joe Biden bolster his delegate tally in significant fashion tonight, UNH could be in for another solid day on Wednesday. More Bad NewsFor those tired of hearing bad news about Boeing (NYSE:BA), you wouldn't be blamed for that sentiment. But on a good day for the broader market, the stock continued sliding, touching its lowest levels since 2017.Even when ignoring the 737 Max issue, which is frankly impossible, Boeing is confounded on other fronts. For example, the COVID-19 epidemic is crimping air travel while low oil prices mean carriers can use older planes for longer periods of time, allowing them to stave off costly upgrades. Neither of those scenarios is constructive for upside in BA stock. Consumer ConundrumConsumer-oriented Dow stocks, namely Disney (NYSE:DIS), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), soared today, but the consumer, the backbone of the economy and to many, the bull market in stocks, remains in an interesting spot.There's no denying the COVID-19 is crimping discretionary spending, but some are making that argument that between declining oil prices and lower mortgage rates, that's $725 billion (yes, billion with a &quot;B&quot;) in savings for consumers. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayI don't want to sound an ominous tone, but Tuesday's upside, while pleasant, doesn't mean markets are out of the coronavirus woods just yet.Consider the following, which is relevant because there are still three weeks left in the first quarter: to this point in 2020, nearly 1,800 earnings calls have taken place and the coronavirus has been mentioned more than 11,300 times.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

That may happen, but the both the BOJ and ECB are already running negative interest rates, meaning there are only so many arrows left in their respective quivers.Stocks also got a lift today on news that Congress has approved nearly $8 billion in spending aimed at the coronavirus as U.S. fatalities caused by the respiratory illness jumped to 11.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven with remaining coronavirus challenges, Wednesday's equity market action was strong enough to deliver a scenario not often seen this year: all 30 of the Dow stocks were higher in late trading. Healthy HealthcareWith Biden's resounding showing last night, he entered Wednesday with a delegate count of 566 to 501 for Medicare For All supporter Sen. Bernie Sanders, explaining why UnitedHealth and other healthcare stocks supported the Dow.  * 7 Strong Value Stocks to Buy for 2020 Add Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to the UNH mix and three of the Dow's top 10 names today hailed from the healthcare sector. Dealing a blow to Sanders's hopes, Biden scored a victory in Maine, which neighbors Sanders's home state of Vermont.The race isn't over, but as been noted in this space so often dating back to last year, investors engaged with the likes of UnitedHealth probably don't want to see Medicare For All become a reality. As such, a more moderate candidate is seen as better news for the politically sensitive healthcare sector. Telling CommentaryAs noted above, all 30 Dow stocks were in the green in late trading, including downtrodden Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX), but some analysts are growing exasperated with traditional energy stocks.In a note to clients Wednesday, Jefferies analysts compared the energy sector to the 1962 New York Mets. For those not familiar with baseball history, the '62 Mets are widely regarded as one of the worst teams in the Major League history, having notched a record of 40-120. Finally, Some Good NewsIf you regularly follow me here, you know that American Express (NYSE:AXP) has been making regular appearances and usually for all the wrong reasons.Frequently viewed as one of the Dow stocks highly vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak due to its intimate ties to business travel and tourism, no one would have been surprised if AXP said its first -- and perhaps second-quarter -- results were going to be dismal.However, CFO Jeffrey Campbell said at the KBW Fintech Payments Conference that the company's guidance isn't going to be affected by the coronavirus epidemic.It's not hyperbole to say that that news from AXP is one of Wednesday's more pleasant surprises. Not So Boring TodayConsumer staples usually isn't the sector investors turn to for excitement and when stocks swooned late last month, the group betrayed its normally defensive reputation.However, with U.S. shoppers stockpiling goods like something out of one of those doomsday-prepper TV shows, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) were all up at least 4% today. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIn what may considered good news following Tuesday's terrible reaction to the emergency interest rate cut, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said today markets shouldn't put too much stock in another rate cut at the Fed meeting later this month.Rate cuts aren't enough to ease crimped supply chains or to get folks traveling again, indicating that what investors really want to hear is that the U.S., China and others are close to containing the epidemic.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-03-04	2020-03-04 21:08:00	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow books nearly 1,200-point gain, reclaims perch above 27,000 as stock market focuses on coronavirus response	U.S. stocks on Wednesday shot higher as investors appeared to react positively to early signs of efforts to address the outbreak of COVID-19, the infectious disease that reportedly originated in Wuhan, China in December and has claimed more than 3,100 lives. Some of the gains also were attributed to a victories by former Vice President Joe Biden in Super Tuesday election contests to help determine the Democratic nominee who will face off against incumbent President Donald Trump. The advance for markets also come a day after the Federal Reserve cut benchmark interest rates by a half a percentage point to a range of 1%-1.25%, marking the first such emergency cut since the 2008 financial crisis.Fed Chairman Powell said the cut was to preemptively combat the negative impact of the viral outbreak but markets reacted negatively to them. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 1,171 points, or 4.5%, to end around 27,090. The blue-chip index fell nearly 800 points in the previous session. The gain marks the second gain of at least one thousand points for the 124-year-old equity index. The S&P 500  gained 4.2%, driven higher by the health-care sector. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index  closed rose 3.9%. Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc.  led the day's gains in the Dow, up almost 11%, with analysts attributing the health-care company's gains to Biden gaining traction over Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. The Vermont Sen. had been perceived as less friendly to the health-care industry. U.S. lawmakers were reached an agreement on funding a roughly $8 billion response to the coronavirus, the Wall Street Journal reported. Law makers are expected to approve more than $3 billion for developing treatments for COVID-19 and $2.2 billion for containment.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0104fd0b-d0e4-325e-9493-45b091bd4bce/dow-books-nearly-1%2C200-point.html?.tsrc=rss

During that fast-paced highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.For those who don't have the time to tune in live or listen to the podcast, Benzinga will highlight one stock that merits further discussion. This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation.Stock Of The Day: UnitedHealth GroupWhen an issue is trading wildly in one direction or another, it's important to identify the catalyst for the move and act accordingly. Is it a short-term news driven catalyst that only has a short-term impact or is it a long-term fundamental catalyst that may have long-term implications?An excellent example of this is the price action of UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE: UNH) in Wednesday's session.With the upcoming election getting into full swing with the results of Super Tuesday being a major victory for Joe Biden, it was also a major victory for health care stocks. First of all, it diminished the chances of Bernie Sanders getting the Democratic nomination and in turn. As a result, his Medicare-For-All proposal, which would have destroyed issues in the sector, may be a thing of the past.See Also: Biden's Super Tuesday Surge Gives Health Care Stocks A BoostPrice Action Since The Market ImplosionJust as the broad market has suffered over the past few weeks, so has the share price of UnitedHealth. Just 11 trading sessions ago, it made a new all-time high at $306.73 and all-time closing high at $305.31. Amidst the retreat in the broad market, the issue bottomed on Friday at $245.30.It was able to meander as high as $280.35 on Tuesday before faltering to close just off its low for the session at $261.40.Huge Sigh Of Relief, But Be CarefulWith Biden's victory secured overnight, buyers sprang into action at 4 a.m. onset of pre-market trading, leaping $14 higher and never looking back. By the 9:30 a.m. open, it was trading over $290.When the issue was being discussed on the show, both hosts cautioned against chasing the issue on the long-side. It was as simple as recognizing all the buyers trapped from the last few weeks that were not going to &quot;look a gift horse in the mouth&quot; (better known as the overhead supply theory). While it was good news for the company and sector, it was not an important fundamental catalyst such as an earning beat and or raised guidance.Co-host Dennis Dick desired to short the issue and was hoping the issue filled the void in price action from Feb. 21, when it bottomed the previous day at $298.61 and peaked the following day at $288.99.Unfortunately for him, the issue rallied only to $295.84 and is trading in the mid-$280 handle as of 11 a.m.See more from Benzinga  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Costco  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: General Electric  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Amarin(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The gains for equity gauges also come after former Vice President Joe Biden won a string of key Democratic victories in the Super Tuesday primaries. The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened about 606 points, 2.3% higher, near 26,524, while the S&P 500  was 1.1%, 32 points, higher, opening near 3,036.

That helped boost shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc., which had rocketed more than 10% higher pre-market.

Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan analyst Gary Taylor suggested the investor reaction to COVID-19 was an overreaction, as previous respiratory pandemics haven't produced medical expense impacts that were greater than an average &quot;elevated&quot; seasonal influenza impact. &quot;Our conclusion is quite simple; we are extraordinarily skeptical that COVID-19 proves to be a material headwind to managed care earnings in 2020, and even if it was, it would likely be a one-time impact that would not impair forward earnings power,&quot; Taylor wrote in a note to clients.

On Monday, the stock had tumbled 7.8%, amid a sharp selloff in the broader stock market--the Dow Jones Industrial Average  had plunged over 1,000 points&#92;--amid investor fear over the impact of the global spread of COVID-19, but also after Senator Bernie Sanders' surprise resounding victory in the Nevada primary. Sanders is an advocate for &quot;Medicare for All,&quot; which would reduce the need for private MCOs. &quot;While we believe the coronavirus was the main cause of the movement in the market on Monday, we also believe the Democratic nomination becoming Senator Sanders' to lose contributed in part to deeper pressure on managed care names,&quot; said Raymond James analyst Chris Meekins. Among other MCOs, shares of Humana Inc.  dropped 3.3% on Tuesday, Centene Corp.  slid 3.2%, Anthem Inc.  gave up 2.8%, Cigna Corp.  shed 2.1% and Molina Healthcare Inc.  lost 3.1%, while the Dow dropped 398 points, or 1.4%.

2020-02-24	2020-02-24 21:31:40	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Monday, Bloody Monday	It wasn't &quot;Black Monday,&quot; but today will not be remembered fondly over the course of market history as each of three major domestic equity benchmarks were punished amid intensifying concerns regarding the coronavirus from China. In the span of just two days, $1 trillion has been wiped off the market value of global equities.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 tumbled 3.35%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 3.56%.  * The Nasdaq Composite shed 3.71%.  * UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) felt the &quot;Bern&quot; and was the worst-performing Dow name today, sliding 7.8%.A lot of the talk about the coronavirus today had a &quot;why today?&quot; theme to it. What that means is that for weeks it appeared as though stocks in the U.S. and Europe, too (they deserve some credit across the pond) were holding up very nicely against the virus backdrop.However, that sentiment started to shift last week as it became more apparent that the virus isn't just a China problem. It's a global problem.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn addition to China, Covid-19 is wreaking havoc on technology hubs such as Japan and South Korea. It has forced the cancellation of major tourist events in Italy, the Eurozone's third-largest economy, prompting speculation that another recession there isn't far off.In other words, it's not surprising that in late trading, all of the 30 Dow stocks were in the red. A dozen of those 30 were lower by 3% or more.  * 7 Tarnished Blue-Chip Stocks to Ditch Now  Burned by BernieAs noted above, UnitedHealth was the worst-performing Dow component today, though the slump likely had little little to do with the coronavirus and plenty to do with Sen. Bernie Sanders winning the Nevada Democratic Caucus over the weekend. Sanders is a proponent of Medicare For All.This isn't a one-off problem for UNH stock. With the Silver State victory, Sanders continues building momentum and his odds of securing the Democratic nomination are getting shorter, not longer. With that in mind, the upcoming Super Tuesday primaries could be a real headwind for UNH. Card DeclinedI noted last week that American Express (NYSE:AXP) is one of the names most vulnerable to lingering coronavirus concerns because the virus is a real strain on global travel. Tourists are staying home and conferences and conventions are being canceled, none of which are good news for a stock like AXP. In fact, it was the second-worst name in the Dow today behind UNH. Tech, TooPredictably, technology stocks were repudiated today with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) among the worst offenders. Mentioning that duo as it relates to the coronavirus is relevant due to the China supply chain issues these companies are facing.&quot;The spread of the coronavirus in China is credit negative for US semiconductor companies that generate a large portion of revenues from sales to Chinese manufacturers or depend on end market demand from Chinese consumers,&quot; said Moody's Investors Service. Maybe, But Not YetThere was some chatter that some industrial stocks could be avenues for waiting out the coronavirus issue and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) got a nice write-up from Barron's, which noted the stock is inexpensive. However, that stock along with Boeing (NYSE:BA) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) each closed lower today. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayTo quantify how bad things were for the Dow on Monday, none of its components finished in the green, none of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished higher and the days best-performing assets were standard safe havens, such as gold and municipal bonds.

2020-02-20	2020-02-20 21:17:06	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: The Coronavirus Takes a Toll	For a while, it has felt as though U.S. equities have been immune to the Covid-19 outbreak. That thesis was dealt a blow Thursday. The major domestic benchmarks slumped as global investors grew pensive that the epidemic will weigh on earnings.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 slipped 0.38%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.44%.  * The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.67%.  * Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), one of the Dow's more China-sensitive names, was the index's worst performer today, shedding 2.59%.Underscoring the point that today was a rough one, 23 of the Dow's 30 components were lower in late trading. The Dow's technology components were mixed on the day, but with the index being price-weighted, it was decked by losses by Intel, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPart of the problem is that two novel coronavirus deaths were reported in Japan and one in South Korea, two of the most tech-heavy countries in the world and major markets for U.S.-based technology companies. Reversal of FortuneGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) were two of the Dow's leaders yesterday, but the wind came out of those sails today on news that Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is acquiring E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) in a bid to bolster its exposure to retail clients.  * 7 Small Cap Stocks That Pack a Wallop The deal, which is slated to close in the fourth quarter, is the latest in the brokerage space this year and another sign that these firms are warming up to smaller investors. Sources say Goldman was mulling buying E*Trade, but decided against the move, allowing rival Morgan Stanley to swoop in. Politics AgainThere was another Democratic debate last night, and just going by what folks are saying on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), it appears Sen. Bernie Sanders was the winner. Good news for him and his supporters. Bad news for UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), which was among the Dow's worst losers today. Sanders is a Medicare For All backer, an issue that has long been a thorn in the side of UNH stock. Simple ExplanationAll things considered, oil prices performed admirably today. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX) did not, and there's at least one straightforward reason as to why. Global airlines are forecasting the first decline in passenger traffic this year since 2003 due to the coronavirus epidemic. Airlines obviously use jet fuel, a higher-end product refined from crude. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThe coronavirus outbreak is indeed testing investors' bullishness. For example, BlackRock previously forecast a &quot;V-shaped&quot; recovery in global economic activity, but how well that plays out is likely to be tested.&quot;Yet the depth and width of the 'V' this time are highly uncertain,&quot; said the asset manager in a note out today. &quot;This outbreak could be more disruptive than past ones because it could be more severe, and because of greater reliance on global supply chains.&quot;BlackRock notes that previous viruses have been followed by pent-up demand-driven rebounds, but that this time could be different.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

Growth has trumped valuation at every turn in this bull market. Teladoc's growth is going to be explosive. The Telehealth OpportunityUnsurprisingly, Teladoc Health has jumped out to an early lead in telehealth. The company, after all, was founded by veterans of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration after that agency pioneered remote health services for astronauts at the International Space Station.Since its founding in 2002, Teladoc has become the unquestioned leader in telehealth. Its market share reportedly sits near 75%. The company offers some 450 medical subspecialties, and completed 2.6 million visits worldwide in 2018. That latter figure should rise over 50% in 2019, based on current company's guidance.Teladoc's customers already include health insurance providers like Aetna (NYSE:AET), UnitedHealth (NYSE:UHC) and several Blue Cross Blue Shield companies. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and General Mills (NYSE:GIS) headline the company's roster of employers.Teladoc clearly has the &quot;first mover advantage&quot; in telehealth. And it's going to be a fast-growing market.Younger millennial consumers won't want to visit a doctor's office any more than they want to visit a brick-and-mortar retailer. They can virtually visit a doctor on the Teladoc app in a median time of just ten minutes.Rural patients face long driving distances and/or a lack of specialized providers. Telehealth can be a literal lifesaver for them.Even our company's mental health crisis could be ameliorated via telemedicine. Simply put, Teladoc's service can deliver better care to more patients in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. Is TDOC Stock Too Expensive?Again, Teladoc Health isn't cheap. That might worry some investors. But the company has plenty of room to grow into -- and beyond -- the current valuation.After all, the potential market here is enormous. Back in 2017, Teladoc Health estimated its addressable market in the U.S. at $29 billion.That was before the company acquired Advance Medical in 2018, which helped expand the company worldwide. As of the end of 2018, Teladoc operated in over 130 countries and more than 20 languages, according to its Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Revenue for 2020 is likely to be less than $700 million. That in turn suggests Teladoc has penetrated less than 3% of its potential market just in the U.S. As the company noted in a presentation last month, there are 75 million potential users as current U.S. clients. Teladoc's total user base at the moment is just 54 million.If the U.S. market is $30 billion and the global market $50 billion or more, what happens if Teladoc holds even 30% market share? Or 60%?In either scenario, an $8 billion market value won't look &quot;expensive&quot; in retrospect. It will look like a gift. Stick With the WinnerI've been recommending Teladoc Health going back to 2018. All that has changed since then is its valuation. TDOC stock has gained 68% since mid-2018.But I believe the company, and the stock, are just getting started. There are few better opportunities out there, where an investor can own the unchallenged leader in an industry with decades of growth ahead.Tesla is one. Shopify another. Those stocks have risen by multiples of their former share prices -- and faced valuation concerns the entire way. TDOC stock has risen nicely, but it hasn't seen that explosive upside yet.But it will at some point, as long as Teladoc keeps executing.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

What's next for the stock? We take a look at earnings estimates for some clues.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-unh-0-5-since-163004415.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-02-14	2020-02-14 11:30:50	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Income and Growth Investors Will Benefit as CVS Adopts Managed Care	It's never easy to marry companies that seem to exist in different industries. This is especially true if a buyer is on what looks like the &quot;failing&quot; side of the equation.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com That's the case for CVS Health (NYSE:CVS).Net income of $1.7 billion, $1.73 per share, on revenue of $66.9 billion beat analyst estimates by 5 cents per share. Those numbers even beat the company's own projections.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis didn't cause investors to rush into the stock. That's because results from other health insurers, most notably UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), looked better. The jury is still out, one reporter wrote, on whether combining a company that takes healthcare premiums with one that sells healthcare services makes sense.No, it isn't. Could be WalgreensDon't compare CVS to UNH, which has been walking down the managed care road for years, or Centene (NYSE:CNC), built to serve Medicare and Medicaid patients. Compare it to Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), the other major drug store chain.  * 20 Stocks to Buy From the Law of Accelerating Returns There's no comparison. Over the last year CVS stock is up 8.6%, mid-way between the gains of UNH and CNC. Walgreens is down 25.1%.Cynics will say CVS' results only looked good because it sold more drugs and charged higher prices for branded drugs. They will say CVS only bought Aetna, a major health insurer, for $69 billion to lower its costs.But CVS didn't buy Aetna to lower drug costs. CVS bought Aetna so it could match the income from premiums to the outgo of healthcare spending. The income is now starting to flow. Revenue for the entire company was up 32% over a year ago, representing Aetna premiums. The shift of claims into CVS is still ongoing.There are other benefits to CVS from getting into insurance. The repeal of the Health Insurance Fee (HIF) will flow through to CVS, through Aetna. More to ComeWhat remains to be seen is how competitive Aetna can be, now that more benefits are being served through CVS stores. CVS MinuteClinics can now handle 80% of what a primary care physician can treat, often with no copay or reduced costs.CVS is building on that by turning 1,500 stores into HeathHUBs, selling services as well as products. The plan is for the new stores to add incremental business from Walgreens. It also makes Aetna more attractive, by lowering out-of-pocket costs. Stores that have converted to the new format outperform traditional CVS stores, the company said on its conference call.CVS is now projecting earnings between $7.04 and $7.17 per share in 2020. Based on the stock's Feb. 13 opening price of $73.45, that's a forward price-to-earnings ratio of barely 10. The 50 cent per share dividend also pays a yield of 2.7%. By way of comparison, the yield on UNH is 1.5%. The Bottom Line on CVS StockIt's true that CVS is trying to become more like UnitedHealth. It's becoming less like Walgreens. CVS is aiming to be a low-cost leader in managed care for the private insurance market.That's good news for both income and growth investors.For income investors, you're already getting a better yield on a new CVS investment than on any managed care stock. For growth investors, you are still getting in early on the transition.Managed care is the model for all insurers going forward. This is true whether they're taking money from government, corporations or individuals. You can't have an unlimited draw from a limited pool of funds. That's the road CVS Health has embarked on.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Chinese lawmakers have also taken steps to curb a possible economic downturn from the coronavirus,&quot; reports CNBC.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Hot & Trendy Generation Z Stocks to Buy In late trading, 20 of the 30 Dow Jones stocks were higher today with about dozen sporting gains of 1% or more. A Bernie Bump?With his victory in New Hampshire last night, Sen. Bernie Sanders is -- at least for the moment -- the Democratic front runner. He is a supporter of Medicare For All and that may confuse some investors about why UnitedHealth has recently been steady and soared today.The reason UNH, one of the names most vulnerable to Medicare For All talk, and the market in general may be rising along with Sanders's momentum requires further examination. Strategists for Standard Charter point out in a recent note that if Sanders is the Democratic nominee this year, that increases the odds of President Trump winning a second term, reports Barron's.Sanders is far from a sure bet at this point simply because Michael Bloomberg, the candidate with the deepest pockets, didn't actively campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire. Rather, the former New York mayor is targeting a big delegate haul from the upcoming Super Tuesday primary slate. Let's see how markets react to those outcomes when they arrive early next month. Bad News Becomes Good NewsNike (NYSE:NKE) was in position to be the second-best Dow stock today due to a combination of ebbing coronavirus concerns and a weak earnings report yesterday from rival Under Armour (NYSE:UA).Those are helpful, but fleeting catalysts. Arguably, a better reason for investors to consider Nike is the company's new retail strategy, one that should have longer-ranging, positive implications. Also in the ClubAlong with UnitedHealth and Nike, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was the other Dow component in the 2% or more club today. This is an obvious China-sensitive name and one that has struggled to start 2020 due in large part to the coronavirus issue.The industrial machinery maker was able to reopen its China-based factories a couple of days ago, but the headwind going forward for Caterpillar will be just how much the &quot;Wuhan virus&quot; is going to shave off global economic, particularly in China. Good News Part IISometimes, the mere thought of good news helps a stock and that was the case with Boeing (NYSE:BA) today after Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn raised his price target on the stock to $367 from $321, but he kept his &quot;hold&quot; rating in place. He believes Boeing is entering a &quot;positive news period.&quot;&quot;While nothing material was revealed, the perspectives offered by the company…left us incrementally more constructive on the name,&quot; said Spingarn in a note to clients. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThere are a few more earnings report of note to consider, including Dow component Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) later today and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on Thursday.Clearly, the near-term issues investors need to stay abreast of are the coronavirus because a cure hasn't been found and incremental progress could be set back at a moment's notice. In the U.S., there will be some respite on the political front as the Nevada Caucus is over a week away.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

And it's one that's getting worse, not better. However, stocks clung to modest gains Tuesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average supported by a host of China-sensitive fare.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 added 0.17%.  * The Dow Jones was flat today.  * The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.11%.  * Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) was the blue-chip index's leader today, something that hasn't been said in a while, as the materials name has sagged amid coronavirus fears.In other news today, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified before a House committee (he'll be before the Senate tomorrow), noting that the U.S. economy remains on firm footing. Predictably, Powell did not make overt comments on the central bank's plans for interest rates this year.Looking at Dow offenders today, an obvious one is Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which was stung after a New York judge signed off on Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) completing their merger, which will lead to the creation of the country's number three mobile carrier.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn late trading, 16 of the Dow's 30 members were in the green. Tech TumultCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) were the exceptions, but the other Dow technology stocks traded lower today on news that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is reviewing past acquisitions by some tech giants.  * 7 Great ETFs to Buy for the Rise of 5G On the Dow, this is relevant to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The FTC voted 5-0 in review of the acquisition review order. Interestingly, some market observers are making a case for Microsoft spinning off its fast-growing cloud business, Azure. That might help the company deflect some regulatory scrutiny if it chooses to go that route.For Apple, the FTC is likely looking into what are known as &quot;discreet deals,&quot; something the company does multiple times a month, but doesn't reveal because the transactions are small and usually about gaining intellectual property. Be Careful HereAs has been widely noted, the energy sector was a mess in January. In fact, it was the only one of the 11 sectors represented in the S&P 500 that traded lower last month.More recently, Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have steadied. Both were among the Dow's winners today and Chevron is up more than 4% over the past week. Yes, there is value to be had in the energy patch, but valuations are depressed for a reason. Investors may want to wait for a bit &quot;show me&quot; out of Exxon and Chevron before rushing in. Primary PreviewThe New Hampshire Democratic Primary is taking place today and, perhaps surprisingly, all but one of the Dow's healthcare stocks was in the green. Merck (NYSE:MRK) was the offender, but only in slight fashion.The bigger surprise is that UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) was one of the Dow's better performers today, potentially a sign that markets are at peace with Sen. Bernie Sanders notching another strong showing tonight. That or markets don't see the Vermont senator as a credible threat in a matchup against President Trump. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayI'm usually a fan of the notion that history doesn't always repeat, but it often rhymes. Hopefully, that proves to be the case with the coronavirus.&quot;What can we learn from past global disease outbreaks? Economic growth and markets have historically responded with a V-shaped pattern,&quot; said BlackRock in a recent note. &quot;The temporary hit to economic activity results in pent-up demand, which eventually helps fuel the rebound in economic activity.

2020-02-07	2020-02-07 12:10:08	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Why Trump and UNH Stock Have Four More Years	I'm not going to pretend to know all the reasons why shares of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) popped up more than 5% on the Feb. 5 session. But I have a strong suspicion that astute Wall Street powerbrokers watched the prior evening's State of the Union Address. The unprecedented drama that unfolded there bodes very well for our president and by logical deduction, UNH stock.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com First, let me back up and provide some context. Last year saw UNH return 22% for stakeholders, which isn't a bad deal for a big, boring blue-chip investment. Arguably, most folks buy equity in UnitedHealth for stable revenue streams and a sure dividend. Never does this name appear on a list of get-rich-quick schemes.However, the net bullishness in UNH stock overlooks how choppy and volatile it was in 2019. By the end of the first half, shares were basically flat because, political momentum picked up for &quot;Medicare for All&quot; proposals. So much so that UnitedHealth Group CEO David Wichmann warned that such proposals would &quot;destabilize the nation's health system.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAccording to CNBC, Wichmann rarely discusses politics. Therefore, his opinion stood out more than usual. Not surprisingly, it also negatively affected UNH stock, with shares sinking from mid-July to late September.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends The other significant contextual factor is President Trump and his trade war against China. As you know, UNH stock responded very positively to Trump's administration. Since inauguration day, shares have nearly doubled.However, a poor economy represented a serious risk to a second term and that translates to potentially large-scale changes in the healthcare system that Wichmann fears.Thankfully, House speaker Nancy Pelosi assuaged those fears. Pelosi Stunt Will Fire-up UNH StockLike probably most Americans, I watched the SOTU address because I knew I was going to watch a train wreck. I wasn't disappointed.The fireworks started right off the bat, with Trump seemingly declining Pelosi's offer of a handshake. Presumably, in response, Pelosi cut short the customary introduction of the President.I can overlook the chilly interaction between the two based on the impeachment controversy. What I could not overlook - and millions of American voters would surely agree with me - were Pelosi's childish antics in the background. Finally, after Trump concluded his speech, she ripped her copy of it in plain view of the camera.From her point of view, she protested what she claimed were &quot;page after page&quot; of &quot;mistruths.&quot; She's passionate, I'll give her that. But in her childish antics, she might as well have given what the Republicans chanted earlier that evening: &quot;Four more years!&quot;In the military and the various uniformed services of the federal government, we have a tradition of saluting (senior) officers. You might not personally like the officer. Ultimately, though, he or she represents the office they are holding and that is what uniformed members salute.By ripping the speech, Pelosi dishonored the highest traditions of this country. She further disrespected the office of the Presidency of the United States. Honestly, it was one of the most shocking moments I have ever witnessed.Now, I recognize that the nation is deeply divided politically. But our government representatives must demonstrate basic decorum and etiquette when conducting official functions of the U.S. Failure to do so is an unconscionable insult, yet here we are.However, if you're long UNH stock, you're looking forward to celebrating November 2020. UnitedHealth Shareholders Breathing a Sigh of ReliefIf I wasn't clear above, let me state it bluntly: I wholeheartedly believe that Donald J. Trump will win his second term. I'll go a step further. I think it'll be a landslide victory.Americans are not the smartest creatures on this planet. But I thank my lucky stars that America's forefathers apparently forecasted our intellectual and moral decline, and the gift they gave us, the Electoral College, will prevent the tyranny of stupidity (see progressive California's business-killing AB 5 as an example) and emotional instability for at least the next few years.However, it was rough going for some time for &quot;The Donald,&quot; which is why UNH stock was turbulent in 2019. But with a phase one trade deal signed, and headline economic numbers moving in the right direction at the right time, it'd be crazy to bet on anyone else.It's nothing personal…it's just business.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-04	2020-02-04 21:27:48	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Coronavirus, Caucus Uncertainties and Stocks Don’t Care	There was plenty of uncertainty to go around today. The coronavirus appears to be getting worse, not better. It's so bad in fact that Macau, the world's largest gambling hub, is closing casinos for two weeks. Here in the U.S., the Iowa Democratic Caucus was hindered by glitches galore and the result still isn't known as of this writing. Markets typically don't like that level of uncertainty, but they bucked that trend today.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 advanced surged 1.50%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.44%.  * The Nasdaq Composite rallied higher by 2.10%.  * File this under a rarity for this space, but in late trading, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was tussling with some other names for top honors in the Dow.Adding to the significance of the U.S. rally today is this interesting factoid: the Nasdaq-100 Index raced to another all-time high despite a roughly 3% post-earnings slide by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), one of the index's marquee components.Obviously, we're discussing U.S. stocks here, but one catalyst for the good fortune to start the week is China being proactive to prop up their markets in the face of the coronavirus epidemic. No, Monday wasn't pleasant for Chinese stocks, but the central bank there has injected almost $243 billion into markets and it's reasonable to expect an interest rate cut beckons.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn late trading, 28 of 30 Dow stocks were higher, one of the best ratios seen in weeks. Caterpillar CallOn light news, Caterpillar jumped 3.22%. As noted here, the industrial machinery appears poised to raise its dividend again early this year, potentially allaying concerns about cash flow. Following the company's recent fourth-quarter earnings, which was at best a mixed bag, some analysts remain cautious on the name.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends &quot;We believe conservatism is spreading throughout the heavy equipment industry as customers are taking a wait-and-see approach with their capital expenditure investments as uncertainty persists in many geographies,&quot; said Morningstar in a fresh research note. &quot;We believe such a pullback in sales might impede Caterpillar's planned expansion of its aftermarket revenue, and we are reducing our fair value estimate to $156 from $166.&quot; Pleasant SurpriseVisa (NYSE:V) was toward the bottom end of the Dow winners today, but highlights just how strong the index was Tuesday and it's not an indictment of Visa stock, which gained more than 1%.It can be argued that Visa's strength was a pleasant surprise because it's expected that the company will soon unveil significant alterations to its interchange fee program. Some businesses will pay less when they swipe customers' Visa cards, but online retailers are likely to pay more. That could mean more revenue for Visa due to the growth of e-commerce. This Is Getting ConcerningExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) was the worst-performing name in the Dow today, shedding about 1%. That on a day when oil prices rallied and rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX) was among the Dow winners.Today's slide takes Exxon deeper into 10-year low territory and there's an article by Barron's raising concerns about the company's ability to generate enough cash flow to cover its previously sacred dividend. Even if the payout can be sustained, the company would deal a blow to investors by not raising, even modestly. Pre-Earnings RallyDisney (NYSE:DIS) reports earnings after the bell today with Wall Street expecting earnings of $1.46 a share on revenue of $20.783 billion. Under normal circumstances, an update on Disney + would be the issue investors would focus on, but since the company has a theme park in Shanghai, CEO Bog Iger and team will likely need to make some commentary on how the coronavirus is affecting the company. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodaySomething interesting that stood out today was the strength in Dow healthcare stocks. Yes, even UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH).I don't possess a crystal ball, but I suspect the release of the Iowa caucus results coupled with a State of the Union address tonight in which drug prices will almost certainly be mentioned could present some near-term headwinds for the sector. On a related note, Dow component Merck (NYSE:MRK) reports fourth-quarter results before the bell tomorrow.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-03	2020-02-03 21:24:25	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: A Coronavirus Rebound in the U.S., But Not China	Monday brought a tale of two markets for the U.S. and China -- the world's two largest economies. Domestic equities rebounded following last Friday's slide. U.S. stocks were boosted by a report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which indicated its manufacturing activity index climbed to 50.9 last month from an upwardly revised reading of 47.8 in December. Readings above 50 are considered positive.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 advanced 0.73%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.51%.  * The Nasdaq Composite soared 1.34%.  * Nike (NYSE:NKE) was the Dow Jones leader today as the stock earned an analyst upgrade even as amid some legal controversyEarlier today, China confirmed that there have been 361 coronavirus fatalities on the mainland, topping the 349 seen during the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. To this point, there has been just one death outside of China (in the Philippines) and the number of total deaths is well below the roughly 800 suffered during the SARS outbreak, but plenty of market observers and health experts are now making SARS comparisons.Prior to the open of Monday's China trading session, the first time markets there have been open in two weeks, Beijing implemented a slew of controls, including a short selling ban and liquidity injection, none of which could prevent stocks there from plunging. The gambit was similar to some of the efforts used in the U.S. at the height of the global financial crisis and proved equally as ineffective.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 of the Top Franchise Stocks to Buy Now U.S. stocks proved somewhat resistant to the China fallout with about two-thirds of the Dow's 30 members pointed higher in late trading. Nike Runs HigherIt was an interesting day for Nike to say the least. The athletic apparel and footwear king is deal with the Michael Avenatti trial, one it will likely ultimately win. However, the federal government is looking into Nike's role in a grassroots basketball scandal that has ensnared several assistant coaches of big-name colleges across the country.Rumors are swirling that Nike and some of its rivals may have directed cash to some high school hoops phenomenons to persuade those players to attend colleges that the companies sponsor. Investors should note that is investigation could take awhile to play out and it appears that Wall Street isn't overly concerned about it.J.P. Morgan Securities added Nike to its focus list today while modestly raising its price target on the name to $111 from $110, noting that the recent weakness in the name is a buying opportunity. Good For GoldmanGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) traded higher today on reports that the company is in talks with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to possibly offer loan products to Amazon merchants. Neither company confirmed the speculation, but assuming it's true, it jibes with Goldman's efforts to bolster its consumer-facing operations as it moves away from trading in a bid to boost profits. Even Apple's Not ImmuneApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) traded slightly lower today and while some investors may be focusing on the headlines that the company closed its retail stores and corporate offices in China due to the coronavirus, the issue isn't so much the stores as it is how the illness could affect the Apple supply chain. The company itself the store closures will have a minimal impact.&quot;The real question to us is whether channel inventories work down materially, should production plants of Apple's semiconductor components or Foxconn's own plants be disrupted in any material way in the coming weeks,&quot; said Deutsche Bank's Jeriel Ong in a note out today. Evaluating ExxonMonday was another brutal day for oil prices and Dow component Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) wasn't spared in the fallout. In fact, the largest U.S. oil company was the Dow's worst-performing name today, shedding 2.2%.Last week, the company &quot;reported fourth-quarter earnings that continue to reflect the macroeconomic headwinds the company is facing across all parts of its business, which are weighing on earnings and cash flow,&quot; said Morningstar in a note out today. Some ReliefSearch around news sites, prediction sites and political punditry and it's clear the consensus is that Medicare For All supporter Sen. Bernie Sanders is likely to win the Iowa caucus tonight. Mr. Market may be signaling a different outcome as UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), easily the Dow component most vulnerable to Sanders momentum trader higher today, gaining 0.61%. Make of that what you will. Bottom Line of the Dow Jones TodayNo, the Dow didn't come close to clawing back all of last Friday's 600-point tumble, but the rebound has to start somewhere and it's impressive that it started against a challenging backdrop today. One wildcard to consider is that, on a historical basis, February isn't a great month for stocks. Perhaps today's upside will set the stage for a reversal of that trend.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-30	2020-01-30 21:19:37	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Stocks Show Immunity to Coronavirus Concerns	The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak an international emergency earlier today, sending riskier assets lower in the process. That call makes sense because the number of confirmed cases and deaths are rising rapidly, reaching 7,700 and 170, respectively, as of early Thursday.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 rose 0.31%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.43%.  * The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.26%.  * There aren't many Dow winners to discuss today, but Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was easily the standout, jumping 2.82% following its Wednesday afternoon earnings report.In addition to the virus concerns, some economic data released today provided unwanted headwinds for stocks. The Commerce Department said fourth-quarter GDP rose 2.1%, but some economists were critical of that figure, saying it was attributable to lower imports, not increased business investment.Another &quot;trouble spot&quot; on the economic front was the consumer spending that showed that metric increased just 1.8% in the fourth quarter following a 3.2% gain in the third quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn other words, there were enough negative or tepid headlines today to facilitate a mediocre day on the Dow Jones with just 14 of the index's 30 residents higher in late trading. Marvels of MicrosoftAs noted above, Microsoft was by far the Dow's top performer today, delivering the type of post-earnings surge some thought the stock was capable of prior to that announcement. In its fiscal second quarter, Microsoft notched GAAP earnings of $1.51 per share on revenue of $36.91 billion. Wall Street was expecting earnings of of $1.32 per share and $35.67 billion in sales.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for February Contrarians Predictably, investors are fawning over what Microsoft had to say about its Azure cloud business. Azure revenue surged 62% in the fiscal second quarter, a stunning increase to be sure.&quot;Results continue to underscore our thesis, which centers on customer adoption of hybrid cloud environments with Azure,&quot; said Morningstar. &quot;Microsoft continues to use its dominant position of on-premises architecture to allow customers to move to the cloud easily and at their own pace, which we believe will continue over the next five years.&quot; The Fizz Is InRivaling Microsoft for top Dow honors today was Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which surged 3.21% to an all-time high on the back of an impressive fourth-quarter earnings report. The world's largest soft drink maker said it earned 44 cents on sales of $9.07 billion in the last three months of 2019, topping analysts' estimates calling for revenue of $8.89 billion.Atlanta-based Coca-Cola forecast full-year 2020 earnings of $2.25 per share, slightly below the $2.26 analysts are expecting, but investors clearly didn't mind as highlighted by the stock's stellar showing. Bad News BearsInvestors hoping that 2020 would bring better things for the energy sector will have to either wait a little longer or avoid the group over the near-term because the coronavirus has sent oil into a bear market, weighing on the likes of Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) along the way.In late trading, both stocks were higher, but today is just one day. Both oil giants are locked in multi-week losing streaks and both are down more than 8% to start 2020. Feeling the BernAs I noted earlier this week, Sen. Bernie Sanders' increasing momentum in the Democratic primary field is a problem for managed care providers, including Dow component UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). UNH was lower by about 1% today, extending its one-week slide to 7%, a decline materializing around news that Sanders is looking strong heading into the Iowa caucus next week.A recent note by UBS analyst Keith Parker, cited by Barron's, says that for every 10% Sanders and rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren gain in the polls, the S&P 500 could be subject to a 1% drop.Both contenders are supporters of Medicare For All, the issue that has frequently plagued UNH stock. However, Sanders has recently been the more vocal proponent of nationalized healthcare. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayI'm fond of the advice about not getting caught up in one-day moves, regardless of direction. That said, the major averages had every reason to close lower today and did just the opposite. Indeed, that's a positive sign.Conversely, there is some nourishment for the worriers among us. Strength in equities is largely being confined to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft and a few other mega-cap names that are taking on disproportionately large shares of the S&P 500.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-21	2020-01-21 20:43:41	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	30 Massive Dividend Increases From the Past Year	The S&P; 500's dividend stocks provided shareholders with an average payout boost of more than 8% in 2019. However, a number of outstanding companies announced far more substantial dividend increases - 20%, 30% or more. In a few cases, companies more than doubled their payouts overnight.Companies often authorize significant upgrades in their regular dividends to attract new investors or stand out from industry competitors. While one-time influxes of cash will often go toward buybacks or one-time special dividends, firms that believe they can maintain heightened levels of profitability will return some of that money through larger regular payouts.You'll notice that many of the past year's largest dividend increases came from the banking industry. That's in part because some large banks that were sitting on stockpiles of cash received permission from government regulators to distribute their excess capital to investors. Another major impetus for dividend growth was tax reform, which bumped up after-tax profits for many American companies, including banks.Here, we look at 30 companies that stood out over the past year because of their outsize dividend increases. Each dividend growth stock listed here improved its regular payout by at least 20% in 2019, though in numerous cases, the dividend improved by considerably more. Let's take a look.

2020-01-15	2020-01-15 21:18:32	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Trade Deal’s Done, Earnings Take Focus	After several years of what were often hostile or unproductive negotiations, the U.S. and China finally inked the first part of what the world's two largest economies are hoping will be a broader trade package. That and some earnings reports from marquee companies paved the way for modest upside for equities Wednesday.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 added 0.19%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.31%  * The Nasdaq Composite rose by 0.08%  * On the back of a strong earnings report, managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) led the Dow Jones today with a gain of 2.8%While some of the bloom of the trade deal rose wore off pretty quickly during the trading day, it cannot be argued that China is pledging to buy $200 billion worth of American goods to close the trade gap between the two countries and crack on technology intellectual property theft.  * 7 Socially Responsible ETFs to Buy in 2020 As a voracious consumer of commodities, China will purchase $52.4 billion worth of American energy products, including coal, natural gas and oil, over the next several years as part of the trade accord.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven with that news, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were not among the Dow winners today, but losses for the oil giants were minor.In late trading, about half of the Dow's 30 stocks were pointed higher. Onward And Upward For UnitedHealthAs noted above, UnitedHealth, the largest healthcare component in the Dow, was the index's leader today. UNH reported 2019 earnings of $15.11 per share, beating the recently upped guidance of $15 and easily topping its 2018 profit. UNH reiterated a 2020 forecast of between $16.25 and $16.55 per share.&quot;Return on equity of 25.7 percent in 2019 reflected the Company's strong overall operating performance and efficient capital structure. The debt to total capital ratio was 40.2 percent at December 31, 2019, full year dividend payments grew 18.4 percent year-over-year to $3.9 billion, and the Company repurchased 22.4 million shares for $5.5 billion in 2019,&quot; according to a statement issued by UNH.The company's Optum health services unit grew revenue by $11.7 billion or 11.5% year-over-year to $113.0 billion. Muted ReactionGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also stepped into the earnings confessional earlier today. Investors reaction to this report was much more subdued than what was seen yesterday with fellow Dow component JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).Goldman stock inched up on the day, but its fourth-quarter net income dropped to $1.72 billion, or $4.69 a share, from $2.32 billion, or $6.04 a share a year earlier. Revenue jumped 23% to $9.96 billion, indicating that the problem, by Goldman's own admission, was rising expenses, something the company said it's addressing. Everywhere You Want to BeVisa (NYSE:V) continued an impressive ascent that has seen the stock climb about 4% over the past week. Investors are rewarding the stock for the company's recent acquisition of fintech startup Plaid, a deal announced earlier this week.For conservative investors looking for fintech exposure, Visa and rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have shown themselves to be more than worthy options in a space where stock picking among smaller companies can be difficult for the uninitiated. After UnitedHealth, Visa was the Dow's second-best performer today.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10  Just Another Day For AppleAlbeit in modest fashion, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was again among the Dow winners on Wednesday after another analyst chimed with bullish commentary on the iPhone maker.

Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayWe're still in the early innings of earning season and have some more big financial services reports to work through before getting to technology, the S&P 500's largest sector weight, but there's an important earnings theme emerging in that group investors should take note of.&quot;At the sector level, the Information Technology sector has the highest number of companies issuing EPS guidance for the quarter at 39,&quot; according to FactSet research. &quot;This is not unusual, as the Information Technology typically has the highest number of companies issuing EPS guidance each quarter. Of these 39 companies, 19 have issued negative EPS guidance and 20 have issued positive EPS guidance.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-08	2020-01-08 21:17:06	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Trump’s Iran Comments and Jobs Data Spark Stocks	Equities rebounded Wednesday despite a batch of Iran-related headlines last night after President Trump sounded a clear, decisive tone on dealing with the republic and as private payroll data for December gave investors hope the economy will remain sturdy in 2020.Source: Charts Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 surged 0.49%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.56%  * The Nasdaq Composite tacked on 0.67%  * On a day when risk was on, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), often viewed as a defensive name, was the Dow's best-performing name with a gain of 2.09%.On Tuesday evening, Iran launched missile strikes against U.S. military installations in Iraq. Fortunately, no casualties have been reported and there is some speculation that Iran missed on purpose. Still, those attacks, futile as they may have been, earned a stinging rebuke from the White House with President Trump promising swift retaliation for any attacks that cost American lives and new economic sanctions against Iran. As for the Tuesday night attacks, it appears U.S. forces were more than ready.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Trump's Tax Cut Truly Rewarded &quot;Most of Iran's missiles are liquid-fueled, which take longer to get ready for launch and are easier to spot. The actual launch is detected by infrared satellites, which can see the plumes and predict the trajectory,&quot; reports CBS News.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn economic news, the ADP private payroll survey showed the addition of 202,000 private sector jobs last month, easily topping the forecast of 150,000 jobs. The Labor Department releases its December jobs report Friday before the open of U.S. markets with economists expecting the addition of 160,000 roles. Boeing AgainIn late trading, 23 of the 30 Dow stocks were higher, but Boeing (NYSE:BA) wasn't one of them. Earlier today, a Boeing 737 passenger operated by a Ukranian airline crashed, killing the 167 passengers and nine crew members aboard, soon after departing the Iranian capital of Tehran.There is some speculation that this crash was the result of an engine failure, but as the crash occurred in Iranian territory and authorities from that country are in possession of the plane's black boxes, the world may never know the true cause of this unfortunate accident.Compounding Boeing's Wednesday woes, Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr downgraded the stock to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy&quot; with a new price target of $371, down from $419. Walgreens WoesAs I noted yesterday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) was scheduled to report earnings this morning and the company did just that. However, investors may have wished the pharmacy operator kept quiet because the report resulted in a 5.84% decline for the stock, by far the worst performance in the Dow Jones today.Walgreens said it earned $1.37 per share on sales of $34.34 billion, but analyst were expecting earnings of $1.41 a share on revenue of $34.60 billion. Finally, Some Good NewsWe're just a few days into 2020 and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), one of the Dow's top 2019 performers, hasn't been mentioned here as of yet, but today is a good time to change that. The stock climbed nearly 1.6%, as Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated an &quot;outperform&quot; rating on the name with big price target boost to $189 from $157.&quot;Strong positioning for ramping public cloud adoption, large distribution channels and installed customer base, and improve margins support a path well beyond $1 trillion market cap for Microsoft,&quot; Weiss said in a note to clients. Charge It UpVisa (NYSE:V) was also among the top Dow stocks today as MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis reiterated &quot;buy&quot; ratings on that name and rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Her new price target on Visa is $230, implying significant upside to today's close of just over $192.  * 10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers Interestingly, Dow component American Express (NYSE:AXP) joined the credit card party, posting a Wednesday gain of almost 2%. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIt's not too late for fun and informative historical trends and anecdotes that could be relevant this year. The S&P 500 notched 150 up days last year, a rare occurrence to be sure. In five previous years of that happening, the benchmark U.S. equity gauge finished higher on an annual basis the following year four times, according to Schaeffer's Investment Research.Hopefully, that trend repeats in 2020.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-06	2020-01-06 21:23:19	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Another Risk-Off Kind of Day	The widely followed domestic equity benchmarks were able to cobble together modest gains Monday even though many market participants are taking a wait-and-see approach to what comes next amid heightening hostilities between the U.S. and Iran.Source: Provided by Finviz day   * The S&P 500 started the week higher by 0.35%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.24%  * The Nasdaq Composite added 0.56%  * After disappointing last Friday as oil prices rose on the back of the Iran headlines, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) was one of the leaders on the Dow Jones today, gaining 0.77%As was often the case in the latter stages of 2019 when trade dominated the headlines, whenever there were days lacking macroeconomic or stock-specific news, market participants were apt to turn their attention to geopolitical headlines.That was the case today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith the Iran situation being volatile at best, that's likely to be the issue du jour until traders have reasons to look elsewhere. Fortunately, there will be some near-term relief on that front as Federal Reserve members Richard Clarida, John Williams, James Bullard and Charles Evans deliver remarks on Thursday followed by the December employment on Friday.In late trading Monday, just 10 of the Dow's 30 members were in the green and Exxon Mobil was just one of two higher by at least 1%.  * 9 Boring Stocks to Buy You Should Never Let Go Of  Boeing BondsBoeing (NYSE:BA) was one of the Dow winners today, albeit in modest fashion after the company said it's mulling a corporate bond offering, prompting some market observers to opine that the capital-raising move is aimed at shoring up dividend sustainability.Boeing, which currently yields 2.47%, has boosted its payout every year since 2011. Yes, dividend investors can find longer dividend increase streaks among Dow members and across U.S. benchmarks, but that streak is now long enough that Boeing shouldn't want to jeopardize it. Due to its strong balance sheet, Boeing likely won't have to do much in terms of enticing bond buyers.&quot;Bond investors reflected the strength of the balance sheet in the yield demanded on Boeing bonds,&quot; according to Barron's. &quot;Debt issues by Boeing this past summer yielded about 2.6%, less than 1 percentage point above the 10 year U.S. treasury yield, in line with the safest corporate bonds.&quot; No More FunMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD) was one of the other Dow names hovering around a 1% gain to start the week. Underscoring just how important corporate culture and workplace environment have become, the catalyst for today's pop in McDonald's stock may have been word from new CEO Chris Kempczinski that major cultural changes are coming at the world's largest burger chain.Following the ouster of former CEO Steve Easterbook in November amid allegations that he carried on a consensual relationship with a female subordinate, McDonald's culture has come under scrutiny.&quot;We must now champion and apply them more evenly across the three-legged stool to be even stronger,&quot; said Kempczinski. Defensive WinnerWith investors matriculating to some defensive names today, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) got a lift, but there was more to the positive story. Morningstar was out with a bullish note on managed care providers today, one that indicates the odds of Medicare For All coming to life are long.&quot;In a Medicare for All scenario where U.S. insurers have no place in the U.S. insurance market, private insurers' operations could be in jeopardy,&quot; said the research firm. &quot;However, we believe this scenario represents a very low-probability risk (5% or less) within our 10-year forecast period, as it would require significant shifts in current federal government control, including a filibuster-proof Democratic majority position in the Senate and a new president from the left wing of the Democratic Party, as Republican voters remain significantly opposed to such a plan.&quot;  * 7 Investing Resolutions to Follow in 2020  Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodaySeveral times toward the end of 2019 I highlighted the need for investors to prepare a bit for the fourth-quarter earnings season, which will soon be upon us. The bad news is that the bottom-up S&P 500 earnings for Q4 has come down 4.7%.&quot;During the past five years (20 quarters), the average decline in the bottom-up EPS estimate during a quarter has been 3.3%,&quot; notes FactSet. &quot;During the past 10 years (40 quarters), the average decline in the bottom-up EPS estimate during a quarter has been 3.1%. During the past 15 years (60 quarters), the average decline in the bottom-up EPS estimate during a quarter has been 4.4%. Thus, the decline in the bottom-up EPS estimate recorded during the fourth quarter was larger than the five-year average, the 10-year average, and the 15-year average.&quot;This is probably priced into stocks right now, meaning there will be some burden on companies to reveal upbeat guidance for the current quarter and year when given the opportunity.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-31	2019-12-31 16:30:10	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	7 Excellent Value Stocks to Buy for 2020	After an exceptionally strong performance in the stock market in 2019, 2020 will have a higher than average chance of a correction. This argument can only hold true if either fundamentals worsen and volatility rises or if markets decide to lock in profits early. The S&P 500 rose by almost 30%, so even a slow 5%-10% pullback will still net a 20%-35% return in a one-year period.To stay investors but minimize the damage from the potential near-term downside, consider accumulating value stocks in 2020. Since it is impossible to time or predict any market correction, investors will need to have the discipline to shift from growth to value. Demand value and have a bias for stocks that pay a dividend. Phillip Braun, the Clinical Professor of Finance and Associate Chair of the Finance Department at Kellogg School of Management, said:Money will flow out of low volatility funds because of their declining performance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs market uncertainty continues to prevail, dividend funds will continue to be popular, momentum funds will see a net outflow and quality fund inflows will continue to rise.There will be a shift of money from growth funds into value funds as the performance of growth funds decline relative to value funds.  * 7 'A'-Rated Stocks to Buy Under $10 Besides adding to dividend fund holdings, what are seven value stocks that investors will want to buy in 2020? Value Stocks to Buy: BP (BP)Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com The energy sector vastly underperformed the markets in 2019 and is due for a strong rebound in 2020. Oil prices rose to around $60 a barrel recently despite Wall Street analysts predicting prices falling next year. But that logic does not make sense. If the OPEC exercises restraint in limiting supply, then oil stocks will perform well in the year ahead.In its third quarter, BP (NYSE:BP) reported a massive $2.6 billion asset write-down. The company uses underlying replacement cost profit to measure net income. In October, it reported that the metric fell 41% year-over-year to $2.3 billion.BP's lower interest realizations in the U.S., down around $6 quarter-over-quarter, is due mostly to the barrels coming from the Gulf of Mexico. But if energy prices improve in the year ahead, BP's profit margins will rise. Plus, the company completed maintenance costs and has no hurricane-related expenses in the next few quarters.The income investor will also have the confidence that BP will sustain its dividends through persistently strong future cash flows. On top of that, it will deploy its cash to buy back shares and lower its debt to continue de-levering its balance sheet. Asset disposals will also lift cash flows in the next year while BP's balance sheet improves.Investors should use the Dividend Discount Model: Stable Growth to estimate a fair value on BP stock. At a perpetuity growth rate of 3.5%, the stock is worth $41.60. Schlumberger (SLB)Source: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.com With a dividend that yields 5%, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), which rose 30% from its yearly lows, is a potentially rewarding value play in 2020. Investors have many reasons to hold this oil and gas equipment and services company despite its warnings on the drilling and fracking market. Schlumberger took a massive $12.7 billion write-down in the third quarter related to goodwill intangibles and fixed assets.On its conference call, the company said:Most of the goodwill and intangible comes from two major acquisitions. In 2010, we did the Smith acquisition, which was almost 100% paid by stock. We issued 138 million shares at that time, and then, Cameron in 2016, where we paid almost 78% in stock. The book value of those two acquisitions was booked for Smith at $56 per share, for Cameron at $72 per share.Schlumberger is forecasting a conservative year ahead despite the prospects of better energy prices. But since the company experienced modest product equipment sales in the last two or three years, 2020 budgets may be the same. So, Schlumberger is cautious for the upcoming year. A recession or any geopolitical or economic events will hurt its business. International growth will hold steady, helped by strong offshore activity in both shallow and deep-water environments.The company said that it is too early to forecast a rebound in the North American market. It will have a better idea on the second quarter's performance if it sees stronger activity starting in January. At that time, Schlumberger's customers will set their expectations for 2020. And when they do, it will be better positioned to set investor expectations, too.Similar to BP, Schlumberger has three asset divestitures underway. It closed the Sensia joint venture in October. Its divesting of assets from the Eurasian Drilling Company will come next.  CVS Health (CVS)Source: QualityHD / Shutterstock.com Moving on to the healthcare space, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is becoming a growth play after its Aetna acquisition. One year after acquiring Aetna, CVS said the combined company &quot;met or exceeded its first-year integration goals.&quot; With cost-cutting and operational integration largely completed, the $69 billion acquisition will start contributing to growth.CVS reported Q3 revenue growing 36.5%. It forecast 2019 revenue in the range between $11.8 billion and $11.95 billion. Adjusted operating income will come in as high as $15.4 billion. As CVS transforms its business into the country's leading consumer health company, its stock should continue its uptrend in 2020.On the back-end, CVS is using data and analytics to drive prescription volumes higher. On the retail front, consumers will bring more business as CVS offers local personalized care. For example, MinuteClinics and HealthHubs increase healthcare accessibility and affordability. This may result in the company raising its full-year 2020 revenue expectations.For 2020, CVS expects gross new business growing $1.1 billion. The net new business will add another $1 billion to results. And in 2021, CVS has its product line-up ready and an engaging sales staff who will serve its clients.  * 6 Transportation Stocks That Are Going Places Based on 13 analysts who cover CVS stock, the average price target is $85.31. UnitedHealth (UNH)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Though the stock traded close to its 52-week high recently, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 18 times. The company forecast 2019 revenue of around $242 billion. Earnings per share will be $14.15-$14.25. In 2020, revenue will expand to between $260 billion and $262 billion while EPS will increase to $15.45-$15.75.In 2020, the key drivers to UNH's 13%-16% growth rate exclude the positive impact of deploying strategic assets. It also excludes the use of additional strategic capital. So, if UNH introduces assets in the marketplace in 2020 to drive down costs for patients while improving quality, management may raise its guidance for the next year.UNH will continue to benefit from the performance of OptumCare. The strong momentum in the unit will sustain itself in 2020. OptumHealth is set to become the nation's value-based patient-centric medical system. So, as it manages costs on medicare and empowers OptumRx and OptumCare with digital solutions, profitability will grow.Investors should notice that OptumHealth margins fell 110 basis points from last year. This is due mostly to the DaVita Medical Group acquisition. As its integration of the unit progresses, expect the financial performance of the unit increasing.The average price target on CVS Health stock is $311.95. General Electric (GE)Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Though General Electric (NYSE:GE) is trading close to its 52-week high, the beaten-down conglomerate is a potential rebound play for value investors.Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 Max production halt is a negative headwind for GE's LEAP engines. But Boeing will eventually get the Federal Aviation Administration's certification for the plane. And when it does, GE will get back the $1.4 billion it lost from the grounding. Investors only need to wait patiently for that inevitability. Even if the delays persist longer than thought, GE will still have plenty of customers buying its engines.In 2020, GE will continue to improve its balance sheet by cutting its debt levels. GE Healthcare's PET Tracers enjoys a 4 million installed base. In fact, its backlog of $18 billion suggests steady cash flow growth in the future is sustainable. Last quarter, GE's industrial cash flow improved to a positive $650 million. It benefited from the continued stabilization from its Power unit. As cash flow growth continues, GE is in a good position to pay down its debt.GE ended the third quarter with net debt below $30 billion. So, it still has plenty of debt it must work down. Its Renewable Energy unit was one of GE's bright spots in the last quarter. Orders rose 30% to $5 billion, lifted by international orders rising 94% year-over-year. GE also said that favorable new order pricing helped increase the backlog to $27 billion, up 19% from last year.If GE sustains a perpetuity growth rate of just 2.5% in the next five years, then the stock is worth around $14. Comcast (CMCSA)Source: Todd A. Merport / Shutterstock.com Though shares of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) rose by around 30% in the year, the stock has a low P/E of 16.6. Investors may want to wait for a few positive catalysts ahead.After peaking in September at $47.27 and falling since then, Comcast already prices in the disappointing box office numbers. Its video streaming strategy, through the Peacock streaming service, is a potential growth story in 2020. Comcast will hold an Investor Day on Jan. 16. As it gives more details on what the product will actually be, investors will decide how the service fares compared to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Disney+.The upcoming streaming service will cost Comcast $2 billion in investments. Management expects costs peaking at 1% of Comcast's revenue, but that the service will achieve break-even by the fifth year.Comcast's Universal Parks and Resorts unit has a consistent track record for performing. And in 2020, Nintendo World will help boost performance. The company has two new parks under development, including one in Beijing, China. Although it opens in 2021, markets could start pricing in its upside in 2020.  * 7 Stocks to Buy to Get 2020 Started the Right Way Epic Universe is also under construction and will open in Orlando, Florida in 2023. Again, Comcast will book the investment costs in 2020 but markets will price in the success of these parks ahead of their openings. 3M (MMM)Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com 3M (NYSE:MMM) shares lost money for investors this year but in 2020, that might change for the better. On Dec. 12, the company announced it would sell all of its drug delivery business to Altaris Capital for $650 million. 3M's CEO said:This transaction will allow us to focus more resources on our core health care business as well as retain a share in the value of the drug delivery business as it grows over the coming years.3M needs to simplify its business and strengthen the performance of its core businesses. And although it had the opportunity to grow its profits through the drug delivery market, it now must find growth in other ways. That includes the global electronics market. So, if the factory automation markets rebound in China, 3M will benefit. Semiconductor manufacturers like Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) posted strong quarterly results. Both are positive on the outlook for 2020. If the consumer electronics market rebounds, 3M's product refresh in electronics will lead to the rebound in revenue.The automotive market is undergoing a major acceleration in innovation growth. As more materials and electronics are added to automobiles, demand for its goods used in this sector will grow.3M cited its $6.7 billion acquisition of Acelity as a positive catalyst to growth. With 3M's innovation model in mind, the combined company should report higher margins and return on invested capital. This may begin in 2020 but will certainly continue in the years ahead.As of this writing, Chris Lau owned shares of BP.

2019-12-30	2019-12-30 13:41:15	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Dow Jones Stocks Worth a Second Look	2019 has been a great year for stock market investors. The numbers tell the tale. The S&P 500 is up 29%, the Dow Jones average is up 22%, and the tech-heavy NASDAQ index has gained an impressive 35%. Stocks are on the rise, and it’s looking like the sky is the limit.There have been several factors behind the stock market’s sharp gains. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve began a modest run of rate-cut movements, pushing down bond yields. Also, while the US and Chinese governments have been at loggerheads over trade and tariffs, both countries have maintained contacts through the year and kept up negotiations for a trade settlement – which now appear to be bearing fruit. Also to the credit of the Trump Administration, low corporate taxes and a commitment to freer trade generally are positive for the markets.So, with markets up and stocks clearly the way to go for investors seeking returns, the question is, Which stocks will make the best investments? Luckily, TipRanks &#92;-- a company that tracks and measures the performance of analysts -- allows you to pinpoint the most promising investing opportunities. Here we ran a screen on all the stocks in the Dow Jones- and then sorted the results from the most to least bullish according to the Street.As you can see these 3 stocks all boast a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus based on ratings published by analysts over the last three months. Here’s why these are the three favorite Dow stocks of analysts right now:Chevron Corporation (CVX)Lower oil prices – an ongoing problem for the energy industry – have put pressure on Chevron, one of the world’s largest oil production companies. Even with lower prices, Chevron pulled in over $14 billion in net income last year, and is on track to exceed $10 billion this year.The decline in income is clear in the EPS, which for Q3 showed a 6% estimate miss, coming in at $1.36. Revenues also missed the forecast, by 4%, and came in at $36.12 billion. These numbers reflect the fact that crude oil and natural gas liquids sold for an average of $47 per barrel in the quarter, down from $62 in the year-ago quarter. Lower prices offset a 3% increase in production.Even with revenue and income down, however, CVX shares registered a 10% gain this year. The necessity of energy – and oil in particular – to today’s economy boosts the oil companies, ensuring steady income even against serious headwinds. And steady income allows the energy companies to sweeten their pot for investors with strong dividends. CVX pays out $4.76 per share annualized, giving a yield of 3.96% at current share prices. This yield is almost double the average among S&P listed companies.Well Fargo analyst Roger Read sees CVX as a Buy proposition, pointing out that further regulatory restrictions in California are not likely to hit the company very hard. Read notes that CVX derives only 5% of its current total production numbers from California. He believes the company will outperform the markets in the next twelve months, and sets a $142 price target. His target indicates potential for an 18% upside. (To see Read’s track record, click here)CVX’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 6 Buys and 2 Holds set in the past two months. The stock’s $138.88 average price target suggests an upside potential of 15% from the current $120 trading price. (See Chevron’s stock analysis at TipRanks)Visa, Inc. (V)At a market cap of over $420 billion, Visa is the second-largest credit card processor in the world. The company handles well over 100 billion transactions annually, totaling more than $7 trillion. Like several of its industry peers, Visa does not actually issue the cards with its logo; the company licenses the Visa name and processes the transactions run on those cards.Good economic times, and high consumer spending, have benefited Visa, and the company has shown strong growth. V shares are up 43% this year, outpacing the broader markets by a wide margin. The company’s fiscal Q4 report showed EPS above expectations and a 13% year-over-year revenue gain.Even better, for investors, Visa combines strong stock performance with a modest dividend. The yield, at just 0.63%, is nothing to write home about, but the annualized payment of $1.20 represents a steady extra income for shareholders, and Visa has been steadily raising that payment over the past several years.The analysts are impressed by V, and are clear in their comments on the stock. BMO Capital’s James Fotheringham writes, “[The] Q4 earnings beat and encouraging FY20 guidance driven by improved incentives, reduced operating costs, and lower assumed tax rate, [and] encouraging FY20 guidance [keep this stock our] top recommendation among U.S.financial technology, large-cap banks, specialty lenders, and asset manager companies.”Fotheringham backs his Buy on V with a $239 price target, suggesting a 26% upside. (To watch Fotheringham’s track record, click here)Visa’s Strong Buy rating comes from a unanimous analyst consensus. Eight analysts have given this stock the seal of approval in the past few months. Shares are expensive, at $189, but the reward is clear: the average price target of $211 gives the stock an 11.5% upside potential. (See Visa’s stock analysis at TipRanks)UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Like visa, UNH is a giant – in fact, it is the world’s largest health insurer. The company faces a potentially serious headwind in the emerging platform positions of the Democratic Presidential candidates, who are coalescing around an anti-private insurance position, but its dominance of the current market has allowed it to register an 18% gain this year. UNH’s strong market position is built on a customer base exceeding 115 million people, and revenues over $220 billion annually.UNH sees further growth ahead, despite the Dems’ political movement toward single payer. The company’s Q3 earnings report showed strong growth, with revenues up 7% year-over-year to $60.4 billion and EPS, at $3.88, up 13.8% from the year-ago quarter. Management was clearly pleased with the results, and raised full-year EPS guidance to the $14.90 to $15.00 range.UNH offers a dividend yield of 1.46%, and the high share price puts the quarterly payment at $1.08. This helps make up for the stock’s relatively low upside potential.5-star analyst David Toung, of Argus Research, is bullish on UNH and recently reiterated his Buy rating for the stock. He writes, “…the company's earnings growth in 2021 could reach 20% thanks to the expected permanent repeal of the Health Insurer Fee tax. With strong top-line growth coming from the company's UnitedHealthcare and Optum operating segments in Q3, [we] also remain positive on solid execution by UnitedHealth management driving its future growth.” Toung gives UNH a price target of $340, indicating confidence in a 15% upside. (To watch Toung’s track record, click here)Overall, UNH has 20 analyst reviews, including 17 Buys, supporting its Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are not for budget investors, as they are priced at $295. The average price target, $312, suggests an upside of just 5.4%, perhaps reflecting downward pressure from political worries. But as Toung’s comments show, there is reason to believe that the average upside is understated.

2019-12-19	2019-12-19 21:23:44	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: The Great Melt Up Continues	Following scant losses on Wednesday, stocks continued grinding higher Thursday with little in the way of major headlines. Impeachment continued to be in the focus while central banks in Japan and the U.K. did not alter monetary policy following recent meetings.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 gained 0.45%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.49%  * The Nasdaq Composite added 0.67%  * File this under we don't see this everyday, but Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) was the best-performing name in the Dow today and by a decent margin at that.There have been strong data points released over the course of this week and tomorrow brings a revision to the third-quarter GDP number. However, there was one somewhat concerning data point out today -- weekly jobless claims checked in at 234,000, ahead of the 225,000 claims economists expected.The less volatile four-week moving average moved up to 226,000 from 224,000. Equities probably aren't overreacting to these numbers because U.S. unemployment is running at 50-year lows and the employment picture can't get too much more full than it already is.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd Stocks won't be oblivious to weak employment data for long, but in late trading today, 23 of the 30 Dow names were in the green. Finally, A Lift For CiscoAs noted above, Cisco Systems was the Dow's best-performing name today, snapping out of multi-month funk that had it on pace to be one of the index's worst performers this year. Thank Barclays analyst Tim Long for the Cisco assist today as he upgraded the stock to &quot;outperform&quot; from &quot;equal weight&quot; while lifting his price target on the name to $53 from $47.&quot;Cisco has a diversified revenue stream, but a few key product areas should improve for Cisco and the industry over the next year,&quot; said Long in a note to clients.Importantly, the analyst also increased his earnings estimates on Cisco to $3.25 from $3.20 for fiscal 2020 and to $3.50 from $3.38 for fiscal 2021. Ebbing LitigationWhen it comes to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock in 2019, the primary issue has been the company's various legal wranglings, be they opioid or baby powder asbestos issues. These issues are well-documented and it appears Wall Street is looking forward with JNJ, not backward.Shares of JNJ jumped 1.24% today, good for one of the better showings in the Dow after Barclays analyst Kristen Stewart upgraded the pharmaceuticals name to &quot;outperform&quot; from &quot;equal weight&quot; while lifting her price target to $173.&quot;In our view, litigation concerns are more than priced in and the risk/reward is attractive,&quot; she said in a note to clients. &quot;We think JNJ checks a lot of boxes heading into 2020, leaving risk/reward skewed to the upside.&quot; Sort Of A SurpriseUnited Healthcare (NYSE:UNH) continued its recent bullishness though in modest fashion today. Perhaps the surprise wasn't that the stock rose, but that its gain was small given the news flow.The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to consider whether or not the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, should remain in place. The ruling essentially means there will be no big changes to the current system.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Lost 8%-Plus in the Past Month &quot;The worst possible outcome is off the table for a while, and companies can manage their businesses more effectively over the near term,&quot; said Jared Holz, a health-care strategist at Jefferies, said in an interview with CNBC. Nike ReminderQuick reminder that Nike (NYSE:NKE) is reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings today after the close. FactSet expects earnings per share to rise to 58 cents from 52 cents in the year earlier period while forecasting a sales increase to $10.09 billion, up from $9.37 billion last year. The stock inched higher today in advance of that report. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayI came across an interesting Dow-specific tidbit courtesy of Barron's today. As many of you know, the Dow is often derided compared to the S&P 500 because the former is price-weighted and holds just 30 stocks while the latter is cap-weighted and home to more than 500 names. Still, the Dow has been a winner over the past few years.&quot;The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 6 percentage points behind the S&P 500 index so far this year, but the often-maligned Dow is ahead during the past five years and lags only a little in the last 10,&quot; according to Barron's.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-18	2019-12-18 21:27:08	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Stocks Took a Pre-Holiday Breather	It was a slow day at the office today for equities Wednesday. In the absence of economic data, trade news, Federal Reserve musing and the other usual market catalysts, investors focused on impeachment headlines from Capitol Hill.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 inched lower by 0.04%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a gain of 0.01%  * The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.05%  * For the first time in quite a while, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was the best-performing name in the Dow.With impeachment taking center stage, at least for today, it can be argued that it's surprising that stocks didn't react poorly, subjecting investors to a volatile, down day. That obviously wasn't the case. Markets aren't 100% when it comes to their rate of prediction, but equities are generally seen as forward-looking, indicating that the takeaway here is that the impeachment gambit is likely to fail in the Senate.Investors seem to feel that way while signaling President Trump stands to be reelected next year. At least those are the sentiments of respondents in a recent RBC poll. A couple of caveats here. First, obviously, there's a long way to go between now and Election Day 2020 and plenty can happen over that time. Second, the RBC survey isn't a political poll in the traditional sense and there were just 119 participants.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPerhaps indicating why United Healthcare (NYSE:UNH) was the second-best performer in the Dow today behind Boeing, the aforementioned RBC poll shows diminishing odds for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) capturing her party's nomination. Warren has been a strong backer of Medicare For All, an issued that has weighed on UNH shares this year, but in fairness to her, she has recently backed off those statements.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow Up In late trading, just 13 of the 30 Dow stocks were higher. Merck The MagnificentAlright, so &quot;magnificent&quot; may be hyperbole to describe Merck's (NYSE:MRK) 0.66% gain today, but the stock was higher on news that broke Tuesday after the close regarding the company's bladder cancer treatment, Keytruda. The Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted 9-4 in favor of allowing that treatment.&quot;The ODAC discussions were based on the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA), currently under priority review at the FDA, seeking approval of Keytruda monotherapy for the treatment of patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-unresponsive, high-risk, NMIBC with carcinoma in-situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy (removal of bladder),&quot; according to a statement issued by Merck. Pre-Earnings RallyShares of Nike (NYSE:NKE) added 0.91% today in advance of its fiscal second-quarter earnings report due out tomorrow. Nike is up more than 7% this month and Needham reiterated a &quot;buy&quot; rating on the stock yesterday while lifting its price target on the name to $105 from $98.With major global sporting events such as the Summer Olympics and the UEFA European Championship, the back of half of 2020 could be big for Nike sales and its equity performance.&quot;Tariffs will be most impactful to fiscal Q2, we expect this headwind to gross margin eases in the second half, and expect earnings acceleration in each quarter through fiscal year 2020,&quot; said Stifel analyst Jim Duffy in a note to clients. Another Boeing UpdateAs noted yesterday, Boeing is halting production of the 737 MAX jet, crimping suppliers and potentially denting the broader economy in the process. This issue is far from being cleared up, making the rebound in the stock today all the more curious.Perhaps the rebound in Boeing stock today is attributable to news that the company's Starliner capsule will be atop United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket slated to launch into space on Friday morning.Reportedly, this is significant because it opens the door for Boeing to send astronauts to space again from U.S. launch sites. Goldman Going for the GoldGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has been making some appearances here over the past few days and it's worth highlighting again today although the shares closed modestly lower.Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo, one of the banking industry's most noted analysts, is saying that when Goldman holds its investor day next month, the company will target a return on equity (ROE) of 13%, above the two-decade average of 12.3%.  * 7 Impressive Stocks to Buy Over $250 Mayo boosted his price target on Goldman to $280 from $240 and noted that based on book value, the shares are inexpensive relative to other banking names. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayWith a New Year and new decade almost here, investors may want to consider the possibility that sectors that thrived in the current decade might not thrive in the 2020s. Therefore, considering some defensive ideas for the New Year might be advisable.&quot;After such a great run, today's risks seem more heavily skewed to the downside,&quot; said State Street in a recent note. &quot;We would caution investors who may be attempting to squeeze out those last few points of return or incremental yield. It may not be worth the risk.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-18	2019-12-18 18:16:51	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Teladoc Stock Is Poised for More Explosive Growth Ahead	Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) continued rewarding investors with the stock uptrend in the last quarter. And for good reason, too. The company posted strong third-quarter top-line results and raised its guidance. Markets view the multinational telemedicine and virtual healthcare supplier as both part healthcare and part technology. By utilizing artificial intelligence and analytics and licensing its platform services, this scalable company touched all-time highs recently. The stock may forge new highs if it raises its guidance yet again.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com In the third quarter, Teladoc reported revenue of $138 million, up 24% from last year. Revenue growth was lifted by global subscription access fees of $119.1 million. This accounted for 86% of its total revenue. It lost 28 cents a share, which is not a concern because the company is building its sales levels and taking market share first. The company forecast Q4 revenue in the range between $149 million and $153 million.For full-year 2019, revenue will be $546 million to $550 million. This is up from its previous guidance of $538 million to $545 million. Teladoc expects total visits topping up to 4.1 million.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVisits rose 45% from last year to 928,000. And utilization rates came in just under 8%, up 17 basis points year-over-year. Strong TailwindsTeladoc benefited from the greatest population expansion in the company's history. When over 17 million people gained access to Teladoc, it lifted total visits and revenue. More importantly, TDOC stock rose because investors expect the company to further entrench its distribution channels. Management added UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) to its platform. That netted 15 million commercial members and gives UNH a fully integrated virtual care offering to its customers.  * 5 Large-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy Teladoc proved it can deliver on a product rollout without any project delays. Its initial launch went through without any issues. The teams at Teladoc and UNH proved they can collaborate successfully. This may lead to more collaborative projects for Teladoc in the future, further expanding its population expansion.In the last quarter, the company saw request for proposal volumes jump 25% year-over-year. This implies product orders will continue increasing as client interest strengthens. Bookings rose around 30% and along with deal sizes increasing, Teladoc is on a positive trajectory. Global GrowthTeladoc launched in the United Kingdom and introduced the market to its first virtual mental health service. It counted on American International Group (NYSE:AIG) for the launch. In Canada, Great-West Life added the Mental Health Navigator service. In the U.S., companies like UPS (NYSE:UPS) and Nationwide Insurance chose Teladoc to give over 100,000 employees access to medical experts. So, the Teladoc medical expert service, which is a virtual center of excellence, should improve health support for those who need it.2020 will benefit from accelerating revenue growth, as management forecasts long-term annual revenue growth between 20% and 30%. And thanks to the customer base getting bigger annually and clients coming from a variety of global locations, TDOC stock deserves richer premiums. Price Target And My TakeawayNine of the 14 analysts who cover Teladoc stock rank it as a &quot;buy.&quot; Their average price target is $85.07. Conversely, the cautious investor may forecast a downside scenario in which revenue growth stalls. Assume that the perpetuity growth rate is 4% and revenue growth falls to 30% annually. In this case, TDOC stock is worth $70.For now, Teladoc investors need not expect growth slowing. The company is gaining momentum and winning bigger contract deals. This will support its historical sales growth rates, sending the stock higher.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But broader indexes rallied on follow through on last week's trade news.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 jumped 0.71%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.36%  * The Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.91%  * On the back of some positive analyst chatter, United Healthcare (NYSE:UNH) paced the Dow Jones today with a gain of 2.27%Technology and healthcare, the two largest sector weights in the S&P 500, were the leaders today, helping the benchmark U.S. equity gauge gains for the seventh time in the past nine days.

Key Elements Affecting the Dow TodayUpside for UnitedHealthUnitedHealth is a name that has been mentioned plenty of times in this space over the course of 2019. For much of this year, the news hasn't been good, but in recent months, the managed care provider has really perked up and more analysts growing bullish on the name heading into 2020.Fanning the flames of UnitedHealth's rally today, Goldman Sachs added the stock to its conviction buy list, noting that although 2020 is a presidential election year, healthcare sector valuations are compelling and Medicare For All Risk is declining.Goldman has a &quot;buy&quot; rating on UnitedHealth with a $330 price target, implying upside of nearly 13% from where the stock was trading late Monday.Sticking With HealthcareStaying in the healthcare sector for a moment, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) was the second-best performer in the Dow today behind only UnitedHealth. The blue-chip pharmaceuticals name rallied 2% after the company announced an almost 6% hike to its quarterly dividend, taking the pay to 38 cents a share from 36 cents.Saying Oui to DisneyShares of Disney (NYSE:DIS) advanced again today, cementing the stock's status as one of the Dow's best in 2019. Streaming news was again at play as the shares jumped on news Disney will bring its Disney+ streaming service to France in March. Another catalyst is imminent as the next &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie debuts later this week.Earnings PrepAs I noted last week, there's one Dow earnings report to watch for this week and it comes courtesy of Nike (NYSE:NKE). The company reports on Thursday, Dec. 19. In advance of that report, there was some bullish options activity in the stock today.&quot;At last check, already over 37,000 calls have changed hands, four times the expected intraday amount and double the average daily volume,&quot; according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. &quot;Most of this action is occurring at the December 102 call, where new positions are being opened, and looks tied to stock. There are also new positions being opened at the weekly 12/27 99-strike call.&quot;An Upgrade for GoldmanAs noted above with UnitedHealth, stocks often move on upgrades from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), but shares of the investment bank were on the move today after Citigroup upgraded the stock to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;neutral&quot; while boosting its price target on the name to $255 from $220.Separately, Goldman said it will curb lending to coal companies and oil drillers operating in the Arctic, becoming the latest big-name company to prioritize climate change.Familiar OffenderJust a few Dow stocks were in the red today, but Boeing (NYSE:BA) was by far the worst offender, shedding 4.1%. There were reports out earlier today that the company is considering production cuts or an outright suspension of the troubled 737 MAX passenger jet.  * 7 of the Worst Retail Stocks That Refuse to Die Boeing is lower by almost 6% this month and with any more headline risk, the stock could give up its 2019 gains (just under 6%) before the end of the year. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayBank of America's widely followed survey of global fund managers is due out tomorrow and some are forecasting bullish musings in there. As it is, the bank is forecasting a &quot;melt up&quot; for stocks in the first quarter of 2020.Although central banks may not be able to affect equity markets in 2020 on par with 2019, there are still plenty of endorsements for riskier assets, such as cyclical equities, heading into the new year.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Mizuho Securities analyst Ann Hynes said that optimism follows a PoliticoPro report that a year-end health deal is likely to include the elimination of three major taxes under the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare), including the HIF. The elimination of the HIF was set to bring in $15.5 billion of taxes in 2020, Hynes said. Shares of Humana Inc. , which Hynes said would be the biggest beneficiary of the HIF elimination, surged 4.3% toward a record high. Among some of the other bigger beneficiaries, shares of Cigna Corp.  rallied 3.5% and Anthem Inc.  hiked up 3.3%. Meanwhile, the SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF  climbed 1.3% with 53 of 61 equity components gaining ground, and the Dow rose 176 points.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/2e5bbede-cc9c-3cd1-8494-b4b98f7d8430/unitedhealth%2C-humana-stocks.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-10	2019-12-10 16:47:57	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	The 13 Best Health-Care Stocks to Buy for 2020	One of the most attractive reasons to invest in health-care stocks continues to be the world's aging population.The United Nations says people age 65 and older are the fastest-growing age group worldwide. It estimates that by 2050, one out of every six people will be 65 or older, accounting for 16% of the planet's total population, up from 9% in 2011. That figure is even larger in Europe and North America, where the U.N. predicts the number will be closer to 25%. The demand for health-care products and services should only increase as a result.Yes, health-care stocks will be coming off a weak 2019. Through mid-November, the S&P; 500 was sitting on nearly 25% gains, while the sector had improved by roughly half that. They'll also have to contend with uncertainty regarding the future of health care as the 2020 presidential election approaches. But don't sleep on the space in the year ahead.For one, health-care stocks tend to outperform during periods of economic weakness. For instance, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) delivered a 39.6% total loss (share price plus dividends) during the 2007-09 bear market - more than 15 percentage points better than the S&P; 500&#92;. Thus, headlines warning of an economic slowdown or even a recession in 2020 actually bode well for the sector.Also, health care has traded at a price-to-earnings ratio more expensive than the overall market more often than not over the past 20 years. However, according to the Charles Schwab Center for Research, the sector's P/E currently is cheaper than the S&P; 500, providing a better buying opportunity.Here, then, are the 13 best health-care stocks to buy for 2020, including a couple of funds for investors who want to diversify.

2019-12-06	2019-12-06 21:21:50	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Jobs Jubilee Sends Stocks Soaring	The November jobs report delivered today before the opening bell brought some holiday cheer and that was enough to send stocks soaring to close the week as the major equity benchmarks closed higher for a third consecutive day.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 surged 0.91%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.22%  * The Nasdaq Composite soared 1%  * For the second time this week, industrial 3M (NYSE:MMM) was the Dow's daily leader, advancing 4.32% on news of an asset saleThe Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 266,000 new jobs last month, while the October number was revised higher to 156,000. Economists were expecting the addition of 180,000 jobs in November.Alright, so let's assume there are naysayers out there and there probably are. They'll say, and they're not wrong, that November report was aided by 41,000 General Motors (NYSE:GM) employees heading back to work, seasonal hiring for the holiday shopping season and census hiring. All true, but even combined, those factors likely didn't account for 266,000 jobs in a single month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Hot Stocks for 2020's Big Trends Moreover, the unemployment rate dipped to a 50-year low of 3.9% while wages rose 3.1%. Some investors may be apt to look for the political implications of these numbers and there are undoubtedly some, but these numbers also reveal that near-term downside for stocks may be limited and that's obviously good news.In late trading, 27 of the Dow's 30 components were in the green and of the three losers, downside was limited. UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) was the Dow's worst performer today, but its Friday loss was modest and that stock has been on a tear of late. 3M RenaissanceIndustrial conglomerate 3M is one of the Dow's worst-performing names this year and it will take a miracle, Christmas or otherwise, for the shares to finish the year flat. A 13.70% year-to-date loss is difficult to overcome with not many trading days left in the year.However, 3M did give investors reasons to cheer today as it paced the Dow on rumors that the company is mulling a sale of its drug delivery systems unit, which could command $1 billion. That's not jaw-dropping news for a $95 billion company, so the stock's move today was likely more attributable to the jobs report and news that China is planning to waive some tariffs on U.S. commodities imports.That's relevant to 3M because the stock is trade sensitive and with China showing a gesture of good faith, President Trump may decide to back off of tariffs slated to go into effect on Dec. 15. Consumer CheerThe aforementioned jobs report wasn't the only cheery piece of economic data out today. The University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index for December jumped to 99.2 from from 96.8 last month. An interesting element of that report is that respondents were divided along partisan lines with Republicans feeling good while sentiment among Democrats declined.Politics aside, the Dow's three consumer discretionary names -- Home Depot (NYSE:HD), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) -- all closed higher. Underscoring the strength in that trio, McDonald's was the worst performer today, adding about half a percent.Keeping with theme of consumer strength, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the largest domestic retailer, meaning it's highly levered to the jobs and consumer sentiment data points, added 0.94%. Disney DividendWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) announced a modest dividend increase, saying its payout for fiscal 2019 will be $1.76 a share, up from $1.72 in fiscal 2018. That works out to 88 cents per share on a semi-annual basis.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice &quot;This has been a monumental year for The Walt Disney Company, marked by the launch of our new streaming service Disney+ and the completion of our acquisition of 21st Century Fox,&quot; said Disney CEO Bob Iger in a statement. &quot;We are pleased to deliver another substantial dividend to shareholders as we continue to invest in the company's future.&quot; Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayFor those addicted to Federal Reserve rate cuts, today's data points weren't good news, but that's good news for the rest of the market. Sure, November's pace of job creation will be difficult to maintain, but even it remains simply &quot;strong,&quot; the Fed won't be compelled to trim rates again anytime soon.&quot;We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market and stable inflation,&quot; said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in Congressional testimony last month. &quot;There is nothing in the November jobs report would seem to undermine that view.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-05	2019-12-05 21:29:26	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Trade Influenced Stocks More Than Impeachment News	Stocks moved modestly on a day in which Democratic leadership in the House confirmed articles of impeachment will be filed against President Trump, indicating the trade relationship with China is a bigger priority for markets than party politics.  * The S&P 500 rose 0.15%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.10% today  * The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.05%  * Supported by positive analyst chatter, Nike (NYSE:NKE) was the Dow leader today, jumping 2.21%.Talk that President Trump could back off tariffs on Chinese imports set to go into effect on Dec. 15 along with reports that officials from both sides remain engaged in talks lifted stocks today.&quot;Chinese officials are in 'close contact' with their American counterparts on negotiations, said Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng,&quot; reports Bloomberg.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStill, not all of the China-related headlines out Thursday were perfect. For example, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier today he supports China being removed from a World Bank program designed to help smaller, less affluent nations refinance debt.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Dominated Thanksgiving Shopping &quot;Mnuchin added that the selection of former Treasury Undersecretary David Malpass as the World Bank's president earlier this year gives him confidence the institution will revise its practices to make its lending more equitable.&quot; according to CNBC.Those comments may have capped stocks' gains today as just 14 of the Dow's 30 members were higher in late trading. Nike Runs Higher On Goldman UpgradeAs noted above, Nike was the best-performing name in the Dow today and an upgrade from Goldman Sachs explains why the stock surged. Nike entered Thursday with a year-to-date gain of 26%, putting it ahead of the S&P 500 and well ahead of the Dow. Goldman Sachs analyst Alexandra Walvis believes the good times can continue next year.She upgraded Nike to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;neutral&quot; while adding the stock to Goldman's prestigious conviction buy list.&quot;Evidence of building pricing power, signs of operating leverage, accelerating shift to differentiated retail, sharply scaling app ecosystem, and a constructive global athletic growth backdrop,&quot; said Walvis in a note to clients.The analyst has a $112 price target on Nike, implying upside of about 20%. Happy Holidays With AppleApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is classified as a technology stock, but it's very much levered to strength in the consumer sector, making it a credible play on the holiday shopping theme. Wall Streets seems to agree with that sentiment.Today, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva reiterated a &quot;buy&quot; rating on Apple, noting that the holiday season offers plenty of catalysts for the stock.&quot;This Christmas is different for Apple,&quot; said the Citigroup analyst. &quot;Apple's product offerings as well as pricing strategies and recent demand trends augur for a better Christmas quarter compared with last [fiscal] year when Apple negatively preannounced.&quot; Good News For This SectorThe healthcare sector, the second-largest group in the S&P 500 behind technology and an important part of the Dow as well, has been getting plenty of attention thanks to a recent resurgence. Dow component UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) has been leading that climb and that stock, along with fellow Dow member Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) traded higher today.In other words, it was a mixed bag for Dow healthcare stocks on Thursday with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) trading lower. But don't fret. Healthcare is looking healthy and could be a rewarding defensive play in 2020.  * 10 Hot Pot Stocks to Buy &quot;I believe that it's broken out so strongly that even after … it works off that overbought condition, it's going to rally higher … if we do have a big scare on the tariff side. But it also should rally even if the whole market moves up. So it's kind of a win-win situation, again, after a little bit of a breather on the near term,&quot; said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, of the healthcare sector in a CNBC interview. Bottom LineTwo days in a row of good/no bad news on the trade front is encouraging, but near-term bullishness will be tested tomorrow when the Labor Department delivers the November jobs report before the bell. The ADP private payroll survey out earlier this week was weaker-than-expected, indicating the same could be true of the more Labor Department number.Economists are expecting the addition of 185,000 new jobs last month. If the number comes in well below that level and the October and September numbers are revised lower, Friday could be a rough day for riskier assets.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-03	2019-12-03 21:31:08	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: A Terrible Tuesday	Although December is usually a good month for stocks, that historical precedent wasn't followed yesterday. And defiance of that trend got much, much worse today as all three major equity benchmarks were slammed on the renewal of trade tensions between the U.S. and China.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 slid 0.66%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1.01%  * The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 0.55%  * In late trading, trade-sensitive names Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Dow (NYSE:DOW) were fighting for the dubious distinction of worst-performing Dow stock today as both were flirting with losses of more than 2.5%Riskier assets were roiled today as President Trump dialed back expectations that Phase I of a trade deal with China will soon be signed, prompting speculation that tariffs scheduled to go into effect on Chinese imports on Dec. 15 will proceed.&quot;I like the idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal. But they want to make a deal now and we'll see whether not the deal is going to be right,&quot; said the president earlier today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChina wasn't the only major economy drawing Trump's ire today. The president is threatening $2.4 billion worth of trade levies on French imports, something the Eurozone's second-largest economy is already promising retaliatory action on.All that just a day after the White House pledged to implement tariffs on Argentine and Brazilian steel imports to protect domestic producers.  * 7 Exciting Biotech Stocks to Buy Now All that got the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a situation where in late trading today, Merck (NYSE: MRK) was the only member of the index in the green and only modestly so. Exxon Excellence … Sort OfPredictably, oil equities were weak today on the back of the aforementioned trade jitters and Dow component Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) was not immune from that scenario. However, on a day when good news was hard to come by, there was actually some of that for Exxon.Bank of America Merrill Lynch named Exxon as its top big oil pick for 2020, noting the largest U.S. oil company offers significant upside potential.&quot;BAML said the stock was its top U.S. oil major pick for 2020 and that counter cyclical investments and asset sales should vanquish market skepticism over whether it can outperform its peers,&quot; reports Barron's.The bank has a $100 price target on Exxon, which traded around $68 today. Affirming GuidanceUnderscoring the rough sledding for stocks today, shares of UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) lost more than 1%. As was the case with Exxon, there was some decent news flow out for UNH today even though the stock lost ground.The company said it expects net earnings per share for 2019 to hover around $15. The managed care provider previously forecast earnings of $14.90 to $15 per share.UNH, which hosted its investor day today, forecast earnings of $16.25 and $16.55 per share in 2020. Bad Action On Good NewsAdding to the theme of stocks slumping today even with some positive headlines, there's Nike (NYSE:NKE), one of the Dow's more trade-sensitive names. The athletic apparel giant was sporting a loss of more than 1% in late trading.Morgan Stanley's Kimberly Greenberger revealed a new price target of $118 on Nike today, implying upside of more than 25% from the stock's Tuesday close.&quot;We continue to believe NKE is in the early innings of transition from a traditional wholesale business to a digitally-driven, direct-to-consumer brand,&quot; said the analyst in a note to clients. Dow DownerAs noted earlier, chemicals maker Dow was one of the worst-performing names in the blue-chip index today due to its trade sensitivity. That's bad news because the stock declined yesterday as well after Morgan Stanley downgraded it to &quot;equal weight&quot; from &quot;outperform.&quot; If Dow falls another 3%, it'll violate its 50-day moving average, potentially accelerating declines from there.  * 10 of the Best Stocks to Buy Right Now From the JUST 100 List  Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayHindsight is 20/20, but a day like today was probably brewing for some time given the inability of the U.S. and China to come to trade terms. Sure, there are plenty of musings about Phase I of a trade deal, but the longer it took to put that plan into action, the greater the risk that President Trump would lose patience. That's where we arrived at today.Over the near-term, the White House can help stocks get back on track by delaying the tariffs set to go into effect on Dec. 15. However, there are no guarantees that will happen.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-25	2019-11-25 21:22:55	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Trade Optimism, Merger Activity Send Stocks Soaring	Optimism on the trade front and the renewal of the &quot;Merger Monday&quot; theme sent stocks rallying to record highs on Monday. But no members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average were involved in the leap today.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 soared 0.75%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.68%  * The Nasdaq Composite added 1.32%  * UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) paced the Dow with a gain of 2%, extending recent gains that have helped the stock rank as one of the best large-cap healthcare names in recent weeksOn the mergers and acquisitions front, as has been widely speculated, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) announced a $26 billion offer for rival TDAmeritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD). In another widely forecast deal, French luxury goods maker LVMH is buying Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) for more than $16 billion. Of course, the Tiffany name and prestigious blue boxes will be retained.  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy for 2020 In a sign that trade negotiations may have some credible momentum, China is promising to implement harsher penalties on violators of intellectual property rights, long a sticking point for the Trump Administration.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile some data points suggest Beijing hasn't yet upped purchases of American farm goods as promised (soybean exports to China declined last month), markets are more concerned with the intellectual property issue because that has been a drag on a slew of big-name U.S. tech companies over the course of the trade war.On another trade-related note, CNBC star Jim Cramer said today that the mainstream media's treatment of Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Trump, making the former out to be the good guy and the latter a &quot;mad man,&quot; has been unfair.Opinions aside, it appears that Phase I of a trade deal is close to happening, but investors shouldn't bank on Phase II being realized anytime soon. UnitedHealth Stock Is on FireAs noted last week, some momentum has been percolating in Dow Jones healthcare names, including managed care provider UnitedHealth.The managed care provider extended its recent bullishness today on relatively light news. The company said it's opening 14 UnitedHealthcare Medicare services centers in Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) stores in five metropolitan areas across the country.&quot;The UnitedHealthcare Medicare services centers will begin to open in January 2020 at Walgreens stores in the Las Vegas, Phoenix, Cleveland, Denver and Memphis markets,&quot; according to the companies.The more plausible explanation for UNH's Monday rally is probably recent data indicating hedge funds were eager buyers of the stock when it was slumping earlier this year. Disney DeliversAlthough it was in modest fashion today, Disney (NYSE:DIS) just keeps on delivering for investors and no, I'm not talking about streaming today. Streaming is a nice a compliment to Disney's core businesses, which include making movies.Frozen 2 got off to a solid start over the weekend, hauling in $127 million in box office receipts.&quot;The film's box office sales fell in line with analysts' expectations of $100 million to $140 million, and it's estimated sales will remain strong throughout the Thanksgiving weekend,&quot; according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. Intel InterestOn a day when positive trade news took center stage, it wasn't surprising to see all of the Dow's technology constituents finish in the green. Semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the leader of that pack, gaining 2%. Chip stocks, including Intel, have long been sensitive to the trade intellectual property issue with China so progress on that front is a boon for Intel shareholders.However, some chip industry observers believe growth in share prices is being supported by buybacks, not robust demand.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Are Bargains Right Now &quot;Keep in mind that most of the double-digit sales growth expected next year will be regaining lost ground to get back to 2017 levels -- before the U.S. trade conflict with China,&quot; reports MarketWatch. &quot;Meanwhile, because of flat earnings, the stocks are much more expensive than they were in December.&quot; Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayAssuming the aforementioned trade chatter is legitimate and Phase I is signed before the end of the year, that would remove a significant volatility overhang investors have had to contend with this year. Then again, if you're investing for the long-term, it's best not to get caught up in daily market gyrations.Don't just take my word for it.&quot;Taking all of this into account, I would argue that short-term volatility is unsettling but is not the biggest risk to long-term investors,&quot; said BlackRock in a recent note. &quot;Fleeting price changes should be of little concern to someone investing for a retirement that is five, 10, 15 or more years away. They may even represent opportunity, as company fundamentals are the predominant driver of long-term investment returns.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The concern prompted some upside in defensive sectors, sending the S&P 500 up and down throughout the day.Source: FinViz   * The S&P 500 rose just 0.05%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.11%  * The Nasdaq Composite tacked on 0.11%  * UnitedHealth was among the best-performing companies in the Dow Jones today, climbing 1.3%As has been the case for much of the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, mixed messages from media outlets made life difficult on traders today.  * 7 Strong Retail Stocks to Buy for the 2019 Holiday Season &quot;Word that White House would extend a license to allow U.S. companies to do business with Chinese telecom firm Huawei competed with reports that said Beijing was skeptical about reaching a overarching deal anytime soon,&quot; according to Bloomberg.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOther reports went so far as to say that the mood in Beijing regarding a trade deal is &quot;pessimistic.&quot; Whether that's accurate remains to be seen, but with few earnings reports of any magnitude left, trade will likely dominate the market's behavior over the next several weeks. Darling DisneyIt's starting to feel like Disney (NYSE:DIS) is making all the right moves and a year-to-date gain of about 32% confirms as much. Up 2% today, Disney stock was again the Dow's best-performing name to start the week.The Disney + streaming service is justifiably commanding plenty of headlines. But Disney is still a powerhouse at the box office. And this was confirmed by the newly released Ford v Ferrari. That movie, starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, did about $52 million in revenue over the weekend.What's important about that isn't just the revenue tally, but that it was the first real hit delivered by 20th Century Fox since Disney acquired that studio. UnitedHealth Is Getting HealthyAs noted above, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) was the second-best performer in the Dow today behind Disney as the managed care provider jumped 1.3%. Diminishing political risk from Medicare For All appears to be reason behind Monday's rally by UnitedHealth and shares of rival managed care providers.&quot;Shares of major health-insurance firms were rising Monday morning as political developments over the weekend seemed to lessen the chances of Medicare for All being implemented in the near term,&quot; reports Barron's.I've been beating the drum on Medicare For Risk throughout this year because my pick in InvestorPlace's Best ETFs of 2019 contest was the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (NYSEARCA:IHF), in which UnitedHealth is the largest holding.Thanks in large part to UnitedHealth shares being up 10.56% over the past month, IHF is now higher by a respectable 15.53% year-to-date. Marvelous MicrosoftMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) notched a modest gain today, putting it toward the bottom among the Dow Jones winners. But the technology giant is still on a roll. Much of the bullishness in Microsoft's stock this year is based on its Azure cloud business. This part of MSFT is shaping up to be a significant long-term catalyst for Microsoft investors.&quot;In a research note Monday, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Brad Reback notes that Azure is already at a $17 billion annualized revenue run rate--but that businesses that are potential customers are still in the early stages of shifting computing to the could, with less than 10% penetration so far,&quot; according to Barron's.Reback forecasts Azure becoming a $90 billion business for Microsoft by fiscal year 2030, up from $12.5 billion in fiscal 2019.  * 10 Best High-Growth Stocks to Buy for Young Investors  Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayGeopolitical risk, including the U.S.-China spat, has been ongoing for much of this year. That creates a level of uncertainty markets usually don't like. However, some market observers believe that tide could turn for the better in 2020 because next year is a presidential election year.&quot;Geopolitical risk has been a wildcard for markets this year,&quot; said BlackRock in a recent note. &quot;In fact, it is geopolitics that have been an important headwind to an otherwise constructive environment for financial assets: Accommodative monetary policy is in play across multiple geographies, and many of the high-frequency economic indicators we track are pointing to a pick-up in growth. As China and the U.S. could be nearing a two-stage trade deal ahead of the 2020 U.S. electoral process, we see potential for the geopolitical headwind to shift to a tailwind.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-15	2019-11-15 22:36:49	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Warren Maps 3-Year Timeline Toward Medicare for All; Stocks Rise	(Bloomberg) -- Elizabeth Warren said Friday her Medicare-for-All plan would be implemented over three years, a major concession to the difficulty of fundamentally changing the way Americans get health care. Managed-care and hospital stocks moved higher on the news.A Medium post Warren published Friday mapped out a strategy to enact a mandatory government-run health care system that she estimates would cost $20.5 trillion but others have tagged at more than $30 trillion.Warren said she would inch up to Medicare-for-all, starting with a plan to cover children and poor families. That would happen through a legislative maneuver in her first 100 days in the White House, while not actually eliminating private insurance plans until her third year in office.Health-care companies, which worried about extinction, rallied Friday, leading the S&P 500 Health Index to an all-time high. Among them, some of the nation’s largest insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc., Humana Inc., Anthem Inc. and Centene Corp. have climbed more than 5% in Friday’s trading.The advance in health care is a turnaround from the first nine months of the year, when the industry trailed most of its market peers over drug-pricing regulations and Medicare for All proposals.Even if Warren wins the White House and Democrats win control of both the House and Senate, Warren’s timeline is still optimistic, given how Congress operates.She said she would ask Congress to use a quirk in the budget process to allow a simple majority vote -- bypassing the 60-vote Senate threshold -- and “fast-track” a Medicare for All option that would immediately cover children under the age of 18 and families making less than $51,000 a year, and provide an option for expanded Medicare for people over 50.In the first three years, anyone else could buy into Medicare for All at a “modest” cost, Warren said, before it eventually became free.By her third year in office, Warren said, “the American people will have experienced the full benefits of a true Medicare for All option, and they can see for themselves how that experience stacks up against high-priced care that requires them to fight tooth-and-nail against their insurance company.”She added, “I won’t hand Mitch McConnell a veto over my health care agenda,” referring to the current Senate majority leader.After repeated questioning about how she would finance a government-run Medicare for All system that eliminates private insurance, Warren on Nov. 1 rolled out a $20.5 trillion proposal funded by taxing the rich and large corporations.Her gradual implementation “will give people time to adjust, people in the industry will have time to look for other jobs, pension plans will have time to start changing their portfolio and it will give the government time to gear up the bureaucracy,” said Gerald Friedman, professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who consulted on Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign on Medicare for All, the basis of Warren’s plan.The new proposal sets Warren apart from Sanders, who has said he wouldn’t compromise with incremental health-care changes.But Friedman cautioned that a long transition period could leave the private health insurance industry in shambles.“If you know that in three years your company is going to be wiped out, then it could create perverse incentives, staff start exiting and companies may become dysfunctional before the government program is set up,” Friedman said.Warren’s new proposal at least at first ends up looking much like that of her moderate rivals, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg: Expanded government-run insurance without mandating it for everyone.Spokesmen for Biden and Buttigieg quickly weighed in.“Senator Warren is now trying to muddy the waters even further,” said deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield. “We’re not going to beat Donald Trump next year with double talk on health care.”Buttigieg spokeswoman Lis Smith said, “Senator Warren’s new health care ’plan’ is a transparently political attempt to paper over a very serious policy problem, which is that she wants to force 150 million people off their private insurance -- whether they like it or not.”Even if Democrats control the entire federal government in 2021, their best-case scenario is a narrow Senate majority that would likely leave Warren far short of the votes to pass Medicare for All. And several key Democrats have pledged not to eliminate the legislative filibuster. But the party is more united around the idea of a government-run insurance option.The budget fast-track process, known as reconciliation, has been used by majorities in both parties to avoid a filibuster. Democrats under President Barack Obama used it to pass Obamacare in 2010, while Republicans under President Donald Trump tried to use the procedure to repeal the health-care law in 2017 but came up short.“While Republicans tried to use fast-track budget reconciliation legislation to rip away health insurance from millions of people with just 50 votes in the Senate, I’ll use that tool in reverse – to improve our existing public insurance programs,” Warren wrote.Still, budget reconciliation creates complications as Senate rules require that such legislation be limited to changes involving taxes and spending. Republicans struggled to shoehorn their attempted repeal of Obamacare, which included regulatory reforms, into the process.Warren also vowed to take immediate action to lower drug prices in her first day as president, including insulin, EpiPens and drugs that save people from opioid overdoses. A Warren administration would help companies produce expensive medicines as a price-control measure and use administrative authority to ensure sufficient supply.(Updates with details in first, second, third paragraphs.)&#92;--With assistance from Tatiana Darie.To contact the reporters on this story: Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou in Washington at megkolfopoul@bloomberg.net;Sahil Kapur in Washington at skapur39@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Wendy Benjaminson at wbenjaminson@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-medicare-implemented-over-three-193233171.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-11-15	2019-11-15 22:36:00	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Health stocks post best day in 10 months as Trump announces transparency rules	A popular exchange-traded fund that tracks the health-care sector saw its best daily return in 10 months on Friday after the Trump administration proposed new rules aimed at making health-care prices more transparent. The SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF  posted a 2.1%, marking its best day since Jan. 4, when it rose 2.98%, according to FactSet data. The Trump administration proposed a rule that would require health insurers to disclose estimated out-of-pocket costs, including negotiated rates, to patients in advance of a procedure or office visit. It also finalized a rule requiring hospitals to make transparent the prices they charge patients starting in 2021. It's possible that the stocks gained on doubts on how the rules would be enforced. &quot;While the Trump administration's new hospital price transparency requirement is quite sweeping, the enforcement of it is quite weak - a maximum fine of $300 per day,&quot; Kaiser Family Foundation executive Larry Levitt wrote on Twitter. Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. , which is the largest health insurer in the U.S., and Anthem Inc.  each rose roughly 5%. Shares of Tenet Healthcare Corp.  and HCA Healthcare Inc. , both large hospital operators, were up at least 2%. The S&P 500  is up 24.4% year-to-date.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/fe901df3-fadc-3ed0-81ca-5e626feca574/health-stocks-post-best-day.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-10	2019-11-10 22:02:13	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Apple Co-Founder Says Goldman’s Apple Card Algorithm Discriminates	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., two of the most recognizable companies in tech and finance, are caught up in a growing debate over whether lenders unintentionally discriminate when they use complex models to determine how Americans borrow money.On Saturday, Bloomberg reported that a Wall Street regulator had opened a probe into Goldman’s credit card practices after a viral tweet from a tech entrepreneur alleged that the Apple Card’s algorithms discriminated against his wife.Now another high-profile user of the Apple Card -- Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak -- is calling for the government to get involved, citing excessive corporate reliance on mysterious technology.“These sorts of unfairnesses bother me and go against the principle of truth. We don’t have transparency on how these companies set these things up and operate,” Wozniak said in an interview on Sunday. “Our government isn’t strong enough on the issues of regulation. Consumers can only be represented by the government because the big corporations only represent themselves.”Wozniak said he can borrow 10 times as much as his wife on their Apple Cards even though they share bank and other credit card accounts, and that other lenders treat them equally.“Algos obviously have flaws,” Wozniak said. “A huge number of people would say, ‘We love our technology but we are no longer in control.’ I think that’s the case.”Lenders have promoted the models because they’re supposed to level the playing field among different borrowers by removing human error and focusing only on data.Apple Card only offers individual accounts and it is possible for two family members to receive significantly different credit decisions, a Goldman spokesman said. “In all cases, we have not and will not make decisions based on factors like gender,” he said.The investigation was launched in response to a series of Twitter posts from David Heinemeier Hansson that railed against the Apple Card for giving him 20 times the credit limit that his wife got. The tweets, many of which contain profanity, immediately gained traction online -- and a response on Twitter from Wozniak.Hansson didn’t disclose any specific income-related information for the couple but said they filed joint tax returns and that his wife has a better credit score than he does. Wozniak said he and his wife also file joint returns and share credit card and bank accounts.“The department will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex,” said a spokesman for Linda Lacewell, the superintendent of the NY DFS. “Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class of people violates New York law.”It’s the second such action in recent weeks from the regulator, which opened a probe against health-care giant UnitedHealth Group Inc. after a study found an algorithm favored white patients over black patients.“New technologies cannot leave certain consumers behind or entrench discrimination,” Lacewell said in a statement on Sunday. She also solicited complaints from aggrieved consumers on Twitter.Traditional lenders are increasing their use of machines to decide who gets how much credit as part of a strategy to reduce costs and boost loan applications. Meanwhile, technology companies are moving in on the financial services industry’s turf, with businesses such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google threatening banks’ lucrative business lines by offering loans and payment options.Congressional ScrutinyThe algorithms have drawn scrutiny in Congress. In June, the House Financial Services Committee heard about examples of algorithmic decision-making where researchers have found instances of bias targeting specific groups even when there was no intent to discriminate.Some lawmakers already are demanding a federal response. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and contender to challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 election, told federal regulators in June that the government “will have to take action to ensure that anti-discrimination laws keep up with innovation.”For Goldman, its growing ambitions for Main Street are bringing increased scrutiny and a new set of challenges it hasn’t faced previously. The Apple Card is a joint venture between Apple and the New York-based bank, which is responsible for all the credit decisions on the card. It was rolled out earlier this year -- the tech giant markets it as “created by Apple, not a bank” -- and executives at both firms hailed it as the most successful launch ever.Hansson said Goldman isn’t treating inadvertent bias seriously.“As soon as this became a PR issue, they immediately bumped up her credit limit without asking for any additional documentation,” he said of his wife in an interview Saturday. “My belief isn’t there was some nefarious person wanting to discriminate. But that doesn’t matter. How do you know there isn’t an issue with the machine-learning algo when no one can explain how this decision was made?”To contact the reporters on this story: Shahien Nasiripour in New York at snasiripour1@bloomberg.net;Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

He’s a partner at Basecamp, a web-based software development firm, and also known to regularly take part in automobile endurance races, including the 24 hours of Le Mans in France.“Goldman and Apple are delegating credit assessment to a black box,” Hansson said. “It’s not a gender-discrimination intent but it is a gender-discrimination outcome.”The use of algorithms by lenders in credit decisions has drawn scrutiny in Congress.

But investors may be left thinking about what could have been because stocks opened noticeably higher before drifting lower over the course of the day.Source: Finviz As was the case on Wednesday, trade talks were in the spotlight today and the news was mostly encouraging amid reports that the U.S. and China are moving toward lifting tariff's on each others exports.According to the Boston Globe, &quot;A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed Thursday that an agreement to roll back tariffs would be part of phase-one deal.&quot; Bloomberg expanded upon this stating that &quot;[t]he negotiations are ongoing and a time or place for any signing of a pact is yet to be determined.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Buy-Rated Stocks With Dividend Yields Over 9% News of lifted tariffs should be rewarding for U.S. technology companies, many of which are trade-sensitive and depend on China as a major end market. Those headlines why six technology stocks were among the Dow's 20 winners today.Still, with the tariff news in mind, investors likely expected better than the Nasdaq Composite gaining just 0.28% while the S&P 500 added a mere 0.27%. Quick ReminderAs a reminder, Disney (NYSE:DIS) reports fiscal fourth-quarter results after the close today. The entertainment giant gained 1.2% today in advance of that report. With another quarter of the Fox content library in the books and the Disney + streaming service just getting off the ground, analysts and investors will be anxiously awaiting commentary from Disney management on those items, among others.&quot;Streaming investments are forecast to weigh on Disney's bottom line in its fiscal fourth quarter. The company is expected to report 95 cents in adjusted earnings per share, down from $1.48 in the same quarter in 2018. Revenue is estimated to come in at $19 billion, versus $14 billion last year,&quot; according to Barron's.On lighter news, managed care provider UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), a stock that has made a few appearances in the &quot;Dow Jones Today&quot; space in recent months, added 2.3% today. I mention this because for the bulk of this year, UNH and rival managed care providers have languished amid political headwinds. But the group seems to be moving past the doomsday Medicare For All scenario. UNH's nearly 14% gain over the past month proves as much. Fighting Off Bad PRShares of Nike (NYSE:NKE) added 1% today, an impressive move considering the company is dealing with some poor public relations.In an op-ed in The New York Times, track and field athlete Mary Cain, formerly a member of Nike's Oregon Project, made damning comments about Alberto Salazar, the program's coach.&quot;I joined Nike because I wanted to be the best female athlete ever. Instead I was emotionally and physically abused by a system designed by Alberto [Salazar] and endorsed by Nike,&quot; Cain stated.Cain said the program forced her to lose weight to increase her performance and that she suffered mental and physical harm as a result. Value PlaysExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the two largest domestic oil companies and both Dow components, were boosted today by the aforementioned trade news.Additionally, each of the Dow's four financial services components closed higher. Combining these two sectors in this conversation is relevant because both energy and financial services are viewed as value destinations and there continues to be talk of a value resurgence.&quot;We've had a growth scare, and we're coming out of that. And what was priced for worse than a growth scare were the value, the cyclical stocks,&quot; said Morgan Stanley Investment Management's Andrew Slimmon in a recent CNBC interview. &quot;Those value stocks are the big opportunity, and they're starting to rally.&quot;  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever  Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayKeeping with the value theme, investors need not fear this concept because, as highlighted by energy and financials, there are some sectors where cyclicality and value intersect. For those looking to play defense without paying up on valuation for consumer staples and utilities, healthcare, one of the Dow's larger sector weights, makes sense.&quot;Thanks to its noncyclical business, Health Care historically outperformed the broader market in six of seven US recessions by an average of 10% and in eight of 11 slowdowns by an average of 5% on a cumulative basis since 1960. This provides a strong defensive exposure in the current slowdown environment,&quot; according to State Street.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-01	2019-11-01 20:21:25	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: A Treat From the October Jobs Report	Yes, Halloween was yesterday, but endure one more related pun: The October jobs report that was released earlier today didn't trick investors. Rather, it a provided a treat that boosted stocks to end the week and start November on the right foot.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com The major equity benchmarks rallied today after the Labor Department said U.S. employers added 128,000 new jobs last month, well ahead of the 85,000 economists were expecting. That against the backdrop of massive layoffs in the automotive industry and the loss of about 20,000 temporary 2020 census workers. Additionally, the September number was revised higher to reflect the addition of 180,000 jobs.While unemployment inched up to 3.6%, it's still low by historical standards and average hourly earnings rose 3% in October. Remember, today's jobs report comes just a couple of days after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the third time this year. Following the most recent FOMC meeting, the central bank noted it's rate-cutting regime may be on hold for awhile and the data seem to support that stance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnother rate cut may not be coming anytime soon, but markets didn't care about that today as the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.13% while the S&P 500 rallied by 0.97%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 1.11% with 19 of its 30 components pointed higher in late trading. Surprises In the Winners ColumnTwo of the Dow's four healthcare components eked out gains today and pharmacy operator Walgreen Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), a consumer staples stock with significant healthcare exposure, surged nearly 5%.  * 10 Stocks That Every 30-Year-Old Should Buy and Hold Forever However, the real story among Dow healthcare names and it's related to WBA's rally, is the gain, albeit modest, for UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH). Indulge my speculation for a moment because I suspect UnitedHealth and rival managed care stocks were in the green today because Democratic frontrunner Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) finally detailed costs for her proposed Medicare For All plan.&quot;Investors have deemed the Sanders plan to be untenable, at least as laid out in its initial form,&quot; said Jeffries analyst Jared Holz, reports Barron's. &quot;We think the Warren proposal, along with its $52 trillion price tag, will also be met with skepticism to say the least and likely viewed as a non-starter by many. Early feedback suggests this is the case. &quot;Putting $52 trillion into context, that's roughly 52 Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL). Speaking of AppleIt was just another day at the office for the iPhone maker as the shares jumped 2.50%, starting November on healthy note after posting a double-digit gain last month.One of the more relevant Apple news items out today was the company asking the Trump administration to relax China-related tariffs on some important products, such as the iPhone 11 and Apple Watches.&quot;The company on Thursday sought tariff exclusions from 11 products, including HomePod speakers, iMac computers, parts for use in repairing iPhones, iPhone smart battery cases, AirPods and others,&quot; reports Reuters. Oil EarningsExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the two largest domestic oil companies and both Dow components, reported third-quarter earnings today. Exxon gained 2.77% to rank as one of the best-performing names in the Dow today while Chevron traded slightly lower.While down by a wide margin on a year-over-year basis, Exxon's third-quarter profit of $3.17 billion, or 75 cents per share, beat the 67 cents a share Wall Street was expecting.Chevron's third-quarter profit fell 36% to $2.58 billion, or $1.36 per share. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.55 a share, topping the consensus estimate of $1.45. Bottom Line in the Dow Jones TodayThere are few big-name earnings reports out next week, including Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) among Dow components, but overall just 3% of the S&P 500 reports next week. So I'll take this opportunity for a brief review of how this earnings season has progressed.&quot;To date, 71% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for Q3 2019. In terms of earnings, the percentage of companies reporting actual EPS above estimates (76%) is above the 5-year average,&quot; according to FactSet research. &quot;In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 3.8% above the estimates, which is below the 5-year average. In terms of sales, the percentage of companies (61%) reporting actual sales above estimates is above the 5-year average. In aggregate, companies are reporting sales that are 0.9% above estimates, which is also above the 5-year average.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-01	2019-11-01 14:46:14	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Why Alphabet’s Acquisition of Fitbit Is a Master Move	Earlier in the week, there was lots of buzz that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) would acquire Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), whose shares spiked more than 15% today on the news (the main report came from Reuters). While such rumors often fizzle, this one certainly did not. Today the announcement hit the wires: Google has agreed to shell out $2.1 billion for the company. All in all, I think the deal is a spot on -- and should be a catalyst for Google stock.Source: Shutterstock True, it's still relatively small, as Alphabet's market cap is a whopping $870 billion. Yet, Fit is likely going to provide quite a bit of leverage. Let's face it, Google has tried to get a piece of the wearables market with its Wear OS. However, there has been little progress so far. How Fitbit Benefits Google StockSo with Fit, Google will have about 6% of the global market (this is based on data from IDC). This will definitely be a good launching pad. According to Fitbit CEO and co-founder James Park: &quot;Google is an ideal partner to advance our mission. With Google's resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone. I could not be more excited for what lies ahead.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut perhaps the biggest benefit -- in terms of the impact on Google stock -- would be the healthcare opportunity. During the past few years, Fitbit has gotten traction with striking deals with health plans. The company has also been working hard to get FDA approvals.Oh, and yes, there is the treasure trove of data, which extends 10-plus years. Note that Google is a global leader in AI and this technology will likely prove extremely useful in transforming the healthcare industry. As CEO Sundar Pichai noted on the latest earnings call, the company continues to push the boundaries of innovation, such as with the creation of a new kind of neural network that improves web services as well as breakthroughs in quantum computing.  * 7 Triple-A Stocks to Buy in November But the fast-growing cloud business should also be a driver for Google stock when it comes to healthcare. In September, the company announced a partnership with the Mayo Clinic to help with clinical experiences, diagnosis and research.&quot;Since Google has numerous health initiatives at present, those should complement what Fitbit brings to the table,&quot; said James Cassel, who is the chairman and co-founder of investment banking firm Cassel Salpeter & Co. (in an email interview). &quot;Access to the installed base could be very helpful to Google's healthcare initiative Project Baseline - a partnership with Duke University School of Medicine, Stanford Medicine and the American Heart Association - as well as other health-centric projects they are working on. Access to big data is crucial for the future of healthcare and Fitbit has access to a lot of information.&quot; Bottom Line on the Alphabet Stock PriceThe wearables market is simply too large for Google to ignore. For example, as seen with Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest earnings report, the category is quite lucrative and a source of strong growth.The company's assortment of products -- like the Watch, HomePod smart speaker and AirPods -- generated revenues of $6.5 billion in the latest quarter, up 54% on a year-over-year basis (this is nearly as much as the Mac business!) In fact, AAPL has gotten traction with its Watch in deals with United Health (NYSE:UNH) and CVS (NYSE:CVS).True, Fitbit has its issues. Growth has been lagging and the competition has remained intense. But again, Google should be an ideal partner -- which should allow for a classic win-win partnership.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-10-29	2019-10-29 20:31:06	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Struggling at the Highs	On Monday, the major U.S. equity benchmarks broke out to all-time highs, but as was noted in the wake of yesterday's bullishness, domestic stocks have had difficulties building on breakouts for over a year now. One trading day does not confirm that will be the case this time around, but stocks retreated on Tuesday.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com Some of today's malaise can be attributed to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), which declined following a disappointing earnings report issued yesterday after the market closed. The internet search giant reported earnings of $10.12 a share on revenue of $40.5 billion while analysts expected earnings of $12.42 on revenue of $40.32 billion.On the company's earnings conference call, CFO Ruth Porat made remarks about year-over-year revenue variability in coming quarters, something that apparently spooked some investors today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWeakness in shares of Alphabet, a major part of the Nasdaq-100 Index, explains why the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.59% today while the S&P 500 retreated just 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined a mere 0.09% as just 11 of its 30 member firms were higher in late trading. Help From HealthcareI've frequently noted that the healthcare sector, the second-largest group in the S&P 500, has been a dud for much of this year, but that wasn't the case on Wednesday. On the back of solid third-quarter earnings reports, Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) were the Dow's top two performers today.  * 10 Stocks to Buy Regardless of Q3 Earnings Merck jumped 3.53% to take the top spot among Dow members today after the company said it earned $1.51 a share on sales of $12.1 billion in the third quarter, easily topping Wall Street estimates of $1.23 and revenue of $11.59 billion.Merck said it expects full-year earnings of $5.12 and $5.17 a share, up from previous guidance of $4.84 to $4.94. The company also forecast 2019 revenue of $46.5 billion to $47 billion, up from a prior forecast of $45.2 billion to $46.2 billion.Pfizer gained 2.48% after the company joined Merck in boosting 2019 guidance. Pfizer now expects to earn $2.94 to $3.00 per share this year, well ahead of previous guidance of $2.76 to $2.86.Strength in Merck and Pfizer today was enough to move UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) and Walgreen Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) higher as well. UNH is the best-performing name in the Dow this month. Something Of A SurpriseThe brief Boeing (NYSE:BA) respite in this space is over, at least for today. I'll give the stock some credit for gaining 2.36% while CEO Dennis Muilenburg was testifying before the Senate about the controversial 737 MAX jet.Then again, the skeptic in me is inclined to say it sure would have been nice if the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights using the 737 MAX didn't crash, touching off a long, still-running saga related to that plane.&quot;We've dedicated all resources necessary to ensure that the improvements to the 737 MAX are comprehensive and thoroughly tested,&quot; according to Muilenburg's prepared remarks. &quot;This process has taken longer than we originally expected.&quot; Interesting ItemShares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) were halted in late trading pending release of news. The news turned out to be that Johnson and Johnson said it found no asbestos in the baby powder it recalled. JNJ was trading slightly lower prior to the trading stop, but is up over 3% after the close. Bottom LineAs the market continues working through third-quarter earnings, it's worth noting that, broadly speaking, the results have been better-than-expected. However, it was also expected that due to the U.S./China trade tensions, which ran hot for much of the September quarter, some companies with significant ex-U.S. exposure are reporting slack numbers. Data confirm as much.&quot;The blended (combines actual results for companies that have reported and estimated results for companies yet to report) earnings decline for the S&P 500 for Q3 2019 is -3.7%. For companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the blended earnings decline is -0.8%. For companies that generate less than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the blended earnings decline is -9.1%,&quot; according to FactSet research.Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Wednesday report could be one more test on the global revenue front.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-21	2019-10-21 18:55:54	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	A Move to Managed Care Will Strengthen UnitedHealth Stock	UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) stock jumped on earnings recently. But a bigger earnings catalyst came a few days later. UnitedHealth is getting into managed care.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Managed care has been the biggest healthcare story of the decade, the truest legacy of the Affordable Care Act. Under managed care companies focus on wellness rather than illness. They control costs by owning the places people go to for care and telling them what medicines they should take.Over the last 10 years Centene (NYSE:CNC) shares have risen almost 950% on Medicare and Medicaid contracts. UNH, which most consider the star of the healthcare sector, is up 840% in that time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before December's Meltdown Now UnitedHealth's Optum unit has created an &quot;accountable care&quot; program in southern California. The sector will never be the same. Everyone in the PoolUnitedHealth had been doing great under the old model. It generated $5 billion in profit during the third quarter, and its health services business is now nearly half its revenue.You might ask, why change?Two reasons. First, because competitors are doing it. Second, because it can.CVS Health's (NYSE:CVS) acquisition of Aetna has made it the first true competitor to UNH, at least in terms of revenue. CVS plans to use its thousands of drug stores and hundreds of in-store clinics to deliver first-line care to millions of people.Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has opened a massive front-line clinic facility in Georgia. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is taking over 1 million people out of the market with its Haven healthcare unit, also a managed care system.UnitedHealth, meanwhile, has been laying its plans for nearly a decade. Optum has become a true competitor to companies like Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) in electronic health records. UNH's acquisition of Catamaran means it has a pharmacy benefit manager comparable to that of Cigna's (NYSE:CI) Express Scripts unit. UnitedHealth has also been quietly buying up care providers like DaVita Medical Group, which provides kidney dialysis.Along the way there have been mistakes. Harken Health, which tried to compete with Kaiser Permanente, was closed. But the company's sheer size now gives it the ability to play hardball with even large hospitals.The new Optum offering, called the SignatureValue Harmony Network, will start with 1.5 million customers, combining Optum's own providers. With DaVita, OptumCare now has more physicians in its networks than HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA), the largest hospital operator. Why Managed Care WorksManaged care works because chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease and kidney failure represent 75% of the national health bill -- and they account for even more of Medicare and Medicaid spending.These conditions can be prevented by lifestyle changes. Careful management can also keep people out of hospitals. Keeping people out of hospitals is the key to managing risks, as Centene has shown.UNH's moves put it in line with industry trends. Its size gives it the power to handle massive amounts of this business profitably. The Bottom Line on UnitedHealth StockProposals for reforming the nation's healthcare system are all geared toward the managed care model.UnitedHealth now has the infrastructure to deliver this model to the mass market.Given the company's size, a market cap more than double that of any insurance rival, revenue that has grown by more than one-third since 2015, this move is a very big deal.UnitedHealth stock is still cheap. Its trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 18 is in line with the market. While the dividend yields just 1.8%, it has nearly tripled in the last five years. UNH has one of Washington's largest lobbying budgets, and its political contributions are usually split evenly between the parties.UnitedHealth, in short, looks ready for nearly anything 2020 could throw at it.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Health care companies have strong underlying businesses, a factor becoming more attractive in the market as investors shift away from “riskier” assets and more expensive, loss-making companies. And from a valuation perspective, the weakness in the health care space has led many investors to buy health care stocks, which are selling at discounted prices.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0829bdb5-3cfc-33f2-9f58-29f2b269c8a7/why-health-care-stocks-can.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-15	2019-10-15 20:33:27	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Earnings Boosts Across the Board	Stocks surged Tuesday as the third-quarter earnings season finally kicked off and several marquee names from the Dow Jones Industrial Average delivered results that were mostly cheered by Wall Street and investors.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com Earnings ebullience for the Dow Jones today was enough to lift the major domestic equity benchmarks to four-week highs. Fortunately, today's earnings reports appeared to command more attention than another tepid global economic growth forecast from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).&quot;Investors are closely analyzing the earnings reports, given the global backdrop of slowing growth and a host of unpredictable macro risks,&quot; according to Bloomberg. &quot;The International Monetary Fund made a fifth-straight cut to its 2019 global growth forecast, citing a broad deceleration across the world's largest economies as trade tensions undermine the expansion.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe IMF report wasn't enough to derail the Nasdaq Composite, which gained 1.24% while the S&P 500 added 1%. The Dow closed higher by 0.89% with 26 of its 30 components in the green in late trading. Holy HealthcareThe healthcare sector, the second-largest sector weight in the S&P 500 behind technology, has been a dog this year with managed care providers, such as Dow component UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) weighing on the group.That tone shifted for the better today with UnitedHealth surging 8.25% after the company posted stellar third-quarter results.  * 10 Hot Stocks Staging Huge Reversals &quot;During the quarter, revenue grew 7% year over year to $60.4 billion, operating profits grew 9% to $5.0 billion, and adjusted earnings per share grew 13% to $3.88,&quot; according to Morningstar. &quot;UnitedHealthcare, the leading U.S. health insurer, grew 5% year over year to $48.1 billion in revenue while operating profits grew 4% during the same period to $2.7 billion. This business continues to benefit from the expansion of Medicare Advantage plans, and the recent executive order bolstering that program may reinforce those positive trends.&quot;Importantly, UnitedHealth lifted its 2019 earnings-per-share guidance to $14.90 to $15 from $14.40 to $14.70 a share. UnitedHealth holds its analyst day on Dec. 3 and is likely to unveil 2020 guidance at that event.Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) joined the healthcare rally, jumping 1.6% after delivering solid third-quarter results. Tuesday's gain was enough to have JNJ stock just outside of the top five Dow performers on the day.For the July through September quarter, JNJ earned $2.12 a share on revenue of $20.7 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $2.01 in EPS on sales of $20.1 billion.&quot;As we look ahead, we remain confident in the strength of our broad-based business model, which is fueled by our disciplined portfolio management, focus on transformational innovation and dedicated employees around the world who position us for success today and well into the future,&quot; said CEO Alan Gorsky in a statement. Financial FunJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, was the second-best performer in the Dow today behind UnitedHealth on the back of its impressive earnings update. The company earned $2.68 a share in the third quarter, easily beating analyst estimates of $2.45. On the earnings call, CEO Jamie Dimon said banks continue seeing erosion in net interest margins due to low U.S. interest rates.Although it missed on third-quarter numbers, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) posted a modest gain today. Slack trading revenue and some bad bets in the &quot;unicorn&quot; world, including WeWork, weighed on Goldman's results in the most recently completed quarter.Alas, bank stocks, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, are inexpensive on valuation.&quot;JPMorgan trades for two times tangible book value, while Goldman, which has the lowest valuation among its peers, trades at tangible book value,&quot; according to Barron's.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy (With Brands You Can Find In Your Kitchen)  Intel InterestFollowing UnitedHealth and JPMorgan, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the third-best performer in the Dow today, but it wasn't earnings news boosting shares of the semiconductor giant. A modest $27 million acquisition of a 5G software business known as Smart Edge from Canada's Pivot Technology Solutions appears to be one of the catalyst's behind Intel's Tuesday rally.Not an earth-shattering deal relative to Intel's size, but it does underscore the company's commitment to entrenching itself in the fast-growing 5G market. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayFor Dow components, Wednesday is a docile day on the earnings front with only International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) reporting after the bell. As noted above, the companies reporting today got the ball moving in the right direction and it could prove encouraging that previously downtrodden UnitedHealth offered such bullish guidance and that Goldman Sachs traded higher despite a less-than-impressive report.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-15	2019-10-15 14:20:29	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	For J&J and UnitedHealth, Making Money's Easy for Now	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Being an enormously profitable industry leader doesn't mean what it used to.Johnson & Johnson and UnitedHealthGroup Inc., the world’s biggest health-care company and health insurer, respectively, reported third-quarter earnings results Tuesday morning that should thrill investors. Both managed to beat Wall Street earnings estimates and boosted full-year profit guidance above expectations as they generated a combined $80 billion in sales. You’d expect shares of well-run blue chips in a defensive sector to be doing well amid recession fears. And yet, even after both J&J and UnitedHealth rose in early trading on their earnings news —  with the latter’s stock surging more than 7% — both are substantially trailing the broader market this year as investors focus on policy and legal risks. Making boatloads of cash in today’s environment is the easy part for these companies. The question is their ability to keep doing so in the long run. The performance of lobbyists and, in J&J's case, an armada of lawyers will matter more than the performance of these businesses for some time to come. A big chunk of the Democratic presidential debate Tuesday evening will be devoted to discussing policies that range from unpleasant for both companies to existentially threatening to UnitedHealth.The most threatening proposal from the industry’s standpoint is “Medicare for All,” which would eliminate most private insurance in favor of a government plan and create price pressure throughout the health-care sector. It’s likely too ambitious to have much chance at passing anytime soon, but it can’t be ignored. It’s the preferred policy of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, at least for now, and she is looking increasingly like the front-runner. Even the comparatively moderate public options proposed by candidates such as former Vice President Joe Biden would take market share from insurers and pressure profits.While the worst-case scenarios would hurt UnitedHealth more, J&J could very well be more likely to see major policy damage stemming from other initiatives. There's more consensus on drug pricing among Democrats than there is on broader health reform, and that consensus isn’t pharma-friendly. Many Democratic presidential candidates support something similar to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s muscular drug price negotiation bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently reported that the legislation would save Medicare $345 billion over seven years and cost drugmakers as much as $1 trillion in revenue over a decade. Action on drug prices is also possible under a broader range of 2020 electoral outcomes; even traditionally more industry-friendly Republicans are keen to act, and President Donald Trump has sounded off on the issue as well and promised action. Add in J&J’s uncertain liabilities from thousands of lawsuits targeting all sides of its business, and it’s easy to see why investors can't focus on fundamentals.   Some see this weakness as a buying opportunity, but that bet requires a brave and patient investor. We’re more than a year away from the 2020 election, and J&J’s legal issues will take a long time to resolve. Tangible policy change remains uncertain and distant, but the policy consensus has shifted in an interventionist direction.Even a run of several fabulous quarters can’t change that. To contact the author of this story: Max Nisen at mnisen@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2019-10-15	2019-10-15 14:10:39	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Health Insurers Gain Most Since 2013 as Medical Cost Fears Ease	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. health insurers had their biggest intraday gain in more than six years after the industry’s biggest company reported third-quarter earnings that gave investors confidence in coming results by its rivals.UnitedHealth Group Inc. raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast after a key measure of medical spending improved from the prior quarter. Known as the medical-loss ratio, or MLR, the crucial gauge measures the share of each premium dollar that goes to pay for customers’ medical care. A higher MLR can cut into profitability.UnitedHealth is the first of the major insurers to report earnings, and its MLR is often seen as an indicator of medical spending trends. In the third quarter, UnitedHealth said its ratio was 82.4%, down from 83.1% in the second quarter. While the change seems small, it amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars in potential profit for company.“We continue to see costs very well controlled and cost trends consistent with expectations,” said Jeff Putnam, chief financial officer of UnitedHealth’s insurance unit.UnitedHealth’s shares rose as much as 6.6% in New York, their best intraday gain in about two years. Its health plan competitors rose as well, with Anthem Inc. up 4.4%, Centene Corp. up 1.7% and Humana Inc. up 2.5%. The S&P’s Managed Health Care Index had its biggest intraday gain in more than six years.Health-insurance stocks had struggled this year, facing political worries from Democratic presidential candidates and more narrow concerns about their businesses.“Investors are likely breathing a sigh of relief on this print” after shares fell about 17% since second-quarter earnings on political and fundamental concerns, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Gary Taylor said in a note to clients earlier Tuesday.The S&P 500 Managed Care Index has plunged into a correction twice this year already and is hovering around the lowest level since April, when insurers fell on worries about Democrats’ Medicare-for-All proposals, which would either eliminate private health insurance or create a government competitor to private plans. The presidential primary candidates face off in their fourth primary debate Tuesday evening in Ohio.UnitedHealth said it now forecasts full-year adjusted earnings of $14.90 to $15 per share, up 15 cents from the projection it gave in July. Third-quarter adjusted earnings were $3.88 a share, topping the $3.75 average of analysts’ estimates.UnitedHealth’s 2020 earnings growth estimate also came slightly above analyst expectations, based on estimates from Evercore ISI. The insurer guided for growth at the low end of its long-term 13% to 16% goal, while analysts were looking for 11%, analyst Michael Newshel said in a note to clients earlier Tuesday.For more details on UnitedHealth’s third-quarter earnings results, click here.To contact the reporters on this story: John Tozzi in New York at jtozzi2@bloomberg.net;Tatiana Darie in New York at tdarie1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Drew Armstrong at darmstrong17@bloomberg.net, Cécile DauratFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/health-insurers-gain-most-since-141039225.html?.tsrc=rss

Delegates from China and Trump Administration officials started two days of trade meetings today in Washington and it looks like a &quot;mini deal&quot; is what's on the table.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com Although President Trump has long rebuked the idea of a small trade deal with China, that may be what ultimately comes of the two-day meeting and stocks seem to like the idea. Trump posted on Twitter earlier today that he plans to meet with Vice Premier Liu He tomorrow.&quot;The White House is looking at rolling out a previously agreed currency pact with China as part of an preliminary deal that could also see a planned tariff increase next week suspended,&quot; reports Bloomberg. &quot;Separately, Bloomberg is reporting that China plans to ask the U.S. to lift sanctions on its biggest shipping company, citing people familiar with the matter.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGeopolitical negotiations are like any other negotiations: it's all about compromise and compromise is all about both sides feeling like they're benefiting. In other words, Trump probably won't get the all or nothing trade deal he wants and financial markets seem to be at peace with that.The Nasdaq Composite added 0.60% today, while the S&P 500 gained 0.64%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.57% with just over two-thirds of the index's 30 members higher in late trading. Caterpillar CallConstruction machinery maker Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was one of the Dow's top performers today, adding 2.7%, in a move that's likely attributable to the aforementioned traded news as Caterpillar is one of the more trade-sensitive names in the Dow.  * 10 Winning Stocks to Buy and Stick With for the Long Haul Shares of Caterpillar have been in a funk recently, sliding more than 8% over the past month, a tumble that has turned the stock negative on the year, making it one of the worst performers in the Dow.&quot;Given new data that has come in and healthy skepticism to begin with, we reduced our estimates for the remainder of 2019 and for 2020 as the North American market weakened and further production cuts are probably necessary to align to retail demand,&quot; said William Blair analyst Larry De Maria, in a note out earlier this week in which the research pared 2019 and 2020 earnings estimates on Caterpillar.The company reports third-quarter results on Oct. 23. Another OffenderSpeaking of Dow Jones stocks that have seemingly not been able to get out of their own way this year, there's UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH).

Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThe aforementioned U.S.-China trade confab is slated to last two days, so there are short odds that I'll be addressing that issue again tomorrow. Progress on that front was seemingly made today, leaving investors to hope for more of the same on Friday and that President Trump takes it easy on Twitter 24 hours.Love him or hate him, he's probably shrewd enough to realize he can spin any good news on trade with China into a political victory and that's something stocks are likely to respond to positively.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Windley cut his rating to hold from buy, and dropped his stock price target by 22% to $235 from $300. Windley's target is now the lowest among the 26 analysts surveyed by FactSet, making him the least bullish on the healthcare services company. Windley said Anthem's strategy to regain market share in the commercial group risk market &quot;is showing traction,&quot; likely at UnitedHealth's expense.

2019-10-03	2019-10-03 19:39:25	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Trump Crying ‘Socialism’ Isn't a Health-Care Plan	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- After months of promising a big beautiful health-care plan, President Donald Trump finally delivered something.Escaping briefly from the impeachment drama going on in Washington, Trump used a Thursday speech in Florida to announce a new executive order aimed at steering more seniors into privately managed Medicare Advantage plans instead of traditional Medicare. The president is selling it as part of a broader effort to lower costs and protect seniors from Democratic proposals such as &quot;Medicare for All&quot; that he said would “raid Medicare to fund a thing called socialism.” It served as a preview of the rhetoric the president will use as he attempts to gain an advantage on a strong issue for Democrats. It's easy to see why he's going this way. Change is scary. Medicare for All, which would end most private insurance and put all Americans on a government-run plan, gets a mixed reception in polls. But health care is still a minefield for Trump. Crying &quot;socialism&quot; at efforts to change America’s health system isn’t new. Medicare was decried as a capitalism-killer in the 1960s. The Affordable Care Act got the same treatment, even though it echoed ideas that came from a conservative think tank. Now Medicare is so well-regarded that the president is making its &quot;defense&quot; a centerpiece of his health agenda. As for the ACA, it’s getting increasingly popular, and Republican efforts to repeal it contributed to their losing control of the House.In that context, it's worth looking at what Democratic proposals would do. Rather than destroying Medicare, they'd arguably improve it and expand it. The current program isn't perfect. It includes substantial premiums, as well as co-pays, deductibles, and co-insurance for using care. There's no cap on out-of-pocket expenses for people in traditional Medicare, which can create a significant financial burden.Medicare for All – essentially universal health coverage – would substantially extend the benefits available to seniors and eliminate all out-of-pocket costs. The plan’s coverage of long-term care would remove a huge weight from the elderly and their families. There are some potential trade-offs: Wait times could increase as more people join the program, and taxes would increase. Even so, it’s hard to frame the plan as a definite negative for most seniors. Medicare for All is also the least likely of the Democratic health plans to become law. Most of the party’s presidential candidates support less disruptive policies that would still help seniors. Some would expand benefits, most would cap out-of-pocket expenses, and some would do both. By contrast, Trump's proposal may not do all that much for seniors.The idea behind Medicare Advantage is that competition between private insurers like UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Humana Inc. that sell these plans will boost efficiency and decrease costs. People who sign up for these plans get access to expanded benefits, out-of-pocket caps, and potentially lower premiums. In return, though, they face more limited access to a narrower set of doctors – the very thing the president says Democratic plans will bring. Cost savings and profits have to come from somewhere, after all.The executive order reportedly includes some additional cost-control efforts, including a fraud crackdown and an expansion of the role of nurse practitioners. They are unlikely to have a major impact. A reported boost to tax-advantaged health-savings accounts will largely benefit the wealthy. Moreover, the order may open the president to accusations that he’s trying to privatize Medicare. Republicans also will have to contend with the Democratic counter-argument that more Americans should get Medicare Advantage-type benefits without subsidizing insurer profits. There’s also the salient fact that insurers who run these plans have over-billed U.S. taxpayers by nearly $30 billion in the last three years alone, according to the Department of Health and Human Services’ own estimates . Ranging into other health-care areas, Trump’s speech also touted his various drug-pricing initiatives, failing to mention those that have failed to make it to the finish line. Other vulnerabilities remain, too, like the administration's support for a lawsuit that could kill the ACA even as the president makes a contradictory pledge to protect people with pre-existing conditions.Perhaps inevitably, Trump couldn't stay away from the impeachment inquiry. Towards the end of his Wednesday remarks, he implied that drugmakers unhappy about his efforts might be involved. If Trump wants to turn health care into a strength, he’ll have to do better than that. To contact the author of this story: Max Nisen at mnisen@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2019-09-18	2019-09-18 17:42:17	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Blue-Chip Stocks for a Market Slowdown	The global economy is starting to look a little shaky. Between the US-China trade tensions and now the Iranian-sponsored attacks on Saudi Arabian oil output, the pressures on the world system of trade and commerce are increasing. As CLSA’s Eric Fishwick said, “Trade both ways has slowed… the trade wars are definitely having an impact.” And in an effort to calm markets after the drone attack on his company’s largest facility, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said, “We have enough oil products to supply the local market.”After posting losses on Monday, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones were up slightly on Tuesday. The S&P gained 0.26%, while the Dow added 0.13%. A look at the charts, however, shows that the sharp gains the markets have posted since August 23 have slowed and levelled off. Investors are watching the news and getting nervous.A wise investor will move to protect his portfolio, and we’ve found three Strong Buy stocks in the TipRanks database to do just that. These are large-cap health insurers, offering a product that remains in high demand no matter what the economic conditions, and generating high returns through share appreciation over the long-run. They are not cheap stocks, but they are classic defensive plays for an uncertain market environment. Anthem, Inc.With 40 million members, Anthem (ANTM – Get Report) is the largest managed care company in the Blue Cross Blue Shield network. It is the largest health insurer in California, the country’s largest state-wide market. ANTM shares are up 123% over the past five years, and the company’s dividend, while yielding a modest 1.24%, pays out an appreciable $3.20 per share annually.Anthem’s earnings reflect the company’s strong position in the health care market. In the second quarter, Anthem reported a net profit of $1.14 billion on quarterly revenues of $25.47 billion. EPS, at $4.64, was in line with the expected $4.62. Both profits and EPS were up year-over-year; net profits by 8.5% and EPS by 9%.Robust earnings and a solid position in its industry prompted Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill to start coverage of this stock with a Buy rating. He set a $323 price target, and noted, “The company's execution has been strong recently, even though we see some implementation risk [from] relatively lower exposure to the faster-growing segments of the market.” Hill’s price target suggests an upside potential of 25%.ANTM stock has a unanimous Buy consensus from the Street; 7 analysts have given this company a Buy in the past three months. Shares sell for $257, and the average price target of $345 implies a potential upside of 34%. Cigna Holding CompanyWith 5-year growth of 75%, and a Q2 earnings positive surprise of 13%, Cigna (CI – Get Report) is another solid performer in the health insurance industry. The company offers medical and dental, as well as accident, disability, and life insurance products around the world.Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn, who has a 65% success rate with his stock recommendations, sees CI as a compelling buy. His price target of $254 suggests an impressive upside of 57%. In his comments, Wiederhorn states, “The [business] environment has certainly changed, with regulatory pressure affecting all ends of the pharmaceutical supply chain, but he believes the depressed multiples are well overdone.”Analyst George Hill, quoted above, also likes CI, enough to initiate coverage with a Buy rating. He writes, “The company's PBM segment does not contain the significant short-term earnings risk implied by the steep discount of the stock price. We believe its core commercial MCO and the perceived cross sales benefit could drive its multiple expansion.” Hill’s $207 price target implies an upside of 28%.Like Anthem, Cigna has a unanimous consensus rating of Strong Buy – in the last three months, the stock has been given 8 buy ratings. Cigna shares sell for $161, making it significantly less expensive than Anthem or UnitedHealth (see below), and its average price target of $214 gives the stock a 32% upside potential. UnitedHealth Group, Inc.UnitedHealth (UNH – Get Report) benefits from scale – it is the world’s largest health insurer and boasts over 115 million customers. Its 2018 revenue totaled over $225 billion, with over $17 billion realized in profits. More recently, UNH posted a 3.9% positive earnings surprise on Q2 EPS of $3.60. While the company’s growth has slowed in the past year, sheer scale ensures that it will remain profitable. The strong dividend, paying out $4.32 per share annually, makes this stable stock a favorite for return-minded investors.Continued profitability lies behind 4-star analyst A. J. Rice’s optimism on the stock. The Credit Suisse analyst gives UNH a buy rating with a $293 price target. Rice says of UNH, “The company gave the impression that the moderation in enrollment growth it’s seeing this year was largely expected... However, it also stressed that its goal of 13-16% EPS growth is a long-term target implying that 2020 is an unlikely timeframe to see such substantial improvements.&quot;Our current 2020 estimates anticipate 10% Y/Y growth. If UNH posts modest upside relative to our Q3 and Q4 2019 estimates, our 2020 $16.30 EPS est could then represent roughly 8-10% growth. This type of growth seems a reasonable initial target.” Rice’s price target suggests a potential upside of 26% for UNH shares. He has a 63% success rate with his recommendations on this stock.Overall, UNH holds a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, with 10 buys and 2 holds given in the past three months. Shares in UNH sell for $232, making it the most expensive of the stocks in this list. The $298 price target suggests an upside of 28%.Visit TipRanks’ Trending Stocks page and find out what else the Street’s top analysts are looking at.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-blue-chip-stocks-market-174217258.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-13	2019-09-13 20:10:57	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Lacking Sizzle	Stocks meandered for much of Friday despite some encouraging consumer data, which may not be surprising given that this week was mostly impressive for riskier assets.Source: Shutterstock In a report out earlier today, the University of Michigan's initial reading of September consumer sentiment jumped to 92 from the three-year low of 89.8 last month. Additionally, another report out this morning showed retail sales in August rose 0.4% and that the July reading was revised higher.&quot;The resilient reading shows American consumers may be poised to shake off trade war and global slowdown to support the record-long economic expansion as the labor market holds up,&quot; according to Bloomberg.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Discount Retail Stocks to Buy for a Recession In recent months, I've noted many times in this space the importance of the U.S. consumer and that many of the recession calls were likely premature because the market has not absorbed material deterioration in consumer data to date. I'll stick by that thesis because the preliminary September sentiment reading seems to indicate the August result was a bump in the road, not the start of a negative trend.Today, the Nasda Composite finished lower by 0.22% while the S&P 500 dropped 0.08%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.13%, extending its winning streak to eight days. In late trading, 16 of the Dow's 30 components were pointed higher. Pleasant Surprise for Dow Component UNHIt was interesting if not surprising to see UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), a frequent guest of this space, rank as one of the best-performing names in the Dow today. I say surprising because there was a democratic debate last night, an event that typically weighs on stocks like UNH. I missed the goings on, but I'll assume whatever Medicare For All talk that took place was not strident enough to derail UNH shares today.Staying with the healthcare theme, don't read too much into today's bounce in pharmacy name Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), a consumer staples name with sizable drug price exposure, because two of the Dow's three pharmaceuticals names finished lower today. This is another hot-button issue investors need to be aware of going forward.&quot;An ambitious draft plan from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to allow government price negotiation on a swath of expensive drugs has shifted Washington's contentious policy debate leftward at a critical point for Democratic negotiations with Senate Republicans and the White House,&quot; reports Modern Healthcare. BA Flying HigherBoeing (NYSE:BA) continued trending higher, gaining 1.06% today as the company makes progress toward getting the 737 MAX jet airborne again. A deeper analysis of that issue and other important points on Boeing stock is available here.There seems to be some momentum for Boeing getting the jet back in the skies before the end of this year, Wall Street's desired time horizon, but by the company's admission, it doesn't control the timeline.&quot;The timeline is in the hands of divided regulators around the world who must approve Boeing's proposed software fix for 737 MAX flight controls and new training materials. European regulators plan their own test flights on the changes,&quot; reports Reuters. Fighting BackWith a decline of about 2%, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That's not something that happens very often, so when it does, it's fair to surmise there's a reason for the Apple weakness, albeit temporary.Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall cut his price target on Apple shares today to $165 from $187, saying the company's recently unveiled $4.99 per month price on the Apple + streaming TV service is aggressive and could hamper the company's earnings.Apple rebutted the analyst, saying it doesn't expect Apple + to materially impact results. Bottom Line on Dow JonesThere are just a couple of weeks left in the the third quarter, meaning another earnings season is fast-approaching. I'll leave you with a glance at some of the sectors analysts are bullish and tepid on this quarter.&quot;At the sector level, analysts are most optimistic on the Energy (66%) sector, as this sector has the highest percentage of Buy ratings. It is interesting to note that the Energy sector is projected to report the largest earnings decline of all 11 sectors in CY 2019 (-20.9%) and the largest earnings growth of all 11 sectors in CY 2020 (30.2%),&quot; said FactSet.The research firm notes analysts are not enthusiastic about consumer staples as that sector has the lowest percentage of &quot;buy&quot; ratings and the highest percentage of &quot;sell&quot; calls.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-11	2019-09-11 20:02:20	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Why Teladoc (TDOC) Stock is Poised to Capture the Future of Healthcare	There's a big shift going on in the healthcare industry. I'm sure you've seen evidence of it yourself. But today, I want to make sure it's on your radar as an investment. My pick in this area, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) stock, is starting to take off, and once you see why, you'll want to be on board, too.Healthcare companies are finally joining us here in the 21st century… by using technology to offer us better care, more efficiently.There are all sorts of advancements being made, from DNA sequencing to &quot;liquid biopsies&quot; (which can detect disease biomarkers with one little prick). But the one I find most exciting right now is telemedicine. Rather than getting stuck in line, waiting to see a doctor, these days you can often just log on (or get on the phone) for a &quot;virtual checkup.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'm a bit of a hypochondriac, so I'm never hesitant to go to urgent care if I'm concerned about something - but I hate sitting in a crowded room with people coughing on me. I'm sure you do, too. Telemedicine is perfect for me, and I've loved it every time I've used it.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September Aside from convenience, I believe telemedicine could have a big impact on things like mental health. When people are able to see a therapist or psychiatrist virtually, it makes it much easier for people to get treatment.Those are just two anecdotal examples. But as the trend takes hold, more data becomes available. Last week, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) published the following research:  * Of 5,000 respondents to an Advisory Board survey on telemedicine, three-quarters said they'd consider virtual care.  * Telemedicine can be especially important in preventative care. Ninety percent of respondents said they'd cancel (or reschedule) a &quot;wellness visit&quot; if it conflicted with work.  * One of the biggest opportunities is in rural areas without sufficient access to healthcare. There are 7,200 of these areas in the United States, in which about 85 million Americans are underserved.  * And for health insurers, these programs could save $6 billion annually. For example, a $1,800 trip to the emergency room could cost less than $50 virtually!So far, the results are encouraging: From 2014 to 2018, virtual care usage is up 624%!As for United Healthcare itself, its experience with telemedicine reinforces my expectation that this trend is here to stay. Demographics Are On Their SideUnited Healthcare launched &quot;Virtual Visits&quot; in 2016. Of roughly 500,000 customers to date, &quot;most are between the ages of 30 to 34 and are primarily women.&quot;And this generation - the millennials - is now the largest living adult generation, having just surpassed even the baby boomers.This demographic shift is one I have a close eye on. In fact, I just devoted my September issue of Investment Opportunities to it.Millennials are now reaching the point where they're beginning to form families and buy houses. They may have waited longer than their forerunners, but they will have a huge impact as they dominate the economy for the next decade or more.And if millennials prefer virtual checkups, then this really is the future of healthcare. One Company Has the First-Mover AdvantageAt the end of its report, United Healthcare announced that its new, nationwide provider of Virtual Visits is Teladoc.But Teladoc has actually been around since 2002. And today, it's the leading provider of telehealth medical visits in the United States. The company boasts being able to connect you with a licensed doctor in under 10 minutes… whether it's via the phone, internet, or mobile app.Shares got hit on news that Teladoc's contract ran out with the U.S. Defense Health Agency. I wasn't too worried, though, as I explained in Investment Opportunities - where we've owned TDOC stock for a year and a half.Teladoc is already the leader in the telehealth industry, with well over 50% of the market share in the United States. If it can keep growing at this pace, the number of visits could grow by 10-fold in the coming years - and revenue gains should keep pace.Already in the most recent quarter, revenue gained 38% quarter-over-quarter to $130.3 million. Visit volumes soared 70% to 908,000, while U.S. paid memberships grew by 100,000 to 26.8 million.Sure enough, the stock has begun to surge again after the United Healthcare deal was announced. After all, the Military Health System was a 9.4 million-person market - but United Healthcare is a 49.5 million-person market!TDOC stock has popped more than 50% from its lows late last year. It is still under my recommended buy price in Investment Opportunities… but I don't expect it to stay that way for long. Once more investors catch on to the virtual-medicine mega-trend - and identify Teladoc as the industry leader - TDOC stock will realize plenty more upside.And while Teladoc is a great direct play on personalized medicine… Certain Indirect Plays Are Just as InterestingWearable devices are helping people like me take control of our health. The Apple Watch is actually an approved medical device. It can alert you to a low heart rate, detect your heart rhythm, and even conduct an ECG (or EKG). It can also make an emergency call for you - and it can do it in 150 different countries with the new Series 5 announced today.It's no wonder Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would want to move into this market: Analysts are predicting 14X growth in just 10 years!All of these devices need to be powered. And when we're talking about something as crucial as medical devices - then we really need a battery that's more reliable than the current technology.It blows my mind that we are STILL relying on battery technology that was created for Sony camcorders in the 1980s. But the next generation is in the works. And these batteries will be more powerful - and much safer.I've got everything you need to know, and I can show you how to invest now.

In this episode of Matt McCall's &quot;Money Line&quot; podcast, he gives you the basics to get through everything this month has to offer (think cold season, NFL and an often-dreaded market period).If you're cozying up to watch -- or listen to -- this podcast with tissues, cough drops and a bad case of the sniffles, you'll find that McCall is in the same boat. However, his advice for getting through cold season doubles as a stock pick.Do you hate going to the doctor when all you need is a prescription for an antibiotic? Find yourself avoiding appointments to not take time off from work? Telemedicine might just be the answer. For McCall, this meant he could video chat with a doctor, discuss his cold symptoms and pick up a prescription in a matter of minutes. For you, this could mean saving time and escaping the misery of waiting rooms. Telemedicine consultations can cover topics ranging from prenatal care to oncology to dermatology.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMcCall sees Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) as one of the perfect plays for the future of medicine. According to UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), 70% of people are willing to or have already tried telemedicine. These survey results are promising for TDOC stock, but a new deal with UnitedHealth may be even more promising. Later this month, Teladoc will become the national virtual visit provider within UnitedHealth's network. This spells good things for TDOC stock and for sniffly workers. McCall's PodcastSeptember isn't just the start of cold season. It also marks the start of the NFL's regular season -- and what's historically considered one of the worst months in the market. Tune in to this episode to get tips on how to handle this dreaded month.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now McCall's VIP subscribers might know that he's picked four &quot;NFL stocks&quot; to watch.

Well, as should be no surprise, there will continue to be offerings from red-hot areas like cloud software operators, and there will be some deals from traditional companies. First: What's an IPO, Anyway?For many people, IPOs are kind of a mystery. After all, it does seem kind of strange for a company's stock to zoom on the first day of trading, right?Here's a quick explanation of IPOs: An IPO is when a company issues its shares to the public on an exchange, such as the Nasdaq Composite or New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Often this process results in raising a large amount of money, say over $100 million.Getting to this point is not easy. Upcoming IPOs need to have audited books, a strong financial infrastructure and an experienced management team. There will also need to be advisors -- called investment bankers or underwriters -- who will provide guidance through the process. This involves putting together a disclosure document called an S-1, and having a roadshow, in which management makes presentations to investors.Advisors will generally undervalue the shares, allowing for the pop. It's a way to reward investors. Yet these investors are usually institutions, hedge funds, and wealthy people.Yes, it's kind of unfair, but the system has seen little change over the decades. Despite this, individual investors have still made lots of money from IPOs like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) -- regardless of if they got the shares at the offering price.Let's take a look at the seven upcoming IPOs for the month: SmileDirectClub (SDC)Source: Thamyris Salgueiro / Shutterstock.com Among the upcoming IPOs, SmileDirectClub might garner the most interest. This company is the pioneer of the direct-to-consumer market for teeth straightening systems. SmileDirectClub leverages innovative teledentistry technology and has a fully integrated platform.While a orthodontist may charge $5,000 to $8,000 for a procedure, SmileDirectClub charges generally below $2,000. The company also has a financing program and reimbursement relationships with UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and CVS Health (NYSE:CVS).From fiscal 2017 to 2019, revenues soared nearly 200% to $423.2 million. And since 2014, the company has served over 700,000 customers.  * 7 Tech ETFs to Invest In Now The SmileDirectClub IPO is expected to involve the issuance of 58.5 million shares at a range of $19 to $22. The lead underwriters include JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Jefferies, UBS (NYSE:UBS) and Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS). The shares will be listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker of SDC. Cloudflare (NET)Source: Shutterstock Cloudflare develops technologies to deliver highly robust and secure internet connectivity. The company is trying to disrupt the traditional approaches, which rely heavily on legacy on-premise software.From 2016 to 2018, revenues have gone from $84.8 million to $192.7 million. Keep in mind that the company counts 10% of the Fortune 1,000 as paying customers. In fact, about 18% of the top 10,000 websites use at least one product from Cloudflare.As for the upcoming IPO, the company expects to offer 35 million shares at a range of $10 to $12 on the NYSE (the proposed ticker is NET). The lead underwriters are Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), JPM, Jefferies, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and RBC.

The company has about 8,800 customers, up from 5,400 on a year-over-year basis.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off Datadog plans to issue 24 million shares at $19 to $22 and the lead underwriters include MS, GS, JPM, CS, Barclays (NYSE:BCS), Jefferies, and RBC. The company will list its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker of DDOG. Ping Identity Holding (PING)Source: Shutterstock Ping Identity builds technologies that allow for secure access to any web service or API from any device. At the core of this is sophisticated AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) that analyzes data in real-time, whether from the cloud, hybrid cloud, or on-premise systems.In terms of growth, the company's revenues have jumped from $172.5 million in 2017 to $201.6 million in 2018, up about 17%. More than half of the Fortune 100 use the software.Ping Identity IPO expects to issue 12.5 million shares at a range of $14 to $16 and the lead underwriters include GS, BAC, RBC, Citigroup (NYSE:C), BCS, CS, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) and WFC. The company will list on the NYSE under the ticker of PING. Envista Holdings (NVST)Source: Shutterstock Envista is one of the largest dental product companies, with strong positions in categories like implants, digital imaging, and orthodontics. The company owns a variety of brands like Nobel Biocare Systems, Ormco and KaVo Kerr. They have over one million dentists across 150 countries. Last year, Envista posted revenues of $2.86 billion.A key to the success of the company is a strong focus on innovation. To this end, it spent about $172 million on R&D last year.  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever Regarding the upcoming IPO, Envista plans to issue 26.8 million shares at a range of $21 to $24 and the lead underwriters include JPM, GS, MS, Baird, Evercore ISI and Jefferies.

The company will list its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker of TXG. SpringWorks Therapeutics (SWTX)Source: Shutterstock SpringWorks Therapeutics is a biotech company, which is focused on precision medicine to create oncology treatments. By leveraging partnerships - such as with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) -- the company has been able to get two drugs into late-stage trials. For example, Nirogacestat is an oral GSI (gamma secretase inhibitor) that is for desmoid tumors (there are no FDA approved drugs for this).In terms of the IPO, the company expects to offer 7.4 million shares at a range of $16 to $18 and the lead underwriters include JPM, GS and Cowen. SpringWorks Therapeutics will list its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker SWTX.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

After analyzing the policy positions of the leading candidates seeking the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 2020, the U.S. Senate landscape in the upcoming election, and the preferences of likely voters on both sides of the aisle, we think investors should consider the probability that a policy similar to Medicare for All will see success to be in the 5%-10% range at best.  Aside from the political barriers to broader support of a universal healthcare system, cost remains a key hurdle.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e64ca957-d9ad-338a-a15c-3dc0a493cf4e/investing-with-our-2020.html?.tsrc=rss

So with that in mind, today's results were nothing to be concerned about.Source: ymgerman / Shutterstock.com In fact, the results for this Friday, the last trading day of August, weren't too shabby when considering there was a concerning consumer data point released earlier today. Regular readers know that I've been beating the consumer drum quite a bit recently and it is a story worth following for investors.&quot;The University of Michigan's final sentiment index fell to 89.8 in August from a previously reported 92.1 and 98.4 in July,&quot; according to Bloomberg. &quot;The gauge of current conditions dropped to the lowest since October 2016, while the expectations index matched January as the weakest since that same period.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off Even with that the Nasdaq Composite finished lower by 0.13% while the S&P 500 eked out a gain of 0.06%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day up 0.16%. In late trading, just over half of the Dow's 30 components were trading higher. Dow Winners With AsterisksToday's Dow Jones Industrial Average winners were not large in percentage terms, but two of the standouts merit caution and not just because they are defensive names. Plenty Dow stocks with defensive leanings have been solid performers for the bulk of this year, but UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) isn't a member of that group.The healthcare benefits giant gained 1.35% today, good for the best performance among Dow stocks, but the shares still finished August with a loss of more than 1.44%. The best-case scenario is that traders were doing some nibbling at UNH shares today in anticipation of a possible rally over the last four months of the year, but my prescription for caution here stems from a looming democratic debate in September, which could stir more Medicare For All talk. That's always a drag on UNH.Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) jumped 1.57% today, but this is another example of a dog Dow stock with fleas. Despite today's gain, this Dow stock also finished August with a loss of more than 7%.Two other Dow stocks that were winners today, each closing higher by about 1% that I'd be careful with are Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Dow (NYSE:DOW). These are both tariff-sensitive names that notched double-digit declines this month. Maybe trade talks will progress, providing catalysts for these type of cyclical stocks, but in absence of those headlines, investors considering Dow stocks of this nature are likely making no more than technical bets over the near-term. Defensive DeparturesAs I noted above, there were some bounces in defensive Dow stocks today while some similar names saw departures. Namely, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) were two of the blue chip index's worst-performing names today, each shedding more than 1%.Speculation here, but today's action in those stocks may have been nothing more than some profit taking because McDonald's and P&G posted an average August gain of 3.66%. Given September's reputation for being a rough month for stocks, it would not be surprising to see those Dow stocks do a little better next month. Dow Bottom LineWith all the talk about trade tensions and the Federal Reserve's plans for interest rates, investors should not take their eyes off the earnings ball. Unfortunately, the news isn't so hot to this point in the the third quarter.&quot;During the first two months of the third quarter, analysts lowered earnings estimates for companies in the S&P 500 for the quarter,&quot; according to FactSet. &quot;The Q3 bottom-up EPS estimate (which is an aggregation of the median EPS estimates of all the companies in the index for the third quarter) dropped by 3.0% (to $41.64 from $42.90) during this period.&quot;On another note, investors looking for sector-level ideas for September may want to consider financial services and utilities, which on a historical basis, are the best-performing groups in the ninth month of the year.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

Instead, with recession worries renewed by another inversion of the two-year and ten-year yield curve, the S&P 500 fell 0.32% on Tuesday.Source: Shutterstock Altria Group (NYSE:MO) led the charge, falling another 4% as investors protested its reported plans to merge with rival Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). To that end, Philip Morris shares fell nearly 8%, albeit on lower volume, on the unpopularity of the idea among its shareholders.Yet, there were some winners. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) was one of them, up 5% after a very well-received opening of its first store in China.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow As for names worth a look headed into the midpoint of the trading week though, take a look at the stock charts of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). Here's what's most noteworthy. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)It has more to do with the broad market and the industry itself than it does with the company. Nevertheless, UnitedHealth Group shares -- already fighting a losing battle -- started to break down in a big way last week. Yesterday's 3.1% tumble underscored how easily UNH stock could be up-ended.While the stage is perhaps set for a short-term dead cat bounce, even a modest recovery effort wouldn't be enough to undo the bulk of the damage that has been done just since the middle of last month.  *   Click to EnlargeChief among the technical problems here is a break back under what had been a support level tagging most of the key low since late last year, plotted in red. April's dip was an exception.  * Also note that the convergence of all the key moving average lines in February and March has since turned into a divergence … a bearish one. The blue 20-day and purple 50-day moving average lines have since turned into technical resistance as well (highlighted).  * It's a bit difficult to see in detail, but many of the daily selloffs since the middle of July have been on high volume. That bearish volume has been persistently above average the past few days. eBay (EBAY)In the middle of last month, eBay was put under the trading microscope. After it punched through a technical ceiling just under $39 in June, a couple of very rough days were testing that level again as resistance.It ended up surviving, against the odds. But, that reprieve may have only been temporary. The bears took another shot early this month, and although EBAY stock bounced off the former ceiling near $39, the bears started to take another shot on Friday. The outlook is not encouraging for a couple of different reasons.  * The 10 Biggest Winners From Second-Quarter Earnings   *   Click to EnlargeSince the last look, the gray 100-day moving average line has stepped up as a support level, although it has yet to spark a clear rebound.  * It's only a mild concern at this point, but notice how the &quot;down&quot; volume bars since the middle of last week are starting to grow taller, and taller than the green &quot;up&quot; volume bars.  * If the support around $39 should fail, two potential landing spots are already clear. One of them is the white 200-day moving average line, currently at $35.66, and the other is the floor around $35.40, where eBay found support several times earlier in the year. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)Finally, it's not a name that's often analyzed from a charting or technical perspective. But, if Berkshire Hathaway is dropping technical hints, then it's dropping technical hints.And, that is what it's doing here. Although they're unsurprisingly subtle given the income-oriented nature of Buffett's portfolio, they're there, and they mean something. Indeed, given that Berkshire is a name preferred by the non-trader types, there's an argument to be made that the chart's shape tells us more about the changing viewpoint of the average investor than charts of more actively traded names. In this case, a big red flag is starting to wave.  *   Click to EnlargeIt's clear on both stock charts, but the perspective needed to fully appreciate the risk is more evident on the weekly chart. That is, BRK.B stock has already logged a string of lower highs, and is testing a major floor right around $198.  * It would be easy to miss in the entanglement, but all four key moving average lines are now sloped downward. It's a subtle clue that the momentum has taken a turn for the worst in all timeframes.  * Berkshire Hathaway will most likely move in the same direction as the broad market, and if that's lower, the next likely landing point is the line that connects the key lows from last year, plotted in yellow, just under $190.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

When the closing bell sounded the Nasdaq Composite was lower by 0.34% while the S&P 500 closed down by 0.32%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.47%. In late trading, just 11, or barely more than a third, of the Dow's 30 components were in the green.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow An interesting fact, courtesy of the ETF Research Center: the price-to-earnings ratio on the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA), the Dow tracking ETF, currently resides in an area that was seen following the fourth-quarter 2018 and May 2019 declines, which eventually gave way to equity market rallies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Healthcare CheckupAs I mentioned yesterday, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was waiting on a ruling from an Oklahoma judge in the opioid case. That ruling was publicized late Monday and Dow components JNJ is on the hook for more than $572 million, a mere penance for an almost-$347 billion company that generates as much free cash as JNJ does. So shares of JNJ jumped 1.44% today, but one analyst indicated investors may not be paying attention to the fine print.&quot;J&J held a 1% market share of Oklahoma's opioid market, far less than Purdue and Teva, which settled for $270m and $85m, respectively,&quot; said Berenberg Capital Markets analyst Patrick Trucchio. &quot;Thus, to us, the $572m judgment is very bearish; if it holds on appeal, it could put a bear case scenario of $150bn of litigation liabilities for all opioid players…in all tracks (i.e., states, federal MDL, DOJ…in play.&quot;UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) remains a dog among Dow healthcare stocks as highlighted by today's slide of 3.57%. I've noted multiple times this year that UNH has been plagued by political concerns, meaning the Medicare For All debate, but the stock's woes are mounting outside of the political arena.&quot;A July hospital survey from JPMorgan last week has heightened concerns about insurers' spending on patients' medical claims in the third quarter. Anthem Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Centene Corp. were among the companies that flagged rising costs in the past quarter,&quot; according to Bloomberg.And to make matters worse, the next round of Democratic debates is just a few weeks away, so at a time when UNH should be steady due to its defensive posture, the shares are under siege on multiple fronts. Grounded For TodayShares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) have recently been hot, but the stock lost 1.19% today, which was mostly the symptom of broader market declines, not a lawsuit out of Russia that, justifiably so, did not unnerve investors.&quot;Avia Capital Services, a subsidiary of state-owned Russian conglomerate Rostec, is suing Boeing to cancel 737 MAX orders,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;Avia isn't listed specifically in Boeing's commercial orders database, probably because it is classified as a lessor or an unidentified client. Boeing had no comment on the lawsuit.&quot;Russia is a minor market for Boeing, and the thing for Boeing investors to focus on over the near-term isn't Russia, but the company's progress on getting the 737 MAX airborne again before the end of 2019. Apple AnglesShares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined 0.71% amid reports that Huawei Technologies took some smartphone market share from the iPhone maker in China due to &quot;nationalistic buying&quot; attributable to the U.S.-China trade war.Still, many market participants remain bullish on Apple with some technical analysts saying if the stock moves through the $215 area, upside from there could be significant. Bottom Line on Dow JonesUnderscoring the still defensive tone to the market this month, gold is getting more and more attention, though the yellow metal was mostly sluggish today.&quot;The surge in demand for gold comes as global market uncertainty has risen in response to the imposition of new U.S. sanctions on Iran as well as growing certainty of more Fed rate hikes this year,&quot; according to FactSet. &quot;Expectations of lower long-term interest rates and the resulting weaker dollar are both contributing to gold's strength.&quot;Adding to the allure of defensive positions is growing concern that the German economy, the Eurozone's largest, is nearing or in a recession. On a related note, the second reading of the U.S. second-quarter GDP number is due out Thursday.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

Anthem Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Centene Corp. were among the companies that flagged rising costs in the past quarter,” according to Bloomberg.

2019-08-22	2019-08-22 20:10:22	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Data Dependency Emerges	It is often said the Federal Reserve is &quot;data dependent&quot; in its quest to accurately calibrate U.S. monetary policy. With that in mind, it may be surprising the major equity benchmarks did not do more gyrating Thursday following the release of one particularly concerning data point.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com Earlier today, the August reading of the Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index check in at 49.9, the first reading below 50 in about a decade. Readings below 50 are generally considered negative, particularly if they are accrued in consecutive months. That hasn't happened yet, but this is a data point that should not be ignored.As has been widely noted, the Fed expects to take appropriate measures if the U.S. economy shows signs of wilting. With yesterday's release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), it looked like some Fed members want large rate cuts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More However, that thesis may have been a short-term blow today as President of the Philadelphia Fed Patrick Harker said he doesn't believe more monetary stimulus is needed, while Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George said she sees the U.S. economy as still on solid ground.Even with all that Fed speak, the Nasdaq Composite lost just 0.36% while the S&P 500 dropped 0.05%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average mustered a gain of 0.19%. Big Boeing BounceIn what is certainly good news because it is the largest Dow stock, frequent guest of this space Boeing (NYSE:BA) surged 4.25% on above-average volume on news that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is planning to run software tests for Boeing's 737 MAX passenger jet with newer pilots as soon as next month.The tests are expected to involved pilots with around a year of flight time. Obviously, the results of those tests remain to be seen, but the news is the latest sign that Boeing may be able to meet investors' expectations that the 737 MAX could be back in the air sometime before the end of 2019.&quot;As part of its own testing process Boeing has invited senior U.S. airline pilots to experiment with the software fix and use simulators to run scenarios similar to the ones that led to the two crashes,&quot; according to Reuters.Boeing is also attempting to fill hundreds of temporary jobs aimed at getting the 737 MAX back in the skies in the fourth quarter. Apple NewsIn late trading, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was clinging to a modest gain. The company is just a few weeks away from its annual refresh of critical products, including the iPhone. Today, rumors circulated that Apple could unveil as many as three new iPhones next month as well as unveil significant upgrades to the iPad and its most popular laptops.&quot;Also coming in 2019: refreshed versions of the iPad Pro with upgraded cameras and faster chips, an entry-level iPad with a larger screen, new versions of the Apple Watch, and the first revamp to the MacBook Pro laptop in three years,&quot; Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.At the upcoming Apple event, investors will also likely be demanding clues and updates about Apple's streaming entertainment effort, Apple+. Dow DogsAmong the worst of the day's Dow offenders today was UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH). Weakness in UNH shares today wasn't a symptom of healthcare weakness because the Dow's three other healthcare components traded slightly higher. I don't like to speculate, but UNH slumped a day after the requirements for the next round of Democratic debates were released. Good news for UNH: supporters of Medicare For All are growing mum.Chemicals maker Dow (NYSE:DOW) continues to be a dog with fleas. Read more about that condition as it pertains to the stock here. Today, the stock lost 2.74% after 20 mayors in France announced a ban on glyphosate, a weed killer that dozens of companies, including Dow, sell around the world. Bottom Line on the DowIt's all about data right now. That and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech from Jackson Hole tomorrow. I've frequently mentioned the importance of the consumer in this space and there are now inklings that there is some softness on that front. Should that weakness persist, the Fed governors mentioned above may have no choice but to get on board with more rate cuts.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-21	2019-08-21 17:10:28	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Is UnitedHealth Stock’s Dividend Worth the Hassle for Investors?	UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) is the largest healthcare company in the world by revenue. That may sound pretty impressive, and with 130 million customers, it is. But, remember that most industrialized nations don't rely on employer-provided healthcare or supplemental Medicare insurance.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com So, while the &quot;world's largest&quot; moniker is impressive, it really means it's the largest in the United States. And nowadays, it's hard to figure out if that's a curse or a blessing.There's no doubt that the 2020 election is all about whether the Democrats will actually run a candidate that will support a Medicare-for-all or single-payer system. But even if they do, it's likely that the U.S. will find a way to keep private insurers in business, simply because they employ so many people. And the transition to a new system would take a while.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRegardless of the details, it's obvious that something has to be done about the current healthcare situation. The Republican Party has yet to present a plan on how to replace the Affordable Care Act and it doesn't seem like Congress is doing much of anything about anything. And the president can't simply sign an executive order changing the entire healthcare system.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential All this has caused a certain consternation in the industry.You see, regardless of what happens, the companies in the healthcare sector simply need a clear understanding of where they stand so they can pursue the most efficient and effective ways to be profitable. As the old saying goes, the markets hate uncertainty. And that is exactly where this sector is right now. There are no ideas and there is no progress, so these stocks sit. The Bottom Line on UNH StockFor UNH, a good example is its Optum unit, which was a powerful profit center a couple years ago. This division managed outpatient clinics, had relationships with the major pharmacy benefit managers and was doing deals left and right.But now, there's less visibility on how best to grow, and the previous growth isn't enough to sustain UNH investors' imagination.As for UNH stock's dividend, given all the other sectors that are actually moving in a positive direction and delivering much better dividends -- real estate, financials, consumer goods -- UNH's wimpy but rock-solid 1.8% isn't much to get excited about. It's not like this dividend has been diminished because the stock has been on fire. For most companies, a rising stock price means a lower dividend yield.UNH stock is off 2% year-to-date and just over 8% in the past 12 months.My Portfolio Grader rates UNH stock a &quot;C&quot; at this point. That's a hold. There are much better sectors that have stronger growth potential. If you own the stock, it's not going to hurt you, but it's not going to help you much right now either.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-08-20	2019-08-20 19:11:01	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Healthcare Stocks to Trade: UNH, JNJ and PFE	Even under normal circumstances, the healthcare stocks are prone to headline risk. Case in point, what happened to Sarepta (NASDAQ:SRPT) last night when the stock fell 15% on FDA news. Add to it that the U.S. is approaching another round of elections, and it makes healthcare stocks even riskier than normal -- through no fault of their own.In late June, I discussed three healthcare stocks to buy and for the most part the trades paid quickly. But since then, the stock markets in general had several mini corrections. We had fear flashes over geopolitical headlines, China's currency crisis and most recently, a bond-yield crash. So it's only fair to revisit those names again as the dust is settling.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential So today we are discussing United Health (NYSE:UNH), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stocks. I'll start with my conclusion first. All three are still good stocks to buy at these levels -- but for different reasons.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Johnson & Johnson is a long-time American success story. They are a global household name and their products are ubiquitous. From a valuation perspective, JNJ stock is relatively cheap because it has a modest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and pays a decent dividend.JNJ could be cheaper, but this is a management team that has proven itself through thousands of headline worries. The current headlines are nothing new for JNJ. So they have nothing but a temporary effect on the overall trajectory of JNJ stock.That said, Johnson & Johnson is still a buy here for anyone who's looking to add this sector to their portfolio. It is important to note that the company is probably past its talcum-powder headline risk by now even though it's not officially resolved. So I wouldn't take a full position all at once. Alternatively, I can sell puts below the current JNJ stock price to generate income from the intrinsic value of JNJ stock this way I don't even need a rally to win. United Health (UNH)United Health stock has performed the best of the three healthcare stocks since my last write up. It had an immediate 9% spike so from a trading perspective that was good timing.In addition, the overall thesis on UNH stock since then has not changed. It is still trailing the S&P 500 year-to-date. But over the last five years, UNH stock is up 180%, which is four times better than the S&P.After the July spike, UNH stock price faded the rally, but is has fallen into the same support zone from which it broke out. So this is the opportunity for the bulls to rinse-and-repeat another run.Technically speaking, UNH range is tightening into a point, so a move is coming in either direction. It is setting lower-highs and higher-lows at a point that coincides with the 12 month point-of- control for the stock. This is significant because this is literally where bulls and bears have agreed the most.So they will fight it out hard at this price once more and create support. As long as UNH stock holds above $240 per share, the bulls have a shot at retesting $260 or higher. There will be resistance along the way perhaps at $255 and most certainly at $256.50.  * 10 Mid-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Conversely, there is the threat that the bears are able to break below $240 per share. If that happens, it could turn into a bearish head-and-shoulder pattern to target $224 per share. This is not a forecast but it's definitely a scenario that exists currently below UNH stock price. Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer stock was once bulletproof, but it can't even find footing of late. But maybe this time will be different. From current levels Pfizer stock can mount a revenge rally. Clearly so far, its stock performance metrics are poor so this has a lot of hopium tied to it.So this is definitely a tactical trade, and it should have a hard stop below $34 per share. This inadvertently is also a long-term five-year-old pivot point that also happens to be the point of control for that same period. So mathematically speaking, this is where bulls and bears love to disagree. This congestion should act as support.Simply put, if I buy PFE stock here, I literally have more upside potential than downside risk based on the 5-year price history. Fundamentally speaking, PFE is not expensive selling at 17 P/E and three times book. Yes, it can get cheaper, but this trade set up is tactical, so fundamentals don't matter as much for the short term.Longer-term, the Pfizer management team needs to re-earn Wall Street trust so that trades like this one would be with conviction. Maybe then the bulls will be able to drag the PFE stock out of the dumps and back in line with the overall stock market or at least its sector.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-08-15	2019-08-15 15:05:31	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Reasons to Park Tesla Stock and Leave	Up until fairly recently, I used to be a big fan of Elon Musk and his vaunted company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, a series of unnecessary controversies and unforced errors made me change my opinion. Granted, I still think the man is a genius. However, I wanted to avoid the coming train wreck in TSLA stock.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com And man, was that ever the right decision. Year-to-date, Tesla stock is down more than 28%. Of course, this figure includes the effect of June and July's sympathy rally in TSLA. Without it, shares would have shed closer to 40%.For the bears, I say &quot;never say never.&quot; In my opinion, TSLA stock is on the verge of falling into an overwhelmingly negative ecosystem. From internal troubles to external headwinds, Tesla is about to face an unprecedented series of challenges.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere are three reasons to avoid Tesla stock (unless you want to short it): Recession Cuts Two Ways for TSLA StockOn Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered an 800-point drop, the worst day of 2019 so far. Since no publicly traded company operates in a vacuum, virtually all stocks tanked. Even companies like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) which has no exposure in China dipped severely. This drew fears of a coming recession.Logically, then, it wasn't a good day for Tesla stock, which does have exposure in China. In fact, before the U.S.-China trade war escalated in the past few weeks, TSLA was making an aggressive push toward dominating the electric vehicle market share in China.  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall You can say those plans got scuttled.But that's only the headline headwind. The other swing of the blade comes from a possible recession's associated risks. Primarily, I'm talking about oil prices. During the midweek session, the international oil benchmark Brent crude dropped more than 3% on weak global economic data.That's a massive problem for TSLA stock because it takes away the EV's principal selling point: eliminating pain at the pump.Thus, if we head into a recession, don't expect consumers to jump on EVs. By the way, Tesla's cars aren't that reliable, taking away another selling point and adding troubles to TSLA stock. Tesla Stock Could Get 'ICE-d'I believe most economists agree that we're headed toward at least a market correction, if not a recession. Given that we're on the longest bull market ever, I think that's a reasonable forecast.But let's say that we don't have a recession for whatever reason. Maybe President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping engage in a &quot;Titanic&quot;-like bromance. Or maybe the Federal Reserve finally found the magic formula to quantitative easing.Would an extension of the bull market save Tesla stock? I highly doubt it because of the competition.As I argued last month, we're living in the golden age of the internal combustion engine, or &quot;ICE&quot; for short. While fossil-fueled cars are archaic compared to EVs, they offer astounding conveniences and performance at a great price.Previously, I used the example of a Toyota's (NYSE:TM) popular Camry: It's practical, sporty, reliable and affordable. Also, I think it's good looking. But the point is, modern ICE cars are combining so many attributes under one umbrella. On the other hand, because EVs represent relatively new technologies, they lack ICE cars' consumer friendliness.As an aside, consider General Motors' (NYSE:GM) 2020 Corvette. A mid-engine beast that resembles an Italian exotic, GM made the shocking announcement of selling their flagship for only $60,000. Who'd buy an EV under such an aggressive pricing environment?The innovation in ICE cars is bad news for TSLA stock. Same Old TeslaFinally, let's discuss the third reason to avoid TSLA stock: We're still dealing with the same old Tesla. Specifically, the company loves to overpromise and underdeliver.This has been a criticism that has dogged the company for years. Usually, this has revolved around car deliveries. But recently, the bearish assessment extends to product features, such as automated driving.In the past, Wall Street gave Tesla stock substantial leeway. After all, EVs represented an exciting new technology. And while traditional automakers forwarded ugly or otherwise uninspiring hybrids, Tesla cars were undeniably gorgeous. Stated differently, Tesla did EVs right.But the honeymoon phase is over. The Street wants to see hard numbers to back up the premium in TSLA stock. They also want Musk to stop making unnecessary errors and start taking his business seriously.Of course, some of the bullish arguments rest on the company doing exactly that. But for me, I'm going to read between the lines.As you likely know, Tesla has experienced a mass exodus of key executives. Most recently, chief technology officer JB Straubel stepped down from his post.You've got to wonder what's going on at Tesla. Executives at these types of organizations are overpaid and underworked. So it must take something extraordinary for them to give up such great money. Whatever the case, it's probably not conducive for TSLA stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-13	2019-08-13 20:13:47	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: It Was a Good Day…Finally	For what seems like the first time in an eternity, stocks enjoyed a good day Tuesday. Much of that had to do with President Donald Trump pledging to back off of threats to levy fresh tariffs on Chinese imports starting next month.Citing &quot;health, safety, national security and other factors,&quot; the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) said that new tariffs on certain consumer-related items would be delayed until mid-December. That announcement came as officials from the U.S. and China, the warring factions in the trade spat, agreed to hold talks again in a couple of weeks.&quot;Separately, China's Commerce Ministry said Vice Premier Liu He had spoken by phone with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lightizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and they agreed to talk again in two weeks,&quot; according to CNBC.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now As recent history shows, trade talks between the U.S. and China can turn on a dime, but at least for today, the news was good and that was enough to send the Nasdaq Composite higher 1.95% while the S&P 500 rose 1.47%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on 1.44%.Something that has not been said here very often in recent weeks: in late trading, all 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average were in the green. Tech Tops the DowSince stocks rallied due to trade news, it is not surprising that tariff-sensitive technology stocks were among Tuesday's big winners, including Dow components Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which added 4.23% and 2.72%, respectively.&quot;Further, as part of USTR's public comment and hearing process, it was determined that the tariff should be delayed to December 15 for certain article,&quot; said the USTR. &quot;Products in this group include, for example, cell phones, laptop computers, video game consoles, certain toys, computer monitors, and certain items of footwear and clothing.&quot;That list includes several products that Apple makes and Intel has some exposure to. So while today's pops in those names wasn't surprising, the moves higher were nonetheless embraced by investors.Not to be a downer, but this is an appropriate time to remind readers of just how sensitive technology stocks, including Apple, are to trade tiffs. You've probably experienced that phenomenon first hand this year, and data confirm the sector's export-heavy tendencies. In a note out today, S&P Dow Jones said S&P 500 technology companies got just over 58% of their 2018 sales from ex-U.S. markets, well above the 42.90% rate for the S&P 500 overall. More Dow WinnersAhead of Thursday's earnings reports Walmart (NYSE:WMT) jumped 2.21% today, but this was a tariff sympathy play. Looking at the list of items mentioned by the USTR, Walmart sells all of those things and the largest U.S. retailer hawks plenty of goods made in China.If the positive trade vibes stick, that is meaningful for Walmart ahead of the holiday shopping season because the company is a major seller of computers, toys, and video game-related fare. Additionally, many Walmart shoppers are price-sensitive. The idea of the retailer having to pass on tariff costs to consumers is largely viewed as unappealing to investors.Athletic apparel giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) gained 1.67% today. Again, this is a pretty simple scenario to explain: the USTR list mentioned &quot;certain items of footwear and clothing&quot; and Nike certainly makes &quot;certain&quot; clothing and footwear items. Bottom Line: Broad-Based Strength on the DowI'm fond of saying in this space that investors should not get too caught up in the gyrations of a single trading day, no matter how good or bad. However, another bright spot to consider is how broad the strength was.What I'm getting at is, plenty of Dow stocks that are not tariff-sensitive joined Tuesday's party. For example, all of the index's financial services names finished in the green while UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), a company with essentially no China exposure, surged 2.50% to finish as the third-best Dow performer behind Apple and Intel. Indeed, that's a positive sign.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-11	2019-08-11 11:01:15	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 High-Yield Dividends to Boost Returns	The Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the first time since 2008, ending a decade-long hands-off approach to monetary policy. While Fed chair Jerome Powell explicitly stated that this move is a one-off and does not herald a new round of cuts, most market watchers are predicting at least one more cut before the end of the year. At the same time, bond yields are at historic lows – the US 10-year Treasury note is below 1.6%, the 30-year note is near its all-time low, and the UK 10-year bond is below 0.5%. It’s a difficult minefield for return-conscious investors to navigate.Which makes dividend stocks a natural choice. Public companies are not bound to the prevailing interest rates, and so even in times of high rates stock returns can outpace bonds. In today’s low-rate environment, stocks – and especially dividend stocks – are an investor’s best choice for a strong return. And since investing is all about profits and returns, let’s take a look at three stocks that offer high returns through premium dividends. AT&T, Inc. (T)The modern incarnation of Ma Bell, AT&T has long been one of the market’s best dividend stocks. While the payout is modest, at $2.04 per share annually, the yield, currently at 5.9%, puts T among the top-ten highest-yielding dividends in the S&P 500.The high-yielding dividend isn’t the only attraction here – T shares have been on an upward trend for the past six months, gaining over 20% since early-February. In its recent Q2 earnings report, AT&T disclosed 89 cents EPS on $45 billion in revenues, meeting expectations despite a slide in DirecTV subscriptions. In the words of CEO Randall Stephenson, “We’re halfway through the year and on track to deliver on all our 2019 priorities. We continue to pay down debt and are more confident than ever that we’ll meet our yearend deleveraging goal, and we’ll look at buying back stock.”AT&T shares currently sell for $34.54 and hold a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 7 buy and 2 hold rating given in the past three months. The average price target of $36.14 implies a modest upside potential of 4.6% for the stock.Cowen’s Colby Synesael (a 5-star analyst according to TipRanks) reviewed T after the earnings report, and raised his price target 17% to $40. He said, “The company met or beat revenue/EBITDA for each segment except International versus our estimates. The company is on pace to meet or exceed its 2019 guidance.” Synesael’s price target suggests an upside of 15% for AT&T shares. Boeing Company (BA)It’s no secret that Boeing has taken a hard hit recently, as the company reported its largest-ever quarterly loss last month, of $2.9 billion. The losses come as the company’s 737 MAX airliner – its best-selling narrow-body jet – remains grounded after the two recent fatal crashes. With the grounding going on four months now, Boeing was forced to charge the costs – slower production lines and missed deliveries – on its quarterly report. The company reported 104 fewer aircraft deliveries in Q2 2019 compared to the year-ago quarter.The news wasn’t all bad for Boeing and its investors, however. Boeing’s services business posted a $400 million revenue increase, while the defense segment gained $6.6 billion for the quarter. The company bid successfully on several Pentagon contracts, and the F/A-18 family of fighter jets remains in production.Despite earnings loss, Boeing shares remain a strong investment. The company has proven resilient over the years, and has a reputation for consistently rewarding its shareholders with a lucrative dividend. The yield is modest at 2.44%, but the high share price boosts the annual payout to $8.22. Boeing has been consistently raising the dividend payout for the last decade.Boeing remains a Strong Buy according to the analyst consensus. Even with the serious headwinds it has been facing this year, BA shares have received 12 buy and 4 hold ratings in recent months. Shares are priced at $337, but the average price target of $432 indicates that Wall Street’s analysts see the current trading level as too low. The upside potential is 28%, especially impressive given the high price of the shares.Writing from Vertical Research Partners, Robert Stallard (a 5-star analyst) noted, “In terms of the numbers, 2Q was actually better than what we had conservatively modelled for Boeing… there remains considerable uncertainty in the estimates going forward, as there are no doubt many different assumptions regarding the MAX and its return to action.” Stallard set a $413 price target on the stock, lightly lower than the average, but still suggesting a 22% upside. UnitedHealth Group, Inc. (UNH)UnitedHealth is the world’s largest provider of health insurance, by any measure. The company posted over $226 billion revenues in 2018, and serves over 115 million customers. It’s a giant, in a giant industry. UNH has also used that revenue stream to pay back shareholders, steadily increasing the dividend since 2010. The payout is now $4.32 per year ($1.08 quarterly), on a yield of 1.74%.In addition to the high dividend, UNH also offers investors a solidly profitable business. The company reported Q2 earnings in the middle of July, and beat the EPS estimate by 3.6%, showing $3.73 per share.Steven Halper (a 5-star analyst) from Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated his buy rating on the stock after the earnings report, saying, “We continue to believe UNH is attractively positioned given its integrated model and consistent execution.” Halper gives UNH a $310 price target, indicating an upside of 24%.Overall, UNH is another Strong Buy on the analyst consensus, based on 9 buys and 1 hold from the last three months. The stock’s shares sell for $248, so the average price target of $303 suggests an upside potential of 22%.Visit TipRanks to find out what Wall Street’s best analysts are saying about today’s Trending Stocks.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-high-yield-dividends-boost-110115774.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-09	2019-08-09 19:03:10	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Start Comparing CVS Stock to UnitedHealth	CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) stock is getting results combining the health insurance income of Aetna with the outgo of its pharmacies and health services.Source: Shutterstock The proof came in its second-quarter earnings report, with adjusted net income of $4 billion, $1.89 earnings per share and adjusted revenue of $63.4 billion. Same store sales were up 4.2%, pharmacy market share was up 1.2% at 26.6% and the company generated $5.3 billion in operating cash flow.The results put CVS stock in another league. Stop comparing it to Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), which saw falling earnings on $34.6 billion of revenue.  Instead, compare it to UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), which earned $3.3 billion, $3.60 per share fully adjusted, on revenue of $60.6 billion in its most recent quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What The CVS stock results &quot;demolished&quot; Wall Street expectations but should not have been a surprise. CVS vs. UnitedHealthIt has been a long time since any health insurer could go toe-to-toe with UnitedHealth. The company has spent 15 years installing technology through its Optum unit, integrating the former Catamaran pharmacy benefit manager. It is by far the largest player in the health insurance industry, with almost 13% of all premiums.UnitedHealth's size, and the cost control it generates, have also benefited investors. The shares are up over 200% over the last five years, while CVS has fallen in value by 25%. But Aetna, one of the companies that had fallen behind, merged with CVS pharmacies -- and therefore with Caremark, CVS' pharmacy benefits manager -- gaining low-cost facilities to create a second large player.CVS Health is now going to start capitalizing on that synergy by expanding its home dialysis service, creating an Amazon-like membership service called CarePass and continuing to open stores while Walgreens cuts back.I have been pounding the table for the potential of this merger for some time. That's because combining pharmacy facilities with insurance is the best way for the private market to generate cost control. My model here has been Centene (NYSE:CNC), whose combination of premium income and facilities lets it turn a profit even on Medicare and Medicaid contracts. What Business WantsPoliticians debate whether a public plan or one with private options can bring cost control. The market is saying whoever holds the money must be able to control how it is spent.That's what UnitedHealth and Centene have, and what CVS Health is gaining. About 75% of a health plan's cost relates to chronic conditions, preventable things like heart disease, kidney failure and diabetes. Having control of the facilities, making sure people take their medicine and keeping people out of the hospital is the key to reducing costs.All players in the healthcare game know this. That's why drug companies are desperate to keep even Medicare from bargaining for lower prices. That's why hospitals fear the CVS-Aetna merger. The &quot;front door&quot; to care in the past has always been a doctor or hospital. CVS is making it your local pharmacy. The Bottom Line on CVS StockUnitedHealth has three times the market cap of CVS, even though CVS now brings in more revenue.CVS' integration with Aetna is still in its early stages, and it's already showing it can deliver fatter margins than UnitedHealth.All healthcare stocks will remain under pressure as the political debate continues. CVS Health already has a 50-cent-per-share dividend yielding 3.4%. Its dividend yield is better than UnitedHealth's $1.08 per share dividend, yielding 1.76%.The result of the political debate is going to be a managed care model, combining income with outgo.

2019-08-01	2019-08-01 08:45:39	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	5 Hot Stocks to Buy After Fed Rate Cut	So there we have it. As expected, the Federal Reserve has now cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in a decade. Specifically, the Fed made a ‘mid-cycle adjustment to policy’ by trimming rates a quarter point to 2%-2.25%. However, this more hawkish language sparked fears that the Fed was not planning to embark on an aggressive rate cutting regime.  And this uncertainty sent the S&P 500 falling by as much as 1.8%. Similarly, both the tech-heavy Nasdaq index closed the day down 1.19%, as did the Dow Jones (down 1.23%). “It was a very confusing and muddled message, and I don’t think that Powell delivered clear direction for what the near term path of additional Fed easing will be, and I think that’s why the market reacted negatively,” Mark Cabana, head of US short rate strategy at Merrill Lynch told CNBC.Indeed, Chairman Jerome Powell later moved to reassure investors. At the press conference he said: “Let me be clear: What I said was it’s not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts… I didn’t say it’s just one or anything like that. When you think about rate-cutting cycles, they go on for a long time and the committee’s not seeing that. Not seeing us in that place. You would do that if you saw real economic weakness and you thought that the federal funds rate needed to be cut a lot. That’s not what we’re seeing.”So which stocks should investors snap up now to take advantage of the current pullback? Let’s take a closer look at some of the Street’s top picks now. As you will see these five stocks show a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus from the Street. That’s based on the all ratings received by each stock over the last three months: Microsoft (MSFT)Microsoft dropped 3% on July 31. It is now trading down 3.16% on a five-day basis. Analysts are extremely bullish on the software giant right now. In the last three months, the stock has received 22 buy ratings vs just 1 hold rating and 1 sell rating. Meanwhile the average price target stands at $154 (13% upside potential). RBC Capital’s Matthew Hedberg bumped up his MSFT price target from $136 to $153 following the company’s stellar earnings results. Revenue of $33.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year (Y/Y), easily beat the consensus estimate of $32.7B (+9%). Hedberg cited impressive commercial bookings growth strength (+22% Y/Y) driven by larger, longer-term contracts and significant improvement in Azure gross margins.“Multi-year growth engines of O365 and Azure continue to show fundamental strength, and margin expansion across Commercial Cloud is continuing with scale and execution” cheered the analyst.  Amazon (AMZN)E-commerce king Amazon is trading down 7% on a five-day basis. That’s with a 2% drop on July 31. Shares are falling not just due to the Fed rate cut, but also in the wake of Amazon’s earnings upset. However, all 29 analysts polled are bullish on AMZN’s prospects- suggesting now is the perfect time to buy on the dip. Indeed the $2,281 average analyst price target suggests sizable upside potential of 22%AMZN reported strong Q2 and year-over-year sales gains coming in above trend and greater than Street consensus expectations. However, a significant incremental investment to increase delivery speed and supply chain improvements caused a shortfall in earnings.“We view the recent weakness as a buying opportunity as Amazon continues to exhibit its ability to leverage its advanced technology infrastructure to drive new industry verticals and incremental sales growth” wrote five-star Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth on July 30. “The strong results come as Amazon continues to invest in its warehouse delivery infrastructure as part of its plan to make one-day shipping standard for Prime members” he added.  Visa (V)Now is the time to snap up Visa Inc- which has a very positive outlook according to the Street. On the back of strong earnings, the stock is trading up 35% year-to-date. However, in the last five days we see a 3% pullback, with a 2% drop on July 31. Visa’s fiscal third quarter earnings report beat on both profit and revenue- leading to a wave of bullish Street sentiment. Currently the stock displays a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus with 18 buy ratings and just 1 hold rating. Its average analyst price target works out at $199 (12% upside potential). For instance, SunTrust Robinson analyst Andrew Jeffrey reiterated a buy rating on V with a $205 price target. He describes Visa as &quot;a core holding&quot; and &quot;the most valuable global payments asset.&quot; Most &quot;third-party wallets, e-commerce and mobile solutions ride Visa's rails,&quot; the analyst told investors.Meanwhile Nomura Instinet’s Bill Carcache believes Visa remains &quot;uniquely positioned&quot; to sustain mid-teens annual earnings growth despite an uncertain macro backdrop.  UnitedHealth (UNH)One of the US's largest insurance companies, UnitedHealth sold off 2% on rate-cut day. And even though the stock is now flat year-to-date, analysts are staying firmly bullish on UNH’s prospects. Out of ten analysts covering the stock, 9 rate UNH a buy. The average analyst price target is now at $303 (22% upside potential). Shares remain attractive says Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper. &quot;With Medicare for All noise subsiding, we believe Managed Care sentiment is improving. We continue to believe UNH is attractively positioned given its integrated model and consistent execution. Our price of $310 represents almost 20% upside from current levels&quot; the analyst wrote on July 19.Following the company’s solid earnings report, the analyst noted strong growth from both UnitedHealthcare (UHC) and Optum. Notably total Optum revenue grew 13.4% Y/Y, while UNH indicated that its outlook for Medicare Advantage remains &quot;exceptional&quot;. Comcast (CMCSA)Last but not least comes blue chip telecoms giant Comcast. The stock also saw a 2% selloff on the Fed news, bringing shares 4% lower on a five-day basis. Still, year-to-date gains work out at 27%- and the stock holds a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus from the Street. Indeed, all seven analysts polled rate CMCSA a buy right now.On the back of recent earnings, Rosenblatt’s Bernie McTernan hitched his price target slightly from $50 to $51, while maintaining his bullish call. The analyst stated, &quot;Strong results in 2Q19 and higher cable guidance reinforces our thesis on shares that broadband share gains will continue to drive growth and margin expansion despite a potentially worsening video environment as cord cutting appears on the rise following results from Comcast and AT&T.”“With a bright outlook for broadband revenue growth, Comcast is not as levered to cord cutting pressures as some other media peers... We are increasing our FCF estimates driven by a slightly higher EBITDA forecast and lower capex, this lifts our price target higher to $51 from $50&quot; he concluded.Discover the Street’s Best-Rated Trending Stocks now	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-hot-stocks-buy-fed-084539108.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-31	2019-07-31 20:17:27	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Fed Obliges, But Stocks Don’t Respond	In financial markets, there are disappointments, and then there are disappointments. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point today and set the stage for another rate cut later this year.Source: Shutterstock &quot;In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the committee decided to lower,&quot; said the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in a statement.Even with the benefit of the widely-anticipated rate cut, stocks tumbled with losses accelerating late in Wednesday's session. The Nasdaq Composite plunged 1.19% while the S&P 500 slid by 1.10%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.23% on the final trading day of July. All that after the Fed's first rate cut in more than a decade.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;As the committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,&quot; said the FOMC.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Invest in for August Adding to the Wednesday woes was that stocks tumbled followed a decent jobs data point. Earlier today, the ADP private payroll survey for July showed the addition of 156,000 private sector jobs this month, topping the estimate of 150,00. The July jobs report from the Labor Department is due out Friday before markets open.Let's look at some Dow winners, of which there were not many. An Apple Today …If not for shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which gained 2%, it'd be painful to imagine how bad the Dow's losses would be today. The iPhone reported impressive earnings for the June quarter, saying it earned $2.18 a share on revenue of $53.8 billion, ahead of estimates of earnings of $2.10 a share on sales of $53.39 billion.Apple also said up its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance to $61 billion to $64 billion. In the low end, that's slightly ahead of the $60.98 billion analysts are expecting. Both iPhone and services revenue for the most recently completed quarter missed estimates, but investors appeared more focused on the bullish revenue guidance.&quot;The iPhone accounted for 48.3% of Apple's overall revenue, the first time that it hasn't contributed over half of Apple's sales since 2012,&quot; according to CNBC.In late trading, just two other Dow stocks were in the green, but the gains paled in comparison to Apple and are hardly worth mentioning. Too Many Losers In the Dow TodayAmong the Dow's losers today, and there were plenty to pick from, were all of the index's financial services components, including Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). That was somewhat predictable given the belief that bank stocks benefit from higher interest rates.However, that conventional wisdom was probably dealt a blow last year when the sector struggled amid four rate hikes. Indicating that Wednesday's losses in bank stocks like JPM may be no more than knee-jerk reactions is increasing sentiment that some banks, including JPM, are poised to thrive as rates decline.After all, many of the largest domestic money center banks already warned on net interest margins on second-quarter earnings calls, so that should be baked into these stocks.Familiar face UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) slipped 2.32% today. Guess why? There was a Democratic presidential debate last night (another one tonight). I'm not making political commentary here. All viewpoints are welcome, but the fact remains that of the participants in the debate, the ones with better chances to emerge from the crowded field appear to favor some form of Medicare For All, while lower-tier candidates favor a more gradual approach to altering the healthcare system in the U.S.Either way, there's a good chance UnitedHealth makes another appearance here tomorrow. Dow Jones Today: Bottom LineWednesday's market action was very much a case of &quot;sell the news.&quot; With plenty of earnings reports still left and Friday's job number loom, near-term catalysts are in play. That could help riskier assets start August on a strong note. Investors looking for sector ideas in the eighth month of the year may want to consider tech and utilities, which historically perform well in August.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-25	2019-07-25 16:26:07	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	CVS Stock Bears Have Got It All Wrong	This year's bull market has passed by many notable companies. Just look CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) stock. It's gone from $65 to $56.Source: Shutterstock Yet this has not just been a temporary thing. Keep in mind that since 2015, CVS stock has been in a downtrend. The high was $113.65.But of course, the company has been transforming itself. No doubt, the biggest move was the $70 billion acquisition of Aetna, which closed in November 2018.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season So why the general bearishness?  Well, the pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business has been sluggish. Then there is the potential disruption from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has been investing more in the healthcare space. And as the Presidential election looms, there are concerns about the potential change of the health insurance industry; specifically to a Medicare-for-all approach.Yet I think the concerns for CVS stock have been already factored in. Note that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 8x and the dividend yield is a reasonable 3.6%. And while the debt load is at a hefty $65 billion, the company continues to churn out juicy cash flows. The Pros on CVS Health StockNow through the deal-making and restructuring, CVS is a diverse platform: the company generates revenue streams from pharmacy services, retail/LTC and healthcare benefits. All these businesses are highly synergistic.But more importantly, CVS is positioning itself to meet the dynamic changes in healthcare. First, there's the transition from sick care to self-care. Then we have the aging U.S. population, especially concerning the Baby Boomers, as well as the changes in reimbursement practices and business models. Finally, we're witnessing the transition to personalized care.All these changes require new approaches but also a major physical footprint.  As for CVS, the company is certainly nicely positioned.  There are close to 10,000 pharmacies across the U.S. In fact, 70% of U.S. population lives within three miles of a CVS location.The company also has been expanding its MinuteClinic locations (there are over 1,100). They provide roughly 80% of what a typical primary care practice does. Management is also expanding their scope to include more services, such as help with diet and nutrition. Consider that the locations have handled 42 million visits with a 95% customer rating.And of course, Aetna has made CVS a big player in the critical insurance market. The company now has 38 million members. These memberships include important categories like Medicare Advantage offerings and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans.The deal will also result in substantial cost savings that should help drive CVS Health stock. In fact, they are expected to hit $750 million within two years. Bottom Line on CVS StockOther mega health operators like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Cigna (NYSE:CI) are also transforming their businesses. It's all about building vertical platforms that allow for synergies, cost savings and better service.At the time when CVS closed its acquisition of Aetna, CEO Larry Merlo emphasized the shift in strategic vision. He stated that the combined company &quot;will have a community focus, engaging consumers with the care they need when and where they need it, will simplify a complicated system and will help people achieve better health at a lower cost.&quot;This is spot-on. True, the changes are risky and far from guaranteed. But then again, the company has so far been able to manage the moving parts, continues to be highly profitable and the shares are trading at value levels. In other words, for investors looking at an interesting play on healthcare, this one looks like a pretty good choice right now.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-07-24	2019-07-24 14:48:46	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Health Insurers Sink as Rising Spending Gauge Alarms Investors	(Bloomberg) -- Health-insurance stocks sank across the board after Anthem Inc. became the third insurer to report it is paying out a higher percentage of the premiums it takes in to cover patients’ medical claims.Investors watch the so-called medical-loss ratio reported by health insurers closely. The number is a key measure of the companies’ financial health; when the ratio goes up, it can suggest that money is leaving the companies faster than it is arriving. Other issues, such as changes in tax law, can also affect the ratio.Anthem shares fell as much as 7.4%, the biggest intraday drop in three months, after the company said on Wednesday that its medical-loss ratio had climbed to 86.7% in the second quarter, from 83.4% a year earlier. Analysts had expected a ratio of 85.7%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Over the past week, UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Centene Corp. also reported year-over-year increases of the measure. Shares of those companies sank by as much as 3.9% and 3.6%, respectively, on Wednesday.Shares of large health insurers -- many of which also operate large pharmacy-benefit management units -- had gained last week after the Trump administration dropped a plan to overhaul a rebate system often blamed for keeping drug prices elevated. The S&P 500 managed-care index is still up 17% since hitting a 52-week low on April 17.Anthem, UnitedHealth and Centene all reported otherwise favorable results, beating analysts’ estimates and raising their outlooks for the year.Tax ChangesAnthem, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield commercial plans in 14 states, said the increase in its medical-loss ratio was due to changes in a health insurance tax and dynamics in its Medicaid business in a handful of states. Anthem raised the low end of its 2019 guidance for the measure, which the company calls benefit expense ratio, to 86.2% to 86.5%.Anthem Chief Financial Officer John Gallina said the increase in the expense ratio didn’t reflect rising medical costs, but rather insufficient reimbursement from state Medicaid programs.“We have not stated that we’ve seen an increase in medical cost,” he told analysts on an earnings call Wednesday. “The premium reimbursements we are getting are not fully compensating us for the risk that we are taking,” he said.To contact the reporter on this story: John Tozzi in New York at jtozzi2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Drew Armstrong at darmstrong17@bloomberg.net, Timothy Annett, Mark SchoifetFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/health-insurers-sink-rising-spending-144846773.html?.tsrc=rss

With such huge gains, it's time to start thinking about what Dow Jones stocks to sell.As you'd expect, when the market as a whole rips so much, it sets up some great profit-taking opportunities in individual stocks out of the Dow Jones' 30 components.  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio From vulnerable healthcare stocks to overpriced consumer staples plays and more, here are five Dow Jones stocks to sell before the market slides again.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Stocks To Sell: Boeing (BA)It has been baffling watching Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock recently. You would have expected a massive correction in BA stock since several of the company's jets crashed, calling into question the safety of the Boeing Max line of jets.Instead, BA stock has been astoundingly resilient. This would be one thing if BA stock had already been cheap when the safety issues began. But no, BA stock wasn't cheap at all. It had just quadrupled in value since early 2016 and reached its highest P/E ratio in years in March.It seems that investors have forgotten that the airline industry is cyclical. Yes, oil prices are low right now. Airlines are making a lot of money for the moment. When airlines make huge profits, they order planes. In fact, they order too many planes. This cycle has happened every few years dating back to the 1960s. Yet investors seem to think this commercial aviation boom will go on forever. It won't.On the military side, yes, orders have been up. But analysts modeling this upturn in defense spending indefinitely will also be disappointed. What happens if and when the Republicans lose power in Washington? There's also the little matter that we have no idea how bad the issues will be from the Boeing Max situation. BA stock is still really expensive. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Shutterstock The chase for yield has investors rushing back into a lot of slow-growing defensive companies. The rationale makes sense on the surface. Lower interest rates mean that bonds are less attractive investments.Yet investors, especially retirees, still need current income. So they sell their bonds and other fixed income holdings to buy stocks with larger yields. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is one such popular stock.It's not hard to see the appeal of KO stock as a bond alternative. It yields more than U.S. Treasuries or bank CDs while offering a dividend that Coca-Cola has increased every year for decades on end.However, cracks are forming in Coca-Cola's growth and income story. Namely, there's hardly any growth.Soda sales have plunged in America and other developed markets. Emerging market growth has largely offset this so far, but there are limits to that. Soda sales may drop even more sharply going forward as more jurisdictions implement sugar taxes. As a result, Coca-Cola has hardly grown in recent years - it has taken on more debt and boosted its dividend payout ratio to keep the yield going up. That works for a while, but without organic growth, Coca-Cola's dividend stream will turn to a trickle over time.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) Based solely on earnings, for a slow (or at times no-) growth company like Coca-Cola, you'd rarely pay more than 20x earnings, if that. As such, it's hard to justify KO stock being worth more than $45 now. If you own KO stock solely for the dividend, it's a fine holding. But don't anticipate much, if anything, in the form of share price gains over the next year or two. McDonald's (MCD)One has to wonder if McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is about to launch CBD-infused burgers. Or perhaps a national Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) burger rollout. That is to say, investors are bidding up MCD stock like it's a hot craze, even though its business momentum is decidedly pedestrian at best.In fact, many of the company's franchisees have been complaining. All-day breakfast greatly increased complexity for operators and raised labor costs without doing much for overall revenues. McDonald's is also asking its franchisees to make extensive store overhauls even though the local operators haven't exactly been rolling in cash flow lately. Franchisees sent a harshly-worded letter around earlier this year demanding that:&quot;We can NOT afford the waste that a 'one size fits all' reinvestment program creates […] We must allow our owner operators to take back control of the reinvestment that is happening, stop the useless and problematic investing, and focus our reinvestment in what will actually produce a return on investment (drive thrus and kitchens).&quot;Over on Wall Street, however, no one seems worried about McDonald's questionable strategy in recent years. MCD stock is up 36% over the past 12 months and is up more than 22% year-to-date. This has led McDonald's to sport a bloated 28x P/E ratio. Investors are likely to get indigestion when they look back at paying more than $200 a share for MCD stock. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Source: Shutterstock If you watched the first Democratic presidential debate, you probably won't be too surprised by this pick. A sizable number of candidates, when asked if they would get rid of private for-profit health insurance, raised their hands in affirmation. The political world has moved a lot since 2016, when Bernie Sanders' suggestion of abolishing private health care seemed radical.Now, there's a decent chance that the eventual Democratic nominee will be pushing to outlaw or at least greatly curtail private insurance going forward. Would that nominee, if elected, be able to push legislation through what will likely still be a Republican Senate in 2021? Probably not.Still, do you want to own a private insurer like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) ahead of the election? Absolutely not. Even if you think the Republicans will keep the White House, think back to 2015.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Hillary Clinton went on the attack against Martin Shkreli and biotech firms for jacking up prescription drug prices. Biotech stocks collapsed shortly thereafter. Private health insurers are about as popular as nuclear waste dumps with a large portion of the electorate. With the presidential election still a year away, politicians have plenty of time to threaten and demonize firms like UnitedHealth. Sell this recent pop in UNH stock; it's toxic given the political environment. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Shutterstock On a similar note, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also exposes investors to a great deal of political risk ahead of the election. JNJ is a highly diversified business with many consumer care products that are (mostly) above reproach.But JNJ also sells a lot of prescription drugs, and both Trump and the Democrats are making loud noises about going after pricing, which would cut into JNJ's margins. Trump's efforts to curtail drug prices appear to be stalled for the time being. But make no mistake, the issue is a perfect one for politicians to use to drum up votes during election season.Johnson & Johnson also has its liability issue related to baby powder products which allegedly led to cancer. It is exposed to large verdicts against it related to this. Presumably JNJ will be able to reduce its liability greatly over time as cooler heads prevail, but for now, it's another big overhang on JNJ stock. If JNJ stock were cheaper, you could discount the political worries; it's a very strong and diversified company. But at this valuation, JNJ stock could easily have more downside before it bottoms.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned JNJ stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

2019-07-18	2019-07-18 14:02:00	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	UnitedHealth&apos;s stock slump exacts nearly 30-point toll on Dow industrials -- but IBM&apos;s rally caps loss	A decline in shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc.  Thursday morning was producing the most severe drag on the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average  in early action. Shares of UnitedHealth were down 1.8%, or about $4.75 lower at $261.90, translating to a roughly 30-point drag on the price-weighted Dow. The company&apos;s shares had hit a low of $257.26 near the open, representing a drag of about 50 points on the Dow. A $1 move in any one of its 30 components of the 123-year-old index equates to a 6.8-point swing. The Dow was down 18 points, or 0.1%, at 27,198. Capping the decline in the Dow was an advance in International Business Machines Corp., which was up 3.2%, delivering a roughly 30-point boost to the Dow. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index  was off 0.1% at 2,981, with a 0.2% decline for the Nasdaq Composite Index  to reach 8,170. The losses for UnitedHealth come even as the health insurer reported better-than-expected quarterly results and lifted its full-year earnings outlook to $13.95 to $14.15 a share, from its previous forecast of $13.80 to $14.05. Late Wednesday, International Business Machines Corp.&apos;s  quarterly results topped estimates.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3e6d52bd-c188-316d-b508-49e01d78528c/unitedhealth%26apos%3Bs-stock.html?.tsrc=rss

The earnings reports that were out today, though not from members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, were concerning.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBank of America (NYSE:BAC) echoed a refrain that we've been hearing a lot of during financial services reporting season: expect lower net interest margins.Adding to the concern, at least for industrial stocks, a bellwether sector due to its cyclical nature, was a roughly 10% plunge for railroad operator CSX (NASDAQ:CSX). That's a tumble that occurred on more than seven times the stock's average daily volume.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip CSX &quot;earned $1.08 in adjusted earnings per share from almost $3.1 billion in sales, about 2% worse than analysts predicted. Weak volumes were to blame. Shipments fell 4% year over year in the second quarter. What's more, CSX lowered its 2019 sales guidance and now expects revenue to fall about 1% this year,&quot; according to Barron's. Wednesday WinnersIn what could be an encouraging sign, some of the members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average that report earnings tomorrow were among the index's better-performing names today. For example, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) jumped 0.76%. The managed care provider delivers second-quarter results Thursday before the open of U.S. markets.Analysts are expecting earnings of $3.45 per share on revenue of $60.6 billion. UNH has endured its share of politically-charged struggles this year, but the shares have been on a torrid pace of late and enter the Thursday earnings report up more than 8% this month.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) lost 0.59% today. The software giant reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday as well with analysts expecting adjusted earnings per share of $1.21 on revenue of $32.8 billion.Much of the story here will revolve around Microsoft's comments on refreshing existing products, new offerings and the company's commentary on Azure, its booming cloud business. The stock is up nearly 36% year-to-date, good for one of the best showings among mature, mega-cap technology names.It wasn't one of the Dow winners today and it doesn't report earnings tomorrow, but Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a name worth discussing briefly. As an industrial stock and one of the larger ones at that, Caterpillar slumped 2.39% today, a decline largely tied to the aforementioned glum earnings report from CSX.Shares of Caterpillar could be boosted by an interest rate cut, any progress on the trade front with China and some market observers note the stock is attractively valued relative to other well-known industrial names. Bottom Line: Some HopeOne more thing to watch: International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), another member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, reports earnings after the bell today. The stock fell 0.31% in advance of that report. Wall Street is expecting earnings of $3.07 per share on revenue of $19.16 billion.In the good news category, this earnings season may prove to be better than previously expected if the reports revealed prior to Wednesday are accurate indicators.&quot;The earnings season began this week, with 43 S&P 500 companies reporting as of Wednesday morning, and a whopping 84% beating analysts' estimates,&quot; according to CNBC.Analysts were expecting an earnings contraction, but the reports to date indicate the S&P 500 will likely see a modest uptick in second-quarter profits.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-15	2019-07-15 11:40:13	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	CVS Stock Is a Buy as It Prepares to Take on Private Insurance	Since July of 2016 CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) has been a nightmare for investors. This time three years ago, CVS stock traded at a little more than $97, today it trades at something closer to $57.Source: Shutterstock Despite making what seemed like smart moves, like dropping cigarettes, converting to a health format, adding clinics, and buying Aetna, the stock has continued to sink.But analysts have suddenly warmed to CVS' story. In the last month, the shares are up 8%. On July 11 alone they rose 4.68%. Even at that price, CVS is still selling at a retailer's multiple of less than half its revenue.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's an illustration of the difference between the marketplace and the stock market. It's a great opportunity for investors with a long-term view.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond  Chronic Conditions and CVS StockAmerica spends 18% of its GDP on health care, but 75% of that is spent treating and monitoring chronic conditions. These are preventable diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and kidney disease.This is what CVS has been focused on. By delivering services as well as products through almost 10,000 stores, the company hopes to gain a bigger share of this $1.1 trillion bonanza. Preventing obesity, treating alcoholism and ending smoking could be worth trillions more.Analysts have been focusing on drugs, in the form of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its Pillpack service or CVS' Caremark Pharmacy Benefit Manager, but CVS has been diversifying away from the pure-intermediary model.Aetna alone brings 22 million insurance accounts to the party. If CVS' network can reduce the costs of covering those people, it can offer lower prices that increase that number. That's what its HealthHUB strategy is all about.Deliver the most common services and treatments from a storefront, add front-line clinics for primary care, of which CVS already has 1,100, and you have more cost control than any insurance rival. CVS hopes to turn 1,500 of its outlets into HealthHubs in the next two years. CVS Stock and the Real CompetitionCVS' rivals in this area aren't Amazon or even Walgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA). They're other insurers like United Healthcare (NYSE:UNH), which dominates the private insurance market and managed care companies like Centene (NYSE:CNC), which uses company-owned facilities to handle Medicare and Medicaid at a profit.Investors haven't credited any of CVS' moves for political reasons. Democrats talking about converting all health care to a publicly funded system makes them nervous. The possible end of Obamacare, pricing tens of millions out of the insurance market, also makes them nervous.But CVS' strategy can work in either case. If Democrats expand Medicare the companies that can cut costs fastest will benefit. If people are left without insurance, stores that offer the lowest-cost primary care and services grow. The Bottom Line on CVS StockIn its first-quarter report for 2020, delivered May 1, CVS earned $1.4 billion, $1.62 per share fully diluted, on revenues of $61.6 billion.  This is the first fiscal year that has begun since the Aetna deal closed. CVS raised earnings guidance for the full year. Its 50 cent per share dividend, with its fat 3.6% yield, is thus affordable.Because of its retail operation, CVS is the only insurer that can rival United Healthcare in size. That company's revenues for the first quarter were $60.3 billion. It has four times the market share of Aetna in private insurance.Most analysts consider United Healthcare the biggest winner in health care, but macro trends may be running against it. CVS stock is a winner for income investors right now, with that fat, affordable dividend.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-12	2019-07-12 12:23:19	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: HollyFrontier, Activision Blizzard and Vertex Pharmaceuticals	Another win for the market on Thursday, with the S&P 500 ending the session up 0.23% to finish the session at just a hair below 3,000. The volume grew once again on the third-straight daily gain, though it is still below average.Source: Shutterstock CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) ranked among the session's biggest winners, up 4.7% and 5.5%, respectively, after President Trump decided to not enact new rules that would stymie rebates on pharmaceutical purchases. At the other end of the spectrum, Merck (NYSE:MRK) led the losers on Thursday, as the President's move worried some that it could end up being pharmaceutical companies that bore the brunt of any cost-control initiatives. Merck shares ended the day down by 4.5%.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond Headed into the final trading day of the week, though, it's HollyFrontier (NYSE:HFC), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) that merit the closest looks from traders. Here's why, and what to look for.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)Vertex Pharmaceuticals is still technically in a long-term uptrend, guided higher by a rising support line that extends all the way back to late-2017. Although it has ebbed and flowed along the way, it has made higher highs and higher lows for some time now.The flavor of the advance changed in a fundamental way this year, however, and although it has been more erratic than not, current and prospective owners may want to note that the repeated bearish swings are taking a cumulative toll on the broad uptrend.  Click to Enlarge  * Chief among the changes in the timbre of the major rally is the fact that for the first time in several quarters, VRTX has logged a streak of lower highs. They're plotted in yellow on both stock charts.  * The long-term support line is marked with a dashed blue line on both charts.  * It's easy to look past in the wide swings we've seen since the beginning of 2018, but the most recent round of weakness has pulled the purple 50-day moving average line below the white 200-day line for the first time since mid-2018 (although that instance proved to be a great entry point). HollyFrontier (HFC)Late last month, HollyFrontier shares were able to punch through a long-standing falling resistance line, and proceed to test their 100-day moving average line, marked in gray on both stock charts. That test ultimately failed, sending HFC lower again. Shares only needed to take a small step back before renewing a much-needed running start. The second effort made a big dent on Thursday.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks With Critical Levels to Watch   Click to Enlarge  * The resistance line in question is marked in yellow on both stock charts. In retrospect, May's steep selloff served as the capitulation the chart needed.  * Although it faltered the first time when attempting to push past the moving average line (highlighted), Thursday's second attempt worked nicely.  * While the volume behind the runup since May's bottom is on reasonably healthy volume, the pace hasn't been healthy. HollyFrontier isn't yet stochastically overbought, but it's getting to that point fast. Activision Blizzard (ATVI)Finally, within nothing more than a quick glance, Activision Blizzard shares merely look stuck in a trading range. And, that may well be the case. A deeper look at some of the more subtle clues, however, suggests the bulls may be working on a bigger-picture recovery of last year's oversized pullback. The inflection point is within sight too, with a massive amount of room to run if and when the last hurdle area is cleared.  Click to Enlarge  * The subtle hints are not just the bullish crosses of most of the moving average lines on the daily chart. Since the end of last month, the 20-, 50- and 100-day moving average lines are acting as support.  * The inflection point, or final potential resistance, is the 200-day moving average line at $51, plotted in white on both stock charts. In the meantime, there's horizontal resistance around $48.80.  * The weekly chart puts the potential rebound in perspective. It also better identifies the fact that we've already seen a higher low.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The Dow added 0.85%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGains for the Dow and S&P 500, in particular, could have been better if not for weakness in the healthcare sector, the second-largest sector weight in the S&P 500. In late trading, all three of the Dow's pharmaceutical names were lower with Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) being the index's worst loser with a loss of 4.5%. Politics were at play.&quot;The Trump administration is backing down from a controversial effort to lower drug prices, only days after its first major industry reform was overturned by a federal judge,&quot; reports CNN.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown Likewise, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) is looking to jump-start her scuffling 2020 presidential campaign by unveiling ideas for lower drug prices. In other words, pharmaceuticals stocks were hit by both political parties today.Now, onto some Dow winners. Speaking Of Healthcare…It was not all bad news for Dow healthcare names today. Just look at UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), which surged 5.53%. The managed care giant, often highlighted in this space, has been finding its groove in recent weeks and stands to benefit from lower drug prices.Keeping with the theme of selling pharmaceuticals, shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) slipped 0.01% after the company said it will raise its quarterly dividend by 4% at 45.75 cents a share, marking the 44th consecutive year the company has boosted its payout. A Bullish NoteShares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) nudged up 0.4% after Cowen initiated coverage of the stock with an &quot;outperform&quot; rating and a price target of $150. The stock is up 37% year-to-date and 19 of 20 analysts have the equivalent of &quot;strong buy&quot; ratings on it. A Fine FinancialGoldman Sachs Group (NYSEARCA:GS) jumped 2.61% on above average volume on news that the Wall Street behemoth is looking to extend its reach in the world of digital assets. As was noted here yesterday, a slew of financial services stocks report earnings next week, and Goldman is one of the bellwethers of that group, so today's buying in the name could also be a sign traders are expecting the stock to rally into earnings. Bottom Line: Let's Talk About EarningsWe have been highlighting potential areas for concern related to earnings season. With the calendar about to bring a spate of reports, investors should brace for some disappointments.&quot;Because of uncertainty around trade wars and global growth, a bulk of U.S. companies are lowering the bar for their second-quarter earnings. Of the 114 companies that have issued earnings guidance for the period, 77% have issued negative forecasts, according to data from FactSet,&quot; reports CNBC.If there is a silver lining, it is that many of these dour expectations may already be baked into stocks.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-10	2019-07-10 11:54:19	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	If Everything is Going Wrong for CVS Health Stock, is That a Buy Signal?	When it comes to CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), there's no shortage of reasons to steer clear of CVS stock. Pharmacies are getting hammered by lower reimbursement rates and higher costs. Health insurers -- recall that CVS acquired Aetna last year -- are struggling. CVS Health stock is down 16.3% this year.Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrBut wait, there's more: That Aetna deal may be reversed. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) looms, fueled by its PillPack acquisition and its Haven health care joint venture, with partners JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B).Those risks have led to an ugly chart for CVS Health stock. In March, CVS stock touched its lowest level in almost six years. Since then, the shares have traded mostly sideways, returning to those lows several times before a recent, modest, bounce.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut at the lows, CVS becomes an interesting contrarian pick. CVS stock is cheap - - and close to absurdly so. Some of the headwinds facing the company should reverse at some point. The legal uncertainty surrounding Aetna doesn't necessarily seem like bad news. And the threat of Amazon may be overblown, as it so often has been.That's not to say those risks aren't real. And with a huge debt load post-Aetna, CVS stock absolutely can fall further. Still, with support seemingly intact and the valuation pricing in those concerns, the risk-reward surrounding CVS Health stock looks attractive. CVS Health Stock Tanks … And So Do PeersPerhaps the biggest change surrounding CVS stock of late is that the pharmacy business model has moved from being perceived as a strength to seen as a weakness. Pharmacies long were considered defensive stocks; even in an economic downturn, consumers still needed their prescriptions. Indeed, CVS earnings rose over 12% in 2009 -- at the same time the U.S. was dealing with the worst of the Great Recession. (To be sure, CVS stock still tanked as investors sold pretty much every U.S. equity.)  * The 7 Top Small-Cap Stocks Of 2019 It's not just CVS that's struggling. Shares of Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), too, touched a nearly six-year low in late May. Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) stock has collapsed to the point that a reverse split was required.Three key factors are behind the industry's troubles.One, pharmacies are receiving lower reimbursement rates from insurers. As efforts to rein in costs cascade through the health care system, pharmacies are taking the brunt.Another factor is that generic drugs aren't coming as quickly as they have in the past -- and they aren't as cheap as they used to be. Without steady savings from generics to offset lower rates, margins in the pharmacy business have crumbled.Adjusted operating income in CVS' retail/long-term care (LTC) segment declined 19% in the first quarter. While the LTC business struggled, the pharmacy business was a big driver. Walgreens highlighted similar pressures in its recent fiscal third quarter report.And, finally, front-end sales remain weak. For CVS, front-end sales declined 2.6% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2016. A 0.5% increase in 2018 still suggests negative growth over the three-year period. Whether that weakness is coming from e-commerce competition, improved convenience stores from fuel sellers like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), or other factors, isn't entirely clear yet. But here, too, Rite Aid and Walgreens are seeing similar trends. Amazon and PillpackEssentially, the pharmacy business looks tough right now. And it may get tougher. Amazon long has been considered a potential entrant in the pharmacy space. That speculation only intensified after the e-commerce giant acquired PillPack last year.As Luke Lango detailed in February, Amazon appears to be a real threat to CVS Health -- and to CVS Health stock. And that's not just a matter of displacing in-store prescription sales through a mail-order model.Rather, it appears increasingly likely that Amazon is considering disrupting the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) model. CVS is one of the three titans in PBM, through the Caremark business that it acquired back in 2007. Cigna (NYSE:CI) recently acquired Express Scripts, another big player, while UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) has substantial share through its OptumRx unit.As Barron's noted, about 70% of earnings, even after the Aetna deal, come from the retail pharmacy and the Caremark PBM. Investors fear those profits are at significant risk. With health insurers not exactly setting the world on fire -- a basket of the largest health insurance stocks would be roughly flat over the last year -- it's not hard to see why CVS is trading at such paltry earnings multiples. Is The Aetna Deal At Risk?With all those risks, the last thing shareholders needed was another one. But now it appears the already-closed Aetna deal might be at risk.As InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn detailed last month, a federal judge is reviewing the merger, and in theory could force the two companies to separate. Case law here is murky, and the odds that the court actually reverses an already-closed deal seem slim. But it is a possibility -- and one that could be close to disastrous for CVS Health.After all, it's not entirely clear how such a separation could even work. What happens to the $48 billion in cash that CVS paid to Aetna shareholders? Will they send bills? Would Aetna stock be re-listed? The practical considerations alone would seem to dissuade Judge Richard Leon from actually separating the two companies, were he so inclined.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 Still, the risk is out there. And as one of many, investors have responded accordingly. But assuming a somewhat orderly split, even a reversal of the merger might not be bad news for CVS stock. Investors didn't really like the deal to begin with: CVS stock now is down by about 30% since it was announced. Would a reversal be greeted by more selling -- or a relief rally? The Case for CVS Health StockAgain, these worries can't be ignored. But there's also an appealing contrarian case for CVS Health stock.First, CVS stock is cheap. Ridiculously cheap as 2019 EPS guidance of $6.75-$6.90 was reaffirmed at the company's Investor Day last month. Even the low end of the range suggests CVS trades at 8.2x earnings.Meanwhile, at the same event, CVS guided for steady growth going forward: $7+ in 2020 EPS, followed by mid-single-digit growth in 2021 and 10%+ increases afterward. CVS could target EPS nearing $10 per share by 2024; assuming even a still-soft 12x multiple, the stock would more than double in five years even before a current 3.6% dividend yield.Debt funding the Aetna deal (for now) does help that multiple. But even on an EV/EBITDA basis, which includes the company's borrowings, a 7x+ multiple is the company's lowest in years. By any measure, CVS is priced for earnings declines - while management insists that growth is ahead.And management could be right. CVS is moving toward a diversified health care offering, between insurance, a PBM, and in-store care through its HealthHUBs. Reimbursement rate pressures may ease at some point. Front-end sales already are being de-emphasized, as the HealthHUBs replace space currently allocated to slower sellers.Contrarian investing always is tricky -- particularly when a company has the debt and the headwinds that CVS has. A stock like that never truly gets &quot;too cheap&quot;. But CVS is cheap and management believes it will be a beneficiary of the transformation of U.S. health care. If management is even close to right, CVS stock will rally at some point.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

(VZ)Verizon (NYSE:VZ), usually a defensive name, was somewhat offensive today, losing 0.70% after Citigroup lowered its rating to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;buy,&quot; citing risks in the broader telecommunications space.&quot;The opportunities for further multiple expansion have narrowed, in our view, as we close in on different wireless merger scenarios from what we previously envisioned and Verizon is less likely to pursue bolder strategic moves to accelerate its network and 5G strategies over the next 6-12 months,&quot; said Citi analyst Michael Rollins in a note. Looking For Good News?Investors looking for positive vibes on a day when those were hard to come by can focus on at least two Dow stocks. Let's start with UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest healthcare component in the Dow. Shares of the beleaguered health insurance provider could be second-half winners.&quot;That's at least according to technical analyst Mark Newton, founder of Newton Advisors. With UnitedHealth shares down nearly 14% from their 52-week highs made in December, Newton said Friday that this Dow dud is poised for a breakout,&quot; reports CNBC.A cyclical name to consider may just be Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), shares of which are up just 7.35% this year.&quot;Caterpillar has created a virtuous cycle by manufacturing superior quality equipment that has fostered a premium product reputation,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note. &quot;The equipment therefore is highly fungible with known resale values. It also has a robust support infrastructure, which creates a lucrative aftermarket business.&quot; Bottom LineWith it appearing increasingly unlikely that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates this month or perhaps even this quarter, investors will likely be beholden to company-specific events over the near-term. That will be even more true as second-quarter earnings reports start trickling in over the coming days.This week, however, hope burns eternal for encouraging news on the rate cut front.&quot;Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to give testimony on monetary policy before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, which some investors expect will provide clues regarding the likelihood of a rate cut from the U.S. central bank when it meets at the end of the month,&quot; reports Reuters.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

Historically, July is not the best nor is it the worst month in which to own stocks, but over the past decade, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA), the Dow-tracking exchange-traded fund (ETF), is one of the best-performing ETFs in the seventh month of the year.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Same Price as Beyond Meat Before we start the weekend, let's look at some individual Dow stocks and how they fared on Friday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM)JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest domestic bank, tussled with rival Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) for top honors among Dow Jones percentage gainers today and the aforementioned CCAR results were the reason why.JPM investors are about to see a higher dividend and significantly larger buyback effort than was previously expected, thanks to the bank's impressive CCAR results.&quot;Highlights among the big banks included a plan by JPMorgan to buy back as much as $29.4 billion of stock, far more than the roughly $21 billion investors expected,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;The country's top bank by market value plans to boost its quarterly payout to 90 cents to 80 cents, resulting in a yield of 3.2%.The increase was in line with expectations.&quot; Nike (NKE)All things considered, it was a decent day for shares of Nike (NYSE:NKE). The stock was up 0.35% after the athletic footwear king report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 62 cents a share, below the consensus estimate of 66 cents. That represents a rare earnings miss for Nike. To be precise, it was the first time in seven years that NKE stock missed estimates.Analysts and Nike executives alike are not sound alarming bells over the miss.&quot;Our distinctive innovation and digital advantage led to accelerated growth across our complete portfolio, while our brand fueled deeper relationships with consumers around the globe,&quot; CEO Mark Parker said in a written statement. UnitedHealth (UNH)In the healthcare sector, investors have their pick of Dow offenders today as most of the Dow healthcare stocks closed lower. On a percentage basis, one of the worst offenders was UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH). Guess why?There was another debate last night for Democratic presidential hopefuls and there was more talk in this round than in Wednesday's debate about government-backed healthcare efforts many investors see as punitive to the sector.Good news: healthcare is often one of the best-performing sectors in July. Apple (AAPL)In today's example of somewhat silliness, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) lost 1.14% on news that designer Jonathan Ive is leaving the company to start his own firm, but even Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company will continue working closely with Ive and his new company. One analyst called Ive &quot;irreplaceable.&quot;Chances are someone once said that about Steve Jobs. Said another way, no one is &quot;irreplaceable&quot; in Corporate America. Apple has been down this road before and dealt with it with aplomb. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThis was the best June for the Dow since 1938, with 28 of the index's 30 members gaining in the final month of the second quarter. Looking forward to next week, there are likely to be some G-20 reverberations on Monday, but remember it is a holiday-shortened week. With the Fourth of July coming on a Thursday, don't expect much in the way of excitement after Tuesday.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-21	2019-06-21 20:33:39	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: A Typical Summer Friday	Interestingly, June 21 marks the official start of summer, and the summer months often bring lethargy in the equity markets, particularly on Fridays. That was the case today as stocks, broadly speaking, were mostly listless.Source: Shutterstock To close the week, the S&P 500 fell a scant 0.13%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.24%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also lost 0.13%. Long-term investors can find some solace on the day of the summer solstice with an article in Barron's today indicating Dow 30,000 could arrive sooner than expected.&quot;To stick with our 2025 forecast now would be to suggest that stocks over the next 5½ years will climb just 2.1% a year, plus dividends,&quot; according to Barron's. &quot;It's possible, but pessimistic. The Dow could reach 30,000 much sooner than 2025.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe article indicates it is possible the Dow sees 30,000 sometime in 2021, a bullish forecast considering the blue-chip index closed around 26,800 today.That is a long-term forecast. Over the near-term, the Federal Reserve will likely dominate the conversation and that is not surprising. For investors hoping for rate cut this year, good news: Fed funds traders bet on such a move in record fashion this week, according to CNBC. Some Mild WinnersBy the end of the day, just two of the 30 Dow Jones stocks were sporting gains of 1% or more. The clear powerhouse was UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), which gained 1.82% on new that it is acquiring health-care payments provider Equian LLC for $3.2 billion.  * The 7 Best Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 That is a drop in the bucket for UnitedHealth, which has a market capitalization of $240 billion and a stellar return for Equian's private equity owner New Mountain, which purchased the company four years ago for just $225 million.Defensive names have been getting some attention here in recent weeks and with good reason. Today, Dow component Walmart (NYSE:WMT), on essentially no news to merit a move like this, jump 0.73% to hit an all-time high. The largest U.S. retailer is up almost 20% year-to-date.Pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) added 0.88% after the European Commission approved the company's TALZENNA treatment for breast cancer patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the treatment last October.&quot;We are thrilled that we can now offer these patients in Europe, who are often diagnosed at a younger age and have limited treatment options, an effective, once-daily, alternative treatment to chemotherapy,&quot; said Pfizer in a statement.Staying in the blue-chip pharmaceuticals space, Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) closed modestly lower, but three analysts raised price targets on the stock to $90, $95 and $96, respectively. In either case, that is some decent upside from Merck's Friday close around $84.50. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayWith all the talk about a potential rate cut, investors should not forget that second-quarter earnings season will soon be here. While glum earnings may be baked into the market at current levels, investors should still expect some less-than-positive sentiment around the second-quarter numbers.&quot;As of today, the estimated earnings decline for the second quarter for the S&P 500 stands at -2.6%,&quot; said FactSet in a note out Friday. &quot;If -2.6% is the actual earnings decline for the quarter, it will mark the first time the index has reported two straight quarters of year-over-year declines in earnings since Q1 2016 and Q2 2016. It will also mark the largest year-over-year decline in earnings since Q2 2016 (-3.2%).&quot;Unfortunately, the same note indicates analysts are ratcheting down third-quarter estimates with the energy and technology sectors looking like the worst offenders.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-19	2019-06-19 20:33:42	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Stocks Almost Had Some Fed Fun	As was expected, the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged following the conclusion of its two-day meeting today. But what market participants wanted was inklings of hope that a rate cut could materialize later this year. That wish was granted, helping stocks rally into the close.Source: Shutterstock Importantly, the word &quot;patient&quot; was not featured in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement, indicating the Fed could take a more proactive approach to managing rates if the world's largest economy starts to show signs of weakness.&quot;The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook have increased,&quot; said the FOMC. &quot;In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne Fed member, James Bullard, preferred to lower rates by 25 basis points at this meeting. That was not enough to deliver the coveted rate cut, but it was enough to send the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 higher by 0.42% and 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.15%. Winners, But Were There Enough?Yes, the Dow is home to just 30 stocks and in late trading, two-thirds of those names were higher. But if nitpicking is to occur on an otherwise positive day, it is worth noting that Dow's offenders today were all cyclical names. Going a bit further with the scrutiny, several of the Dow losers today were among the index's biggest components. But to be fair, some of these stocks have been on winning streaks and the Wednesday losses were mostly modest.  * 7 Value Stocks to Buy for the Second Half UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the Dow Jones' largest healthcare component, was the blue-chip index's biggest winner today, adding 1.82%. Not to play politics here, but UNH's Wednesday rally occurred a day after President Donald Trump kicked off his reelection at a rally in Orlando.Obviously, the election is a long way out, but as has been note here, UNH and rival healthcare providers have been under pressure amid speculation that Medicare For All could become a reality if a Democrat wins the White House. Again, November 2020 is a long way away, but UNH has been trending higher for almost two months and looks poised to wipe out its year-to-date loss.American Express (NYSE:AXP) was one of the best-performing financial services names in the Dow today. The stock, a Warren Buffett favorite, added 1.01% after Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Jason Kupferberg put a &quot;buy&quot; rating and a $145 price target on the shares, implying significant upside from Wednesday's close.AXP is a &quot;a worthy investment which offers customers unique experiences beyond traditional rewards points&quot; and &quot;we have been pleasantly surprised to see [American Express] strategically raise card fees to help offset these costs,&quot; said the analyst in a note cited by Barron's.Home improvement giant Home Depot (NYSE:HD) ticked higher, aided by the Fed minutes. Lower interest rates often benefit companies with exposure to the residential real estate market, and that rate chatter could aid Home Depot in its quest to break through resistance at the $210 area. If that happens, it could be off to the races for the stock. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIt is difficult to complain about Wednesday's price action. Sure, stocks could have gained more, but for the most part, investors got what they wanted in terms of dovish Fed commentary. Plus, Fed funds futures are indicating a July rate cut is a real possibility.Fortunately, investors looking to prepare for a rate cut without incurring significantly higher risk can turned to a beloved asset class: dividend stocks and ETFs. Several dividend ETFs hit record highs today and a large batch are withing just a few percentage points of doing the same.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-19	2019-06-19 11:40:33	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	CVS Stock Has More Going for It Than Just a 3.69% Dividend Yield	CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) faces two distinct headwinds that are putting pressure on CVS stock.First, markets are cautious over the drug store and drug manufacturing market as the government pressure all players to lower drug prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDoubts over CVS' acquisition of Aetna are adding more distractions for management in the near-term. With CVS stock testing the $51.72 yearly low on at least five occasions since March, what will it take for the stock to rebound?CVS reported first-quarter earnings of $1.62 and also raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $6.75 to $6.90. This is up from the previous guidance of $6.68 to $6.88 a share.The Q1 beat and improved outlook are due largely to the inclusion of managed care operations. The company also included revenue from SilverScript Medicare Part D, which contributed $17.9 billion of revenue for the quarter.  * 5 Stocks to Buy for $20 or Less Better synergies with Aetna also contributed favorably to the higher outlook. CVS expects it will exceed its target savings of $750 million in 2020. It found synergies stemming from the elimination of duplication in corporate and operational functions, medical cost savings such as formulary alignment, and purchasing efficiencies. By 2022, CVS forecast saving $1.5 billion to $2 billion, well above its deal synergy targets.CVS forecast cash flow of between $9.8 billion and $10.3 billion and will use $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion to pay down its debt. Its debt/equity of 1.25 times is above that of Cigna Corporation (NYSE: CI) at 0.95, and UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) at 0.74, both of which are attractive investments.Despite the less favorable debt/equity, CVS Health pays a dividend yielding 3.69%. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) also has a lower debt/equity of 0.73 but its dividend is slightly lower too, at 3.35%. Value Investing OpportunityInvestors who think that CVS has deep value with a forward P/E of 7.6 times are betting the company will mitigate near-term headwinds hurting the business. In Q1, prescription growth of 5.5% benefited from the support of clinical care programs and network relationships.The company will improve margins in its long-term care business. And with PBM, the idea of a net cost pricing model is resonating with clients. Some clients will adapt to this offering while CVS expects its uptake improving in 2020 and beyond.CVS is testing new approaches in delivering and managing health care. Its Houston HealthHub stores bring health care services into communities. Meeting people where they are should drum up more business.Still, CVS will primarily use data and analytics to deliver such services at the best cost. Plus, it has a long-term vision of seamlessly connecting consumer experiences across digital and clinical interactions.Initial results from the Houston stores are encouraging. The locations are performing better than expected, giving the company the green light to expand the HealthHUB model. RisksAlthough CVS Health's market share stood at 26.2% in the first quarter, front store comparable sales rose just 0.4%. Adjusted operating income from Retail/Long-term care dropped 18.9%. Reimbursement pressure, higher legal costs, and higher expenses weighed on Q1 results.Should costs grow higher than expected in the course of this year, CVS may lower its guidance. Fortunately, synergies from the Aetna acquisition are tracking higher than the company expected. HealthHUB is resonating well with customers. This is encouraging the company to add more net new items in the front-store of the self-care and wellness areas. Along with expanding MinuteClinic services, CVS will continue expanding the interactions between pharmacists and patients who need it most. ValuationThe 14 analysts offering a price target on CVS stock have an average price of $70.18, which is ~30% above the recent closing price of $54.17. Conversely, investors could assume a perpetuity growth rate of between 5% and 6% in the 5Y DCF Growth Exit model. In this scenario, the fair value of CVS stock is $63 a share, implying an upside of 16% for investors (per finbox.io). Your CVS Stock TakeawayThe CVS and Aetna deal is getting challenged. Investors could bet that the court lets the deal close. More importantly, CVS is already reaping the benefits of the combination by cutting costs. By delivering better services to the customers it services, the company will keep growing.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Compare Brokers The post CVS Stock Has More Going for It Than Just a 3.69% Dividend Yield appeared first on InvestorPlace.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cvs-stock-more-going-just-114033463.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-13	2019-06-13 14:22:16	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Can CVS Stock Overcome the Latest Wrench in Its Aetna Merger?	Senior Judge Richard Leon sent shares in drug store chain CVS (NYSE:CVS) lower after saying he might try to stop its $69 billion merger with Aetna (NYSE:AET), a health insurer. CVS announced the deal in December 2017. Since then, CVS stock is down over 25%. It was due to open for trade June 12 at about $54 per share. CVS' market cap of $70 billion is now just 36% of its 2018 revenue, which was $194 billion.Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrLeon told CVS' and Aetna's lawyers to &quot;cancel their summer vacation,&quot; arguing the Department of Justice barely considered what adding 21 million customers could do for CVS' Caremark, a Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM).Oral arguments will be held July 17, a ruling coming shortly after. CVS has already agreed to sell its Medicare Part D plan, the only overlap with Aetna, to Wellcare, which in turn is being bought by Centene (NYSE:CNC).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Question of CostsCentene's involvement begs the main question raised by the merger, which is whether the deal can cut healthcare costs.Centene's market advantage is cost visibility. Its business model is to profit in Medicare and Medicaid by owning clinics and other facilities its covered patients use. It was a big winner on the Obamacare exchanges, where it could offer much lower prices than standard insurance plans.The American Hospital Association opposes the CVS-Aetna merger, while supporting mergers between hospital groups, arguing that hospitals aren't the cause of health care inflation.  * 10 Stocks That Every 30-Year-Old Should Buy and Hold Forever They're right. Drugs are. Combining PBMs and insurers is how the industry is fighting drug costs.CVS plans to turn 1,500 stores into &quot;HealthHubs,&quot; after the merger, with labs, nurses and dieticians to treat chronic conditions like diabetes, representing 75% of America's health care bill.CVS has been preparing itself for a favorable outcome since February, when it reached the agreement with the Department of Justice Judge Leon is now reviewing. The Question of CompetitionLeon's objections are centered on Caremark, but that unit's problems were behind the merger in the first place.The PBM model was upended four years ago when UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest private insurer, bought Catamaran, another PBM, for its own OptumRx unit.The deal made the stand-alone PBM market untenable. Since then, Express Scripts, the largest PBM, was acquired by Cigna (NYSE:CI), an Aetna rival. That merger, and the CVS-Aetna tie-up, followed failed attempts by Aetna to merge with Humana (NYSE:HUM) and by Cigna to merger with Anthem (NASDAQ:ANTM). Having failed at horizontal mergers because of their size (despite UnitedHealth being bigger than either combination), the second-tier players moved toward vertical mergers, hoping to compete through cost control.Thus, Leon seems intent on stopping a train that has already left the station. UnitedHealth, Centene and Cigna own PBMs, and he's going to stop CVS-Aetna because CVS owns one? The Bottom Line on CVS StockNot all mergers work. CVS' own acquisition of Omnicare, a long-term care provider, caused it take a $3.9 billion write-down in the second quarter of last year, and a net loss for all of 2018.  * 7 U.S. Stocks to Buy With Limited Trade War Exposure But given how far insurers have gone along the road to matching income with outgo, the Aetna merger was looking like a winner. The delays have pushed CVS shares down enough to give its 50 cent per share dividend a yield of 3.82%, even though absent of write-offs, it covers that dividend with earnings two to three times over each year.The Leon delay looks like a good opportunity for income investors to grab a bargain.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Five of the Dow's 30 stocks are tech names and those five stocks were among the blue-chip index's top seven percentage gainers today.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the Dow's top performer today as the stock jumped 2.8%, reclaiming its status in the $1 trillion market value club while ascending to an all-time high. Earlier this week, Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler noted Microsoft's cloud business could eventually generate $140 billion in revenue. The analyst has an &quot;outperform rating on Microsoft stock.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the Dow's largest tech holding, joined the party, adding 2.66%. Apple's Friday rally appears to be a sympathy play as the stock traded higher alongside the broad market, not on the back of company-specific news. There was some bullish analyst chatter on Apple stock yesterday along with rumors that the company is considering an acquisition to bolster its footprint in the fast-growing autonomous vehicle market.Outside of tech, United HealthGroup (NYSE:UNH), the largest healthcare stock in the Dow and one of the index's worst-performing components this year, enjoyed a decent day Friday, gaining 2.05% to put a dent into a year-to-date loss of almost 3%. On Thursday, UnitedHealth declared a quarterly dividend of $1.08 per share, up from the previous quarter's payout of 90 cents a share.McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) continued its assault on the record books, hitting another all-time high after Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated a &quot;buy&quot; rating on the fast food giant with a $220 price target, implying decent upside from Friday's close around $206.&quot;The company has generated strong growth in international markets, and though its traffic has been down in the U.S., its same-store sales have easily outperformed competitors as customers pay higher prices and order more add-ons,&quot; according to Restaurant Business. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayHeading into Friday, it was expected that the May jobs report would miss expectations and do so in a big way. Still, it is encouraging to see riskier assets, such as stocks, handle that number with aplomb. There is still plenty of June, but the Dow closed the first week of a month that is historically rough on stocks on a four-day winning streak.Traders likely bid stocks higher today because the weak jobs number stoked hope that if the economy slows, the Federal Reserve could step in with interest rate cuts. In fact, bond markets are now pricing in as many as three rate cuts this year, with one possibly coming as soon as next month.It remains to be seen whether or not the Fed will pursue any rate cuts this year, so monitoring President Trump's Twitter feed for trade updates may help investors get a sense for where stocks are headed next week.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-30	2019-05-30 12:10:44	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Ways to Minimize Your Exposure to the U.S.-China Trade War	Citigroup (NYSE:C) just slashed Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone sales in half as a result of the U.S./China trade war. It seems more and more companies are getting caught in the crossfire. Whether buying goods from China or trying to sell products to China, navigating this trade war is a real difficulty.Source: Shutterstock Meanwhile, investors of all stripes are trying to figure out how to best insulate their portfolios from what's quickly becoming a global economic contagion.Is it even possible to hide from this trade war in which no one wins? Probably not. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, I've got three ideas for minimizing your exposure.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June  Buy Service-Oriented StocksThe argument for buying service-oriented stocks, especially those focused on the domestic market, is that they have far less exposure to trade policy. Naturally, most people immediately think of smaller companies, but that doesn't have to be the case. Sectors that come to mind include healthcare, utilities, software, real estate, etc. For example, although Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) ecommerce business would be affected by the trade war, its AWS segment, which generated $2.2 billion of operating income in the quarter ended March 31 from $7.7 billion in revenue, wouldn't face nearly the same tariff concerns. In Q1 2019, its North American operating segment generated about the same amount of operating income from almost five times as much revenue. Although Amazon's doing a lot more third-party selling these days, whether its Amazon or the third party that owns the product, the trade war isn't helping their businesses. So, Amazon's a good, if not great way to minimize the trade war headwinds. Another possibility is to buy healthcare businesses that have a strong services component like hospital operators, healthcare plan providers, retirement and assisted living facilities, etc. In mid-April, I suggested that those who had the stomach start buying UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) stock despite the calls for &quot;Medicare for All&quot; because whatever the future holds for the provider of healthcare benefits and services, its stock has got to be worth more than $220. UNH stock bottomed in mid-April and has rebounded by more than 10% in the six weeks since. With the trade war hanging over our heads, a stock like UNH wouldn't be half bad. Alternatively, if you don't want to go the stock selection route, a good option would be to buy iShares Healthcare  Providers ETF (NYSEARCA:IHF), a collection of stocks targeting domestic healthcare services companies like UnitedHealth, which is the ETFs number one holding with a weighting of 22.94%.   Boring but ConsistentWith an ongoing trade war possibly leading to a recession, the best stocks to buy in this situation might be the most boring. Stocks that deliver consistent dividends or distributions and aren't necessarily affected by what's happening on the trade front. Two sectors that meet these criteria are real estate and utilities. Real estate, especially if you're investing in multi-family residential, is an area that's not going to suffer nearly as much from a downturn because we all have to live somewhere. Utilities benefit from the same scenario; we all need to pay our bills if we want to keep the lights on and the home appliances and electronics running smoothly. That's why Elizabeth Warren popularized the 50/20/30 budgeting rule, which puts aside 50% of your after-tax income for bills that you absolutely must pay. Rather than pick the real estate or utilities stocks to own, it would be much easier to buy two inexpensive ETFs to meet your needs. I'd go with iShares Residential Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:REZ) for the real estate play. Approximately 49% of its net assets are invested in residential REITs with the remainder in REITs that own retirement homes, storage facilities and other specialized real estate assets. It charges 0.48% annually.  As for utilities, I'd go with Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEARCA:VPU). It's inexpensive at 0.10% and only has 68 holdings with its top ten accounting for 53% of the ETFs $4.8 billion in total net assets.    Park Your Money If you're freaked out by the consequences of a lingering trade war, you can always move your portfolio out of equities and into a certificate of deposit or high-yield savings account until the skirmish is settled.  Or, you can buy into the MNA IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (NYSEARCA:MNA), an expensive ETF at 0.78% annually that's worth every penny. I first suggested the ETF in September 2017.  Utilizing a directional hedge fund strategy, it has very little correlation to either the equity or fixed income markets, making it the perfect fund to own when both types of securities are losing their value. It's not going to make you rich, but in my opinion, it will protect your downside better than most bond funds would. Alternatively, you could invest in one of the many special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) currently listed, preferably one that's gone public in the last 3-6 months. That's because SPAC's are blind pools of money raised to use for an acquisition at some point in the 21 months after an IPO. The funds are placed in escrow and interest is paid until a target company is found to acquire. If a target's not found, the funds are returned to investors with interest.   It's an excellent way to park your funds with minimal downside and potential upside should an acquisition come to pass before the 21-month deadline. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-28	2019-05-28 08:37:41	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	The 5 Best Dow Jones Stocks To Buy Now, Say Analysts	The Dow Jones Industrial Average has suffered a bruising recently. The index posted its fifth straight weekly decline, and is now down 3.79% so far this month. However it’s not all doom and gloom. On Monday, Dow Jones futures traded up thanks to the news that President Trump and Japan’s Prime Minister Abe Shinzo met to discuss a whole host of trade issues.“Great progress being made in our Trade Negotiations with Japan. Agriculture and beef heavily in play. Much will wait until after their July elections where I anticipate big numbers!” tweeted President Trump on May 26.And from an investing perspective, there are certainly compelling stocks to be found in the index. You just have to know where to look. Luckily TipRanks has released a new tool that allows you to compare stocks- and pinpoint the most promising investing opportunities. Here we ran a screen on all the stocks in the Dow Jones- and then sorted the results from the most to least bullish according to the Street. View Stock Comparison Tool As you can see these 5 stocks all boast a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus based on ratings published by analysts over the last three months. Here’s why these are the five favorite Dow stocks of analysts right now: Microsoft (MSFT)In first place comes software giant Microsoft. Even though shares are down in May, the stock is still trading up 24% year-to-date. And according to five-star Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan, plenty of upside lies ahead. He has just reiterated his buy rating with a $145 price target after attending the Microsoft Build Developer Conference a couple of weeks ago. From current levels that indicates shares can surge 15%.Following the conference, Horan told investors it’s become “obvious that the company has totally restructured itself around the intelligent edge cloud.” As a result it is now better positioned to create and drive new services through developer partnerships. According to Horan, MSFT sees Azure as a base layer that customers use to run their applications but also as a building block for MSFT services up the software &quot;stack&quot;. That’s through dozens of new PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) offerings. Plus MSFT's services are being re-architected to run on Azure—Office 365, Dynamics 365, LinkedIn and Teams. By running on Azure, MSFT applications become cheaper to operate and easier to innovate and integrate. “We are just at the beginning of this transformation, with innovation accelerating” the analyst concludes. Overall, 22 out of the 24 analysts polled rate Microsoft a ‘Buy’- hence its ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus. See what other Top Analysts are saying about MSFT.  Visa (V)Next up comes the mighty payments processor Visa. Like Microsoft, Visa has posted impressive gains year-to-date (23%), however in the last month shares have marginally pulled back in keeping with the broader market.But there’s plenty to look forward to. Notably, Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider has just initiated coverage of the stock. He starts Visa off with a buy rating and a bullish $188 price target, citing volume growth in Europe, price increases and an expanding business payments unit. Schneider believes Visa enjoys ‘multiple opportunities’ to beat current consensus estimates. He also singles out upcoming product announcements and earnings reports as positive price catalysts. And for investors cautious about pending legal and regulatory issues, Schneider has a reassuring point. He notes that both Visa and Mastercard have escaped recent litigation relatively unscathed, by settling claims with minimal financial impact or change to their market leading positions.This isn’t the only analyst optimistic about Visa’s outlook. In the last three months Visa has received 18 buy ratings and just 1 hold rating. “We remain attracted to Visa's dominant position in the global card network market and its strong, recognizable international brand” cheers Cantor Fitzgerald’s Joseph Foresi. Looking forward, he sees a basket of catalysts pushing V higher, including Visa Direct, contactless payments, & B2B to name but a few. See what other Top Analysts are saying about V.  Disney (DIS)These are exciting times for Disney. The company is on the brink of launching its much-hyped streaming service Disney+. And it has just allowed a lucky few into its new Star Wars Land, &quot;Galaxy's Edge&quot; at Disneyland, California. One of the visitors to the new park was Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger. Although he wasn’t allowed to take photos, Juenger nevertheless revealed that the two main attractions (Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run, and Rise of the Resistance) were &quot;absolutely jaw-dropping.&quot;For investors, Juenger advised that the attraction will exceed reasonable guest expectations by a wide margin; and that it is more incremental for revenue than previously imagined. That’s because in Disneyland, it adds almost 14 acres of capacity, while in Disney World it will utilize the most-underused gate, meaningfully expanding overall guest capacity.&quot;This is the biggest attraction we’ve ever built,&quot; Scott Trowbridge, Portfolio Creative Executive at Walt Disney Imagineering, said in a recent presentation. &quot;It should be epic, because, Star Wars, right? That’s why we’re going big with this attraction.&quot; The Disneyland park will open on May 31, and from June 24 it will be possible to enter without reservations. Encouragingly, Disney’s recent earnings report shows a bullish story for theme parks. The Parks and Consumer Products segment delivered results roughly $200M above consensus estimates. “The segment has been a key growth driver for the company over the last few years, accounting for roughly 60% of total segment operating income gains from '16-'19E” writes Rosenblatt’s Mark Zgutowicz.“We are encouraged the company continues to invest in this segment with Star Wars Galaxy Edge opening in May/ August in CA/FL, as well as Marvel properties and expanding in Asia. We assume the segment is able to continue to grow returns at roughly the same rate over the next five years” concludes the analyst. This ‘Strong Buy’ stock boasts 15 buy ratings vs 3 hold ratings, while the average analyst price target comes in at $152. See what other Top Analysts are saying about DIS.  United Health (UNH)Managed healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group has had a bumpy ride recently. That’s as UNH, and indeed the health care sector in general, continue to be pressured by worries around “Medicare For All.” This proposes a transition to a national single payer health plan backed by a number of the Democrats’ 2020 presidential hopefuls.“Although the extreme versions of such a bill would be devastating to the healthcare sector, we see no shot of them going through in today's (and tomorrow's) political environment” writes top-ranked Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn. He reiterated his buy rating recently with a $305 price target indicating robust upside potential of 23%.“We believe the regulatory fears that have pressured the group are significantly overblown. We would be buyers of UNH on the weakness and maintain our Outperform rating” advises the analyst. He is a fan of the company’s diversification, strong track record, elite management team and exposure to certain higher growth businesses (including the Optum IT business). A similar message comes from Citigroup’s Ralph Giacobbe. Tellingly, the analyst has just upgraded UNH from Hold to Buy. He also boosted his price target considerably from $247 to $280. &quot;We acknowledge that the diversification story isn’t a new phenomena, but buying a bellwether name at discounted valuation presents an attractive opportunity considering the pullback has largely been premised on fears that we don’t expect to materialize” explains Giacobbe. Overall, UNH scores a buy rating from 10 out of 11 analysts polled by TipRanks. The average analyst price target works out at $284 (15% upside potential). See what other Top Analysts are saying about UNH.  Cisco Systems (CSCO)For our final best-rated Dow stock we have network leader Cisco Systems. The company has just posted a slightly ahead of consensus quarter on nearly all metrics once again. “Overall market demand and execution prove resilient; maintain Outperform” celebrated Baird analyst Jonathan Ruykhaver following the report.“Management continues to string together solid quarters during the ramp phase for Cat 9K and SD-WAN. Cisco's EPS algorithm produced normalized growth of 18% in 3Q19, which appears sustainable for the visible future” commented the analyst. He has a $57 price target on shares. Cisco reported FQ3 revenue/non-GAAP EPS of $12,958 million/ $0.78, representing revenue growth of 4% YoY (+6% excl. SPVSS), versus consensus of $12,889 million/$0.77. Meanwhile gross margin was up roughly 50 bps QoQ and up 70 bps YoY. The key takeaway: “We remain enthusiastic towards the product strategy and runway for growth over the next several years despite some concerns over a shakier spend macro and political instability.” Clearly the Street shares this upbeat analysis. With a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus, 15 out of 19 analysts give CSCO the thumbs up. Their average price target works out at $59 for 9% upside potential. That’s with shares surging 25% year-to-date- and experiencing a relatively minor dip of 3% in May. See what other Top Analysts are saying about CSCO.

2019-05-06	2019-05-06 16:12:49	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	7 Stocks to Buy From the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund	Want to make money on the stock market? One of the best ways to find good healthcare stocks to buy is by following the best ideas of successful portfolio managers. How do you find them? Well, you could use a mutual fund screener to find top performers. Or, you could do a Google search for mutual funds that gained notoriety in 2018 and buy the fund manager's best ideas. I'm talking about stocks in the top 10 or top 25 holdings. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe only problem with this solution is that mutual fund holdings aren't real time, so you're usually getting a list of stocks that are stale, dated, and no longer at the top of the fund manager's holdings list or even a holding 4-6 weeks after the end of the quarterly report. This little problem aside, it's still an excellent way to get ideas, even if you ultimately don't pull the trigger. And two of the best-performing categories of mutual funds in 2018 were large-cap growth and healthcare funds. One of these healthcare funds was the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund (MUTF:PRHSX), which had a total return of 1.23% last year, 561 basis points higher than the S&P 500.  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio Trailing the index by a significant amount through the first four months now might be the perfect time to check out its holdings list for healthcare stocks to buy.    Healthcare Stocks to Buy: United Health (UNH)Source: Shutterstock UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is the fund's number one holding with a weighting of 6.5% as of March 31. For obvious reasons which I'll explain, UNH stock hasn't had a good year to date. It's down over 6%, well behind the 17.5% gain by the S&P 500. UnitedHealth has two distinct businesses: The first provides healthcare plans for a company's employees. That's UnitedHealth. The second, known as Optum, provides health services to individuals, many of them having UnitedHealth healthcare benefits. As the Democratic candidates have come out of the woodwork in 2019, many of them have called for some form of universal healthcare in the U.S., some even suggesting following a single-payer system like the kind found in Canada. The idea of implementing a socialist healthcare plan scared investors. As they wondered whether an entire half of UnitedHealth's business would be wiped out under such a scenario, UNH stock's become kryptonite. However, as I stated in my April 18 article about UNH, investors should consider buying its stock near 52-week lows because investor fears are likely overblown. Since then, it's up 6% through May 1. As healthcare stocks go, UNH is as stable as they come. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Source: Jon Fingas via Flickr (Modified)Of all the healthcare stocks in the fund's top 25 holdings, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is probably the healthcare stock I'm most familiar. The second-largest holding in PRHSX, it has a weighting of 5.5%. Like UNH, ISRG hasn't exactly lit up the scoreboard in 2019. It's up 6% year to date. I first recommended ISRG stock in March 2013. Intuitive Surgical's stock price was under pressure due to lawsuits it faced over the company's da Vinci surgical systems. It got so severe that the FDA was looking into whether robotics was a threat to patient safety. As a result, ISRG was down 8.4% over 52 weeks, while the S&P 500 was up 25%, putting shareholders in a very grumpy mood. Here's what I said about its stock at that time:&quot;Intuitive Surgical is a great company that is growing free cash flow at a significant rate. If you own shares already, I'd applaud any pullbacks in its stock. If you don't own any shares, buy some now and then some later if it drops some more. If you don't, you'll be kicking yourself in five years when it's a $1,000 stock.&quot;  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Well, hyperbole aside, it's still an outstanding healthcare stock to own, even at half the price. Pfizer (PFE)Source: Shutterstock I don't know which type of healthcare stock I have a harder time assessing: a big pharma play like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) or a small biotech stock like Mustang Bio (NASDAQ:BIO). Not being a science guy, the jargon gets a bit tricky. The seventh-largest holding in the fund with a weighting of 2.9%, I picked Pfizer because it's recently added 1.2 million shares, increasing its shareholdings by 16%, the largest addition by shares in the top 25. Clearly, portfolio manager Ziad Bakri sees some serious capital appreciation in its future. I know InvestorPlace's own James Brumley thinks highly of Pfizer's drug pipeline. &quot;Though the headlines and sentiment seem dire, that pessimism is largely rooted in investors' collective view that sees a glass as half-empty rather than half-full,&quot; Brumley wrote in April. &quot;Pfizer's got a quietly potent pipeline, though, with a mix of already-approved and new drugs closer to wrapping up clinical trials than many investors might realize.&quot;Translation: Pfizer should not be in negative territory given the strength of its portfolio of drugs combined with the momentum in the overall markets. At a 14x price-to-earnings ratio, it's trading at a valuation well below its historical norm.   Roche (RHHBY)Source:  Images Money via FlickrOf all seven of these healthcare stocks to buy, Roche (OTCMKTS:RHHBY) appears to be the only new position in the fund's top 25 holdings with an initial 664,009 shares bought. Why did Bakri buy into the Swiss pharmaceutical company? That I couldn't tell you. What I do know is that the company is optimistic about 2019. On April 17, Roche upped its outlook for the year due to higher sales expectations in both China and the U.S. This despite downward pricing pressure from President Trump. At the end of 2018, Roche projected its sales growth this year would be low-to-mid-single digits. In its Q1 2019 earnings release April 17, it said it now expects sales to grow by at least mid-single digits with core earnings rising by a similar amount. &quot;We haven't taken any price increases in the U.S. since July 1,&quot; Bill Anderson, head of the Roche's drugs division, said on its conference call. &quot;Overall in the world, our 10 percent sales growth in pharma was based on 15 percent volume growth and 5 percent average price declines across the portfolio.&quot;  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May Thanks to the company's newer cancer drugs like Tecentriq, it continues to deliver growth for shareholders.    Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)Source: Shutterstock Although Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is best known for its cystic fibrosis drugs Kalydeco, Orkambi, and Symdeko, with 37,000 patients currently eligible to use them, it's also focusing on transformative medicines beyond cystic fibrosis for kidney disease, neuropathic pain and others. Of the 37,000 potential patients, about half are receiving treatment at the moment. By treating younger patients, it hopes to get that number up to 44,000, and using a triple combination regimen, it has its sight on 68,000 patients worldwide. Accomplishing this goal takes cash flow. To that end, Vertex has grown its operating cash flow over the past three years by 448% to $1.27 billion. That's starting from -$365 million in operating cash flow at the end of 2015. As a result, it's added $2.2 billion in cash to its balance sheet. From negative cash flow just three years ago, its free cash flow is now higher than $1.1 billion. In the first quarter ended March 31, Vertex increased free cash flow by 38% year over year to $307 million. Up just 8% year to date, the next eight months look ready to deliver a higher share price.  Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)Source: Shutterstock Of the top ten holdings in PRHSX, Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) has the second-best total return year to date, up 24%. Only Sage Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SAGE) has a better return. The fifth-largest holding in the fund portfolio, Thermo Fisher Scientific is a big buyer of its stock. Last September it announced a $2 billion share repurchase program. On May 2, it announced its first-quarter earnings report. While the 10-Q's not out yet, it did say it repurchased $750 million of its stock during the first quarter ended March 30 and increased its quarterly dividend by 12%. InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto summed up why TMO is such a great stock.&quot;If you think about it, Thermo Fisher stands on an almost unassailable position. The biotech sector will never stop searching for the next big therapy,&quot; Josh stated last September while discussing the company's big buyback. &quot;Of course, not all contenders are successful. But TMO doesn't have to be: they provide the equipment necessary for other companies to do their work.&quot;  * 7 Stocks That Are Soaring This Earnings Season Why try to pick the next great biotech stock when you can own TMO and win no matter who it turns out to be? HCA Healthcare (HCA)Source: Shutterstock Not a large holding in T. Rowe Price's health sciences fund at a weighting of 1.9% (16th position), HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) was first bought in 2011, so it's one of the fund's long-time holdings. HCA stock took a beating in April due to the Medicare-for-All scare that hurt many of the big healthcare stocks. It dropped 10%, its worst single-day performance since Trump's election victory in November 2016. However, the owner of 185 hospitals and 119 freestanding surgery centers in 21 states, has seen its stock recover most of those losses over the subsequent 7-10 days. &quot;The market is ascribing an inordinately high probability that some form of Medicare-for-All proposal could become reality,&quot; Cowen analyst Charles Rhyee wrote in a note in April. &quot;In our view, Medicare-for-All fails the Occam's razor test.&quot;For those who aren't Latin scholars, it means other, more straightforward options will likely be used to reform the healthcare system.Americans, especially Republican politicians, are so afraid of socialism, there's no way Medicare-for-All gets passed into legislation. As the population continues to age, hospitals will continue to experience significant demand, making HCA an excellent long-term buy.   At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But that doesn’t mean they’re willing to give up private insurance. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey of people with employer-provided insurance finds that 68% say their plan is excellent or good. One-quarter say their coverage is average, with only 6% rating their plan as poor or failing. Overall, 72% say they’re “grateful” for their coverage.	https://finance.yahoo.com/video/medicare-doomed-214221523.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-02	2019-05-02 16:01:49	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Analysts Are Missing the Cost Control With CVS Health	CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) shares rose sharply after it beat earnings estimates, but the stock remains dirt cheap. The company earned $1.427 billion, $1.62 for each fully adjusted share, on revenues of $61.6 billion. It was the first quarter that included results from Aetna, the health insurance company CVS Health bought last year. Most analysts credited Aetna with the strong numbers.Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrA raise in the earnings forecast for the year, from $6.68-$6.88 per share to $6.75-$6.90 per share, also helped the shares gain nearly 4.5% in early trade on May 1.But if the company's earnings forecast is right, its price of about $57 per share is barely 8 times earnings. Its dividend of 50 cents per share will yield 3.6% to today's stock buyer.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf the forecast is off, it's on the low side. Customer Control for CVS StockI have been pounding the table for CVS for some time so let's review.The issue here is customer control, linking payments on health services with the income from health coverage. You can't have an unlimited draw from a limited pool of funds. The only way to control costs, whether the system is run publicly or privately, is to have control over spending.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May That's what CVS is bringing to Aetna customers. It owns Caremark, a pharmacy benefit manager that can steer people to cost-effective solutions. It also owns a network of Minute Clinics that can handle front-line care efficiently, using nurses, physicians' assistants and electronic health records.This is the secret of industry winners like UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), which dominates in employer-paid insurance, and Centene (NYSE:CNC), which is achieving dominance in Medicare. The difference is that Centene has even more control over costs through acute care clinics and links to hospitals than UNH or CVS.Such &quot;managed care&quot; plans can be efficient, because most of the cost of medicine today is in dealing with &quot;chronic conditions&quot; like hypertension and diabetes.  Here patient compliance and regular check-ups are key to keeping costs down.CVS' decision to bring in insurance dollars, and manage those dollars, now makes it very different from Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), once its drug store doppelganger. While CVS is selling customer control, Walgreens is selling customer convenience. Other OpportunitiesThere may be more good news coming to the sector very soon.Cigna (NYSE:CI), which unlike Aetna decided to be a buyer rather than a seller, closing on pharmacy benefit manager ExpressScripts last December, is due to report May 2. Analysts expect earnings of $3.74 per share. They are hoping for $3.81. If Cigna could maintain that pace for the year, it would have a forward price-to-earnings multiple of a little over 10, based on its May 1 price of $161 per share.Here again, the goal is to same. Cigna is getting ExpressScript's ability to bargain, to create formularies, and to drive people to cost-effective, best practice solutions. It is also getting ExpressScript's drug delivery, and its ability to administer drugs directly to patients, increasing compliance on chronic conditions. The Bottom LineWhat the private sector is doing, through CVS Health, Centene, UnitedHealth and Cigna isn't a complete solution to the nation's health care cost crisis.That's one reason why CVS Health, and the rest of the industry, is fighting the concept of Medicare for All.  They fear government bargaining on acute care and drug costs, which the Veterans Administration has. They first want it for themselves, and they're slowly getting it.In the end, what the industry has to fear aren't Democrats, but business customers who now see 18% of GDP going out the door, while overseas competitors pay a fraction of that cost.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-04-30	2019-04-30 14:54:52	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	10 Workhorse Health Care Stocks That Never Break a Sweat	Health care stocks - and pharmaceutical makers in particular - recently dodged a bullet when President Donald Trump unveiled a relatively benign overhaul to the nation's health care system with the ultimate aim of lowering costs to costs.Granted, the industry isn't entirely sure what bullet it dodged, in that these companies weren't sure what was in the works. The specifics of Trump's plans have yet to be fully fleshed out, too. But the fact that the conversation took place at all underscores the notion that many, many eyes are scrutinizing the sector's healthy bottom lines.What if, however, there was a sliver of the health care sector that really was relatively immune to the politicization of the business, and was resistant to economic cycles?As it turns out, there is.No company is outright bulletproof. However, a wide swath of these organizations are amazingly reliable revenue and profit producers. Here's a closer look at 10 top health care stocks you can count on in good times and bad.

2019-04-23	2019-04-23 15:09:07	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Why Is Bristol-Myers Near 52-Week Lows?	Two things are hurting the near-term prospects of Bristol-Myers (NYSE:BMY). First, drug plan companies like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) issued a quarterly revenue warning, scaring investors from the drug sector. Second, Bristol-Myers is about to acquire Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG). And as the firm doing the acquiring, markets typically get cautious on short-term risks related to the acquisition.Source: A 4 via Flickr Are these two headwinds enough of a reason to justify BMY stock trading this low? Drug Prices Under PressureWashington is still looking for deterrents to a drug company's ability to raise prices. Any politically driven rules that limit a company's effectiveness to adjust prices will hurt not just Bristol-Myers but most companies in the pharmaceutical space. Companies often need to make adjustments to increase profits. It may then use those profits to pay for research and development, make acquisitions or return profits to shareholders. If this cycle is disrupted, investors will be less inclined to invest in the sector.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt 15 times earnings, BMY stock is relatively inexpensive compared to its peers. Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) fell by around 11% but its shares still trade at 31 times. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), which is widely held by investors, trades at 23 times. Markets discounted Bristol-Myers stock because the firm's inability to adjust prices higher will limit the options it has to help pay down the Celgene acquisition. Quarterly Earnings Ahead for BMY StockBMY will report its quarterly results for the quarter ended March 2019 on April 25. First-quarter 2019 earnings are expected to come in at $1.09, up from 94 cents last year. According to Tipranks, analysts are still bullish on BMY stock and have an average price target that is around 33% higher than its $45.52 recent closing price.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt In the upcoming quarter, the firm may shed some light on the progress of Opdivo. Currently, Opdivo has indications for nine different tumors. Management forecasts growth opportunities for Opdivo in the U.S. and outside the U.S., due to its treatment option for two of the tumors. Specifically, the treatment is for adjuvant melanoma and first-line renal cell. BMY launched these indications early last year. Opdivo plus Yervoy will play an important role in first-line renal, so investors should expect a good opportunity for the drug.Regarding Opdivo for cancer treatment, the prospects are more challenging. The company is facing a decline in eligible patients, dropping to the 35%-40% range. Fortunately, Bristol-Myers has a 30% market share. Merits of Celgene Deal for Bristol-Myers ExplainedAt face value, the Celgene buyout will come at a hefty price of $74 billion. Fundamentally though, the two firms coming together will benefit shareholders as a stronger firm. The timing for the deal is good because BMY is strong right now. The strong cash flow will facilitate the management of the debt level. In the long-term, it gets a complementary product line that strengthens its prospects.Revlimid's IP, in particular, has strong prospects ahead. Fortunately, Bristol-Myers forecast a downside and minimal outlook for Revlimid during the negotiation phase. And by preparing for weaker cash flow from it, management may plan out what it needs to do to make the most from the product.Fedratinib, luspatercept and ozanimod have strong commercial viability whose product launch will lead to strong cash flow growth from Celgene. In short, Celgene's specializing in making drugs to treat myeloma will complement BMY's drugs that treat inflammatory diseases. Further, cell therapies will advance BMY in ways that are not possible without the acquisition. ValuationAnalysts are optimistic that BMY stock will increase by over 30% in the next year. When the stock's P/E is below that of its peers, negative emotions are likely to blame for the stock's underperformance. In the near-term, the stock may head even lower as selling pressure accelerates. Still, value investing is all about patience, so starting a position at these levels may pay off over time. Investors who find the stock appealing at these levels will need to hold the stock for at least 2-3 years. By then, Celgene's new product launches will be accretive to Bristol-Myers' results.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-22	2019-04-22 13:56:28	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Solid Stocks for a Strong Portfolio	Building a strong portfolio is of course the Holy Grail for investors. The ideal portfolio will include a variety of stocks with a combination of high returns and reliability, coming from several different sectors of the market.The best way to populate your portfolio is to search through TipRanks’ database of stocks. With in-depth coverage of more than 5,000 stocks, and up to date rankings for more than 5,000 Wall Street analysts, all at your fingertips, you’re sure to find your right investment.We’ve taken a step to get you started, using the new Smart Score tool to find three upwardly mobile stocks that will provide a solid foundation for your portfolio. Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ – Research Report)Constellation represents the consumer goods sector of the market, traditionally a segment viewed as somewhat “recession proof,” since these companies tend to offer products that every consumer needs, and will continue to buy even when times turn hard. Constellation has found its niche as an alcohol supplier – the third largest beer importer to the US, by market share. The company owns the Corona and Modela brands, as well as Svedka vodka and several whiskeys. In the second half of 2018 and first quarter of 2019, Constellation made headlines for selling off its low-end wine brands and purchasing a 38% stake in Canadian cannabis company Canopy Growth (TSE:WEED).With the cannabis acquisition and low-end wine selloff, Constellation has both streamlined its core alcohol business and positioned itself to take advantage of the increasing trend toward cannabis legalization. While specific plans have not been released, Canopy is known to be developing cannabis infused beverages, and Constellation has both mature market share and international import-export networks.It its quarterly earnings report earlier this month, Constellation’s $1.84 EPS beat the expectation by 7.6%, and showed revenues of $1.8 billion. These numbers were in line with the year-ago performance, and came in after the company spent $4 billion on the Canopy acquisition.Top analysts are taking note of STZ. From Jefferies, Kevin Grundy (Track Record & Ratings) writes, “STZ announced its anticipated divestiture of value wine brands for $1.7B… Importantly the deal would remove a key overhang and shifts focus to more attractive areas of its portfolio… STZ remains top pick.” He gives the stock a $267 price target, suggesting room for a 34% upside.Amit Sharma (Track Record & Ratings), of BMO Capital, agrees with the upbeat outlook, saying that “Constellation Brands's FY20 outlook is likely conservative and believes it can generate continued multiple recovery from current levels, with added benefits coming from its free call option on Canopy.” Sharma’s price target for STZ is $225, indicating a 13% upside potential to the stock.It’s not just the analysts who are bullish on STZ – the stock holds a perfect 10 from the TipRanks Smart Score. The score is derived from eight factors that historically indicating a stock will outperform the markets, and among STZ’s strengths are bullish blogger opinions, increased hedge fund activity, and very bullish news sentiment.Overall, Constellation’s consensus rating is a strong buy, based on a unanimous 7 buy ratings delivered in the last three months. The stock’s average price target of $240 implies an upside of 21% from the current share price of $198.View STZ Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM – Research Report)In the tech sector, Qualcomm has been making headlines. The world's seventh largest semiconductor chip maker, by market share, has just reached a settlement with Apple, Inc. (AAPL) that ends a two-year battle over patent rights and royalty payments. On its face, the settlement favors Qualcomm, bringing the company a significant (although undisclosed) damages payment from Apple, along with a vendor agreement between the companies to last six years, with an option for two years’ renewal. Qualcomm saw a 3% dip in sales volume last year; this settlement with Apple bodes well for the company’s 2019 performance.In the days since the settlement announcement, top analysts have come to a quick agreement on QCOM shares. Canaccord Genuity’s Michael Walkley (Track Record & Ratings) writes in a research note, “Qualcomm will start supplying 5G modems for future iPhone generations with sales beginning to ramp in 4Q20. [The] licensing deal between the companies is a device-level licensing deal, which protects Qualcomm's long-term licensing business model.” His price target, $89, suggests room for an 11% upside – and that is after QCOM jumped 38% in the wake of the legal news.Jim Kelleher (Track Record & Ratings), of Argus, takes a similar line, saying, “Qualcomm shares have much further to go since the company has not yet started to monetize its significant intellectual property in 5G and multi-generation lead in 5G basebands… Qualcomm's litigation settlement represents a partial vindication of its licensing model and strategy.” His price target, at $95, is bullish and suggests an upside of 19% for QCOM.Qualcomm’s analyst consensus still reflects pre-settlement sentiment, which was a bit bearish in the face of a likely protracted court battle. The consensus view is ‘Moderate Buy,’ based on 11 buy ratings and 6 holds in the past three months. The average price target is $81 and the current share price is $79, implying a 1.5% upside. However, as the analyst reviews above suggest, the upside has room for growth.View QCOM Price Target & Analyst Ratings DetailThe moderate buy rating doesn’t prevent QCOM from holding a perfect 10 Smart Score, however. The bloggers are taking a bullish stance, market insiders are increasing their QCOM purchases, and investor and news sentiment on the company are all positive. UnitedHealth Group, Inc. (UNH – Research Report)UnitedHealth is the world’s largest health insurance provider, and another recession-proof stock. After all, everyone will need medical coverage at some point. United brought in over $225 billion in revenue worldwide last year, and beat the estimates for Q1 2019 profits in its report earlier this month.In addition to beating the profit estimate, UNH adjusted its 2019 full-year earnings guidance upward, from $14.55 to $14.65. The upwardly revised earnings comes despite some concern about the US election cycle, in which most of the Democratic Party challengers for the Presidential nomination are campaigning on some version of “Medicare for All,” with the possibility of banning private health insurance.Health industry market analysts, however, have focused on the company’s robust quarterly report. UNH was the first of the major health insurers to report quarterly earnings this season, and so it was watched closely. Raymond James analyst John Ransom (Track Record & Ratings) wrote, “UnitedHealth's stronger than expected Q1 EPS was driven by strong top line growth coupled with a lower Medical Loss Ratio, or MLR, and strong cost controls. That the company started the earnings season off right with its beat and raise report.” Ransom gives UNH a solid buy rating, but did not set a price target.Also taking a bullish stance is Steven Halper (Track Record & Ratings) from Cantor Fitzgerald, who described the Q1 results as strong and noted the increased 2019 earnings guidance. He suggested that recent weakness in the stock is “related to ongoing concerns about ‘Medicare for All’ proposals, which are entirely overblown.” Halper sets a $310 price target on this stock, indicating a possible 40% upside.UNH shares are currently selling for $221, so the $288 average price target gives them a 30% upside potential. Like Constellation above, UnitedHealth has unanimous ‘Strong Buy’ consensus rating, this one based on 6 buy ratings.View UNH Price Target & Analyst Ratings DetailLike the other stocks in this article, UNH has a perfect Smart Score of 10. The ‘Strong Buy’ consensus contributes, as do a bullish blogger stance, increased hedge fund purchases, and very positive investor sentiment. Strong fundamentals – increasing return on equity and asset growth – round out the smart score. Enjoy the Research Report on the Stocks in this Article:Constellation Brands, Inc.

Shares of health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, have bounced up and down this year, as Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders launched a renewed push for a ""Medicare for All"" plan that could replace private coverage and as Congressional committees grilled PBM executives over their role in soaring drug costs.  While Medicare for All has little chance of getting through a politically divided Congress, other Democrats support the idea, and the uncertainty produced by such a big potential change can make investors nervous."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-1q-earnings-snapshot-100322097.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-04-18	2019-04-18 16:44:00	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Dow Jones Industrial Average stands less than 1% short of its all-time closing high in midday trade	The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday midday was at the doorstep of a record close. At last check, the blue-chip index was less than 1% from its Oct. 3 peak, up 0.4% at 26,564, compared with its record put in last fall at 26,828.39, according to FactSet data. Thursday&apos;s climb was being supported by a rebound in shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. , which has been taking it on the chin, along with the rest of the health-care sector, this week. UnitedHealth&apos;s stock was up 1.7% or $3.73, while shares of insurer Travelers Cos. Inc. , up 2.9%, or $3.91, also were helping the Dow  creep toward a record, even after a brutal end to 2018 that saw the S&P 500 index  and Nasdaq Composite Index  all put in there most recent lows. All of the main U.S. equity benchmarks are within striking distance of all-time closing peaks.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/197a3456-152d-3427-82e0-995c1f6b5666/dow-jones-industrial-average.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-04-18	2019-04-18 12:20:34	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	If You Have the Stomach, Start Buying UNH Stock as It Bottoms Out	UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) delivered a perfect score Tuesday releasing Q1 2019 earnings that ticked all the boxes. Earnings? Up. Revenue? Up. Estimates? Beat on the top- and bottom-line. Yet, UNH stock dropped by more than 4%.Source: Shutterstock If you're a shareholder of UnitedHealth or other healthcare stocks selling healthcare plans, you've got to be worried that Bernie Sanders or one of the other Democratic candidates proposing a universal health care plan gets into office. Howard Schultz, who's against the proposal, recently had this to say about the idea of &quot;Medicare-for-All&quot;.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;The Democrats are now saying, 'Medicare-for-all.' That's their solution, which is basically a $33 trillion number, which would take 180 million Americans off of the insurance that's provided by their employer, wipe out the insurance industry. It's not realistic,&quot; Schultz told Yahoo Finance. Yikes. That's an ominous thought if you work for UnitedHealth or own UNH stock. If there's no insurance industry, can UnitedHealth remain in business?  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth It probably could. UnitedHealth's Other BusinessUnitedHealth has two reportable segments: UnitedHealthcare (health benefits) and Optum (health services).I'll admit I'm not a healthcare expert, but reading its 10-K, it would appear that most, if not all of Optum's revenues would remain intact in the event of a shift to universal healthcare. The only two areas of this segment that look to be at risk are Optum Financial Services, which operates health savings accounts, and OptumRx, which provides pharmacy care services to 65 million Americans through many of its health plans. But even there, it's possible that both of these areas would survive under universal healthcare. I know that here in Canada where I live there are lots of private insurers providing health and wellness benefits including pharmacy care above and beyond our government-run healthcare system. So, in 2018, Optum had $101.3 billion in revenue and 8.2 billion in operating earnings. Until we know otherwise, I would assume that a majority of this revenue would carry on under a universal healthcare plan.  What About UnitedHealthcare?This is where it gets a little dicey. Howard Schultz states a universal healthcare system like Medicare-for-All would wipe out the insurance industry. He's half right. What Schultz forgets is that somebody has to operate the insurance system that provides universal healthcare, for example an agency that takes care of paying the doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare workers covered under the system. The agency would also have to collect the money required to operate such a system from federal and state tax revenues. All of this takes an incredible amount of human resources. I don't see why someone like UnitedHealthcare couldn't be a critical piece of this &quot;Super&quot; agency. America is all about outsourcing. While the system of payment might change, some of the current players could take a role in transforming America's healthcare system. So, the fact that UnitedHealth CEO David Wichmann is harping about Sanders plan suggests he's positioning the company for a seat at the table. &quot;[Medicare-for-All would] surely jeopardize the relationship people have with their doctors, destabilize the nation's health system and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best,&quot; Wichmann stated. &quot;And the inherent cost burden would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs -- all without fundamentally increasing access to care.&quot;While I understand Wichmann's scare tactics, he has no way of knowing (same goes for Schultz, a so-called expert in healthcare) what the burden or cost will be on the American people. It's possible that more jobs could be created from a government-run system than currently exists. After all, a government-run system's goal is to break even while Mr. Wichmann has a board and shareholders to answer to. His viewpoint on cost, burden, etc., is completely biased. In 2018, UnitedHealth's health plan business generated $9.1 billion in operating profits from $183.5 billion in revenue. Optum made almost as much from 45% less revenue. It's also possible that UnitedHealth could end up making more from less than it currently does.  The Bottom Line on UNH StockIf you currently own UNH stock, I wouldn't start to get worried just yet. Even if Bernie Sanders were to get into power, it would take years to implement such a change. However, you need to ask yourself two questions.First, is the opportunity cost of patiently holding UNH stock when it's facing severe headwinds, worth it? After all, there are so many other stocks you could buy with better near-term prospects.Secondly, do you have the risk tolerance for riding this storm out?If you do, I'd be buying UNH stock at $220 and hoping it falls below $200, so you can buy some more. The choice is yours.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.52%.With record highs a stone's throw away, bullish option flows continue to suggest a retest is on the horizon. In the options pits, call activity surged yesterday, pushing overall volume back above average readings. Specifically, about 20.2 million calls and 14.8 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, the action at the CBOE mirrored that of the previous day with the single-session equity put/call volume holding steady at 0.58. The 10-day moving average remains at 0.59.Options traders flocked to the following three stocks: Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).Let's dig into the details: Proctor & Gamble (PG)The drumbeat of new highs continued for Proctor & Gamble on Tuesday. With the day's gains, the consumer staples stock pushed its year-to-date gains to 15.9%. Chart watchers continue to salivate over the consistency of its uptrend. The series of higher highs and lows has been relentless in 2019, and all major moving averages are rising beneath.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm Despite the substantial rise, PG stock still boasts a meaty dividend at 2.82%, and it is the allure of cash flow that landed the company atop yesterday's leaderboard. Traders harnessed the power of call options for short-term control of PG stock ahead of Wednesday's ex-dividend date. Its next quarterly dividend payment of 74.6 cents will be paid to shareholders.As is usually the case ahead of dividend dates, options traders went cuckoo for call options.On the options trading front, traders came after calls with a vengeance. Activity exploded to 1,232% of the average daily volume, with 204,899 total contracts traded; 85% of the trading came from call options alone.Implied volatility drifted sideways on the session at 20%, which places it at the 40th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are baking in daily moves of $1.37 or 1.3%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Traders played whack-a-mole with UNH stock after the healthcare company reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations. UnitedHealth raked in $3.60 of earnings-per-share on revenue of $60.31 billion. Both metrics topped analyst forecasts.And yet, the early morning gains melted as the recent proposals for &quot;Medicare-for-all&quot; by some Democrats running for president took root. Here's the money quote from CEO David Wichmann during the company's conference call: &quot;The wholesale disruption of American health care would surely jeopardize the relationship people have with their doctors, destabilize the nation's health system, and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best.&quot;UNH stock ended down 4.12% on the session, falling to a new 52-week low.On the options trading front, calls ruled the roost despite the early-morning rug pull. Activity grew to 881% of the average daily volume, with 160,336 total contracts traded. Calls claimed 65% of the total.The typical &quot;volatility crush&quot; in implied volatility following earnings was held at bay by the high uncertainty that came out of the conference call. Implied volatility remains sky high at 34% or the 73rd percentile of its one-year range. Traders continue to expect daily moves of $4.69 or 2.1%. Qualcomm (QCOM)An unexpected settlement to Qualcomm's multi-year legal battle with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was announced yesterday, and the chipmaker is zooming to the moon. When the news hit the wires, QCOM stock rocketed 20% higher. The buying has continued unabated in after-hours trading, and QCOM is up another 12%. That means it will open at a new four-and-a-half year high.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth The only resistance level that remains between Qualcomm and new record highs is the 2014 peak of $81.97. And with the rapid repricing going on over the past 24 hours, the stock could get there in a hurry.As you might expect, calls dominated the day by a large margin. Total activity climbed to 492% of the average daily volume, with 361,393 contracts traded; 80% of the day's take fell on the call side of the ledger.Implied volatility dropped to 34% placing it at the 56th percentile of its one-year range.

2019-04-17	2019-04-17 12:09:41	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Trade of the Day: UnitedHealth Stock Is Primed for a Counter-Trend Trade	Although the healthcare sector of the S&P 500 is still higher by a little more than 3% for the year, year-to-date it is the worst performing sector of the index. Within this space, shares of health insurance companies such as UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) have fared worse than the average stock in the sector but are now reaching record-setting oversold readings. As such, active traders and investors could look for a counter-trend trade setup in UNH stock.Source: Shutterstock A cornerstone of my market analysis approach is closely monitoring sector and group rotation. After all, money is always looking to find the best place to be, meaning the sector and group rotation within the stock market never stops. This also means that from a market participant's perspective, playing sector and group rotation is one of the very few strategies that stands a good chance of being profitable in bull, bear or sideways markets.Before looking at the charts it is important to highlight that the healthcare sector as per my Market Rover dashboard tool is currently both short- and medium-term bearish, yet it remains bullish in the longer term. In that vein, the bullish trade idea we are looking at today is a so-called &quot;counter-trend&quot; trade … and it's not one that I'm looking to overstay my welcome in for the time being.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm For some perspective let's note that over the course of the past four months UNH stock has worked its way from the very upper-end of its longer-standing up-trend to the very lower end. While this price action looks ugly from a bull's perspective, it is also notable that the stock is now at record oversold levels from a momentum perspective, as noted by the weekly MACD indicator at the bottom of the chart. UNH Stock Charts  Click to EnlargeMoving averages legend: red - 200 week, blue - 100 week, yellow - 50 weekOn the daily chart, we see that UNH stock found notable resistance at a confluence of its medium-term moving averages in March. Although the stock fell to fresh YTD lows this week on the back of concerns around &quot;free healthcare for everyone&quot; headlines, from a momentum perspective it has so far failed to make new lows, giving us so-called &quot;positive divergence&quot; from its price.

2019-04-16	2019-04-16 19:31:14	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	5 Healthcare Stocks to Watch If America Chooses a Single-Payer System	Even for the brightest among us, our current healthcare system is a convoluted mess that's difficult to fully understand. With terms like HMOs, PPOs and PFPMs, searching for the right coverage is often as desirable as doing your taxes. However, a political movement to simplify the system has serious implications for you and your portfolio (via healthcare stocks).Earlier this week, Senator Bernie Sanders explained his ambitious plan for a single-payer healthcare system. Broadly, what this entails is that all Americans will enjoy comprehensive health coverage. Under his &quot;Medicare for All Act,&quot; patients won't have to pay out of pocket for doctor visitations. It has raised eyebrows because the proposal is considerably more generous than other single-payer countries.Even more startling for both supporters and opponents, Sanders' plan has generated significant support. In particular, presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand cosponsored the bill. With momentum rising, so too has the importance for healthcare stocks to watch.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the striking components of Sanders' plan is its scope. If it passes, all invoices will eventually go to the federal government. Theoretically, this approach does away with some of the volatile pricing imposed within the current system. But such pricing changes would severely impact healthcare stocks.Another sticking point regarding this comprehensive proposal is a possible existential crisis. In many ways, healthcare stocks exist because our broader medical umbrella is so convoluted. Plus, pharmaceuticals can radically hike drug prices, knowing that insurers and patients have little recourse.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth Of course, paying for a new system would require a substantial tax influx. Sanders hasn't provided a convincing financial plan to accommodate his bill. Nevertheless, the current political environment suggests a change is coming. Here are five healthcare stocks to watch, just in case. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Source: Shutterstock On Thursday, shares of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) tumbled over 4%, and I can't say that I'm surprised. Sure, the commonly cited explanation for why UNH stock took a hit was an analyst downgrade. But the reality is that among healthcare stocks to watch, insurance providers suffer the most risk.Naturally, the Medicare for All Act weighs heavily on UNH stock. Insurers thrive on both the complexity of our healthcare system and the necessity for it. Going without insurance just isn't smart, considering the likelihood of a catastrophic event or disease. According to a shocking BBC report last year, cancer is rising everywhere, including in developed nations.Moreover, fighting that awful disease isn't cheap, with average treatments running well into six digits. The threat of financial ruin is enough for people to run to insurance companies. But with government-endorsed mandated coverage, it's unclear how for-profit insurers like UNH stock can thrive. Cigna (CI)Source: Shutterstock Also on Thursday, shares of Cigna (NYSE:CI) fell sharply, losing 2.5%. Again, I'm not surprised. Compared to other healthcare stocks to watch, CI stock faces an existential threat. If the Medicare for All Act passes, it has severe implications for the insurance company.As we discussed, Sanders' plan is incredibly comprehensive. In his vision of a covered America, no one reaches into their wallets. Whether you're seeing a doctor, getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist's office, or trying on a new pair of eyeglasses, sticker shock in this arena will be obsolete.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm Of course, the problem is that CI stock thrives on this sticker shock. When you cut through all the corporate BS, you realize that the insurance industry prospers on fear. But a government-mandated coverage plan eliminates that fear with a safety net. Thus, I'm currently hesitant on Cigna, and other insurance-related healthcare stocks. Pfizer (PFE)Source:  Kojach Via FlickrAlthough insurance companies present an easy target in light of recent political developments, pharmaceuticals can't dodge the bullet, either. Investors and especially current shareholders of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) should adopt a very cautious stance. On Thursday, PFE stock dipped more than 1%.As with the first two healthcare stocks to watch, Pfizer's pensive trading isn't surprising. In prior generations, a rising tide lifted all boats. But in the next few years, a receding tide could strand everyone. That might be the case for PFE stock, and similar rivals in the pharmaceutical space.As the controversy surrounding the &quot;pharma bro&quot; incident revealed, pharmaceuticals can get away with charging ridiculous prices. But with the Medicare for All Act, that type of predatory behavior -- or even robust capitalism -- stops. When you have to answer to the federal government, suddenly, everyone plays nice.That's great for patients, but not so much for PFE stock. Boston Scientific (BSX)Source: Boston Scientific Ordinally, I wouldn't issue a cautionary note on Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX). As one of the world's premiere medical-equipment providers, BSX stock represents a life-saving investment. Plus, shares have generally performed well following the aftermath of the Great Recession.Unfortunately, that might change in the coming years, especially if the Medicare for All Act passes. Similar to the plight of other medical stocks to watch, Boston Scientific absorbed a noticeable 1% decline on Thursday. That's just the beginning if the worst-case scenario occurs.  * 10 Dividend Growth Stocks You Can't Miss Primarily, BSX stock will essentially lose out on a free market. Instead, a government-imposed network will dictate product pricing and other core details. Essentially, this eliminates the profit motive for Boston Scientific. Since many developed countries have some sort of single-payer system, BSX must cope with the loss of a viable partner. HCA Healthcare (HCA)Source: Shutterstock On surface level, HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) should be one of the healthcare stocks to watch…for a positive reason. Following the end of the Obama administration, Gallup reported a conspicuous rise in the number of uninsured Americans. But under Medicare for All, the insured will likely represent a surge in demand for HCA stock.That's a strong benefit, but it's probably not a net benefit. I say this because the markets really punished HCA stock on Thursday, dropping it down nearly 3%. The most common explanation is that the rest of the sector was also volatile. If other segments within the healthcare industry falls, so too will HCA.But the overriding factor behind the single-payer proposal is big government. So even if the uninsured flock to hospitals and clinics, they can't adopt capitalistic pricing. Instead, the feds will oversee everything, ensuring everyone has access to equal and &quot;fair&quot; healthcare.It's a great deal for patients, but not so much for hospitals, or anyone in this industry for that matter.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The health insurer's stock sank 4.3% on Thursday, to bring the combined 2-day loss to 9.4%, the biggest two-day tumble since plunged 9.4% over the 2 days ending March 3, 2009. Sanders’s plan would create a single-payer health care system to replace the current job-based and individual private health insurance system. Raymond James analyst Chris Meekins said the largest impact by far would be on health insurers. The health care sector was the only one of the S&P 500's  11 sectors that was declining Friday.

2019-04-12	2019-04-12 11:36:32	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: ConocoPhillips, Caterpillar and Morgan Stanley	Stocks were back and forth all day on Thursday, and by the time the closing bell rang, the game ended in a tie. The S&P 500 only mustered an 0.11 point gain yesterday, which wasn't even enough to register a percentage change. Underscoring the lack of conviction behind the action is the fact that yesterday's was the lowest-volume day in months.Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) wasn't fazed by the broad lethargy. Its budding recovery effort was bolstered by whispers that it would soon be putting itself up for sale, sparking a 3.9% advance. At the other end of the spectrum, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) fell 4.3% on the heels of growing political uncertainty regarding the future healthcare. Thursday's jaw-dropper was the 10% tumble Weight Watchers (NASDAQ:WTW), now called WW, took after JPMorgan analyst Christina Brathwaite rang the alarm bells about the company even louder than she had been.Headed into the week's final trading session, the stock charts of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) are worth the closest looks. Here's why, and what's about to happen.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips ConocoPhillips (COP)Most oil stocks are doing reasonably well, catching a tailwind driven by the rising price of oil. That dynamic, however, hasn't applied universally. The oil names that aren't being picked up by that rising tide stand out -- and do so for the wrong reason.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives ConocoPhillips is one of those names, and worse, is knocking on the door of a major breakdown. One more poor day could push COP over the edge.  Click to Enlarge • The line to watch is right at $65, plotted with a red dashed line on the daily chart. That's where ConocoPhillips has made lows since February, and where it found support before the December drubbing.• There may be even more to that technical floor than readily meets the eye. Plotting Fibonacci retracement lines from the well-established floor at $42 from 2017, the $65.60 area is also a key 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line. Notice the other Fibonacci line at $56.60 has also been a key support level.• It's subtle, and perhaps means little. But, yesterday's small pullback took shape on huge volume. There could be a lot of sellers just waiting in the wings for a triggering event. Caterpillar (CAT)Last year was a tough one for Caterpillar, and by extension, for CAT shareholders. After a fantastic 2017 that served up promise of a major earnings revival, fears of rising steel prices and a tariff war put Caterpillar shares back in a downtrend. From its January-2018 peak near $173 to October's low of $112, CAT stock lost a total of 35% from high to low.Over the course of the past few months, however, we've seen hints that the downtrend has been snapped. The new uptrend isn't fully formed yet, but the lines in the sand are very well defined.  Click to Enlarge • The key from here is getting above $142.80, where Caterpillar peaked a couple of times since October's capitulatory low. That resistance level is plotted in yellow on both stock charts.• At the same time, since October's bottom, the bulls have managed to form a clear rising support line, plotted in red on both stock charts.• While a move above $142.80 is still the make-or-break event, the possibility of that happening is bolstered by the golden cross that formed on Thursday. That's where the purple 50-day moving average line crosses above the white 200-day line. Morgan Stanley (MS)When we last looked at Morgan Stanley back on April 5, we were impressed by the breakout thrust that attacked the 200-day moving average line, but were concerned about a gap that had been left behind in the process. It was a perfect setup for the bears to push back.And they did, as would be expected with any fresh encounter with a major moving average line. It's what happened in the meantime and what's about to happen that makes MS worth a refreshed look.  Click to Enlarge • Morgan Stanley danced with the 200-day moving average line for a day, but slipped back under it. That slide, however, was just enough to almost close the gap that had been left behind on the April 3.• At the same time, the technical ceiling around $45, marked with a yellow dashed line on both charts, still stands and augments the potential resistance made by the 200-day moving average line.• Though not yet over that one last hump, if Morgan Stanley shares can clear that line, there's little left to hold a rally back.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-11	2019-04-11 20:08:22	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	5 Top Stock Trades for Friday: CGC, CVS, ICPT, RAD, UNH	Stocks are stagnating lower on Thursday, but aren't declining with any real staying power. As boring as that action can be, investors need to be careful not to overtrade. If need be, walk away from your desk for a while and get some fresh air. Then come back and let's talk about some top stock trades. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Rite AidShares of Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) are making new lows (what else is new) as the company reported fourth-quarter earnings. RAD missed on earnings and revenue estimates, provided weak guidance and announced 1:20 reverse split.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives Let's put it this way: A healthy company doesn't reverse split.We've said to avoid RAD stock over and over throughout the years. The company is circling the drain and there's no reason to trade this one when there's so many other options out there. Even shorts can be burned by a temporary squeeze. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: CVS HealthA cheap valuation, decent growth and a solid dividend aren't enough to support CVS Health (NYSE:CVS). I highlighted this one as a trade last month before shares promptly jumped about 10%. Since then though, the stock has come back down to this $52 level twice now.If it gets there again, will it hold as support? The chart looks grim and while I was a buyer on the initial test of $52, I'm not now. There's no telling where this will find support if the recent lows give way.On the upside, CVS needs to get above downtrend resistance and the 20-day moving average. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: UnitedHealthUnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) has a similar chart, with downtrend resistance squeezing the share price into repeated support. Uptrend support (purple line) has given way, so it's all up to bulls to step up to the plate between Thursday's lows and $235.A drop below $230 puts UNH in no man's land for the time being. If it holds, see if UNH can get above $246 to $250 on a rally. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Canopy GrowthRemember when we talked about the very slow consolidation in Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) stock a few months ago? We ended up stopping out of this one as uptrend support and the 50-day moving average gave way.It looked like $42 was going to hold up as support, but it wasn't worth the risk to us. As you can see in April though, $42 actually turned into resistance after acting as temporary support.CGC may pull in some buyers near the 200-day, but cannabis stocks like CGC, Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON), Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) and others are under pressure. It's not clear yet whether the 200-day will act as support.If it does, bulls have a clear line in the sand. If not, look for potential short-term support in the $37 to $38 area. Below that and ~$34 is in the cards. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Intercept PharmaceuticalsDisappointing late-stage data disappointed investors in Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ICPT), which is down almost 13% on the day as a result.Prior resistance near $115 did not act as support, as ICPT is knifing through all three major moving averages on Thursday. It's not a good look for bulls. If ICPT can't get back above the 200-day and 50-day moving averages, or if it does temporarily but they turn into resistance, then the stock could be heading lower.  * 8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off If that's the case, a test of uptrend support is certainly possible, currently about $15 or 14.3% below current levels. If shares bounce from current levels, look for a retest of $115 and see how ICPT does then.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-04-11	2019-04-11 19:11:17	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	15 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019	[Editor's note: This story was previously published in November 2018. It has since been updated and republished.]In early June of 2018, J.P. Morgan strategist Marko Kolanovic made a startling statement. He said that, since March 2018, President Donald Trump's tough stance on fair trade practices had evaporated more than $1 trillion in market value. Such a drastic impact exponentially raises interest in safe dividend stocks to buy.Of course, since Kolanovic's analysis went public, the markets have reasserted themselves. However, that still doesn't take away from investors' uneasiness with the White House's economic policies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf only the trade conflict was the sole problem we faced! Along with other geopolitical hotspots, our domestic standing has turned into shambles. Honestly, I cannot keep track of all the accusations and indictments flying around.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives Trump claimed that if he were ever impeached, the markets will fall off the rails. I can't say one way or another. What I do know for sure is that the markets prefer reasonable predictability. Right now, we're experiencing anything but that. To better protect your portfolio, consider these 15 safe dividend stocks to buy: American Express (AXP)Dividend Yield: 1.4%Credit-card company American Express (NYSE:AXP), offering a yield of 1.4%, isn't the most generous of dividend stocks. However, in my opinion, it's one of the safest places to earn passive income.Let's get the low-hanging fruit out of the way. First, American Express is a well-known and established credit provider and financial institution. This is a business that will likely not fade into obscurity, irrespective of economic conditions. Moreover, AXP caters to an affluent client base relative to its competitors.Second, AXP has significant international expansion opportunities. While American Express enjoys acceptance in over 130 countries, that's significantly below MasterCard's (NYSE:MA) 210-plus countries. And MasterCard isn't the number one credit card … Visa (NYSE:V) is.While seemingly a disadvantage, this allows AXP to steal market share. Based on its resurgent revenue stream, the company is on the right track. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Dividend Yield: 5%I must admit that I'm not the biggest fan of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). By their nature, insurance providers don't offer the most upside potential in the markets.That said, health insurance is, and will continue to be a massively lucratively market, if only for cynical reasons. In July, I mentioned that the average American lifestyle is shockingly unhealthy. Furthermore, we're simply not kicking our habit of eating processed foods and living sedentary lives.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives Beyond that, UNH features consistently strong revenue growth, and barring unusual events, this year will be no different. On the yield front, UNH again isn't the most lavish among dividend stocks to buy. But the company's very predictable free cash flow and overall industry provide significant confidence for prospective investors. Disney (DIS)Dividend Yield: 1.57%It's not often that you celebrate professional failure. But for Disney (NYSE:DIS), Wall Street apparently sees the silver lining after the iconic entertainment firm lost a bidding war to long-time rival Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). At stake was British television company Sky (OTCMKTS:SKYAY).On the surface, you could understand the near-desperation with which the two media titans fought. Sky opens the door to the lucrative European TV market. Comcast, in particular, lost out to Disney over another protracted battle for Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA). Call it the male ego gone wild, but Comcast wasn't leaving this battlefield empty-handed.CMCSA shareholders, though, had a differing opinion. This is a huge, expensive bet that Comcast can turn itself around due to Sky. Subsequently, CMCSA dropped 6% on the announcement, while DIS stock gained slightly over 2%.The best part for DIS shareholders is that they know management has free reign to expand without an excessively onerous weight. Sky certainly offered benefits, but they also brought with them traditional-TV baggage. Boeing (BA)Dividend Yield: 2.1%Thanks to a recent hissy fit with an iconic motorcycle manufacturer, President Trump is steadily running out of high-profile supporters. But one company stands in the batter's box that is safe from Trump's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) outbursts: Boeing (NYSE:BA).Let's get the obvious out of the way: Boeing manufacturers the most important airplane in the world, Air Force One. While Trump shows no mercy when he's upset at something or someone, even he can't go toe-to-toe with BA. The optics of a President attacking Boeing just won't fly.More importantly, BA stock has proven relatively immune to the ongoing China tariffs. Despite the White House imposing broad-scale sanctions, the Chinese have been measured in their response. As a result, Boeing's management team forecasts continued growth in China despite obvious geopolitical challenges.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives They have a right to be confident. China has left open the door for large airplanes, signaling that they recognize BA quality. Thus, while Boeing's 2.1% yield isn't the most attractive for dividend stocks, it should prove incredibly safe. Apple (AAPL)Dividend Yield: 1.5%In terms of upside growth, I'm not a huge fan of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Don't get this wrong: I'm in awe of what the late Steve Jobs has done in turning a garage-based company into a global behemoth. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that AAPL is still a consumer-electronics investment, which has pros and cons.The obvious benefit to owning AAPL is that today, it's the undisputed king. Everybody clamors for the latest iPhone or whatever gadget Apple is selling next. The company has also become a cultural phenomenon.That said, the inherent risk is that Apple becomes mired in a commoditized market. For instance, peak smartphone has become an increasingly painful reality. You can't really distinguish among devices nowadays, which hurts AAPL unless management can spark excitement again.But if your primary focus is buying safe dividend stocks, AAPL offers an excellent look. The company features strong earnings and predictable FCF, and sits on nearly $86.5 billion of cash. United Technologies (UTX)Dividend Yield: 2.23%In my view, United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) offers a safe, predictable route to both upside gains and passive income.In the markets, UTX would fall under many conservative analysts' bag of stocks to buy. Primarily, United Technologies owns the Pratt & Whitney division that powers our most advanced warcraft. This comes in handy with our dealings with North Korea. Despite admittedly positive developments, we're still negotiating with a despot.History tells me that North Korea will break any peace agreement. This is why I stand with former President Theodore Roosevelt: speak softly and carry a big stick.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives For those who love safe dividend stocks, UTX offers a great look. The company has excellent financials, which includes steadily rising revenues and strong earnings. Additionally, I like the predictability of United Technologies' cash flow. Walmart (WMT)Dividend Yield: 2.2%Only in recent years have analysts considered retail plays as stocks to buy. And even then, they apply significant caution into the names they pick. Thanks to the emergence of e-commerce -- and by e-commerce, I mean Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) -- brick-and-mortars have struggled for traction and relevancy.But Walmart (NYSE:WMT) should emerge not only unscathed but vastly improved. Management looked at Amazon's success and began shoring up their own e-commerce channels. Despite being a retail fixture for decades, WMT is proving technologically adept. As an example, management is turning to the blockchain to help contain food poisoning.WMT also levers the substantial advantage of having a physical presence. No matter how great online shopping is, nothing beats going out to the store and attaining instant satisfaction. Plus, WMT sells everything, with some stores open 24 hours.In other words, WMT is one of the safest dividend stocks to buy because Amazon can't topple its moat. Amgen (AMGN)Dividend Yield: 3%The pharmaceutical sector is always a tough business. Should a proposed drug fail to meet expectations during clinical trials, a lesser-financed outfit could quickly crumble. Add to this mix the political environment, and you have a combustible recipe.Still, I believe Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) offers a distinctive and positive approach to the sector. Unlike other pharma giants, AMGN focuses on a handful of therapies that work. Yes, nominally, they're very expensive. However, they're for extremely serious diseases and conditions, and are not taken frequently.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives As a result, AMGN stock is a decisive winner, having gained around 11% in the last year. Moreover, the company features enticing fundamental strengths. Amgen puts up consistently positive earnings, as well as predictable FCF. It also has over $29 billion in cash, providing confidence for its 3% dividend yield. Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP)Dividend Yield: 2.5%Soft-drink giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has had a rough time  dealing with changing consumer habits. Americans, especially the younger demographic, eschew sugary beverages for healthier alternatives.Overall, I see Coca-Cola making the changes it needs to stay relevant in this ultra-competitive sector. However, I'm particularly intrigued with Coca-Cola European Partners (NYSE:CCEP). CCEP has shot up over 11% YTD. Coca-Cola's European bottler and distributor also pays out a fairly generous 2.5% dividend yield.While it has enjoyed a good year so far, CCEP has the goods to continue moving further down the road. While most people around the world are shifting towards healthy food and beverage options, the numbers speak the loudest. In western Europe, the market value of soft drinks have steadily risen over the past several years.That signals to me that CCEP benefits from a growing industry. Moreover, it has the fundamental stability to keep its attractive yield intact. Procter & Gamble (PG)Dividend Yield: 2.77%Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a decidedly unsexy investment. A consumer-staples play, nobody really clamors to add PG stock to their portfolio. It's just there in case you need a usually dependable stock to protect yourself.In 2019, PG has gained 13.5%. Part of the recovery is likely due to its 2.77% dividend yield, which should prove very sustainable.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives For one thing, PG has an undeniable hold on consumer staples. No matter what, people have to buy things like soap, detergents and cold medicines. Second, the company has steadily grown its top and bottom lines, and it features robust FCF. J.M. Smucker (SJM)Dividend Yield: 2.9%J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) earnings results have been mixed in recent years. However, one point to consider is its industry. As a popular food and beverage provider, the company's products will never go out of style. That provides a measure of reassurance, especially if the markets hit unforeseen headwinds.Furthermore, J.M. Smucker is one of the more generous safe dividend stocks to buy with a 2.9% yield. Thanks to relatively consistent earnings and positive FCF, investors can confidently rely on SJM. Harley-Davidson (HOG)Dividend Yield: 3.8%In 2018, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) experienced a double-whammy. As alluded to earlier, President Trump lashed out on HOG because management doesn't agree with his stance on tariffs. That opposition doesn't come as a surprise since HOG faces a demographic challenge. Not many young people desire Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which sounds almost sacrilegious.The other problem is that HOG has disappointed in the markets. On a 12-month basis, shares are down nearly 7%. With the ongoing China tariffs, Wall Street doesn't feel comfortable with the motorcycle manufacturer's growth prospects.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives But let's agive credit to management, which isn't taking consumer trends lying down. Instead, it's diving into relevant segments, such as committing to electric motorcycles. While it doesn't look great now, I think patient investors will be very happy with HOG in the future, and the 13% gain of HOG stock in 2019 shows that investors think it's on the right track. Exxon Mobil (XOM)Dividend Yield: 4%Usually, safe dividend stocks to buy offer limited passive income. That's basically how the free market works: if you want additional rewards, you must ramp up the risk. But for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), its 4% dividend yield is as good as gold.Actually, right now, it's better than gold for one simple reason: have you seen gas prices recently? You better believe that the current oil market has benefitted XOM stock. In 2019, shares are up almost 20%.Despite our greenbacks being generally stronger than other currencies, we're going to feel more pain at the pump. In addition to North Korea, Trump is taking on Iran. Through sanctions, he hopes to bring Iran to the negotiating table, with denuclearization an absolute must.The problem is that Iran exports two million barrels of crude oil daily. Undoubtedly, we can win a war of attrition with the Middle Eastern nation. However, it will cost us. Unless that is, you're a XOM shareholder. International Business Machines (IBM)Dividend Yield: 4.4%International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is another one of those dividend stocks that have tried investors' patience. Although it has earned a powerful reputation in the tech sector, many people regard IBM as a legacy company. But that doesn't mean this old dog is forever doomed to be irrelevant.Remember that tidbit earlier about Walmart using the blockchain to help eliminate food-poisoning cases? Well, the provider of the blockchain platform is none other than IBM. I believe it's incredibly significant that Walmart could have gone with any number of options. Instead, it went with IBM, not some upstart competitor promising much but delivering little.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives Plus, IBM has the foundational strength to support its 4.4% dividend yield.  It has consistently positive earnings, as well as reliable FCF. Finally, IBM is sitting on over $12 billion of cash. AT&T (T)Dividend Yield: 6.45%No one doubts that AT&T (NYSE:T) is a favorite among dividend stocks. The telecom giant currently offers nearly a 6.45% yield, which is better than some blue chips' equity-market returns.That said, analysts have debated whether or not T stock is worth its yield. Management has incurred significant debt to get to where it is. AT&T is exposed to disparate businesses, which has its own risks.But with the 5G rollout, I don't think you can afford to ignore T stock. Sure, rival Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) stole AT&T's thunder by becoming the world's first commercial 5G service provider. And I think VZ can do very well with their first-to-market advantage.However, AT&T is taking extra time to do things right, where they will roll out 5G using only standard equipment. Over the long run, the smart money favors T stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont unveiled a new version of his “Medicare-for-all” plan on Wednesday, sparking renewed discussion about what such a plan would cost and how it might affect the many different stakeholders in the health care space.  Sanders’s proposal would create a single-payer health care system where a government-run plan guaranteeing coverage for all would replace the current job-based and individual private health insurance system.  This new version of Sanders’s Medicare-for-all plan comes at a time when the health-care sector has been significantly underperforming the S&P 500  (SPX) .The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF  (XLV) has gained 4.4% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 has gained 15%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a30ec4f5-077a-3b63-b2a9-63e0e67afa5e/what-%E2%80%98medicare-for-all%E2%80%99-would.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-04-02	2019-04-02 15:58:14	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Healthcare Stocks to Trade Now	On Monday, the equity markets started the quarter as strong as they ended the first one. The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, yet the healthcare sector was flattish red. It's a bit concerning to see a sector fall as the rest of the market rallies. So is it time to bail out on healthcare stocks?The answer is no, but it's more complicated than that because of the political risk. For as long as I can remember, healthcare stocks have been the target of political hate. Both Democrats and Republicans like beating up on these stocks while they use them for their soap boxes. This became very true during the 2016 elections when both sides of the drug companies became political footballs. Even now, the Republicans want to repeal Obamacare, and both sides want to gloat about crippling their pricing models. Either way, healthcare and drug companies are in the crosshairs.The overall macroeconomic environment still favors the long trade on Wall Street. But this sector has to swim upstream as it fights the added political current. It can do it but the approach is not as easy as finding good fundamentals to bet on. Going long healthcare stocks requires technical help and the positions should be as diverse as possible.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best ETFs for 2019: A Close Race at the Front But there are a few strong tickers within the healthcare sector that I would trade right here regardless of the extrinsic threats. Here are three to consider: Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV)Source: Shutterstock First, I'd bet on a sector exchange-traded fund and there are many to choose from. At this stage, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLV) best represents the opportunity at hand. It is a basket of great companies proven for the long term. More importantly, and given all the geopolitical risk, the major tickers that make up the XLV pay a handsome dividend. This provides support if we were to have another market wide tizzy because of Brexit or the tariff wars.Furthermore, Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and United Healthcare (NYSE:UNH), which are the top three holdings and comprise almost 25% of the ETF, have reasons to continue to their rallies. So buying the XLV is an easy way to bet on the whole sector without the risk of specific stock headlines. We recently saw what happened to Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) when they announced the failure of their Alzheimer drug. Johnson and Johnson (JNJ)Source: Shutterstock Late last year, Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) had a headline scare and the stock fell 15% on the headline. They came under fire as they were accused of wrong doing with their Talcum baby powder product. The good news is that it is now clear that management didn't act maliciously. Mistakes happen and sometimes they have tragic consequences but the real problems are when the companies do evil things and this is not the case.Fundamentally, this is still a solid company with over 100 years of proven performance. It will take more than one incident to break it for good.The other saving grace was that when JNJ stock fell last year it did so from an all-time high. This would have been necessary regardless, so the Talc headline merely pushed the time table a bit. This doesn't diminish from the serious illnesses but from a stock perspective, investors over reacted on the headline and have since been clawing back their way.The opportunity in JNJ stock lies in the technicals. Since the drop to $121 per share, the stock has steadily recovered with a series of higher highs and higher lows. The $134 ledge was important for the bulls to retake as it is pivotal.  * 7 ETFs to Buy for Serious Diversification Now JNJ stock is butting up against another potential resistance zone but it's also an opportunity. If the buyers can breakout of $140.60, then they can spike again to target the all-time highs once more. This would also close the Dec. 14 gap. This won't be easy and Johnson and Johnson stock will need the market in general to help. AbbVie (ABBV)Source: Shutterstock The AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) stock cratered on its last earnings report. But its problems started in January 2018 and since then, ABBV stock is down 35% from the closing high.But therein lies the opportunity.The descent in ABBV has developed a sharp descending wedge that needs to resolve itself soon. This is an intense series of lower highs and lower lows that is forming a bottom. The outcome from here is usually a sharp reversal and the bounce carries huge potential. But conversely, if the bottoming process fails, then it would become yet another ledge for even lower lows.Since February, ABBV stock has had higher lows, which usually increase the odds that the bottom is in. But the bulls are running into a wall at the $81 per share zone. So they need a strong push into it so that they can fill the gap all the way to $86. This will be easier said than done but it is the technical opportunity here.Meanwhile, it is imperative that the bulls maintain footing below, so they need to hold $79 per share, or else they risk losing the momentum that they so desperately need to breach the band of resistance.Usually when a quality stock knocks on a roof so many times it increases the odds of breaking through at the slightest trigger. And the move that follows is usually exaggerated, so ABBV has a chance at some redemption.This, of course, is a tactical trade, so I would set hard stop-loss orders for an escape if the short-term support fails.The exact trigger for ABBV stock will be the next earnings report. The reaction to the last one was horrendous as the stock fell 15%. So this will be management's chance to redeem themselves and deliver results that exceed expectations. Looking back in recent history there are no back-to-back negative ABBV earnings reactions on the stock chart.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

Todd Shriber's pick for the contest is the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (NYSEARCA:IHF).The healthcare sector, the second-largest sector weight in the S&P 500, performed a best-to-worst act in the first quarter of 2019. Healthcare was the best-performing sector in the S&P 500 last year. This year, the opposite is true.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLV), the largest healthcare exchange traded fund (ETF) by assets, is up 7% year-to-date compared to a gain of 12.20% for the S&P 500. The iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (NYSEARCA:IHF), my pick for this year's best ETFs contest, is an even more egregious laggard with a year-to-date loss of 1%. What Happened to the IHF ETF?Excuses are not the objective of this piece, but looking back at what has plagued IHF in the first quarter can be instructive. With the exception of the &quot;growth-ier&quot; areas of healthcare, namely biotechnology and medical devices, the sector, as noted above, has been a laggard to start 2019.Perhaps some of the sector's laggard status to start 2019 is investors taking profits in the group following a solid 2018 or market participants moving into more exciting sectors, such as technology. With IHF, however, the reasons for the fund's first-quarter struggles are more easily identified.Entering this year, my thesis for IHF was that the fund could benefit from the Democrats controlling the House of Representatives. As is often noted, healthcare, perhaps more than any other sector, can benefit or be hampered by political wranglings on Capitol Hill.This is not political commentary, but the fact that so many of the Democrat contenders for that party's 2020 presidential nomination favor Medicare For All has been a significant drag on IHF stock. IHF holds 47 stocks, but just two -- UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) and Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) -- really drive IHF's price action because that duo combines for over 36% of the fund's weight.  * 10 F-Rated Stocks to Sell in This Narrow Market Fortunately, shares of Anthem are up nearly 13% this year because UnitedHealth stock is lower by nearly 1%, making that stock one of the worst-performing members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The impact of Medicare For All speculation has been palpable, particularly for UnitedHealth.Muddying the waters for stocks like UnitedHealth and funds such as IHF is talk among some analysts that although Wall Street does not expect Medicare For All to happen, investors should not expect a snapback rally in managed care stocks once it becomes apparent that single-payer healthcare will not take hold in the U.S.&quot;In our view, the bill has no chance of passing the [Republican]-controlled Senate and probably little chance even in the [Democrat]-controlled House given Speaker Pelosi's apparent ambivalence,&quot; JPMorgan analyst Gary Taylor said in a recent note, reports MarketWatch.However, Taylor notes the Medicare For All Debate is weighing on the healthcare sector and making investors &quot;wary&quot; of being involved with the group. Bottom Line on IHFYes, IHF's YTD loss is small at this point, but there is some risk here, particularly if the fund falls below $165 on heavy volume. At this point in the year, investors have only pulled $4 million from IHF, which could be a sign some are waiting for the Medicare For All debate to blow over.Knowing exactly when that debate will be quashed is another matter altogether. Investors considering IHF over the near-term should monitor shares of UnitedHealth for clues about the near-term validity of the IHF thesis.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Shares of companies with heavier exposure to Medicaid were in the lead, with Molina Healthcare, Inc.  shares falling 6.6%, Centene Corporation  shares falling 2% and WellCare Health Plans Inc.  shares slipping 1.8%. Shares of more diversified, large-cap companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated , Cigna Corporation , Humana Inc.  and Anthem Inc.  slipped as well. &quot;The space could see continued weakness on the back of the DOJ brief,&quot; Jefferies health-care trader Jared Holz told MarketWatch in an email. He said he thinks an actual law change would be unlikely, since that would require support from both the House and the Senate. &quot;The greater significance here near-term could be additional headline risk adding to an already tenuous ground for insurers,&quot; he said. The ruling was a departure for the Justice Department, which had previously sought to cut only protections for pre-existing conditions.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/c06400a0-ecd0-373a-836d-2eb3cebe96c0/health-insurance-stocks-fall.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-03-25	2019-03-25 10:46:00	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Big Stock Charts for Monday: Twitter, UnitedHealth Group and Philip Morris	Pow! A little fear went a long way on Friday, exacerbated by Thursday's surprisingly big advance. When all was said and done, the S&P 500 lost 1.9% on the last trading day of last week. Yet, it's still above all the key moving average lines. Assume nothing.Nokia (NYSE:NOK) did the most damage, losing more than 6% following reports that it was investigating the terms and conditions of a business acquisition made in 2016. Though not likely, any discovery of issues could lead to penalties. DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) logged a much bigger loss though, off more than 9% after analysts with Spruce Point suggests DXCM shares could be cut in half as competition within the glucose monitoring system market heats up.Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) tried to resist the tide, advancing 2.5% as investors get fired up over its brewing rollout of 5G connectivity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere weren't enough names like Verizon to keep the broad market even close to a breakeven on Friday, however.As the new trading week kicks off, it's the stock charts of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) that are worth some technical scrutiny. Here's why, and what to look for. Philip Morris International (PM)It has been a good run. Philip Morris International shares are up more than 28% from their December low. But the weight of the big gain is starting to bear down on the stock, and it's doing so at the point that's most opportune for the bears.  * 7 Beaten-Up Stocks to Buy as They Reverse Course A pullback wouldn't necessarily have to be a permanent condition though, and it's pretty clear where the bulls would regroup if PM shares suffer the setback being flagged here.  Click to Enlarge • The make-or-break ceiling is around $92.80, where the stock peaked last week but also peaked in October.• Zooming out to the weekly chart, we can see shares are stochastically overbought and ripe for profit-taking.• While a setback may be in the works, the convergence of the purple 50-day, the gray 100-day and the white 200-day moving average line could readily combine to act as a floor. Twitter (TWTR)For the past several months, the bears have been trying to upend Twitter but have been unable to do it. That has given the stock time to regroup, and even move into a position to stage a full recovery. That's not happened yet, but one or two more good days could do the trick. And, that effort is taking shape with a very encouraging backdrop.  Click to Enlarge • The foundation for the renewed bullish effort is the support supplied at $26.30, where shares made a double bottom in the latter part of last year.• But the big buy trigger here is a move above the white 200-day moving average line and above the falling resistance lines that has tagged all the major peals since December. It's plotted in yellow on both stock charts.• Fanning the bullish flames -- at least partially - is the big bearish gap left behind in July. The upper edge of the gap range is just above the $42 mark. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Finally, in late February UnitedHealth Group gave a second -- and pretty decisive -- selloff that largely confirmed a major downturn was in the works. That panned out as expected, with UNH stock making a few more days of selling.The bulls did push back, but that effort crumbled and turned back into a downtrend right where one would expect. The renewal of the downtrend at the ideal ceiling sets up a third bearish leg that could end up turning into a bigger selloff than the last couple of setbacks have been.  Click to Enlarge • The rally effort was stopped and reversed just as the white 200-day moving average line was bumped. That reversal is highlighted on the daily chart.• The big floor from here is around $235, in line with the past two major bottoms UNH has made. That support is plotted with a red dashed line.• The weekly chart puts things in perspective. The three-year advance was amazing, but arguably overcooked. A little more weakness could easily turn into a lot of profit-taking.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

UnitedHealth’s new policy means lower drug costs for more people.  It smartly preempts Trump administration efforts to reform rebates, and shows that the industry can make needed change ahead of pushes for an even bigger government-led overhaul of the way they do business.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-pivots-trump-forces-issue-120026668.html?.tsrc=rss

Twenty-five of the 30 Dow Jones stocks are higher on a year-to-date basis.Interestingly, four of the five Dow stocks that are in the red to start 2019 hail from the defensive consumer staples and healthcare sectors. The Dow is a price-weighted index, meaning the stock with the highest price tag, in this case that is Boeing (NYSE:BA), is the index's largest component.Speaking of Boeing, the aerospace and defense giant, represents about 30% of the Dow's 2019 gains. Shares of Boeing account for 11.3% of DIA's weight, or more than 500 basis points above the weight assigned to the fund's second-largest holding.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Trade War Stocks to Sell on U.S.-China Deal News Indeed, Boeing has been hot, but there are other Dow names to consider.

The stock resides around $112, below the average analyst price target of $125.45. With a market value of just over $858 billion, Microsoft is one of the largest companies in the world and few companies of comparable heft can match this Dow stock's growth trajectory.&quot;We see wide-moat Microsoft as an attractive investment opportunity throughout 2019, as there are very few companies the size of Microsoft that can offer 12% revenue growth and 15% earnings growth in each of the next several years,&quot; said Morningstar in a recent note. &quot;With shares hovering around $111, we see more than 15% upside to our $130 fair value estimate.&quot;Microsoft's cloud business, Azure, is a major growth driver for the company.&quot;We estimate Azure is approximately a $7 billion business and it still grew by a staggering 76% year over year in the December quarter,&quot; according to Morningstar.Source: Shutterstock  UnitedHealth Group (UNH)As has been noted, healthcare services providers, of which UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is the largest, have been drubbed lately. A major reason for those declines is speculation that the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee will favor Medicare For All. This Dow Jones stock is down 4% over the past week and is one of the five Dow Jones stocks in the red this year, underscoring the market's negative sentiment toward Medicare For All.Regardless of an investors' political leanings, Medicare For All is a big deal for UnitedHealth is the second-largest Dow stock.

The ruling is groundbreaking, both for Zuckerman Spaeder LLP's effort on behalf of clients to systematically challenge the insurance industry's discriminatory treatment of behavioral health claims, and for the more than 50,000 plaintiffs the firm represented in this class action lawsuit.  The decision comes after an October 2017 trial before Chief Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, who considered two consolidated lawsuits—Wit, et. al. v. UnitedHealthcare et. al. and Alexander, et al. v. United Behavioral Health—brought by Zuckerman Spaeder on behalf of mental health and substance use disorder patients and their families.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-court-agrees-zuckerman-spaeder-185000120.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-02-28	2019-02-28 19:59:59	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	4 Sickly Healthcare Stocks to Avoid	U.S. equities are dribbling lower on Thursday as the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi abruptly ended with no agreement. Adding to the pressure was a batch of weak economic data overnight out of Asia and a stronger-than-expected Q4 GDP report here at home, which could potentially up the pressure on the Federal Reserve to resume its rate hikes.Moreover, the bulls continue to be content with overhead technical resistance near the 2,800 level on the S&P 500 -- a level that has been in play since October.Breath is breaking down a bit here, as traders tighten up positions after a historic start to the year. Healthcare stocks, in particular, are looking vulnerable as politicians once again talk about moving to a single-payer system in the United States.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best High-Growth Stocks for Young Investors Here are four healthcare stocks to avoid: Cigna (CI)Source: Shutterstock Shares of Cigna (NYSE:CI), a global health insurance company that was the subject of a proposed $47 billion takeover offer from Anthem in 2015 that was rejected on antitrust grounds, is threatening a share price breakdown with a test of the lows seen in December. Shares are already down more than 20%.The company will next report results on May 3 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.71 per share on revenues of $33 billion. When the company last reported on Feb. 1, earnings of $2.46 missed estimates by 3 cents on a 29.3% rise in revenues. United Health Group (UNH)Source: Shutterstock Health plan provider United Health Group (NYSE:UNH) is watching its shares drop below their 200-day moving average in an accelerating breakdown from a recent two-month consolidation range. That marks a loss of 11% from recent levels and 13% from the highs set back in December. Political pressure is building against the health insurance companies, with Democrats in the House calling for Medicare for all, which would effectively end the private insurance market.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market The company will next report results on April 16 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.6 per share on revenues of $59.7 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 15, earnings of $3.28 beat estimates by 6 cents on a 12.2% rise in revenues. CVS Health (CVS)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrShares of CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) are cratering, down another 0.6% as I write this to cap a loss of nearly 30% from the double-top high near $80 set back in November. The company recently disappointed investors with some downside guidance as investors await the outcome of the of a court decision on the merger with Aetna in a $69 billion deal.The company will next report results on May 22 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.6 per share on revenues of $59.7 billion. When the company last reported on Feb. 20, earnings of $2.1 beat estimates by 8 cents on a 12.5% rise in revenues. Humana (HUM)Source: Shutterstock Shares of health insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM) have broken down below their lower Bollinger Band and 50-day moving average, accelerating a downtrend that looks set to test the January low for a loss of around 7% from here. Shares have already lost more than 18% from the highs seen back in November. Shares were recently initiated with an overnight rating by analysts at Stephens. Poor timing.  * 7 Reasons Kraft Heinz Stock Is a Contrarian Buy The company will next report results on May 8 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $4.3 per share on revenues of $15.7 billion. When the company last reported on Feb. 6, earnings of $2.6 per share beat estimates by 12 cents on a 7.4% rise in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-28	2019-02-28 16:49:02	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	Wait for the Inevitable Pullback to Buy TNDM Stock	Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ:TNDM) shot higher after surpassing earnings and revenue estimates. TNDM stock ended its string of losses and announced that COO John Sheridan would assume the CEO position on March 1. Current CEO Kim Blickenstaff will become Executive Chairman.Source:  Tandem Diabetes However, this places Tandem Diabetes Care stock in an awkward position. The monopoly power that comes with its latest pump should ensure revenue growth for years to come.However, an unprecedented run from penny-stock status to just above $62 per share over the last year makes a near-term pullback more likely. The move higher over the previous year means TNDM stock belongs on watch lists. However, I would wait for a pullback before putting it in a portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Best Stocks to Buy on U.S.-China Trade Optimism  The NumbersTNDM stock rose by more than 27% in morning trading following its earnings beat and surprise profit. The San Diego-based firm reported a profit in the fourth quarter of $3.7 million, or two cents per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 20 cents per share.Quarterly revenue also significantly surpassed estimates, coming in at $76.2 million. This represents an 89.1% increase from year-over-year levels when the company reported revenues of $40 million. Wall Street had previously predicted $56.34 million for the quarter. A 133% increase in the sales of pumps bolstered this increase.Results for the full-year yielded similar positive surprises. TNDM reported revenues of $183.9 million, a 71% increase over the $107.6 million reported in 2017. However, net losses came in much higher for the year. In 2018, the company lost $122.6 million. Still, that factors in a $66.5 million non-cash charge and a $5.3 million loan repayment.The company also guided higher for 2019. The company predicts it will bring in between $225 million and $270 million in revenue. Analysts had previously forecasted $219.48 million. Although they declined to predict earnings, they do forecast that adjusted EBITDA will break even. Analysts forecast a 75-cent per share loss for fiscal 2019. TNDM Stock Has Gone to ExtremesThese improving prospects cap off a wild run for TNDM stock over the last five years. TNDM had fallen from a peak of over $300 per share in early 2014 to just over $2 per share by the fall of 2017. In 2016, TNDM stock tanked as United Health (NYSE:UNH) chose Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) insulin products over its own. Mounting losses and cash concerns weighed on the stock over the next two years.However, the outlook for the company improved last year when the FDA approved a system which combines Tandem's pump with a glucose monitor made by DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM). This patent-protected solution helps protect people with Type-1 diabetes from dangerous highs and lows in insulin levels. It also gives Tandem a product monopoly that has caused an unprecedented rise in TNDM stock. Today's surge takes Tandem from penny-stock levels to over $59 per share in the last year alone. The TNDM Stock ConundrumStill, the very factors that have lifted TNDM stock have also made buying the equity difficult. The stock rose by 1,509% in 2018. The post-earnings bump means the increase so far in 2019 comes close to 65%. Without question, the future looks promising. It remains a question of how promising.Even before the company issued higher guidance, TNDM traded at more than 12 times sales. Moreover, despite the quarterly profit, analysts expect annual losses through 2021.I think TNDM will become profitable in time. I also believe the stock will continue to rise in the long run. However, in the near-term, this has come too far too fast. I would not discourage those who want TNDM stock from buying in at some point. Still, I would wait for a pullback. The Bottom Line on TNDM StockThe factors driving the long-term success of Tandem Diabetes Care stock have placed TNDM stock in an uncertain position for now. TNDM soared higher in morning trading as the company beat revenue and earnings estimate. Higher guidance and changes at the top level also bolstered the stock.I see TNDM stock as a lucrative long-term opportunity. The monopoly power coming from its latest pump will bring continued revenue growth. Moreover, placing John Sheridan in the CEO position and moving Kim Blickenstaff to the board of directors engenders stability amid the personnel changes.However, investors need to remember that TNDM stock has grown from penny-stock levels to more than $62 per share over the last year. With an elevated price-to-sales ratio and annual profits still out of reach, a near-term pullback remains a distinct possibility.The company's monopoly ensures Tandem will become one of the more essential medical equipment companies. As a result, TNDM stock will trade at higher levels years from now. However, with the near-term picture more uncertain, I do not see now as the time to buy.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-02-28	2019-02-28 12:36:22	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Gap, Bank of America and UnitedHealth Group	It could have been worse. In fact, for the better part of Wednesday, it was worse than the 0.05% loss the S&P 500 logged. The bulls made a point of pushing back.General Electric (NYSE:GE) did much of the work of getting the market back to what was effectively a breakeven. Shares of the beleaguered industrial giant were up more than 2% when investors' faith in the turnaround effort was restored … again. Smaller Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) logged the much bigger gain though, closing 9.8% higher after an unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter print.The broad market might have even ended yesterday in the black, were it not for WW (NASDAQ:WTW)… the company formerly known as Weight Watchers International. Though not an S&P 500 components, its 35% post-earnings plunge set a tone for many other names.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNone are solid trading prospects headed into Thursday's trading. Rather, it's the stock charts of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Gap (NYSE:GPS) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) that were of the most interest. Here's why. Bank of America (BAC)Two months ago, Bank of America shares looked untouchable. Granted, most stocks did, as the December drubbing was mostly indiscriminate. Still, to see a blue chip in so much trouble at the time was … troubling.  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 Much has changed in the meantime. Indeed, everything has changed. And, while it has been easy to be suspicious of the rebound rally thus far -- fearing it would come unraveled -- the effort moved within reach of securing itself in place this week in a couple of different ways.  Click to Enlarge • One of those ways is a move above the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. The long-term line actually served as support on Friday.• The other way is a cross back above a previous ceiling around $29.20, plotted with a blue dashed line on the daily chart, and a hint of a move above the falling resistance line that has tagged all the major highs on the weekly chart going back to the beginning of 2018.• The final line in the sand its $29.75, where BAC peaked last month. Gap (GPS)Owning shares of clothing retailer Gap hasn't been easy at any point since the beginning of 2018. And, there's still plenty of work to be done if it's ever going to recover well enough to step into.But with the backdrop of what's taken shape since late last year paired with the stock's action from yesterday, GPS has become a name to at least put on your radar. A few more good days after months' worth of compression could release the coiled spring and catapult Gap stock considerably higher for a change.  Click to Enlarge • The backdrop in question is the horizontal support line that has developed around $24.40, plotted with a yellow dashed line. The bulls are sending a message.• As of Wednesday, GPS shares have broken above a resistance line that's been bearing down on Gap stocks since June's peak. The stock's also testing the waters of a break above the 50-day moving average, plotted in purple.• Also note the volume surge behind yesterday's gain. It wasn't just Gap drawing fresh buyers either. The entire retail sector popped. If it's a sector-wide reversal, it could get real traction. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Finally, on Tuesday of this week we cautioned that UnitedHealth Group was suspect in the way it was logging lower lows after its 50-day moving average line fell under the 200-day average … a &quot;death cross.&quot; Those fears came to fruition on Wednesday, when shares broke back below both moving average lines. With the ball now rolling in earnest -- with a little momentum -- there's good reason to be concerned.  Click to Enlarge • Yes, UNH stock broke below the purple 50-day line and the white 200-day moving average line in December, only to climb back above both the next month. This time, though, it has happened in the shadow of the first death cross in years.• Zooming out to the weekly chart of UNH puts things in perspective. Traders, accustomed to uninterrupted progress, have been handed a scenario they likely weren't psychologically prepared for.• The bulls may push back again, but odds are good the convergence of all three key moving average lines plotted on the chart will serve as a ceiling and send UnitedHealth Group shares to even lower lows. Watch carefully for that action.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Even though quarterly sales are more than $5.4 billion, the RAD stock price has been below $1 per share since December.Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrAs the market cap hovers just above $802 million, management has proposed a reverse split of as much as 1:20 to buy time. With that time, Rite Aid is repositioning itself as a &quot;wellness store,&quot; supported by a continuing partnership with GNC Holdings (NYSE:GNC), which offers a &quot;store within a store&quot; for its vitamins and supplements.CEO John Standley insists his chain is &quot;healthy and relevant&quot; in markets where it competes, mainly Pennsylvania and California, and it has a new CEO at its EnvisionRX pharmacy benefit manager.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Failed M&A Stripped AssetsTwo failed mergers in recent years have left Rite Aid a shadow of its former self. The company transferred more than 1,600 stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA) last year for $3.6 billion, after a long-running effort to sell the whole company to Walgreens collapsed under the objection of regulators. But even after that move, it still has over $3.4 billion in long-term debt.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market Rite Aid then tried to merge with privately held Albertsons, which would have taken that grocer public. But that deal collapsed in August after some big RAD stock holders objected to the price.Walgreens has been converting some of the stores it bought to its own brand, closing others, while Rite Aid faces its own negative headlines as it tries to consolidate around its best performers. Other units are becoming dollar stores. Once National, Now RegionalWhile CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Walgreens sell for about half their annual sales, Rite Aid is worth less than 5% of its revenue. The chain is considered too small to compete. What was once a nationwide chain is now two regional chains, centered in Pennsylvania and California.EnvisionRX is also thought to be in an impossible situation, as insurers like UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) now have their own pharmacy benefit managers (PBM).But there is potential value there, albeit more than the public market is now willing to pay. Shareholders rejected a deal just six months ago that would have given them 29% of a $24 billion company. Rite Aid did pay $2 billion for Envision, and it's bigger now than it was then.While Cigna (NYSE:CI) now owns ExpressScripts, UnitedHealth owns the former Catamaran, and Aetna is under CVS, Humana (NYSE:HUM) still lacks a PBM and Anthem (NASDAQ:ANTM) is trying to create one from scratch. Analysts insist a deal is there to be had, somewhere.  * 9 High-Growth Stocks to Buy Now for Monster Returns Rite Aid managers insist they need no deal. Add the debt to the equity, and Rite Aid has $4.5 billion in enterprise value. Analysts aren't expecting a profit for its current quarter, to be reported March 20, but a loss of three cents per share of RAD stock would be less than $40 million, on revenue of $5.56 billion. Management feels if it can turn a consistent profit, even on lower sales, the value should become clearer. Bottom Line on Rite Aid StockRite Aid is a minnow in a sea of sharks and it's going to be bought by someone.CEO Standley, in place since 2010, has most of his compensation tied up in RAD stock. There's no good reason for the company to disappear, even after it has been taken apart.If you're still stuck in Rite Aid stock, there's no reason not to wait and hope. But you really should have been paying attention earlier. Next time a buyer comes calling, hopefully Rite Aid can take the deal.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-02-26	2019-02-26 12:26:27	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: American International, Invesco and UnitedHealth	The new trading week got started with a bullish bang, but the effort faded as Monday wore on. By the time the closing bell rang, what had been a 0.7% gain was pared back to a 0.12% gain, leaving the market's true undertow in question.The broad market could have easily ended yesterday's session in the red were it not for General Electric (NYSE:GE). Shares of the iconic but struggling industrial giant were up more than 6% on the heels of news that it was shedding its biopharma unit for $21.4 billion. Weighing the market down more than most other names was Genworth Financial (NYSE:GNW). The stock lost 6.5% of its value yesterday following news that suitor China Oceanwide's auditor abruptly resigned. The news raised red flags with investors, even though the impact on Genworth and the impending deal isn't entirely clear.Neither are great trading prospects today, however. Rather, the stock charts of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), Invesco (NYSE:IVZ) and American International Group (NYSE:AIG) are shaping up as your best prospects. Here's why, and what has to happen next.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips American International Group (AIG)Like most other stocks, American International Group was pounded pretty severely between October and December of last year. Since then, and even in the midst of the beatdown, AIG has tried to break past an increasingly familiar technical ceiling. It has just never happened.  * 7 Cheap Stocks That Make the Grade It still hasn't happened as of yesterday. But, the stock's increasingly moving to within reach of a break above that ceiling, and as of Monday is in better position to make that breakout thrust than it's been in months.  Click to Enlarge • The line in the sand is around $44.60, plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts. Monday's high tested the area, and though shares didn't hurdle it, the stock did manage to close above the gray 100-day moving average line with the move.• For the first time in a long time, we've seen solid bullish volume more often than not since early last week.• Should the potential breakout take hold, the most plausible upside target is around $55.80. Plotted with a blue dashed line on both stock charts, that area served as a ceiling in the middle part of last year. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)With just a quick glance, UnitedHealth Group looks to be in reasonably good shape. Though down a little on Tuesday, many stocks were. Last year's big gain and this year's big rebound from the December drubbing mean UNH deserves a breather.Take a step back, though, and UNH may be closer to being is serious trouble than it seems on the surface. Knowing that it can take two or three tries to put a new trend into motion, it's the next setback that could really start to do some damage in the wake of the recent hint.  Click to Enlarge • That hint is the purple 50-day moving average line's move below the white 200-day moving average line. With that so-called &quot;death cross&quot; in place, the next move below the 50-day average line might not end as sweetly as the previous ones have.• Zooming out to the weekly chart of UnitedHealth Group, we can gain some much-needed perspective. The runup between 2016 and 2018 was nice, but it also left shares overbought and ripe for more profit-taking.• There's a subtle hint to that end in the RSI indicator. Its bigger trend is still pointed downward after moving into oversold territory in 2017. The buyers haven't been able to achieve escape velocity ever since. Invesco (IVZ)No matter which resistance line you're talking about, Invesco is above it. That leaves just one plausible ceiling ahead, and it was tested yesterday. Although the bulls failed that test with their first effort, getting a breakout going is more of a process and less of an event. The bulls will get another shot, and the recent action suggests they'll get over the hump.  Click to Enlarge • The last line in the sand is the 100-day moving average line, plotted in gray on both stock charts. Invesco shares tested it today, but didn't hurdle.• Still, all the falling technical ceilings that capped rebound efforts going back to early 2018 -- plotted with white dashed lines on both stock charts -- are no longer above the stock.• If Invesco can get over that last hump, the odds of a major move are good. IVZ is on the verge of completing an upside-down head and shoulders pattern, which generally signals the completion of an outright reversal effort.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-13	2019-02-13 14:19:10	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	UnitedHealth Stock Is a Buy, but Keep an Eye on the External Risks	The case for insurer UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) seems almost too easy to make. UNH stock already has been one of the best performers in the market, rising 270% over the past five years. Earnings are expected to grow about 13% in 2019. Yet UnitedHealth stock trades at a seemingly attractive 18x multiple to this year's EPS guidance.With a 10% pullback from early December highs, a cheaper price seems to set up an attractive opportunity. UNH's recent performance and huge earnings growth speak well of management. The company's Optum unit is cutting-edge, and growing revenue while expanding margins. With $226 billion in revenue, meanwhile, UnitedHealth has the scale to serve customers and the size to pressure suppliers.All else equal, I'd expect UnitedHealth stock to keep climbing. Indeed, I recommended UNH a year ago, and even ~15% higher, I'm still bullish. But there are risks here, highlighted by near-term trading in UnitedHealth stock. And investors need to understand those risks before proceeding.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 U.S. Stocks That Are Coming to Life Again  The Case for UnitedHealth StockThis simply seems like a good business. Growth has been phenomenal. The midpoint of 2019 EPS guidance of $14.40-$14.70 suggests a 155% increase from 2014 levels.Obviously, a lower tax rate and acquisitions have provided some outside help. But this is a company operating well, with revenue and margins both rising.UNH has a diversified portfolio, too. It has its hands in seemingly every market, with the insurer serving employers, individuals, Medicare, and state and local governments. The Global segment, built through targeted M&A, is now a $10 billion-plus revenue business.And Optum is at the forefront of changes in the industry. 2018 revenue rose double-digits, and operating margins continued to expand. Other PBMs (pharmacy benefit managers) are struggling. Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) unit EnvisionRx has disappointed. Express Scripts managed to sell itself to Cigna (NYSE:CI), but at only a modest premium to 2015 highs. In that context, Optum's performance is even more impressive.This seems simply like a very attractive business. It's the largest health insurer in the world. Optum remains a roaring success. And yet UNH stock isn't that expensive, trading at less than 18x the midpoint of FY19 EPS guidance.Double-digit annual EPS growth, a 1.4% dividend and potentially a higher multiple over time mean UnitedHealth could return 10%+ annually for years to come. The Two Key Risks to UNH StockThere are two key risks, however. The first is that competitors are trying to gain scale themselves and expand their reach. Cigna bought out Express Scripts. CVS (NYSE:CVS) acquired Aetna. Rivals are coming after UnitedHealth's market lead.To be fair, larger mergers haven't played out. Cigna and Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) planned to merge back in 2017, but called it off. Aetna and Humana (NYSE:HUM) did the same. But competitors are trying to copy at least some of UnitedHealth's strategy, and their success could make them more formidable foes.The bigger risk is on the political front. UNH stock has struggled in recent sessions after the Trump Administration announced a plan to end drug rebates (which benefit PBMs like Optum). An apparently ham-handed response from Optum, which asked for 21 month's notice of any changes from drug manufacturers, brought some unwanted publicity, and framed Optum as potentially part of the problem - not the solution.From a long term standpoint, UnitedHealth almost certainly can adapt to any changes. But with net margins only just above 5%, even modest pressure on pricing, reimbursements, or other areas of the business can have a big impact on overall profits. And in the short-term, noise around regulatory changes could impact UnitedHealth stock, as appears to have been the case of late. A Matter of TrustAt these levels, at least some of the risks are priced in. And I'd be loath to put too much faith in the federal government, in particular, doing anything to notably change the healthcare model in the U.S.But that could change. A scenario where a Democratic candidate wins the Presidency in 2020 and is backed by a Democratic Congress is far from impossible. Should such a scenario seem plausible next year, UNH stock could start pricing in that risk.Right now, 18x earnings might seem cheap but it's not hard to picture UNH trading at 13-14x (or even worse) if investors believe regulators are coming for the company's margins.The changing political landscape and UnitedHealth's exposure to that landscape, mean this isn't a set-it-and-forget-it stock. Investors need to understand the risks and be willing to be nimble if political risk, in particular, starts to creep up.In the meantime, however, the pullback in UNH stock makes an attractive business available at an enviable price. And that's enough to make UNH a buy - at least for now.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

The proposed rule from the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services would also apply to Medicare prescription drug  benefit managers and Medicaid managed care organizations.  The Trump administration's proposed rule would allow  prescription drug benefits to be offered directly to patients,  and it would allow drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers to  establish fixed fee service arrangements that could replace the  rebates.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-government-proposes-rule-changing-215209317.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-01-17	2019-01-17 20:24:24	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	UnitedHealth Is a Steady Investment for the Patient Investor	"UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) erased around half of its losses from the December 2018-January 2019 period. Just as markets often get it wrong, it did so again with UNH stock when the company reported strong quarterly reports. With a proven management team, the company has a multiyear growth plan that embraces digitalization.

So as UnitedHealth continues to cut costs, operate more effectively and increase revenue, investors will get rewarded.

### UnitedHealth's Fourth-Quarter Results

UnitedHealth reported GAAP EPS of $3.10 as revenue grew 12.2% to $58.42 billion. Both figures easily beat the street estimates. Its quarterly results surpassed its own previous forecast, communicated at its Investor Conference outlook meeting. Optum's earnings pulled out ahead because of overall medical cost controls.

Management successfully tackled expenses by executing on both structural costs and rate recovery. This sets up for an even better 2019 performance.

  * 7 Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens 



UNH stock is still around 10% below its 52-week high. And at a valuation of 15.6 times forward earnings, the stock may have more upside potential due to the outsized growth. Digitalization, or linking physical interactions to digital channels supported by proprietary data analytics, is already improving performance. The platform already has 22 million registered users that the company may engage with to deliver better service on health promotion and its related finances.

The improved interactions between patients and the company will continue to drive profit growth higher. For example, pharmacy care services reported a 98% retention rate. It won new business awards from health plans and employer plans, which already sets the company up for 2020 revenue growth.

It is looking more likely that the 15.6 times forward P/E is too low and does not reflect the company's upside over the next few years.

### Growth Drivers for UNH Stock

UnitedHealth's two drivers for justifying a higher share price is simple. Lower total medical costs will continue and revenue will go up. Both are connected: by keeping people healthier and avoiding unnecessary hospital visits, costs go down. Commercial customers like this pattern and also join UNH.

Looking beyond into 2030, when 80 million people in the U.S. will have three or more chronic conditions, up from 30 million in 2015, it is imperative that UnitedHealth builds its comprehensive portfolio of care delivery services. On the back end, data analytics across all of Optum will help UNH reduce costs while delivering better care to its customers.

### Risks for UnitedHealthcare

Ignoring the potential and actual risks in investing in UNH stock would give an incomplete picture to readers. Management expects a health insurance tax will come back in 2020. This will also increase healthcare costs by $20 billion for the 142 million Americans. At $500 in extra costs per family with small business coverage, the customer acquisition rate UNH enjoys today may slow because of this.

Despite the headwinds coming up, UnitedHealth will soon realize the benefits of winning a few large corporate deals. In 2020, it will focus more on health plans and then the large employer group.

### Valuation

13 analysts on Wall Street cover UnitedHealth stock and on average, have a $308.90 price target. Every single analyst report in the last month is a &quot;buy&quot; call:

Analyst  Firm  Position  Price Target  Action  Date  John Ransom Raymond James Buy $310.00 Reiterated 1 day ago Kevin Fischbeck Merrill Lynch Buy $320.00 Reiterated 1 day ago Michael Wiederhorn Oppenheimer Buy $305.00 Reiterated 2 days ago Sarah James Piper Jaffray Buy -- Reiterated 2 days ago Steven Halper Cantor Fitzgerald Buy $310.00 Reiterated 2 days ago Ana Gupte Leerink Partners Buy $335.00 Reiterated 2 days ago A.J.

Investors may have a contrarian viewpoint against Wall Street reports but it is hard to get negative on UNH stock after its Q4 results.

Overall, UnitedHealth looks like a slow and steady climber whose stock will reward patient investors.

2018-10-16	2018-10-16 18:57:46	UNH	UnitedHealth Group Incorporated	5 Hot-Running Health Insurance Stocks to Buy	Many of us are unhappy with our health insurers. Premiums are high. Hospital bills can be large and deductibles for many policyholders are larger than ever. But the world looks good if you own health insurance stocks. There are profits to be made managing government health care programs -- Medicaid, public exchanges, the Children&apos;s Health Insurance Program and Medicare. Because despite the confusion over health insurance, government health care expenditures continue to rise. To wit, Medicare spending is projected grow 7.9% annually to 2023 with total expenditures of approximately $1.1 trillion. Meanwhile, Medicaid spending is estimated to grow 5.9% annually to 2023, when it will top $828 billion. Here are five health insurance stocks to buy - all of which have advanced by double digits already in 2018. But don&apos;t worry about being late to the party. There&apos;s reason to expect more upside in these stocks because they need only to maintain a strategy at which they have proven adept: increase enrollments and contain medical costs.

The day&apos;s rally comes amid apparent enthusiasm surrounding a batch of quarterly corporate results from UnitedHealth Group Inc. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and others that were seen as upbeat and reaffirming the vitality of earnings and an economic expansion that has thus far underpinned market gains. However, last week investors drove shares lower on fears of rapidly rising interest rates, which equate to higher borrowing costs for companies.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/778c04e4-db0f-33af-bbbb-ff3ae57e4a16/s%26p-500-retakes-2%2C800-mark.html?.tsrc=rss

He has also advised and served on the board of directors of several other health technology companies, including one focused on moving sleep apnea testing devices into the home and another on helping people quit smoking.  The flashy Amazon/Berkshire/J.P. Morgan initiative has the goal of making health care better and more cost-effective for the three companies' combined workforces, but little has been made public beyond that, so Stoddard's background could provide some hints about what to expect.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/94c915fb-0ecc-3485-98d3-e259e4342382/amazon%2Fjpm%2Fberkshire-health.html?.tsrc=rss

""Despite strong top-line growth and results, we are not performing at, nor consistently growing to, our full potential,"" CEO David Wichmann said during a conference call."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-2q-earnings-snapshot-100132726.html?.tsrc=rss

Of the 19 states that have yet to expand Medicaid under the ACA, only Texas, North Carolina, Florida and Georgia would have more people gain coverage if their legislatures and governors approved Medicaid expansion, according to a study earlier this month by the Urban Institute.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/26de7a56-f238-3939-90d5-2557d5adc392/health-insurers-await-400k.html?.tsrc=rss
