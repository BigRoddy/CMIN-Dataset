Ecolab’s Award-Winning Cockroach Multi-Station Provides Ongoing Defense to Protect Foodservice Operations	Patented design helps resolve cockroach problems and the public health risks they present by improving catch rates and reducing trap displacementST. PAUL, Minn., May 20, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ecolab Inc., the global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions and services, has launched the Cockroach Multi-Station, an innovative, discreet and durable device designed to detect the arrival of cockroaches early and provide ongoing defense to help foodservice providers ensure clean and safe operations. Ecolab’s patented Cockroach Multi-Station was recently recognized with a 2021 Kitchen Innovation Award from the National Restaurant Association. The Kitchen Innovation Awards recognize the most significant equipment innovations to improve back-of-house operations within the restaurant industry. “The Cockroach Multi-Station is the latest innovation in our comprehensive Cockroach Service and will help our customers efficiently protect their brand reputation and bottom line,” said Greg Cook, senior vice president and general manager, Ecolab Pest Elimination. “Ecolab’s new solution will make it easier for the restaurant industry to help eliminate this business risk.” The Cockroach Multi-Station is a permanent solution that is easily installed on any surface, making it ideal to detect and eliminate cockroaches at their source. The station’s unique design and curvature mimics cockroach harborages to facilitate greater pest attraction and capture. “Known to carry bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella, cockroaches are a major threat to food safety, public health and brand reputation,” said Julie Marquardt, vice president of Research, Development & Engineering for Ecolab Pest Elimination. “A single cockroach sighting can lead to a restaurant shut down, so it’s vital to mitigate pest risk through the innovation and expertise that Ecolab brings to our customer partnerships.” Ecolab’s Cockroach Multi-Station has helped resolve major German Cockroach infestations in several types of food establishments through its monitoring capabilities that identify the presence and specific location of pest activity. By deploying this new way of monitoring, Ecolab Pest Elimination service specialists can quickly determine “hot-spots” and narrow their area of focus to help eliminate the origin of cockroach pressure as well as protect against new introductions. An Ecolab Pest Elimination customer using the Cockroach Multi-Station commented, “The fact that cockroaches aren’t visible gives us confidence that monitoring is happening out of sight, and the Ecolab team will let us know what needs to happen if we do have a problem.” The Cockroach Multi-Station is one of several innovative solutions offered with Ecolab’s Cockroach Service, which utilizes science-based protocols and equipment to proactively identify, eliminate and prevent cockroach risks. Ecolab’s Cockroach Service is a key component of its Pest Elimination Protect Programs and will help protect a company’s operations, brand and bottom line.

2021-05-06	2021-05-06 12:30:00	ECL	Ecolab Inc.	Ecolab Launches Digital Solution for Companies Facing Water Scarcity	Global Water Use to Surpass Supply by 56% by 2030ST. PAUL, Minn., May 06, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ecolab Inc., the global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions and services, launched Water Flow Intelligence, a digital service that provides industry with real-time visibility of water usage at the enterprise, site and asset levels. The launch of this new service comes at a time when rising industrial water use continues to contribute to the world’s growing water stress and scarcity challenges. According to the World Resources Institute, the world will experience a 56% freshwater shortfall by 2030 if nothing changes, an increase from the 40% shortfall projected by the U.N. in 2015. At the same time, S&P Global reports that corporate water use progress is currently insufficient to prevent the projected freshwater gap. To help address these growing water challenges, Water Flow Intelligence enables companies to identify opportunities that help improve water management across their operations, deliver on sustainability goals and reduce operational costs by combining smart water meters and sensors with advanced water flow measurement and monitoring, asset performance insights and machine learning. The service is powered by ECOLAB3D™, a secure, cloud-based digital platform that translates data from multiple sources into actionable insights. ECOLAB3D uses advanced algorithms and predictive analytics to power better business outcomes, enhancing the value and impact Ecolab delivers to businesses through its programs, products and services. “Water Flow Intelligence uses cutting-edge digital technologies to enable real-time insights and response,” said Pedro Sancha, senior vice president and general manager of Ecolab’s Industrial Digital business. “By gaining visibility to water use across their organizations, companies can optimize their operations and make real progress on their water-related sustainability goals, from the enterprise level to individual facilities.” Manual data collection and analysis to track water use is often tedious, resource-intensive and difficult to execute consistently across sites. Through the data and insights provided by Water Flow Intelligence, developed by Ecolab’s Nalco Water business, users can efficiently pinpoint on a user-friendly dashboard where water is being consumed across the connected assets and processes within their facilities, set enterprise-wide benchmarks and strategically target improvement efforts to help maximize water savings. At the local plant level, Water Flow Intelligence helps users protect their facilities against water damage and excess water use – which can negatively impact the local community and result in costly fines. Through the combination of real-time monitoring, advanced alarm notifications and 24/7 oversight by engineers at Ecolab’s System Assurance Center, the service alerts users to out-of-spec conditions as they occur, enabling faster responses to address leaks and other issues. In addition to managing risks, Water Flow Intelligence can help reduce costs by reducing water use. In the auto industry, pretreatment of water used to prepare vehicle bodies for painting is one of the most water-intensive processes and the biggest opportunity for water savings. One of the world’s largest automakers asked long-time partner Nalco Water to help reduce water consumption without negatively affecting product quality or production. Water Flow Intelligence was installed in the pretreatment area at one of the automaker’s North American assembly plants, where it has helped the customer cut water use at the facility by 15%, saving 25 million gallons of water and $193,000 per year.1 “Paired with the knowledge and expertise of our on-the-ground sales and service teams, Water Flow Intelligence can help businesses gauge the effectiveness of their water management plans and improve their water footprint,” said Darrell Brown, executive vice president and president of Ecolab’s Global Industrial group. “This is more important than ever as the gap between freshwater availability and demand continues to grow, and companies worldwide step up their sustainability commitments to build resilience and drive action in the face of both climate change and water scarcity.” Water Flow Intelligence is currently available to industrial businesses in North America and Europe, with expansion to Australia and New Zealand by the end of 2021.

Ecolab First Quarter Reported Diluted Continuing Operations EPS $0.67; Adjusted Diluted Continuing Operations EPS $0.81, -18%; EPS Includes Estimated Unfavorable $0.10 (-10pp) Per Share Impact From Texas Freeze	"FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS: First quarter results reflected underlying sequential improvement from the fourth quarter offset by supply chain and customer disruptions from the Texas freeze. As previously disclosed, the Texas freeze is expected to have an unfavorable impact of $0.15 per share in full year 2021; the first quarter impact was an estimated $0.10 per share. Reported sales from continuing operations -4% versus last year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales -8% as strong growth in the Healthcare & Life Sciences segment was more than offset by a modest Industrial segment decrease and narrowed declines in the Institutional & Specialty and Other segments. The Texas freeze is estimated to have had a -1pp impact on overall sales growth. Reported diluted EPS from continuing operations $0.67, -33% versus last year.Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items, were $0.81, -18% versus last year; the decrease reflects the COVID-19 related volume declines, Texas freeze impacts and unfavorable business mix which together more than offset cost savings and favorable pricing. Texas freeze supply chain and customer disruptions were an estimated unfavorable $0.10 (-10pp) per share.

PAUL, Minn., April 27, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sequentially improving underlying trends in Ecolab’s first quarter, driven by further strong new business wins, customer penetration gains, continued pricing and generally better market conditions, were negatively impacted by short-term supply chain and customer disruptions from the Texas freeze. Strong top and bottom line growth in the Healthcare & Life Sciences segment once again led results along with further income gains in the Industrial segment, while Institutional & Specialty and Other segment sales declines continued to narrow as markets further improved. CEO commentCommenting on the quarter, Christophe Beck, Ecolab’s president and chief executive officer said, “Our business continues to show fundamental improvement that gives us confidence in our full year outlook. First quarter results were in line with our expectations as underlying sequential sales and earnings improvement from the fourth quarter 2020 was offset by the previously discussed impact from the Texas freeze. This was a short-term event that primarily impacted our Industrial segment, as raw materials supply was sharply reduced and certain customer operations were constrained. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.81 were also as expected and included an estimated unfavorable $0.10 per share impact from the Texas freeze. “Importantly, our general market outlook remains largely unchanged. North America and China are moving ahead while Europe and several other regions remain behind as they recover from extended lockdowns and slow rates of vaccinations. We continue to believe that we are in a strong position to capitalize on the improving trends while we leverage continued new business wins, customer penetration gains and good pricing. The investments we made to further our product and service innovation, new hygiene and digital technologies and successful sales and profit initiatives are also contributing to our results. We are therefore confident that these critical efforts have expanded our global competitive advantage and uniquely position us to capture new business opportunities and drive accelerated growth for Ecolab. “We look for significant growth in the second quarter, primarily driven by strong year-on-year growth in our Institutional division as new business as well as improving trends in early-reopening U.S. states and continued U.S. vaccination progress more than offset a softer Europe and emerging market recovery. We expect robust consolidated gains in the second half, and continue to look for strong year-on-year growth for the full year 2021 with earnings per share above 2019 earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the estimated $0.15 per share impact of the Texas freeze. With rising hygiene standards, increased demand for our sustainable solutions and our unique digital capabilities, we remain confident in our long-term outlook and believe we are well-positioned for continued superior future growth.” First Quarter 2021 Consolidated Results Ecolab's first quarter reported sales decreased 4%, fixed currency sales decreased 6% and acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales decreased 8% when compared to the prior year. The Texas freeze is estimated to have had a -1pp impact on overall sales growth. First quarter 2021 reported operating income decreased 21% and fixed currency operating income decreased 22% when compared to the prior year; both include the impact of special charges, which were primarily related to restructuring activities and pay protection for certain employees impacted by COVID-19’s effects (net of government subsidies). Adjusted fixed currency operating income decreased 19%. COVID-19 related lower volume, the Texas freeze impact and unfavorable business mix more than offset cost savings and favorable pricing. The Texas freeze is estimated to have had a -9pp impact on operating income growth. Reported other income, which primarily consists of the return on pension assets and other non-service costs of our pension obligations, increased 10% reflecting higher returns on pension assets. Reported interest expense increased 7% due to higher average debt levels in this year’s quarter. The increased average debt levels in 2021 incorporate the late March 2020 issuance of debt to further increase our liquidity at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reported income tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was 25.2% compared with the reported rate of 13.7% in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items, the adjusted tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was 19.7% compared with the adjusted tax rate of 20.5% in the first quarter of 2020. First quarter 2021 reported net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab decreased 34%. Excluding the impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items, adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab decreased 19% versus the prior year. Reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 33%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 18% when compared against first quarter 2020; the Texas freeze is estimated to have had a -10pp impact on adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations growth. Currency translation had a $0.02 favorable impact on first quarter 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Ecolab reacquired approximately 0.3 million shares of its common stock during the first quarter of 2021. First Quarter 2021 Segment Review Segment results reflect continuing operations.

Industrial segment results reflect unfavorable impacts in all divisions from supply chain and customer operating disruptions from the Texas freeze during the quarter, most notably in Downstream; excluding those weather-related impacts, Industrial sales are estimated to have improved sequentially and would have been similar to last year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 4% reflecting cost savings and favorable pricing that more than offset lower volume from the Texas freeze. The Texas freeze is estimated to have had a -14pp impact on Industrial’s acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income growth. Global Institutional & Specialty (unaudited)First Quarter Ended March 31 Acq.

Sales reflected a narrowing decline in the Institutional division and a Specialty division sales decrease versus a very strong year-ago period. Results for both divisions continued to be unfavorably impacted by the continuation of COVID-19’s second wave during most of the quarter, as increased sanitizing product sales were more than offset by global demand pressure on restaurant, lodging and entertainment facilities for other products due to the pandemic. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income decreased 65% reflecting the significant COVID-19 related volume decline and unfavorable business mix which more than offset cost savings and favorable pricing. Global Healthcare & Life Sciences (unaudited)First Quarter Ended March 31 Acq.

Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income grew 90% reflecting the strong volume gains, favorable pricing and cost savings. Other (unaudited)First Quarter Ended March 31 Acq.

Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 51% as cost savings, favorable pricing and favorable business mix together more than offset lower volumes. CorporateCorporate segment includes: sales of $33 million to ChampionX in the first quarter of 2021 under the Master Cross Supply and Product Transfer agreements entered into as part of the ChampionX separationamortization expense of $31 million in the first quarter of 2021 related to the Nalco merger intangible assetsnet special charges of $32 million in the first quarter of 2021 primarily related to restructuring charges and COVID-19 related charges, including pay protection for certain employees impacted by COVID-19’s effects (net of government subsidies), testing and related costs Special gains and charges for the first quarter of 2020 were a net charge of $25 million and include restructuring charges, acquisition and integration charges, Healthcare product recall charges and litigation and other charges. Business OutlookThe continued uncertain outlook regarding the timing and pace of global economic recovery from COVID-19’s impact does not yet present an adequate basis for us to provide either quarterly or annual earnings forecasts. We expect continued recovery in the full year 2021. Healthcare & Life Sciences segment sales are expected to moderately improve over the prior year’s very strong gain, with good year-on-year sales growth from our Industrial and Other segments. We look for our Institutional & Specialty segment to show a significant year-on-year increase for the full year as it progressively recovers toward its pre-COVID peak 2019 levels. We look for significant growth in the second quarter, primarily driven by strong year-on-year growth in our Institutional division as new business as well as improving trends in early-reopening U.S. states and continued U.S. vaccination progress more than offset a softer Europe and emerging market recovery. We expect robust consolidated gains in the second half, and continue to look for strong year-on-year growth for the full year 2021 with earnings per share above 2019 earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the estimated $0.15 per share impact of the Texas freeze.

Non-GAAP Financial Information This news release and certain of the accompanying tables include financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures (including with respect to continuing operations) include: fixed currency salesacquisition adjusted fixed currency salesadjusted cost of salesadjusted gross marginfixed currency operating incomefixed currency operating income marginadjusted operating incomeadjusted fixed currency operating incomeadjusted fixed currency operating income marginacquisition adjusted fixed currency operating incomeacquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income marginadjusted other income expenseadjusted interest expenseadjusted tax rateadjusted net income attributable to Ecolabadjusted diluted earnings per share We provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results. Our non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, operating income, other (income) expense and interest expense exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income attributable to Ecolab and diluted earnings per share further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and certain external factors that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges. We evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange, which eliminate the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international results. Fixed currency amounts included in this release are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2021. We also provide our segment results based on public currency rates for informational purposes. Our reportable segments do not include the impact of intangible asset amortization from the Nalco merger or the impact of special (gains) and charges as these are not allocated to the Company’s reportable segments. Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of any acquired business from the first twelve months post acquisition and exclude the results of divested businesses from the previous twelve months prior to divestiture. Acquisition adjusted growth rates also exclude sales to our Venezuelan deconsolidated subsidiaries from both the current period and comparable period of the prior year. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the GAAP measures included in this news release. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures are included in the following ""Supplemental Non-GAAP Reconciliations"" and “Supplemental Diluted Earnings per Share Information” tables included in this news release. We do not provide reconciliations for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis (including those contained in this report) when we are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact reported earnings per share and the reported tax rate, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures to adjusted earnings per share and the adjusted tax rate. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.

2021-03-22	2021-03-22 12:30:00	ECL	Ecolab Inc.	Ecolab Releases Enhanced Smart Water Navigator to Help Companies Advance Water Quantity and Quality Goals	New tool to help companies close gap between freshwater supply and demand, now at an all-time highST. PAUL, Minn., March 22, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, on World Water Day, Ecolab Inc., the global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions and services, launched an enhanced version of its Smart Water Navigator. The free online tool helps businesses understand the value of water in their operations and take action to achieve corporate water goals. This enhanced tool comes at a time when rising industrial water use continues to contribute to the world’s growing water stress and scarcity challenges. According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), the world will experience a 56% freshwater shortfall by 2030 if nothing changes, an increase from the 40% shortfall projected by the U.N. in 2015. “This is an important time for industry to start closing the widening gap between freshwater supply and demand through smart water management,” said Ecolab President and CEO Christophe Beck. “We developed the Ecolab Smart Water Navigator to help businesses develop comprehensive, context-based plans and to better engage and support the teams responsible for driving smart water management.” A need for increased urgency around corporate water actionTo better understand the state of corporate water management and how companies can more effectively advance their water management goals, in February 2021 Ecolab and sustainability news research organization GreenBiz surveyed 93 companies with revenues of at least $1 billion. The survey underscored the need for increased urgency around water action within organizations, with only 38% of respondents stating that water is a strategic corporate initiative that is proactively managed across their operations. At the same time, S&P Global reports that corporate water use progress is currently insufficient to prevent the projected freshwater gap. Identifying opportunities to advance corporate water goalsWhile water targets and goals are typically set by sustainability and corporate responsibility teams, 95% of respondents in the Ecolab-GreenBiz survey said that facility-level teams are responsible for achieving these targets, which may contribute to the disconnect between water intention and action. Only 54% of survey respondents currently utilized advanced measurement tools to track progressAnd 45% said they felt their organization’s water would be better managed and targets would be more easily achieved if they utilized such tools. “Despite a growing understanding of our world’s worsening water crisis, companies are not making water management a priority,” said Ecolab Senior Vice President of Corporate Sustainability Emilio Tenuta. “Tools that help enable facilities to better measure water use are key to driving action, which is why we enhanced the Ecolab Smart Water Navigator.” Helping enable local water actionThe enhanced Ecolab Smart Water Navigator supports users who are just beginning to identify baseline water use as well as those who are ready to track year-over-year performance. The tool delivers an automated analysis of water use that allows users to set informed, context-based goals that consider the water basin health in surrounding communities and environments. New features include benchmarking across a portfolio of facilities and the ability to identify water withdrawal targets and risks and evaluate performance over time. The Ecolab Smart Water Navigator, first introduced in 2019, supports Ecolab’s broader mission to help industry reuse, recycle and reduce water, supporting resilient operations and healthy communities. Ecolab’s water stewardship efforts focus on identifying and supporting equitable and sustainable water use, and partnerships, like its founding membership in the Water Resilience Coalition, an industry-driven initiative, of the United Nations Global Compact’s CEO Water Mandate.

Texas Roadhouse Earns the Ecolab Science Certified™ Seal Nationwide at More Than 600 Restaurants, Demonstrating Commitment to Higher Level of Cleanliness	Texas Roadhouse is implementing science-based solutions to help address pandemic concerns by advancing cleaner, safer practices and building customer confidenceST. PAUL, Minn., March 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ecolab Inc., the global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions and services, is pleased to announce that Texas Roadhouse has earned the Ecolab Science Certified™ seal at more than 600 restaurants in 49 states. The seal signifies Texas Roadhouse’s commitment to rigorous, science-based cleaning protocols, training and audits that build both guest and employee confidence. Texas Roadhouse, one of the nation’s fastest growing casual restaurant groups, was the most popular chain restaurant in America during the pandemic, according to marketing research company Top Data. “We are proud we were the first restaurant company in 2020 to commit to the Ecolab Science Certified program, and now are honored to have the seal at our restaurants across the U.S.,” said Kent Taylor, CEO of Texas Roadhouse. “Ecolab’s expertise in the industry and science-based program, combined with our operators’ passion for helping keep our employees and guests safe, enhances our ongoing goal of providing a higher level of cleanliness in our restaurants.” Texas Roadhouse joins other leading restaurants, hotels and retailers in advancing cleaner, safer practices through the Ecolab Science Certified program. This comprehensive program combines hospital disinfectants and food-contact sanitizers approved for use during the COVID-19 pandemic with public health and food safety training and periodic auditing. “Through Ecolab Science Certified, foodservice and hospitality companies like Texas Roadhouse can help address concerns about the pandemic by advancing cleaner, safer practices,” said Mike Johannsen, executive vice president and general manager of Ecolab’s Global Institutional business. “Texas Roadhouse takes great care in delivering a heightened level of cleanliness for their guests and employees, continuing to demonstrate their leadership through the Ecolab Science Certified program. We look forward to continuing our long-standing partnership, working together to build diner confidence as Texas Roadhouse puts our scientific expertise to work.” The program was informed by proprietary research1 that showed 66% of restaurant customers said they feel “extremely” or “very safe” knowing a restaurant is cleaned with hospital disinfectants*. The research also found that consumers feel safer knowing that an external, independent Ecolab auditor – particularly one with expertise cleaning and disinfecting hospitals – has audited a facility’s cleaning practices. And even after a vaccine is distributed, Ecolab’s research showed that 95% of consumers surveyed want to see as much or more cleaning and sanitation practices at the places they eat, stay and shop.2 In restaurants, hotels, grocery stores and other businesses, the key elements of the Ecolab Science Certified program include: Create clean through hospital disinfectants and food-contact sanitizers approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use against the COVID-19 virus and other emerging pathogens, and elevated hygiene standards and protocols informed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Check clean through detailed public health and food safety training and periodic auditing by highly trained Ecolab specialists to determine whether program elements are being followed. Help consumers see and believe clean through front-of-house cleaning and disinfecting procedures and the Ecolab Science Certified seal, a visible sign of commitment that a location is advancing cleaner, safer practices. The program is grounded in Ecolab’s decades of experience helping keep hospitals, restaurants, hotels and other businesses clean, and its partnerships with many of the world’s leading foodservice and hospitality brands, including Texas Roadhouse.

2021-02-17	2021-02-17 13:59:21	ECL	Ecolab Inc.	Ecolab's Debt Insights	Over the past three months, shares of Ecolab (NYSE:ECL) decreased by 1.41%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Ecolab has. Ecolab's Debt Based on Ecolab's balance sheet as of October 30, 2020, long-term debt is at $6.67 billion and current debt is at $247.30 million, amounting to $6.92 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.03 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $5.88 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Ecolab has $18.10 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.38. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Investors Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-02-17	2021-02-17 13:23:36	ECL	Ecolab Inc.	Ecolab Dips 4.1% As COVID-19 Dented 4Q Profit	Shares of Ecolab dropped 4.1% on Tuesday, after the company, which provides water, hygiene, and energy technologies and services, reported lower-than-expected 4Q results, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ecolab’s (ECL) 4Q earnings of $1.23 per share missed analysts' estimates of $1.25 and declined 15% year-over-year. The company said, “The adjusted EPS decrease reflects COVID-19 related volume declines, unfavorable business mix and investments in the business which together more than offset cost savings, favorable pricing and lower variable compensation.” However, earnings improved sequentially. The company’s 4Q revenues declined 6% to $3.07 billion and lagged the Street's estimates of $3.11 billion. Ecolab's healthcare & life sciences segment saw 23% revenue growth in 4Q, while its industrial, institutional & specialty and other segment declined year-over-year. Ecolab CEO Christophe Beck said, “Our underlying business continued its sequential improvement as sales trends remained stable and operating income further improved, driven by new business and customer penetration gains, along with continued pricing and lower costs.” Beck expects COVID-19 to continue to impact its end markets in 2021. Though he expects a recovery in the global end markets from the second quarter of 2021, he still believes that “it will take several quarters to fully realize a new normal.” However, he added that “our strengthened business will deliver full year 2021 earnings above 2019 results from continuing operations, with the first quarter year-on-year percentage decline showing modest sequential improvement from the fourth quarter and the remaining quarters of 2021 showing strong year-on-year growth.” (See Ecolab stock analysis on TipRanks). Following the earnings results, Oppenheimer analyst Scott Schneeberger maintained a Hold rating on the stock. The analyst said, “Ecolab's 4Q20 adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.23 (-15% year/year) compared to our estimate/consensus of $1.26/$1.25, respectively.” Overall, the rest of the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 3 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $224.33 implies upside potential of about 6.4% to current levels. Shares have gained 2.7% over the past year. The TipRanks’ stock investors tool shows that investors currently have a Very Negative stance on ECL.

2021-02-15	2021-02-15 15:25:18	ECL	Ecolab Inc.	Earnings Preview for Ecolab	"On Tuesday, February 16, Ecolab (NYSE:ECL) will release its latest earnings report. Benzinga's report can help you figure out the ins and outs of the earnings release. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Ecolab EPS is expected to be around $1.25, according to sell-side analysts. Sales will likely be near $3.11 billion. Ecolab reported a profit of $1.69 per share when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $3.82 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin. View more earnings on ECL If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Tuesday, earnings would be down 26.04%. Sales would be down 18.67% on a year-over-year basis.

Barclays Says These Cleaning and Sanitation Stocks Will Shine Even After Pandemic	"Barclays analyst Lauren Liebermann expects cleaning and sanitation companies to remain long-term beneficiaries of the COVID-19 pandemic.What Happened: ""Pre-pandemic, sanitization/cleaning was mostly taken for granted, but in a post-pandemic world we believe consumers and employees will demand that places not only 'be clean' but also 'show clean,'"" Liebermann said in a note, as first reported by CNBC.The Barclays analyst sees larger incumbents and well-known consumer brands benefiting in particular as she foresees ""a greatly expanding addressable market as well as share consolidation"" in the $30 billion industry.The Barclays analyst estimates a 10% to 20% uptick in same-store sales compared to the pre-coronavirus period for cleaning and sanitation companies and lists the following stocks as the ones particularly to watch, CNBC noted.Ecolab Inc (NYSE: ECL): With an estimated market share between 12% to 16%, Liebermann expects the company to target a 20% hike in penetration rate among its current customers. Since the beginning of the year, Ecolab stock has risen merely by 14.6%. Based on the company's operational scale, service, innovation, and technological abilities, the Barclays analyst predicts a consolidation.Ecolab shares last closed 0.8% lower at $221.25 on Friday.Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ: CTAS) Liebermann pointed out that although primarily in the business of uniform rentals, the company's revenues from its sanitization and hygiene facility service offering contributes almost 10% to the total revenue.Cintas shares closed 0.5% higher at $349.11 on Friday.Proctor & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG): Liebermann notes that the consumer goods company has booked a systematic growth from its cleaning solutions segment, P&G Professional. ""Post-pandemic P&G Professional should be nicely placed to continue gaining share,"" the analyst said, as per CNBC.PG shares last closed 0.74% higher at $136.51.Clorox Co (NYSE: CLX): The company's Professional Products Segment, including the Clorox Pro, could be one of the growth drivers, as per Liebermann. Stock is up 30% driven by higher demand for bleach and disinfectant wipes. The Barclays analysts forecast this segment to be one of the ""compelling growth opportunities"" for the company.Clorox shares were up 0.56% at $201.73 on last close.Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC - ADR (OTC: RBGLY): In July, Reuters reported that the British consumer goods company partnered into long term contracts with multiple companies. The analyst anticipates selected and sizeable contracts to boost sales volumes.RBGLY shares closed 0.1% lower at $17.78 on Friday.Aramark Corporation (NYSE: ARMK): Aramark's core business is in the food delivery market but the company also holds growth prospects in the facilities management business, according to Liebermann.Aramark shares closed 1.2% lower at $37.60 on Friday.See Also: Analyst Recommends These ETFs To Play 3 Key Themes For 2021 -- EVs, Cannabis, And COVID-19 RecoveryLatest Ratings for CTAS  DateFirmActionFromTo  Oct 2020Morgan StanleyMaintainsUnderweight  Oct 2020JefferiesMaintainsBuy  Oct 2020Argus ResearchInitiates Coverage OnBuy    View More Analyst Ratings for CTAS   View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Microsoft's Cloud Products Are Attracting New Customers(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Of course, businesses were already doing plenty of cleaning pre-Covid, although companies that have a longer history in industrial cleaning, like  (ECL) (ticker: ECL) may not ring a bell with consumers, who are more used to household names like  (CLX) (CLX).	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ed2be6d8-7037-3ee8-99d4-0d27405a8781/cleaning-will-remain-crucial.html?.tsrc=rss
