Chile's top mining firms hope senate may modify higher royalty tax	"Chile's top private miners see as ""very good news"" what they called a ""change of tack"" by senators considering a stiffer tax on mining royalties that was approved by congress's lower house last month, a spokesman for the group said on Tuesday.  Joaquin Villarino, head of Chile's Mining Council, which represents major global miners such as AngloAmerican, BHP, Antofagasta, Teck and Freeport-McMoRan, said the state has the ""legitimate"" power to seek to increase tax revenues in moments when, as at present, copper prices spike - but not at the expense of development in the sector.  The bill now sits with the senate's mining committee which is hearing evidence from stakeholders including former presidents, current and former mining executives, academics, sector analysts and mine supplier groups."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chiles-top-mining-firms-hope-220314363.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-27	2021-05-27 15:50:26	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Freeport’s Adkerson Sees Copper Scarcity Trumping Cooling Effort	(Bloomberg) -- The copper market, unlike oil, is supported by a dearth of new discoveries at a time of rising demand that will accelerate with decarbonization efforts, according to the world’s biggest publicly traded producer of the metal.While government and market actions can have an impact in the short term, copper is a very long term business and is “extraordinarily strong,” Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said in an interview Thursday.“There’s no shale oil for copper,” he told Bloomberg Television. “Unlike the oil industry, where you have an ongoing flow of discoveries and now with a new element of shale coming in, copper mines of size are very rare to find.”Bets on tight supplies have sent copper prices to record levels as major economies emerge from the pandemic and the energy transition boosts the outlook for the metal used in electric installations. The rally has cooled somewhat with the outlook of a tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve and China’s efforts to ease a commodities price surge.The industry is facing a supply scarcity that will require both copper substitution and increasing recycling, Adkerson said. If prices were to double tomorrow, Freeport would be unable to bring on new supply within five years, he said.Freeport’s margins are expanding as near-record prices and a ramp-up at its flagship mine in Indonesia counter any cost increases. The company has “its arms around” input supply challenges, he said.Host nation politicians and unions seeking a bigger share of the copper windfall is a typical response to surging prices, he said.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-adkerson-sees-copper-scarcity-155026218.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-23	2021-04-23 16:38:28	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	3 Stocks to Buy After Great Earnings	We’re knee-deep into earnings season. Some companies have delivered the goods, others have failed to impress. The market has rewarded and punished them accordingly. Today we’re highlighting three stocks to buy that all posted solid earnings. But it’s not just about profits, as compelling as they may be. Remember, it’s not the news that matters to traders. It’s the reaction to the news. And today’s candidates all formed attractive price patterns following their respective reports. That, above all else, serves as the reason for my affection. 7 Retail Stocks With E-Commerce Locked In From a sector perspective, these picks come from three different areas of the Street. One is a copper giant. The second is a telecom titan. The third is a homebuilder capitalizing on the real estate boom.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) AT&T (NYSE:T) D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) Let’s review their earnings numbers and why I like their price charts. Then, I’ll share an options trade you can use to bank on continued upside. Stocks to Buy After Great Earnings: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) The inflation trade is heating up in 2021. Copper prices have been ripping alongside other industrial commodities, and companies like Freeport-McMoRan have been massive beneficiaries of the trend. Roughly 80% of FCX’s revenue comes from copper. On the earnings front, Freeport reported EPS of 51 cents on $4.85 billion in revenue. The numbers came in line with earnings expectations but slightly missed revenue forecasts of $4.87 billion. But here’s the thing. The stock didn’t really budge – despite what could be described as less than stellar results. Given that FCX stock has climbed so much over the past six months, I think this is a huge win and bodes well for prices moving forward. Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade The pullback pattern has FCX testing its rising 50-day and 20-day moving averages. This is as good a buy-the-dip setup as any. The Trade: Buy the June $35/$40 bull call spread for $1.80. AT&T (T) AT&T entered earnings with a chart in need of a boost. It’s been stuck in a trading range for the past year and found itself stuck in the middle heading into the event. Fortunately, the telecom and media giant released one of its best showings in years. For the first quarter, AT&T earned an adjusted 86 cents per share on revenue of $43.94 billion. Analysts were expecting 78 cents per share on $42.69 billion in revenue. Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Though T stock closed well off its intraday highs, the close of $31.36 still places prices at the highest level of 2021. We’re now testing the upper end of the one-year range. Any kind of basing in this area could precede an upside breakout over major resistance at $32. This would finally turn the weekly trend higher and inject some excitement into what has otherwise been an extremely dull stock. 7 Retail Stocks With E-Commerce Locked In The improved outlook for AT&T’s fundamentals should help support the stock over the coming quarter. To capitalize, I like diagonal call spreads. The Trade: Buy the June $30 call while selling the May $32 call for a net debit of $1.50. Stocks to Buy After Great Earnings: D.R. Horton (DHI) On Main Street, housing prices have been rapidly climbing in the wake of the pandemic. On Wall Street, traders have gobbled up homebuilding stocks as a way to bank on the trend. D.R. Horton is already up 39% year-to-date and just posted robust quarterly profits. That makes it a perfect final candidate for today’s stocks-to-buy gallery. The Texas-based home construction company earned $2.53 per share on total revenue of $6.45 billion. Both metrics exceeded analyst forecasts. DHR stock ended the day with a powerful bullish engulfing candle at the rising 20-day moving average. Volume swelled throughout the session to confirm institutions and other big buyers entering the fray. Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade DHR is a choppier stock, so I fully expect some backing and filling along the way. But the trend direction is undeniably higher, and $100 beckons as the obvious next target. The Trade: Buy the June $95/$100 for $2.15.

2021-04-22	2021-04-22 15:51:00	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Freeport Beats Copper Estimates in Relief to Tight Supplies	(Bloomberg) -- Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the biggest publicly traded copper miner, produced more than expected last quarter and raised its annual sales projection in a much needed boost to tight global supplies of the metal.The Phoenix-based company is on schedule with the ramp-up of underground operations at its flagship Grasberg mine in Indonesia and is stepping up output from North America just as copper surges toward the highest price in almost a decade. At its Cerro Verde mine in Peru, Freeport plans to get back to pre-pandemic levels next year.At a time of robust demand and production disruptions elsewhere, Freeport’s expansion provides some relief for smelters and consumers of the metal used in wiring. Rather than a spike, Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson sees copper’s rally to above $4 a pound as supported by fundamentals -- with scarce stockpiles, strong demand and dearth of big new projects waiting in the wings.“The outlook for copper has never been better,” Adkerson said on a conference call Thursday, citing structural deficits that support higher prices.In the first quarter, Freeport reported output of 910 million pounds compared with the 825.4 million average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company now expects to sell about 3.85 billion pounds this year, up slightly from a January projection, and sees annual sales growing to 4.4 billion pounds in the next two years.Cost HeadwindRising production costs are one of the only headwinds to earnings growth, with the company matching cash cost estimates in the quarter but raising its projection for the year amid pricier energy and freight. Adjusted earnings came in at 51 cents a share in the first quarter compared with the 50-cent average estimate. Sales met expectations.CEO Adkerson said the company had resumed evaluations of future growth projects and expects to have that process ready by year-end. With high copper prices indicating debt targets will be met around the same time, Freeport will then look at other capital allocation opportunities such as additional dividends.“With Freeport’s major transition year at Grasberg now mostly in the rearview mirror, we expect the company to have ample financial flexibility to re-deploy and accelerate key capital allocation priorities, such as capital returns and leverage optimization,” B. Riley Securities analyst Lucas Pipes wrote in a note to clients.The one remaining component of its Indonesian strategy are smelters. The company agreed to build a smelter as part of renewing its contracts at Grasberg, and has been working with the government on proposals. A decision is yet to be made on proceeding with a project alone or with partners.The company’s shares have more than quadrupled in value in the past year in one of the best performances among copper suppliers tracked by Bloomberg Intelligence. The stock was down 2.8% at 11:20 a.m. in New York.Freeport is focused on expanding its its own assets rather than looking at growth through acquisitions after making M&A missteps in past cycles.“We have no strategy of engaging in M&A markets, but we’ll be positioned now for the first time in a long, long time to take advantage of an opportunity that comes to us,” Adkerson said.(Updates with CEO comment on copper price and capital allocation)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-beats-copper-estimates-relief-155100668.html?.tsrc=rss

Moreover, over the past month, the stock fell by 3.48%, but in the past year, increased by 424.52%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 16.29%. View more earnings on FCX The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 22.91 in the Metals & Mining industry, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 75.88. Shareholders might be inclined to think that Freeport-McMoRan Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It's also possible that the stock is overvalued. There are many limitations to P/E ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings.

2021-03-19	2021-03-19 14:53:16	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Understanding Freeport-McMoRan's Unusual Options Activity	"Shares of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $34.37. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-03-19 Strike Price: $35.00 Volume: 936 Open Interest: 4942 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-03-12	2021-03-12 14:42:15	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Copper Rally Has Echoes of Supercycle for CEO of Miner Freeport	(Bloomberg) -- The copper industry has been wary about calling the doubling of prices in the past year as the start of a new supercycle. On Friday, a veteran of the red metal got pretty close.Richard Adkerson, chief executive officer and chairman of top publicly traded producer Freeport-McMoRan Inc., said the surge in prices to above $4 a pound isn’t just a spike and is supported by fundamentals -- with scarce stockpiles, strong demand and dearth of big new projects waiting in the wings.For 74-year-old Adkerson, the 2020-2021 upswing has “a degree of an echo” with a decade ago, when prices hit record highs after Chinese industrialization outpaced supply growth. While “you never know what’s around the corner,” the latest rally is supported by even fewer prospects to bring on new supply, he said.“If copper were to go to $10 tomorrow, it would take us seven, eight years to get new production to the market,” he said during the Fastmarkets Copper Seminar on Friday.For Freeport, the jump in copper prices is creating “a magical time” given it’s coinciding with the ramp-up of its giant Grasberg mine in Indonesia, he said.While Freeport’s board made “a bad decision” by diversifying into oil at the peak of the cycle, this time around directors are committed to copper and rewarding shareholders, Adkerson said. Still, the company will be well positioned to pounce on opportunities that may come along, he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/copper-rally-echoes-supercycle-ceo-144215420.html?.tsrc=rss

After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $33.58. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-03-19 Strike Price: $35.00 Volume: 2119 Open Interest: 29409 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts.

2021-03-02	2021-03-02 15:20:59	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Unusual Options Activity Insight: Freeport-McMoRan	"Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) shares experienced unusual options activity on Tuesday. The stock price moved up to $35.91 following the option alert. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-03-05 Strike Price: $36.00 Volume: 855 Open Interest: 2085 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

Why Shares in Copper Miner Freeport-McMoRan Surged in February	Shares in copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) rose 26% in February according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

2021-02-19	2021-02-19 15:16:03	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Understanding Freeport-McMoRan's Unusual Options Activity	Shares of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $37.59. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-03-12 Strike Price: $35.00 Volume: 986 Open Interest: 370 3 Ways Options Activity is ‘Unusual’ Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Contracts that have been traded, but not closed by a counter-party, are called open interest. A purchased contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for the option. When a contract has an expiration date in the distant future, it is generally another sign of unusual activity. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. “Out of the money” contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. “Out of the money” occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Understanding Sentiment Options are “bullish” when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are “bearish” when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor’s true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they’re hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-01-26	2021-01-26 18:00:49	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Freeport Falls as Copper Giant Trims Outlook Amid Metals Rally	(Bloomberg) -- Freeport-McMoRan Inc. fell after the mining giant trimmed expectations for copper sales this year -- even as heightened global demand for the industrial metal fuels a price rally.Freeport revised its sales volume forecasts for 2021 after posting fourth-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates, helped by better-than-anticipated copper and gold sales in the period. The Phoenix-based miner now expects copper sales of 3.8 billion pounds for 2021, down from an October projection of 3.85 billion, while its annual gold sales forecast was pared 7.1% to 1.3 million ounces.Chief Financial Officer Kathleen Quirk described the guidance changes in Tuesday’s earnings call as “minor revisions” to reflect costs tied to energy, currency and maintenance as the world’s largest publicly traded copper company ramps up operations at its flagship Grasberg mine in Indonesia.Shares of Freeport fell 7% at 12:52 p.m. trading in New York.Copper has been soaring since plunging early last year with Chinese and U.S. demand increasing as Covid-19 vaccines are distributed and economies recover, while gold climbed to a record in August. That helped propel Freeport’s earnings in the fourth quarter, with the miner posting net income of $708 million and adjusted per-share earnings of 39 cents to beat the 37-cent average estimate of 17 analysts. Revenue climbed to $4.5 billion, also beating estimates.‘Strong Quarter’“In our opinion, this was a strong quarter from an operational standpoint, with the company outperforming our expectations on both volume and costs,” B. Riley Securities analyst Lucas Pipes said Tuesday in a note to clients.Freeport said it expects unit net cash costs for copper to be $1.25 per pound, higher than its previous projection for less than $1.20, according to Tuesday’s earnings statement. The company projected in October that costs will decline as it ramps up production at Grasberg and a new operation in Arizona. Freeport also restarted its Chino mine in New Mexico this month at about 50% capacity, after suspending the operations last April due to Covid-19.Still, Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said during the earnings call that past efforts will enable the company to increase margins and cash flows “substantially” for 2021 and beyond.“Copper sales are projected to increase 20% over 2020, gold volumes are projected to increase by over 50%. Our unit net cash costs of production will decline,” he said. “This is occurring at a time for improved pricing for copper.”Higher CopperAdkerson sees copper going “much higher” than $3.50 a pound, though even at that price Freeport is “on the path” to nearly double earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, from last year’s levels, he said.“The significantly higher cash flows will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet, build value in our business, return substantial cashflows to shareholders,” he said.Adkerson also reiterated interest in reviving Freeport’s dividend, which it suspended in March to help weather the pandemic.“Management expects to recommend to the board of directors the resumption of common stock dividends during 2021 and anticipates an ongoing ability to increase cash returns to shareholders in the future,” the company said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-falls-copper-giant-trims-180049142.html?.tsrc=rss

Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Tuesday's Q4 earnings announcement.What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.Earnings And Revenue Based on Freeport-McMoRan management projections, analysts predict EPS of $0.38 on revenue of $4.21 billion. Freeport-McMoRan EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $0.02. Sales were $3.91 billion.What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values.View more earnings on FCXThe Wall Street estimate would represent a 1800.0% increase in the company's earnings. Revenue would be up 7.65% from the year-ago period. Freeport-McMoRan's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this:Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020  EPS Estimate 0.20 -0.02 -0.18 0  EPS Actual 0.29 0.03 -0.16 0.02  Revenue Estimate 3.71 B 3.13 B 2.90 B 3.71 B  Revenue Actual 3.85 B 3.05 B 2.80 B 3.91 B  Stock Performance Shares of Freeport-McMoRan were trading at $30.49 as of January 22. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 167.61%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably content going into this earnings release.Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call.

2021-01-21	2021-01-21 15:18:46	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Analyzing Freeport-McMoRan's Unusual Options Activity	"Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) shares experienced unusual options activity on Thursday. The stock price moved down to $30.59 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-22  * Strike Price: $24.00  * Volume: 1001  * Open Interest: 1613Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Analyzing NortonLifeLock's Unusual Options Activity  * Analyzing Office Props IT's Ex-Dividend Date(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

He served as CEO from 1984 to 2003 and chairman from 1984 to 2015. The company’s assets include its flagship mine at Grasberg, as well as copper and molybdenum operations in the Americas.Moffett stepped down as executive chairman in 2015, as a commodity-price boom went bust, and was named Chairman Emeritus and consultant to the Freeport board.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-bob-moffett-co-founder-053616249.html?.tsrc=rss

Earlier this month, Axios broke a story detailing a relationship between U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell of California and a woman named Christine Fang.
In short, between 2011 and 2015, Fang began a relationship with Swalwell, who was an up-and-coming local politician in the Bay Area at the time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Fang helped Swalwell fundraise for his 2014 reelection campaign. She also placed at least one intern in Swalwell’s office. And, as it turns out, she had a romantic relationship with Swalwell.
It turns out that Fang was a suspected Chinese intelligence operative, taking part in what U.S. officials believe was a political intelligence operation run by China’s main spy agency.
From Axios:
The woman at the center of the operation, a Chinese national named Fang Fang or Christine Fang, targeted up-and-coming local politicians in the Bay Area and across the country who had the potential to make it big on the national stage.
Through campaign fundraising, extensive networking, personal charisma, and romantic or sexual relationships with at least two Midwestern mayors, Fang was able to gain proximity to political power, according to current and former U.S. intelligence officials and one former elected official.
Even though U.S. officials do not believe Fang received or passed on classified information, the case “was a big deal, because there were some really, really sensitive people that were caught up” in the intelligence network, a current senior U.S. intelligence official said …
Among the most significant targets of Fang’s efforts was Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.).
Today, Swalwell sits on the House Intelligence Committee.
This has raised red flags for other House members, leading them to send a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, urging her to “immediately remove” Swalwell out of national security concerns.
This is just one example of the growing strain between Washington and Beijing.
Dating back to even before President Trump’s tariffs, the reality is the United States is in an economic war with China — one that is going to intensify.
But what does this have to do with investing?
Because certain domestic sectors are woefully vulnerable to a Chinese economic attack, this war is going to reshape parts of the U.S. economy. We’re going to see substantial federal spending as we fortify these weak spots.
So today, let’s look at one of the most critical stress points — and how federal efforts to boost it could be a huge tailwind for your portfolio …
An Overreliance on China
On September 30, President Trump signed an executive order declaring U.S. reliance on China in rare earth metals a national emergency.
Rare earth metals (or elements) are a group of 17 metals that, while not exactly rare, can be difficult to find and extract.
These metals contain unique magnetic, heat-resistant, and phosphorescent properties that make them critical to the technology and defense industries. They are key components of missile guidance systems, lasers, electronic displays, radar, and satellites.
That’s what makes them highly strategic resources.
Yet … the United States has to buy 90% of its rare earth metals from China!
In other words, China could easily cripple major parts of the U.S. military, simply by refusing to ship rare earth metals to us.
According to the U.S Geological Survey, China produced 38% of the world’s rare earth elements in 1993, and 33% of the supply came from the United States. Smaller percentages came from Australia, Malaysia, Canada, and India.
However, by 2008, China accounted for more than 90% of global rare earth element production. And by 2011, China accounted for 97% of global production. Just look at this chart:

Simply put, this reliance on China is a gaping hole in our national security.
Our politicians know this and are scrambling to shore it up … with billions of dollars.
Investors who see what’s happening and position themselves accordingly stand to benefit.
On May 12, 2020, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas introduced the Onshoring Rare Earths Act of 2020, stating:
Our ability as a nation to manufacture defense technologies and support our military is dangerously dependent on our ability to access rare earth elements and critical minerals mined, refined, and manufactured almost exclusively in China.
Much like the Chinese Communist Party has threatened to cut off the U.S. from lifesaving medicines made in China, the Chinese Communist Party could also cut off our access to these materials, significantly threatening U.S. national security.
The ORE Act will help ensure China never has that opportunity by establishing a rare earth elements and critical minerals supply chain in the U.S.
Beyond this, according to Defense News, the Pentagon has “proposed legislation that aims to end reliance on China for rare earth minerals” by earmarking an estimated “$1.75 billion on rare earth elements in munitions and missiles and $350 million for microelectronics.”
And as we noted a moment ago, there was President Trump’s executive order from October.
When you follow the investment breadcrumbs, it leads you directly to top-shelf rare earth mining stocks …
One of 2020’s Best Stocks Could Keep Climbing
From The Wall Street Journal following Trump’s executive order:
Miners say they think Mr. Trump’s executive order could encourage a stronger U.S. industry in critical minerals, not least because investors are more likely to back companies they believe the government supports.
Shares in companies that mine or want to mine critical materials rose on the news of the order.
As it turns out, my pick in InvestorPlace’s Best Stock for 2020 contest is a miner that popped on the Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX).
Freeport-McMoRan is a Phoenix-based mining company with exposure to rare earth metals. It’s also one of the best-performing stocks in that contest.
While I remain highly bullish on Freeport, it’s not the only way to trade this renewed focus on rare earth metals.
I recently came out with a special report called Red, White, and Blue Stocks … for a Six-Figure Payday that details a unique rare-earth-metals play, a world-class uranium company, and a mining company.
There are also three additional picks in the report that tap into other trends relating to escalating economic tensions with China.
The effort to shore up this key U.S. vulnerability — and other “stress points” — suggests there are big gains coming here.

2020-12-18	2020-12-18 17:49:02	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Blowout Profits Seen Boosting Miners Trading at Multi-Year Highs	(Bloomberg) -- The rally that drove some of the world’s largest miners to multi-year highs will extend into 2021 as the economy recovers from the steepest slump since the Great Depression, according to analysts.Trillions of dollars in government stimulus, the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and China’s rampant appetite for raw materials have triggered speculation that the surge in mining companies has further to run. With rising commodity prices and a drop in production costs setting the stage for blowout profits, copper producers are poised for their best year in over a decade. The metal topped $8,000 a ton for the first time since 2013 on Friday.“We expect another leg to this rally” in commodities and mining shares, with momentum extending into the first half of 2021, RBC Capital Markets analysts led by Sam Crittenden wrote in a note to clients. Governments will “do whatever it takes to ensure the global economy gets back on track.”Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer, has soared more than 350% from the stock-market bottom in March, compared with gains of about 65% for the S&P 500 Index. Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson sees profit margins swelling, with the company on track to double earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2021. Newmont Corp., the biggest gold miner, headed toward its best year since 2016.Amid the stunning turnaround for raw materials, copper has surged about 80% from the depths of the pandemic, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. pointing to the start of a new long-term bull market. Industrial metals are likely to strengthen as prospects for a Covid-19 vaccine drive an economic rebound, according to Bank of America Corp. Morgan Stanley said the commodity rally could have more legs -- though it also sees headwinds building as China’s credit impulse moderates, currencies stabilize and stimulus tapering looms.The Bloomberg Base Metals Spot Price Commodity Index has jumped almost 55% from its March 2020 lows. It isn’t the first time that a big selloff ends up in a powerful rebound for the industry. Coming out of the global financial crisis, the gauge soared more than 170% from its lowest point in December 2008, before peaking in February 2011.Read: Copper-Market Cocktail Means Miners Have Rarely Had It So Good“Typically, industrial commodity prices do well when global industrial production is accelerating,” wrote BMO Capital Markets analysts led by Colin Hamilton. They expect the positive momentum for industrial metals to continue in the first quarter of the next year, despite the big rally that’s pushed up valuations.Other analysts including TD Securities Inc.’s Greg Barnes and Berenberg’s Jonathan Guy say investors should tread carefully after the surge in prices. Traders might also consider China’s stance on metals buying, which could wane in the new year, according to BMO.I’d recommend “a degree of caution” as the sentiment for base and bulk metals looks increasingly detached from fundamentals, noted Berenberg’s Guy. His firm expects the rally to continue into the first quarter, followed by a likely pullback later in 2021.Jefferies has a positive outlook for base metals, especially copper for the next 12 to 18 months. Its top picks are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals Ltd., with the firm also recommending Anglo American Plc, Glencore Plc, Antofagasta Plc, Vale SA and BHP Group Ltd.“The bullish narrative is clearly gaining traction with investors, including those who had been skeptical a few months ago,” Jefferies analysts including Christopher LaFemina said in an emailed note.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bullish-wave-seen-powering-rally-161000888.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-16	2020-12-16 18:28:11	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Freeport CEO Sees Banner Years Ahead After Gains Won in ‘Battle’	(Bloomberg) -- With a tumultuous decade almost behind him and the prospect of banner years ahead, the longtime boss of global miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc. has little interest in retiring just as cash looks set to roll in.“Our Freeport family, our Freeport team, has gone to battle together,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson, 73, said Tuesday in a phone interview. “We’re within real close line of sight to having the kind of great success that we worked so long for.”Such success will be underpinned by a production boost after a disruptive year at the company’s mines. Adkerson expects copper volumes to expand by 20% and gold by 70% next year, with rising outputs lowering costs. With copper near seven-year highs and gold hovering about 10% below its peak, he sees profit margins swelling. At those prices, the producer says it’s on track to double earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization next year.Adkerson, who has been at Freeport since 1989 and CEO since 2003, has helped guide the world’s biggest publicly traded copper company through what he calls a series of “twists and turns.” Those include the mid-decade collapse of the commodity boom -- which forced it to sell assets and shares to manage its debt -- years of tortured negotiations to secure long-term mining rights for its flagship Grasberg operation in Indonesia, and a multibillion-dollar revamp of that giant mine.Then Covid-19 hit, forcing the Phoenix-based company to revise its operating plans, cut its dividend and some executive pay, and delay capital spending. Despite disruptions, Freeport pushed ahead with its ramp up of Grasberg, a copper and gold mine that has been transitioning from open pit to underground operations.“By the end of 2021 we will be back at full production,” Adkerson said, returning the mine to its position as one of the world’s single biggest sources of copper and gold.Freeport also brought its Lone Star project in Arizona online this year. It is slowly returning its Covid-hit Cerro Verde mine in Peru back to normal operations and plans to restart its Chino mine in New Mexico next year at half capacity.Investors have noticed the company’s efforts, with Freeport’s stock four times higher than its March low.Rising cash flow has been pushing down net-debt levels, which were about $8 billion at the end of the third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Kathleen Quirk said on the same call. As that continues, Freeport will “significantly” increase cash returns to shareholders “over time”, Adkerson said. He expects the board will start a discussion on reinstating dividends “very early in 2021.”The next use for cash would be to boost production, Adkerson said, and the first choice would be projects at existing operations.“We don’t have to make acquisitions to sustain our production profile,” he said.Copper SmelterOne unfinished piece of business is in Indonesia. Freeport pledged to help build a copper smelter in the country as part of 2018 agreements that gave a majority stake of its Indonesian operations to state-owned PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium. In August, local unit PT Freeport Indonesia sought government approval to push back the target for finishing the $3 billion project in East Java by a year, to 2024, after the pandemic disrupted construction.Adkerson said Freeport remains committed to the project, while PT-FI also is part of talks on an alternative plant with a Chinese company and the government.“My sense is that this will get sorted out sooner than later,” he said. “It’s under discussion.”The CEO and vice chairman said he intends to stick around to see the agreements fulfilled. In any case, he said, Freeport has a succession plan in place around a strong executive team. On the cusp of his 74th birthday, he adds his health and energy levels are good, noting: “I’m younger than Joe Biden.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-ceo-sees-banner-years-182811212.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-20	2020-11-20 15:10:56	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Analyzing Freeport-McMoRan's Unusual Options Activity	"On Friday, shares of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $21.27.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-12-18  * Strike Price: $19.00  * Volume: 373  * Open Interest: 5487Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price.

2020-10-27	2020-10-27 10:23:28	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Critical Copper Negotiations Point to a Tight Market	(Bloomberg) -- As Freeport McMoRan Inc. hammers out next year’s benchmark deal for the copper industry, the coronavirus has complicated negotiations but also given the miner an edge.Gone is an ice-breaking reception for key customers that Freeport’s Javier Targhetta hosted for more than two decades during London Metal Exchange Week. For the past few years, that’s seen Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson serenade hundreds of guests as they dined on champagne and paella at a Park Lane hotel.While virtual talks are proceeding more slowly than traditional face-to-face meetings, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Sales Targhetta is targeting similar contractual terms to this year. That’s partly because the pandemic is stoking market uncertainty and keeping mine supply tight, a central pillar in copper’s rebound to a two-year high above $7,000 a ton last week.“We definitely see a continuing deficit of concentrate in the market,” said Targhetta, referring to the mined ores extracted by Freeport and other producers. “I’d look at a small number plus or minus,” compared with the current benchmark, he said.Even before the pandemic, tight supply for concentrates had enabled Freeport to strike deals for 2020 that offered the lowest processing fees in nine years.This year, the supply of copper from mines in South America was hit hard by the pandemic, while imports into China reached record levels as the country’s economy rebounded. While negotiations for 2021 are at an early stage, a projected deficit for concentrates means Freeport doesn’t expect to see any major changes in the treatment and refining charges it pays smelters to turn mined ores into metal, Targhetta said.As the world’s largest listed copper miner, the deals Freeport signs with its Asian customers typically set the benchmark for the rest of the industry, and negotiations are closely watched by investors as a barometer for supply and demand for the coming year.Even without the bonhomie of LME Week’s gala dinners and after-parties, one tradition appears to have remained intact: many in the industry finished the week feeling more bullish on copper’s prospects than they were at the start.“After a week full of virtual meetings, our bullish view on copper first established in April and reaffirmed in August hasn’t changed,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts said in an emailed note, forecasting that prices could hit $7,500 in the second quarter of 2021. “While there were some disagreements around the price targets during our calls, we concluded that this constructive view on copper seems to be consensus by now.”Higher prices should provide an incentive for miners to maximize output next year, potentially alleviating some of the strain on supply, Freeport’s Targhetta said.While he expects that changes in next year’s processing fees will be small, smelters are pressing for a more significant increase to shore up their margins. The head of Aurubis AG, Europe’s largest copper producer, said treatment and refining charges are unjustifiably low.“It’s difficult to say what will happen for next year, but for me one thing is clear: this level is not the right level,” Roland Harings said in an interview.Harings said he’s looking forward to the day when the industry will be able to iron out such commercial differences face-to-face again. He may cut back on travel, but big industry events like LME Week are still going to play a vital role, he said.On that, Freeport’s Targhetta agrees.“It’s always difficult, but now it’s much more difficult,” he said, referring to ongoing negotiations. “I’m just looking forward to everyone getting back to normal, and for the pandemic to be over.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/critical-copper-negotiations-point-tight-102328610.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-20	2020-10-20 10:00:12	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Those Vanishing Stock Dividends Should Stay That Way	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When Freeport-McMoRan Inc. announced on March 23 that it was eliminating its quarterly dividend because of the uncertainty brought on by the emerging Covid-19 pandemic, the company’s shares took a hit, closing within pennies of their lowest in more than four years. So when Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said on Friday that the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer would be in a position “very early next year” to consider not only restoring the payout but “building it up to where it will be very meaningful for shareholders,” investors could have been expected to be elated.Instead, they seemed disappointed, beating the shares down 0.35%. It’s not as if shareholders missed the dividend. Freeport-McMoRan’s shares soared 211% between the last trading day before suspending the payout and Friday, trouncing the 51% gain in the S&P 500 Index. Even the exalted tech-heavy NYSE FANG+ Index, which surged 111%, couldn’t keep pace with the company.Shareholders appeared to send the message that they would prefer Freeport-McMoRan put the $290 million or so it was paying out as a dividend each year to better use during these unprecedented times. Sure, the amount is relatively small for a company forecast to generate about $17 billion of revenue in 2021. And many variables other than the dividend influence Freeport-McMoRan’s share price. But the point is that the pandemic has shown how quickly disruption can occur and that money paid in dividends may be better used to fund innovations and efficiencies. Given how quickly credit can dry up, even paying down debt is likely to be seen as generating more shareholder value than handing out money in dividends. There’s a reason companies with strong balance sheets  — low debt — have outperformed the broad market this year. And Freeport-McMoRan is not alone. Janus Henderson estimated during the summer that the deep contraction in the global economy would cause dividends to decline between 15% and 34% this year.DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas addressed the broad issue of dividends in a note to clients last week. He noted how companies have basically seen five years of innovative disruption compressed into nine months. For example, he pointed out how the rising popularity of banking and trading apps such as Robinhood Financial LLC have disrupted the financial sector. More people shopping and working from home have disrupted the real estate and consumer discretionary sectors. Less driving has disrupted the energy sector. The list goes on. So instead of thinking about when dividends may be restored, companies would be better off thinking about how to deal with the disruption and perhaps become disruptors themselves. But to do that, executives need to break away from their old way of thinking about dividends and earnings. As Colas says, companies believe that investors see dividend policy as an important signal of future earnings. The reality, though, is that “the amount of time boards spend on dividends is substantially more than the attention investors give the topic,” according to Colas.There’s some truth to that. If there was ever a time that investors preferred safety, it should be during a global pandemic that caused the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, with benchmark interest rates at zero to boot. And yet the S&P Dividend Aristocrats Total Return Index, which tracks those members of the S&P 500 that have followed a policy of consistently increasing dividends every year for at least 25 years, gained just 1.76% in 2020 through Friday. That’s far less than the 7.83% increase in the S&P 500 and 35.7% surge in the Nasdaq 100 Index. It’s notable that dividends are nearly nonexistent for the Nasdaq 100, whose members are a Who’s Who of market leaders and where price-to-earnings ratios are much higher. Sure, Apple Inc. pays a dividend, but it’s minuscule relative to the company’s $33 billion of cash and cash equivalents and almost $80 billion in annual cash flow. Plus, no one would accuse Apple of not being a disruptor. “Equity valuations have become even more asymmetric when it comes to ‘disruptors’ and ‘disrupted,’” Colas wrote. “If you ignore disruption trends, you end up with — at best — a 10-12x earnings multiple. If markets see your company in disruption’s vanguard, then multiples can be +30x.”As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Nir Kaissar wrote in April, dividends as a percentage of earnings for S&P 500 companies have been in decline since the late 1800s, dropping from about 80% to a recent 40%. And those executives who may be hesitant to cut the dividend cord should embrace the views of the legendary Warren Buffett, who prefers to reinvest profits in the companies he controls to improve their efficiency, expand their reach, create new products and services and improve existing ones.It’s no secret that value investing is out of vogue. Innovation is taking place faster than ever, and investors would prefer companies that can find better uses for their cash than pay it out in dividends. So the thousands of companies that drastically reduced or even eliminated their payouts during the pandemic should think long and hard about what they want to do with their cash once the economy recovers. Restoring dividends may be the wrong decision.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Robert Burgess is the Executive Editor for Bloomberg Opinion.

But when it’s time for companies to get fully back to work and show what they’re made of next year, three S&P 500 companies stand out above their peers as growth stocks ready for business both off and on the price chart.
Friday is shaping up to cap off a decent week for stocks. Intraday Friday the broad-based, large-cap S&P 500 is up about 0.8% for gains of nearly 3.8% for the five-day period. It hasn’t been without its hazards, though, for investors trying to further capitalize in the aftermath of September’s broad-based correction.
Following an abbreviated Covid-19 stay at Walter Reed , President Donald Trump went immediately to work, tweeting the country’s stimulus negotiations were off the table until after the election. And the blustery threat was taken seriously by many investors. The S&P 500 sank nearly 1.5% in an abrupt bearish U-turn.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
At the same time, heavier collateral damage across industry groups was par for the course in stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Target (NYSE:TGT), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Delta (NYSE:DAL), among others.


					10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy From Some of America's Best ETFs				

Of course, the president reopened the possibility of negotiations later. That’s not exactly a secret. And today stimulus talks appear to be even closer to an actual deal. Still, the past week has been tough for investors.
Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX)
Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN)
Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL)
Hopefully in 2021 we can truly make America great — and more normal — again. In such an environment, Wall Street’s analyst community sees select companies within the S&P 500 poised for outsized growth, and not simply looking attractive compared to a dismal 2020.

Growth Stocks to Buy: Freeport McMoRan (FCX)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The first of our growth stocks to buy is Freeport McMoRan. FCX has been a terrible investment for more than a decade, since the financial crisis of 2008–2009. But analysts are upbeat on Freeport’s prospects beyond Covid-19. The diversified mining giant is expected to grow sales by 30% and see earnings balloon from 34 cents to $1.46 next year.
Technically, this growth stock turned a key corner last month, as shares broke above long-term downtrend line. Shares also managed to hold above prior resistance, despite the broader market correction in September. Along with a massive triple bottoming pattern in place, the prospects of an emerging bullish cycle for Freeport McMoRan shareholders looks good.
With earnings risk later this month and an admittedly shaky stochastics setup, I’d take advantage of FCX’s options market and gain long delta exposure with the May $20/$25 call spread for $1 or better.

Align Technology (ALGN)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The next of our growth stocks to buy are shares of Align Technology. The outfit behind the wildly popular Invisalign cosmetic dental system hasn’t been a priority in 2020. Given the coronavirus’ impact on the economy and prolonged office closures, that’s hardly a surprise. But next year stands to be a boon for business.
Wall Street expects a bonanza of a year in 2021, with ALGN’s profits expected to roughly triple and climbing sales of almost 40%. Align Technology’s monthly chart should also put a smile on the faces of growth investors.


					9 Outbreak-Fueled Stocks to Buy This Week				

Technically, shares have been busy putting together an irregular ‘W’ corrective base for just over two years. And with this growth stock rallying above resistance through the pattern’s mid-pivot, conditions are promisingly bullish. But like with FCX, nearby earnings and stochastics risks also lend support to using an out-of-the-money call vertical. Here, the April $370/$400 call combination for up to $10 looks well-aligned with the price chart while allowing  2021 to gain bullish traction.

Ralph Lauren (RL)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The last of today’s growth stocks to buy is Ralph Lauren. The storied fashion empire has had a rough time in 2020. But of all the companies in the S&P 500, RL is expected to rebound the most strongly in terms of earnings growth with profits forecast to soar by nearly 1,100%.
Collectively, investors have been slow to sympathize with the consensus outlook. Shares are just barely more than 20% off their Covid-19 March low. That pales next to the S&P 500’s rally of around 60%. Still, a confirmed deep double-bottom formation which successfully tested its financial crisis’ 76% retracement level is the sort of pattern which appreciably can set the stage for a bullish cycle in a company’s share price.
In this growth stock and review of Ralph’s options board, I prefer playing it close to the vest and suggest investors suit up with the Jan $80/$85 bull call spread for up to $1.65.

2020-10-07	2020-10-07 14:25:16	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Understanding Freeport-McMoRan's Unusual Options Activity	"Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) shares experienced unusual options activity on Wednesday. The stock price moved up to $16.77 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-11-20  * Strike Price: $21.00  * Volume: 3001  * Open Interest: 762Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-01	2020-10-01 07:00:16	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	We're a Long, Long Way From Running Out of Gold	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Here’s one potential reason to add some bullion coins or bars to your investment portfolio: They’re not making any more of them.All the gold that’s ever been mined would fit into a cube with edges 22 meters long — small enough to fit into three Olympic-sized swimming pools. Each year, miners and pawnbrokers add another 4,000 to 5,000 metric tons to an existing 197,576 ton pile, but jewelry demand alone uses up about half of that.With the metal hitting a record $2,075 a troy ounce in August, the concern we’re heading toward peak gold has reared its head again. The industry needs to commission 8 million ounces of projects by 2025 to maintain last year’s production levels, consultants Wood Mackenzie wrote in June, requiring some $37 billion of capital investment. Mine production fell last year for the first time in more than a decade. Even the British Broadcasting Corp. has been asking whether we’re at risk of running out.At the core of the concern is a longstanding trend in the gold mining industry: The percentage of gold in ore reserves is falling, from more than 10 grams per ton in the late 1960s to barely more than 1 gram per ton nowadays. Those concentrations are extraordinarily low — equivalent to grinding up and separating a Statue of Liberty’s-worth of ore to recover a teaspoon of precious metal. At some point, the grade must get so poor that it becomes impossible to recover the gold economically.The thing is, we don’t know when that will be — and all the evidence indicates that we’re still a long way from finding out.Take Newcrest Mining Ltd.’s Cadia East mine 200 kilometers (124 miles) to the west of Sydney. The grade there is just 0.45 grams per ton — more than two Statue of Liberty’s-worth per teaspoon — and yet the mine is one of the world’s most profitable, with costs of $160 per ounce, which would deliver a margin of more than 90% at current gold prices(2).Two factors drive that. One is economies of scale: Cadia is one of the world’s top 10 gold mines measured by output. Since the dawn of the mining industry, grades of almost every mineral have been falling because, by definition, the highest-grade, most easily discovered resources are the ones that get exploited first. The growth of the sector has always depended upon better, higher-volume extraction technologies offsetting this fact.The place where many of the highest-grade major gold deposits are still found, South Africa, is increasingly a backwater. That’s because it’s simply so difficult to extract ore from sweltering tunnels kilometers underground using hand-operated tools. By comparison, the immense blasting and dump-truck operations used to exploit lower-grade mines in Siberia, Oceania and Nevada are far more efficient.The other factor is that most gold doesn’t occur on its own. Indeed, the best deposits globally are porphyry, a mineral that’s also one of the world’s biggest sources of copper. The operator of the world’s biggest gold mine isn’t a gold miner at all but copper producer Freeport-McMoRan Inc., whose Grasberg pit on the Indonesian side of New Guinea produced nearly twice as much gold in 2018 as its nearest rival, Polyus PJSC’s Olimpiada. At Newcrest’s Cadia, production costs are so low because for every ounce of gold that’s mined you get about 140 kilograms (309 pounds) of copper, worth $900 or so at current prices.While the issues of mine depletion highlighted by Wood Mackenzie are real, high gold prices like those we’re seeing at the moment are exactly the circumstances that will encourage more exploration and development activity to make up the shortfall. Though people have been digging up gold for seven millennia, it’s constantly being discovered in the most unexpected places.Mining of the yellow metal in Australia’s Victoria state all but ceased a century ago after the veins that drove its nation-building 19th-century gold rush were tapped out. Then in 2015 Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. discovered a new ore body near its uninspiring Fosterville mine site, and realized it was sitting on top of one of the world’s highest-grade deposits, causing its market capitalization to grow nearly 100-fold in five years.The same year, a unit of Zhaojin Mining Industry Co. discovered a new deposit two kilometers below the surface of the Bohai Sea off the coast of northeast China’s Shandong province. With some 212 metric tons of proven and probable reserves, it’s now one of the world’s largest gold deposits.There’s no reason to think that trend is about to break. About half of the world’s gold has been mined since 1976, and if anything the pace is accelerating as grades fall. Worldwide, gold production is up by about a third over the past decade, far more than the 15% increase in oil output. The best reason for investing in gold is still that it provides diversification to an investment portfolio — not that the world doesn’t have enough of it. One day, we may run out of gold. We’re a long, long way from that moment now.(1) The costs are for both Cadia East and the adjacent Ridgeway mine combined -- but Ridgeway is similarly low-grade, at 0.54 grams per ton.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2020-09-28	2020-09-28 21:00:08	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Rio Needs More Than a Safe Pair Of Hands	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Rio Tinto Group may choose to play it safe in its next choice of chief executive officer. With Jean-Sebastien Jacques heading for the exit after the destruction of a sacred Aboriginal site, Australian politicians are also piling on pressure for a local to be given the role. The mining giant should resist the temptation of an old-school solution.Jacques’s successor will certainly have to rebuild Rio’s credibility after the spectacular failure at Juukan Gorge. Repairing frayed community and government relations will be among the first tasks. It won’t be enough to pick a veteran technocrat for CEO, though, as miners did after the mistakes of the last boom. He or she won’t be able to repeat the trick that saw French-born J-S, as he is widely known, hand back billions to shareholders. The new boss will have to show Rio understands the iron ore business, which accounts for more than 90% of earnings and where prices are softening. Longer-term reconstruction will also involve resolving large, troublesome projects in Guinea and Mongolia, and positioning the company for greener growth. A steady hand on the tiller, while necessary, won’t be sufficient.Jacques, who took the top job in 2016 at 44, did plenty of things right. Rio has distributed $38 billion in cash returns since that year, including 2020’s interim dividend, and the shares have doubled. He extricated Rio from the Freeport-McMoRan Inc.-operated Grasberg mine in Indonesia. And he sold out of coal at a laudable price, well before peers began to rush for the door — even if the environmental, social and governance halo that came with both of those departures didn’t last.The outgoing CEO has also left plenty of problems for his replacement, well beyond the public relations disaster in Western Australia. A unit he set up to invest in green-economy materials has yet to make its mark. Mongolia, where Jacques’s role in settling a previous dispute was key to his elevation, remains a technical, financial and political  headache. The future of the giant Simandou iron ore mine in Guinea is also unclear. Least defensible of all, he stopped short of putting the miner on a decisively carbon-light track, failing to set targets for lower emissions beyond the company’s own operations.To make matters worse, his premature departure could hardly have been messier. As a result, a tainted CEO remains in place temporarily, while the chairman and board who will pick his replacement are badly sullied, too. They underestimated the problem and initially backed the forceful Jacques. They also failed to adequately prepare for his succession.Yet while the Anglo-Australian miner has suffered a reputational hit, its core operation is still producing impressive margins. It’s an enviable position that gives the company room to do more than bask in the iron ore price, even if investors are wary of radical moves — its shares rose after Jacques’s departure, on relief that big investments are off the table for now.One option to signal  willingness to change is to pick an outsider, preferably one with operational expertise to appease investors, but also enough familiarity with Rio to grapple with the culture and its problems.  That could be rail freight operator Aurizon Holdings Ltd.’s Andrew Harding, a former Rio iron ore boss passed over for the top job in 2016, if his Pilbara record holds up after Juukan Gorge. Otherwise, gold miner Newmont Corp.’s Tom Palmer, who previously worked in iron ore, or Newcrest Mining Ltd.’s Sandeep Biswas. Better yet, Rio could pick a female leader. Worthy candidates include Zoe Yujnovich, a one-time boss of Rio’s Canadian iron ore venture, before she left for Royal Dutch Shell Plc in 2014.Outsiders can be slow to bring on board, though, and Rio cannot afford to wait six or 12 months. Insiders, then, come into view.The new chief will have to rebuild bridges. Besides Western Australia, this matters in Mongolia, where Rio is in arbitration over tax payments. In Guinea, there is an election on the horizon. That may point to Mongolian-born Bold Baatar, who has been involved with the Oyu Tolgoi operation and is now in charge of Simandou, as part of energy and minerals. Former bankers make deal-wary shareholders uneasy, though. That suggests instead aluminum boss Alf Barrios, who has led a turnaround and proved he can tune in to clients’ green demands. China, a key consumer of Rio’s iron ore and other metals, has just promised to be carbon neutral by 2060, a warning worth heeding. Change isn’t easy, as BP Plc has shown. Adapting to the zero-emissions reality will be less dramatic for Rio, but no less necessary.One person can’t fix all these things, of course. A final step will be to refresh Rio’s underwhelming board, particularly with ESG and community relations experience, given mining in the Pilbara won’t be the same in the next decade and beyond.  There’s room here for that extra Australian voice that Canberra is demanding, perhaps in the chairman’s spot. Jacques’s abrupt departure has offered the world’s second-largest miner a chance to course-correct. Rio would be foolish not to take it. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

Many sectors that were already struggling, like energy and brick-and-mortar retail, have seen their slow declines turn into abject free fall. Other businesses, such as video gaming and work-from-home software companies, are booming. Many companies that initially plunged are now turning into huge rebound stocks.For example, you might not think of Indonesian copper miners or Brazilian payment processors as natural beneficiaries of the present economic situation. Yet those are some of the off-the-radar rebound stocks that are thriving today.  * 9 Gold Stocks to Buy That Still Have Room to Run Here are three surprising rebound stocks that are making huge comebacks this summer:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX)  * Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU)  * PagSeguro Digital (NYSE:PAGS) Rebound Stocks: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.com Back in March, the coronavirus pandemic was in full force. Freeport-McMoRan tumbled below $5, and traders were scared. But shortly after the stock hit that low, I pointed out that the company's CEO had been spending millions to buy the stock, and I also offered an optimistic forecast. Sure, the coronavirus has depressed short-term economic activity, and thus the demand for base metals. The market, however, only priced in that downside and lost sight of the potential recovery. Fortunately, astute traders were able to take advantage of that mis-pricing.While the U.S. is still struggling to fully control the pandemic, in China and many other countries around the world, economic activity is approaching &quot;normal&quot; levels. As a result, industrial buyers are quickly returning to the copper market.Thanks to this resurgent demand, global copper inventories are falling, and are now far below the five-year average levels for this time of year. And now, the price of copper is up 3% year-to-date. FCX stock has followed this amazing trajectory. It is now up 14% overall in 2020.In addition to copper's run, Freeport-McMoRan is also drawing fuel from a rallying gold price and the surprising announcement that the company has been producing more copper and gold than it had previously forecast. This is notable as many mining operations face production shortfalls due to the virus.In fact, part of copper's strength is due to mine closures in Chile and Peru. Yet Freeport-McMoRan has boosted production despite the headwinds.The unexpectedly strong guidance sent analysts scurrying to revise their earnings estimates. Although a slim annual loss is probably still in the cards for this year, earnings per share should easily top $1 next year, assuming copper and gold prices remain around current levels. The company has invested heavily in new projects that will bring even more production online. This could lift EPS to $2 in coming years.Risks remain, of course. The recovering global economy could sputter once again, and the virus could make a second -- or third -- wave. But powerful long-term demand trends are likely to push the copper price and Freeport's shares much higher than they are today. Baidu (BIDU)Source: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com In July, Baidu announced plans to boost investment in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, data centers and other new infrastructure over the next 10 years to prepare for &quot;the smart economy of the future.&quot;&quot;New infrastructure -- which encompasses emerging technologies like AI, cloud computing, 5G, [internet of things], and blockchain -- will be the driver for China's economic development in the coming decades,&quot; CTO Haifeng Wang explained.To establish a leadership position in the techno-future it anticipates, the company has laid out a plan to have 5 million intelligent cloud servers operational by 2030, and to train 5 million AI professionals within five years.There is no guarantee Baidu's grand AI ambitions will translate into robust profit growth, but the company is pointed in the right direction. We also know that Baidu is profitable and possesses a rock-solid balance sheet with more than $20 billion in cash and equivalents. And thanks to resurgent economic activity in China, the company should earn about $6.50 a share this year, rising to about $8.50 next year. At that level of profit, the stock would be selling for just 15x earnings.Baidu stock also trades for less than 3x revenues. That is incredibly cheap for internet companies in general, and compared to other information providers in particular. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) goes for more than 6x sales by contrast. With compelling profitability and valuation ratios, and a credible cloud strategy for the next decade, Baidu's investors will be richly rewarded. Rebound Stocks: PagSeguro Digital (PAGS)Source: rafastockbr / Shutterstock.com Trying to buy a good stock in a bad market is usually a recipe for failure. And in early March, that's exactly what an investment in the Brazilian payment processor PagSeguro appeared to be: a failure. The stock had crumbled 70% from its high above $50 last September to less than $15. But since that low, the stock has more than doubled. That makes it one of the best stocks in one of the world's hardest-hit stock markets.Year-to-date, PagSeguro is now up 30%, even though the overall Brazilian stock market is still down. Brazil's struggling stock market is no mystery, as the country is facing one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks. Political uncertainty is also rising.That's a grim backdrop for any Brazilian company, including PagSeguro. And yet, the company still managed to produce impressive year-over-year growth during the first quarter. A few pertinent highlights would include:  * 24% increase in active merchants on its payment platform  * 27% jump in revenue  * 13% gain in net income  * 10% boost in cash on the balance sheetMeanwhile, PagSeguro continues to take market share from its competitors. This steady market-share growth results directly from the company's strategy to attract millions of small and micro-merchants to its platform. In a way, this is similar to Square's (NYSE:SQ) model in the United States. Get a strong position with active small businesses, and then use that to build out a broader financial platform. Like Square, PagSeguro is launching an online bank to broaden its business. Brazil is an underbanked country, and thus there's plenty of room for a disruptive financial services company to reach previously untapped channels.Additionally, the company seems to be benefiting from the coronavirus in two ways. First, PagSeguro's core customer base of micro-merchants are the kind of entrepreneurs who cannot afford to shelter in place. They must work to eat, and so they are continuing to operate throughout the coronavirus crisis in Brazil. Second, PagSeguro's platform offers touchless payments. Because of virus fears, touchless payments are gaining steam against cash.Looking longer term, PagSeguro's strategy closely resembles the uber-successful model Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) pioneered in China with its WeChat platform. Many Chinese use WeChat Pay like a kind of digital concierge to conduct dozens of everyday tasks. They can book a shared car ride, conduct touchless transactions in person or online, buy train and airline tickets, invest in stocks, pay utility bills, and even buy and manage their health insurance.PagSeguro's bank is building a similar suite of apps and services that customers can utilize through its platform. Bottom line: PagSeguro is performing extremely well in the midst of challenging macroeconomic conditions.

And an Australian hedge fund, Tribeca Investment Partners, had called for Lindsay’s replacement and said the company should divest energy and coal assets.Teck’s shares have struggled this year, dropping 26% in Toronto trading, compared with a 13% gain in the 107-company Bloomberg World Mining Index.“These changes will further strengthen our senior management team as we continue to advance our key priorities to generate long-term value for shareholders,” Lindsay said in Wednesday’s statement.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teck-goes-headhunting-spree-investors-211453677.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-06	2020-08-06 18:31:58	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Unusual Options Activity Insight: Freeport-McMoRan	On Thursday, shares of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $14.62.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2022-01-21  * Strike Price: $15.00  * Volume: 1228  * Open Interest: 5923 Indications of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being &quot;out of the money&quot;. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Strategies to Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For August 4, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-29	2020-07-29 10:01:01	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Rio Tinto Can Stay Stuck in a Profitable Rut, For Now	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The world’s second-largest miner is proving pandemic-resistant.Rio Tinto Group’s latest results show earnings dipped only modestly as iron ore offset tarnished base metals. The steel ingredient’s long-term future looks distinctly rusty, but that’s not yet reality in 2020. Stubbornly high prices have again helped sate investors with dividends in a climate of sub-zero yields, meaning boss Jean-Sebastien Jacques is under little pressure to change tack. Until the global economy recovers, Rio will remain a near-perfect bond proxy.First-half underlying earnings came in at $4.75 billion, before impairments largely related to the aluminum business. That’s down 4% from a year earlier but above market expectations, thanks to top-earner iron ore, which cushioned the impact of worse performances in copper, aluminium and diamonds. Even compared to 2019, when it surged after Brazilian miner Vale SA’s fatal dam collapse, iron ore has shone this year — this time thanks to coronavirus-linked closures and other disruptions. The 72% margin at Rio's Pilbara — based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization — and an average realized price of $85.4 per dry metric ton bode well for peers including Vale, reporting later Wednesday, not least as the current market price is now a quarter above that.Jacques’ team presented broadly what investors have come to expect from mining majors: relatively pedestrian production, decent free cash flow — even if a drop to $2.8 billion will disappoint some —  and modest debt, with a net gearing ratio of just 10%. Plus, of course, a respectable payout. After all, miners are still building up their reputations as good custodians of shareholder cash.The trouble is just how much of this picture depends on iron ore — for this six-month period, the division accounted for roughly 80% of group Ebitda and well over 90% of earnings. That’s great news for the digger’s profits today, but less so for tomorrow’s prospects. Appetite is set to eventually ease along with China’s latest infrastructure splurge, and steel demand will cool. Supply looks plentiful, thanks to projects like Rio’s own problematic but alluring Simandou in Guinea. As Jacques said Wednesday, there is no question that mega-mine will eventually get built.Still, future problems look a lot less pressing when you’re the world’s top producer and iron ore is trading at over $100 per ton. Anglo American Plc’s South African iron ore business has pointed to a price level closer to $90 for the second half — hardly a headache for Rio, with cash costs at $14.5 per ton. In a volatile world of second-wave outbreaks and rock-bottom borrowing costs, investors are less anxious about growth than they are about stability and yield.On that front, Rio continues to deliver. There was no one-time splurge, but Rio still promised $2.5 billion of interim dividends, bringing what shareholders have received in cash returns since 2016 to $38 billion. Even with spending ticking higher, it’s hard to see that shifting. Deals are expensive, too: The balance sheets of long-mooted copper targets like Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and First Quantum Minerals Ltd. are looking healthier than they have in some time, making them harder prey.Super-generous returns are ultimately hard to sustain for a company that digs stuff for a living, especially one that should be doing far more to edge toward a greener, carbon-light economy. And there were welcome glimmers of growth, not least from higher spending and Rio’s exploration work in the Australian outback, where copper and gold finds could boost output and prove the sort of progressive investment that is likely to be welcomed.Corporate heavyweights change slowly. The truth, though, is that iron ore is simply working too well for now, for both Rio and dividend-hungry investors. Until they begin to demand more production, the global economy recovers, and inflation moves higher, there just isn’t a lot of incentive to shift away from austerity and splurge on risky growth. As in past cycles, it will eventually happen. Jacques just needs to call the turn before his rivals.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-07-24	2020-07-24 04:00:00	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Freeport’s CEO Says Covid Has Changed the Way It Runs Forever	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s largest publicly traded copper company says the global Covid-19 pandemic has forced it to become leaner and more nimble than it had ever thought possible -- and it will never go back.“As a company we’ll never work the same way that we did before this Covid thing came,” Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson told analysts Thursday on the second-quarter earnings call. “There will be less office space, less meetings, less travel.”The Phoenix-based miner posted adjusted earnings of 3 cents a share in the second quarter, surprising analysts who had expected a loss. Stronger copper and gold prices helped -- but so did cost-cutting. In April, the company announced a range of measures to preserve cash, including a 29% cut to capital expenses. It also suspended its dividend and reduced the pay of both Adkerson and Chief Financial Officer Kathleen Quirk by 25%.The worst impacts of the pandemic -- which saw 2020 copper sales guidance lowered by about 10% to 3.15 billion pounds -- are being mitigated by some of its side-effects, Quirk said on the call. For example, virus-related unemployment is containing labor-cost pressure. With the exception of higher energy prices in recent months, and unfavorable currency exchange rate swings in Indonesia, Peru and Chile, the company is seeing little input inflation, she said.Meanwhile, Adkerson noted that global copper inventories have stayed low, a trend that is “notable” compared with typical downturns when the stockpiles rise, and a “good omen” for a further recovery in copper prices. Copper’s rebound has already been “sooner and stronger” than expected, he said.Freeport is on track for significant increases to cash flow and Ebitda heading into next year, both executives stressed. As that happens, the company will consider further debt reduction, reinstating its dividend, and share buybacks.The lasting legacy of the pandemic, though, will be its impact on the way the company works. “The halls and offices are empty in our headquarters,” Adkerson said, “and yet you can see the results from this quarter about how effectively we can operate in this kind of environment.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-ceo-says-covid-changed-162406190.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-14	2020-07-14 00:08:59	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Copper's Made-in-China Rally Has Friends	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Copper has erased losses racked up in the early months of the coronavirus outbreak. China’s economic uptick, set to be confirmed by second-quarter figures this week, is encouraging an optimistic view of demand. Latin American supply constraints may be a bigger factor in propelling the price higher, though, with pandemic-related closures and the prospect of strikes ahead. Neither threat will ease soon.China, which accounts for roughly half of global copper demand, is certainly doing its bit to encourage bulls. Industrial production rose 4.4% from a year earlier in May and is likely to have accelerated further in June. Gross domestic product will expand 3.4% in the second quarter, Bloomberg Economics forecasts, after contracting in the first three months. Property sales in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai rose above pre-pandemic levels in mid-June. Appetite elsewhere is recovering more slowly — a problem, given almost a third of mainland copper consumption is eventually exported — but China has unquestionably helped the metal’s recovery from its March lows. Copper has climbed about 40% since then, and is up more than 6% this year to just shy of $6,600 per metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.The spotlight is now moving. After an initial lift from demand, it is output that is pushing prices higher, as some of the world’s largest producers struggle to contain the Covid-19 epidemic. A forecast 2020 copper surplus is beginning to look like a potential deficit.The headache? Latin America, which has turned into a coronavirus hotspot, owing to a combination of bad policies and poverty. The region, including Peru and Chile which alone make up 40% of global copper production, now accounts for more than a quarter of daily incremental Covid cases and over two-fifths of the world’s new deaths. Peru shut down swiftly, but its recovery has been slow. Chile, which has so far allowed mines to keep moving with reduced crews and avoided pit lockdowns, now has one of the world’s highest infection rates.Take the world’s largest copper miner, Chile’s state-owned Codelco. It has tightened safety measures, halted smelting activities and slashed staff at its Chuquicamata mine. Its El Teniente expansion is on hold. Still, the company says it has now registered 3,215 infected workers, implying an infection rate far above the general Chilean population.That suggests more restrictions are likely, and that projected output for the top copper-producing nation will be impossible to sustain. Even an official estimate last month that put the Chilean drop this year at 200,000 metric tons — roughly 1% of annual global production — may be optimistic if infection rates don’t improve. Unions, meanwhile, may begin to agitate more loudly over safety and other worries. The pandemic isn't putting off existing disputes. Workers at Antofagasta Plc’s Zaldivar mine have rejected a final wage offer and voted to walk out. At BHP Group’s Escondida, an early retirement offer has gone down badly. Post-coronavirus efforts to increase efficiency there are elsewhere won’t do much better.And that’s just Chile.Mexico’s outbreak has been devastating, with deaths now higher than Italy’s. First Quantum Minerals Ltd.’s Cobre Panama is only just beginning a reopening plan. Africa’s copper producers are hurting too, particularly  Zambia.The copper market is used to supply disruptions: Strikes and outages are annual occurrences. Yet problems are beginning to pile up, against the backdrop of a stronger-than-expected Chinese recovery and limited stockpiles that have  magnified the price impact of any hiccups. Global visible inventories have declined 30% since March, according to Jefferies. That’s good news for miners like Freeport McMoRan Inc., which has said the expansion of its Grasberg mine in Indonesia is on track. That may well change with a smaller team onsite, but Freeport shares have more than doubled since March. Speculators adding to bullish copper bets will help.The bigger question is what this means for supply beyond the next few months. Production was constrained even before the coronavirus. Now, projects have been pushed back, while exploration and development budgets have been trimmed across the sector. Financially squeezed, Codelco in particular could see expansions shelved. And copper is still trading below prices that would get miners racing to dig again — that in theory requires at least $7,000 per metric ton, a level last hit more than two years ago.Supply pressures are here to stay.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

Freeport Is Selling More Copper Than It Thought in Pandemic	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest publicly traded copper company is navigating the pandemic better than it thought.Freeport-McMoRan Inc. expects to report about 8% more copper sales volume and 10% more gold in the second quarter than it forecast in April when it was first coming to grips with the implications of the coronavirus. The Phoenix-based company gave the rare update less than three weeks before its earnings release. Shares surged as much as 8.6%, the most in a month.The news is “a decidedly positive pre-announcement,” David Gagliano at BMO Capital Markets wrote to clients, who expects higher volume and lower capex to drive cash generation in the next two years. “Our view remains FCX shares are undervalued.”Mines around the world are attempting to keep their workers safe without forgoing too much output by postponing non-essential activities. In April, Freeport announced revised operating plans focused on cash preservation and cost cuts, including a 29% reduction in capital expenses over the year.The company sees preliminary adjusted earnings interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $650 million in the quarter, excluding Covid-19 costs and nonrecurring outlays associated with employee layoffs as a result of the virus.Copper has recovered to be back to near where it started the year as Chinese demand rebounds and investors fear a surge of infections in Latin America will constrain supply.(Updates with shares and copper prices)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-selling-more-copper-thought-153321743.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-02	2020-07-02 17:55:04	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Best Stocks for 2020: Freeport-McMoRan’s Recent Strength Is Just the Start	Editor's note: This article is part of InvestorPlace.com's Best Stocks for 2020 contest. Eric Fry's pick for the contest is Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX).When we last discussed Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), the novel coronavirus pandemic was in full force, the U.S. stock market was struggling to recover from a wicked 34% drop and copper prices had tumbled to a three-year low.This toxic cocktail hammered Freeport's share price from a February high near $13 to a March low below $5. That moment offered plenty of cause for concern … but not for all-out panic.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs I stated at the time:Yes, the coronavirus epidemic will depress economic activity short term, which will depress copper demand short term…Despite that frightening prospect, I expect FCX stock to recover and deliver a solid gain for 2020…Freeport's decimated share price discounts most of [the risks]. It does not price in any potential upside.The biggest potential kicker for the stock is probably just one word: normal. If the copper market simply returned to something resembling normal, Freeport's share price could double fairly quickly from current levels.Well, that is exactly what happened.Thanks to a rebounding copper price, FCX stock has more than doubled from its March lows. Now, it's drawing close to its highs for the year.At current copper prices around $2.70 a pound, Freeport-McMoRan is on track to generate nearly $6 billion in gross profit (EBITDA) over the next 12 months.That level of profitability would produce annual earnings of about $1.10 a share, which would mean that the stock is trading for just 10 times earnings. That expectation assumes no additional rise in the prices of copper or gold.But that's not my assumption.I expect copper prices to continue trending higher toward $3 a pound and gold prices to top $2,000 an ounce on their way to $3,000.At $3 copper and $2,000 gold, Freeport's annual EBITDA could approach $7.5 billion.But that's not all…The company's massive investments to increase production at its Grasberg mine in Indonesia are just starting to bear fruit. As a result, company-wide annual copper production should jump about 40% over the next two years to 4.2 billion pounds. At the same time, gold production should double to 1.8 million ounces.Source: Chart by InvestorPlace Those hefty production numbers could produce EBITDA well over $10 billion and earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $2.Risks remain, of course. The recovering global economy could sputter once again, especially if the second wave of the Covid-19 epidemic in the United States continues to gain traction.But as I pointed out in my previous update, powerful long-term demand trends are likely to push the copper price much higher than it is today. Rising Demand to the RescueDemand from the electric vehicle (EV) and battery industries, for example, could ramp up total global demand for the metal by 900% over the next eight years, according to Robert Friedland, founder and CEO of Ivanhoe Mines (OTCMKTS:IVPAF), which owns the world's largest undeveloped copper mine.Global copper demand is ramping up already, especially from China, the world's largest consumer of the red metal.As a result, global copper inventories have been dropping sharply and are now far below the five-year average levels for this time of year.Source: Chart by InvestorPlace Meanwhile, on the supply side of the ledger, Covid-19 continues to toss boulders in the path of progress.Around the world, the pandemic has disrupted production at more than 50 copper mines. And BMO Capital Markets analyst Colin Hamilton believes that as much as 6.6% of the global copper supply is at risk of disruption throughout the rest of this year.His forecast drops to 5% in 2021. But that is still a significant number in a market that was in a supply deficit as recently as a few months ago.In Chile, the source of more than one-quarter of the world's copper production, the coronavirus is forcing mining companies to run skeleton crews and adopt other measures to operate as safely as possible.While necessary, these measures will almost certainly take a bite out of production. Furthermore, because these mines are also deferring maintenance, they may have to shut down for longer-than-usual periods later this year and early next.&quot;The disruptions to copper concentrate mining due to Covid-19 will be felt by Chinese smelters until at least the third quarter,&quot; predicts Zhu Yi, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Best Stocks: Don't Count FCX Stock Out YetThe coronavirus-constrained supply of copper, coupled with strong resurgent demand, should continue putting upward pressure on the copper price.Bottom line: Freeport-McMoRan's robust snap-back from its March lows is a good start. But there is plenty more where that came from. I'm expecting rising copper and gold prices to propel the stock to $15 and beyond by year-end.Don't count this stock out yet.Eric Fry is an award-winning stock picker with numerous &quot;10-bagger&quot; calls -- in good markets AND bad. How? By finding potent global megatrends… before they take off. And when it comes to bear markets, you'll want to have his &quot;blueprint&quot; in hand before stocks go south. Eric does not own the aforementioned securities.

2020-06-29	2020-06-29 15:35:57	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	3 Compelling Copper Stocks With at Least 40% Upside Potential	Investing in mining companies can be – quite literally – a gold mine. Metals are big business, and one of the mainstays of the industrial world. But that raises an important question: Which metal to invest in?It’s tempting to stick with the old reliables, gold and silver, the original precious metals, among the earliest forms of money, and to this day still considered stable stores of value. All of that is true. But it doesn’t take into account the expense of exploration and mining. It can take a long time for a gold mine to start turning a profit.There are other metals, however, not as rare as gold, or as high priced, but in some ways more valuable in the economy. Copper is typical of that lot. It has uses in jewelry and currency, or course; even today, a lot of our small change is minted with a high copper content. But it’s more important in industry. Everything wires depends on copper, which is the most cost-efficient electric conductor out there, and the most common metal used in the manufacture of electric wiring.This makes copper mines almost as good as gold. Copper is more plentiful – it is sold by the pound, rather than the ounce – and its necessity ensures a ready market. And, the metal is rarely found in isolation. Copper miners routinely extract other metals from the mines, notably zinc, silver, and, yes, gold. Bearing this in mind, we used TipRanks’ database to pinpoint three Buy-rated copper mining stocks that have earned a thumbs up from members of the analyst community. Not to mention each boasts substantial upside potential of over 40%.Western Copper Corporation (WRN)Western Copper is the sole operator of the Casino project, a major copper and gold operation in Canada’s Yukon territory. The mine, which is currently in process of being opened, has an estimated lifetime of 22 to 25 years, and proven recoverable reserves of 4.5 billion pounds of copper an 8.9 million ounces of gold.Casino is a major asset, and Western has used the mine’s potential to raise capital. Earlier this month, the company closed out a successful stock offering of 4 million common shares, which brought in $3.28 million.Roth Capital analyst Jake Sekelsky sees potential in Casino, especially as a magnet for attracting business partners. The scope of the project, in his view, likely exceeds Western’s current capital – but the metals prices are going up. Sekelsky writes, “Casino is a large-scale copper-gold project that we believe could attract a joint-venture partner in a rising price environment. Given the scarcity of projects Casino's size and development stage, we believe a rising metals price environment may spark M&A activity…”Western Copper is a penny stock – but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t got upside potential. Sekelsky rates WRN a Buy and sets a $2.10 price target, suggestive of a 154% upside potential for the coming year. (To watch Sekelsky's track record, click here)Western Copper has two recent analyst reviews, and both agree: this is a stock to buy, and one with high potential. The average price target is $1.95, implying a one-year upside of 136%. Shares are currently priced at 82 cents. (See WRN stock analysis on TipRanks)Teck Resources, Ltd. (TECK)Next up is Teck Resources, a major company with operations in Canada, the US, Peru, and Chile. The company mines copper, zinc, and gold, as well as metallurgical coal – a vital product in the production of steel. Teck’s diversified operations provide some insulation against market downturns in particular metals.Teck’s largest current operation is Highland Valley, a copper-molybdenum mine in British Columbia. The mine has an average production of 160,000 tonnes of metal per year, and is expected to maintain that through 2023. Production is expected to decline after that date, to 150,000 tonnes annually, through 2027, the projected lifetime of the mine.Other major copper mines are in Chile and Peru. Chile is well-known as one of the world’s major copper producers; Peru is a power in mining, with resources throughout the Andes. On May 27, Teck announced that its Antamina copper mine in Peru was resuming operations after a shutdown due to COVID-19.Writing for CIBC, analyst Oscar Cabrera says, “We expect the company’s cost saving and operating efficiency initiatives and strong liquidity to support TECK’s financial flexibility in a challenging macro environment. We believe strong operating execution and the ability to adjust production to changing market conditions while maintaining (or improving) cash returns to shareholders will be key to re-rate TECK’s shares vs. its large mining diversified peers.”Cabrera rates TECK shares a Buy. His price target, at $15.40, implies a 53% upside potential for the stock. (To watch Cabrera’s track record, click here)TECK gets a Strong Buy from Wall Street’s analyst consensus, with 7 Buy reviews and 2 Holds on record. The stock is selling for $10.04, and the $14.19 average price target implies a healthy upside of 40%. (See Teck stock analysis on TipRanks)Freeport-McMoran (FCX)Last up, Arizona-based Freeport is a major mining company with operations in North and South America as well as the Indonesian archipelago. Most of the company’s operations produce copper; molybdenum and gold are also extracted. Freeport boasts a $15.7 billion market cap, and in the market’s rally has seen its shares bounce 100% from their trough value.Which isn’t to say that the coronavirus quarter wasn’t tough on Freeport. Earnings turned sharply negative, and are expected to only partially recover in Q2. Freeport reports a ~400 million pound reduction in copper sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to compensate has announced a $1.3 billion cut in operating expenditures, and $800 million cut in capex, and a $100 million cut in administrative expenses.The aim of those cuts is twofold: to maintain the company’s ability to generate cash, and to maintain a strong liquidity position. While the company’s cash on hand is down 43% year-over-year, Freeport still has available some $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Looking forward, the company is expecting 3.1 billion pounds of copper production this year, as well as a modest increase in gold production from 775K to 780K ounces.Lucas Pipes, of B. Riley FBR, is impressed by FCX’s actions. He writes, “In our opinion, the costcutting measures FCX put in place were very impressive and the primary reason for the positive reaction to the release by investors... As a result of these measures, the company expects to be FCF-positive for the remaining nine months of the year, a remarkable achievement considering the decline in spot copper prices and the fact that 2020 continues to be a transition year for the company.”Pipes gives FCX a $19 price target, implying a robust upside potential of 76% and fully supporting his Buy rating on the stock. (To watch Pipes’ track record, click here)This is another Strong Buy stock, with 10 Buys and only 3 Holds from the analyst consensus. FCX shares are selling for $10.89, and the $12.50 average price target suggests an upside of 18% for the next 12 months.

This will rise to 160,000 daily tonnes of ore for 2021 and 200,000 tonnes for 2022, as the firm completes its transition to underground mining, he said.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-indonesia-shift-underground-mining-053739978.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-11	2020-06-11 05:48:44	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Copper’s Raging Bull Needs More Than China	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Copper has been on a steady upward trend, charging into a bull market and toward $6,000 per metric ton. That’s going to be tough to sustain. China’s stimulus efforts are being felt most strongly in infrastructure and construction. They have been less marked in other metal-intensive corners of the market: consumer goods and exports, which are still waiting for Europe and the U.S. to rally. Meanwhile, disruptions to supply from Latin America’s unfolding coronavirus disaster haven’t been enough yet to offset annualized demand loss. What happens next will be determined by whether Chile, Peru and producers like Indonesia, home to the world’s second-largest copper mine, can do better at controlling the epidemic than resource-rich Brazil.An economic bellwether, copper crumpled earlier this year as the scale of the pandemic became clear, falling by late March to its lowest levels since late 2016. The metal has clawed most of that back and with no large market surpluses in sight, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is among brokers that have raised price forecasts. The comeback has been largely driven by China, which consumes half the world’s copper and has been steadily eating through stockpiles as industrial production restarts and building resumes. There’s plenty of encouraging evidence: Inventories, after soaring when the pandemic began, have tumbled back. Cancelled warrants, which represent metal earmarked for delivery and so suggest appetite for the physical commodity, have shot up since late May. Hiccups in mine activity are lending support. Shipments from Peru, which has seen perhaps the longest lockdown among top producers, are down by almost a fifth so far this year, according to UBS Group AG. Add in Covid- and price-related closures, project slowdowns and cuts to spending budgets, and the combination is telegraphing tight supply. Enthusiasm is visible among previously bearish money managers, who are turning bullish and adding to long positions.Is all of that enough to keep copper running high? Not necessarily. While consultancy Wood Mackenzie Ltd. estimates 2020 refined production will be down more than 1%, it expects refined consumption to contract by over 3%. The shape of China’s stimulus and recovery offers one reason for caution, as the effects of pent-up demand begin to fade. Take grid spending, usually a major driver of copper demand: After a contraction at the start of the year, investment has increased and the budget is expected to expand from a year earlier. Yet the emphasis is on ultra-high voltage electricity lines to cover long distances, which tend to use lighter aluminum. Production of consumer appliances like air conditioners is also still under pressure. Though better property and auto sales figures are encouraging, there was no significant real estate stimulus out of the recent National People’s Congress meeting. And measures to support the electric vehicle sector and its charging infrastructure may not be enough.More worrying is the weakness in the China’s exports, as seen in the May manufacturing purchasing managers’ index. About 30% of China’s apparent consumption of refined copper is actually exported, according to Cru Group, so extended lockdowns in India and elsewhere matter.It would be foolish to  underestimate China’s ability to throw money at the problem. Still, the bigger unknown for the coming weeks is how the coronavirus spreads in copper’s biggest producers. Peru has already seen exports drop but so far Chile, which accounts for about a third of global production, has continued to operate largely unscathed. That was easier when there were fewer cases in the wider population, but now the country is in the grip of a significant outbreak.Brazil, now with the second-highest case number in the world after the U.S., offers a cautionary tale. With case rates rising at and near mines, iron ore producer Vale SA has already been forced to suspend work at one complex, Itabira, and concerns are growing about the country’s north. Near its Carajas operations there, the local town of Parauapebas has 5,734 cases for a population of roughly 200,000.Indonesia is another worry, says Nick Pickens, copper research director at Wood Mackenzie, given the importance of the Freeport-McMoRan Inc.-operated Grasberg mine to additional supply into 2021. Reuters reported last month that the mine was now working with a skeletal team after a rise in coronavirus infections in the area, including in workers’ living quarters. That would add uncertainty further out, not least given the degree to which miners have cut capital expenditure, discretionary spending and care and maintenance, as Cru principal analyst Craig Lang points out. That leaves them less prepared if something goes wrong, and increases the risk of disruption. For now, though, it may take more to feed the bull run.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

The company had $5.1 billion in liquidity at end March and is not planning to pay a quarterly dividend during 2020. Freeport also reported earnings for the first quarter, showing a net loss of $491 million, or 34 cents a share, after earnings of $31 million, or 2 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.

2020-04-17	2020-04-17 00:53:49	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Fortune Will Favor Miners with Nerves of Steel	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- After years of buying at the peak of the economic cycle and selling in the trough, could the world’s big diggers do the reverse? Compared to peers in oil and gas, Rio Tinto Group and the largest diversified miners are riding out the coronavirus storm in sheltered positions: They have low operating costs, little debt and more than $60 billion in liquidity.History matters here. Just over a decade ago, miners binged on hubristic investments like Rio’s acquisition of aluminum producer Alcan or Anglo American Plc’s Minas Rio iron-ore venture. In the hangover years between 2012 and 2016, some $200 billion was written off, and a generation of chief executives were shown the door. It was a near-death experience akin to what the energy sector is going through today, and one that left behind an industry focused on cleaning up, cutting back and returning cash to shareholders. Rio has been among the most generous, handing back $36 billion since 2016.It means the industry’s largest players went into this crisis with two things: balance sheets at their most robust in years, and a pedestrian growth outlook. Almost the opposite is true at long-coveted targets like Freeport-McMoRan Inc., with a market value of $11 billion, and First Quantum Minerals Ltd., valued at $3.5 billion. These mid-size base metal producers are beginning to look fragile, with expanding copper mines but nearly $19 billion of total debt between them. Their shares have fallen more than 40% this year. No one knows how long a recovery from the pandemic will take, or what life will look like on the other side, but miners have a little more certainty than most: Metals like copper, used for electrification and a host of consumer goods, will be needed, and will be in short supply. It’s a tantalizing state of affairs. As ever, things aren’t quite that simple, and even the heftiest miners aren’t immune to the world’s turmoil. BHP Group has to contend with the crashing oil price. Anglo American is dealing with lockdowns in South Africa, Peru and elsewhere, as governments try to contain the spread of coronavirus. Glencore Plc, long the most buccaneering of the large players, is tackling succession, trouble in Zambia and a pending U.S. Department of Justice investigation into its business practices.At Rio, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques has perhaps the strongest motivation to act. He is less exposed to many of these uncertainties, and is running a miner that still relies on iron ore for about three-quarters of its Ebitda, as steel consumption hovers at or near a peak in China. Large mainland miners, like acquisitive Zijin Mining Group or Jiangxi Copper Co., may be his competitors. There are cashed-up bullion players, too: Barrick Gold Corp.’s CEO, Mark Bristow, has said he could consider copper and even Freeport’s Indonesian Grasberg mine.The trouble is, we’re not yet at the distress levels that will prompt boards to approve a rush for checkbooks. Travel and due diligence are impossible, markets are too volatile for share deals and the next few months remain an unknown quantity. Shareholders may balk. In past crises, even distressed sellers were able to command premiums, so bargains will be tough. Copper prices are still above the depths of 2016.Worse, not even the most obvious prey would be easy to snap up: Freeport and First Quantum come with traps. Freeport, the world’s largest listed copper producer, faces the question of who will lead it when veteran Richard Adkerson retires, along with concerns over older U.S. mines and the costly move underground at Grasberg. Rio, unhappy with the environmental and political risks, sold its interest in the Indonesian mine in 2018. First Quantum, more bite-sized and so perhaps more appealing, battened down the hatches earlier this year with a poison pill, after Jiangxi Copper built an 18% stake. Its flagship Cobre Panama mine has yet to  operate through a full wet season. Chinese players eyeing miners with Australian assets, meanwhile, would also have to deal with a regulator bent on discouraging opportunistic foreign bargain-hunters.Yet the longer the pandemic lockdowns drag on, the more the pain increases, as fixed costs go out and no cash comes in. It’s visible already in lithium, with Tianqi Lithium Corp. seeking to sell part of its stake in the Greenbushes operation in Australia, as it struggles to repay debt taken on to buy a stake in Chilean giant SQM. It’s rare to see large Chinese producers in distressed sales, even if lithium prices have plummeted since 2018. Rare-earth producer Lynas Corp., meanwhile, says it may need public funds to complete an ore-processing plant. Buyers won’t pounce yet. A global economic recovery isn’t in sight and will be slow; most will need a little more confidence that growth is coming back. That will mean a wider improvement than China’s stimulus and return to work, as encouraging as State Grid Corp.’s 2020 investment plans may be. They’ll also need travel restrictions to lift. Wait too long, though, and the opportunity to buy cheap will pass — again. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

Credit Suisse Looks Ahead To Recovery In Mining, Issues 2 Upgrades	After the recession of 2008-2009 and following the 2015 China-led recession, mining presented the best buying opportunities in the last 20 years, according to Credit Suisse.The sell-side firm said Tuesday that the period following the current pandemic-driven recession could also bring significant opportunities for alpha generation in mining. The Mining Analyst Curt Woodworth upgraded Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE: FCX) from Underperform to Neutral and lowered the price target from $10 to $8.The analyst also upgraded First Quantum (OTC: FQVLF) from Neutral to Outperform and maintained a CA$12 ($8.58) price target. Credit Suisse's Mining Takeaways China, which accounts for around half of global demand, is supporting the metals and mining industry, Woodworth said in a Tuesday note. (See his track record here.)The country is now recovering while the rest of the world is experiencing &quot;an unprecedented demand shock,&quot; the analyst said. Commodities have historically found their bottom in sync with the real economy, while equites tend to bottom first, he said. Woodworth said he expects global industrial production levels to bottom in the second quarter of 2020 before a modest recovery in the second half of the year.Investors should &quot;selectively increase exposure&quot; to the sector in the second quarter, the analyst said. Naming First Quantum as a top pick, Woodworth said it could deliver the &quot;best relative outperformance&quot; in the first year following the recession.Freeport-McMoRan's stock is among the most undervalued in the sector, he said. First Quantum, Freeport-McMoRan Price Action First Quantum shares were up 3.29% at $4.79 at the time of publication Tuesday, while Freeport-McMoRan shares were higher by 5.35% at $7.58.Related Links:Companies Suspend Dividends, Buybacks As Pandemic Weakens MarketUBS Upgrades Freeport-McMoRan On Sell-Off, Projects Rising Copper PricesLatest Ratings for FCX  DateFirmActionFromTo  Apr 2020Credit SuisseUpgradesUnderperformNeutral  Mar 2020UBSMaintainsBuy  Mar 2020CitigroupMaintainsBuy    View More Analyst Ratings for FCX   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * Wayfair A Beneficiary Of At-Home Trend, BofA Says In Upgrade  * UBS Upgrades Walgreens Boots Alliance, Says Valuation Reflects Heightened Near-Term Risks  * With Harley-Davidson Production, Sales Frozen, Argus Downshifts On Stock(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-02-26	2020-02-26 09:21:13	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Rio Tinto Is Digging Mostly Into Its Pocket	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A combination of hefty dividends and contracting output is turning the world’s second-largest miner into the poster child for a $1.5 trillion industry’s growth quandary.Rio Tinto Group announced a record $3.7 billion final dividend Wednesday, adding to $11.9 billion of cash returns already paid in 2019. Yet it produced less iron ore, copper and aluminum, leaving market prices to lift underlying earnings by 18%. Rio’s Pilbara operations stumbled early in the year. Its Mongolian copper mine, a key source of future production and the basis of a greener portfolio, is now not only sorely overdue and over-budget, but also tangled in international tax arbitration. The $86 billion mining giant isn’t alone. High dividend yields and pedestrian output have begun to define resources heavyweights that used to be known for the exact opposite. Diversified groups relied on their varied sources of cash to expand, but large-scale opportunities are scarcer than ever, and portfolios look far less diverse too, once coal and other less appealing assets have been carved off. At Rio, iron ore now accounts for three-quarters of its underlying Ebitda.For investors, it hasn’t been all bad news. Since Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques took the helm in 2016, Rio’s total return including reinvested dividends adds up to an impressive 112%, outpacing most rivals.Yet much of that is due to generous payouts. For a company that digs stuff up for a living, this may not be sustainable — especially for one that aims to build a portfolio better aligned with a carbon-light global economy. It may also be an indication of just how hard it is to change. Rio paid shareholders in 2019 more than double its capital expenditure budget for the same year.One priority has been copper. Under Jacques, head of that unit until he became CEO, Rio has said it wants to add more of the red metal as its existing mines age, and will look at other green ingredients, those for rechargeable batteries and the like. Yet a unit set up to consider just such deals hasn’t sealed a single one despite considering more than 200 opportunities, and the company has suffered blow after blow in Mongolia. Its Oyu Tolgoi mine in the South Gobi accounts for only a fraction of Rio’s value today, but could dictate the company’s fortunes. So far, it’s mostly an unhelpful headache. The mine, which Rio holds through Canada-listed Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd., is one of the largest copper deposits around, and could produce an annual 550,000 metric tons of copper, almost as much as Rio produced last year, plus 450,000 ounces of gold. In the parlance of big miners, it moves the needle.Unfortunately, it also encapsulates everything that makes such projects so challenging: tough geography, messy local politics and complex geology. The cost of the largest, underground, portion has swelled to as much as $7.2 billion, and could rise again when a final estimate is published later in 2020. First production may now be be 30 months later than predicted. Fears of a cash call have dragged down Turquoise Hill shares.In the latest development, Rio announced last week it would begin arbitration proceedings to solve a tax dispute. Few arbitration deals yield significant victories —  ask Barrick Gold Corp. and Antofagasta Plc, which won a $5.8 billion ruling against Pakistan last year — and  they tend to irk host governments, so it’s a worrying sign. The risk is that Oyu Tolgoi becomes Rio Tinto’s own version of Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s Indonesian pride and joy, Grasberg – wonderful in theory, nearly impossible in practice.Rio won’t drop Mongolia, and not just because of Jacques’ own attachment to the project. A copper option, however long-dated, is valuable, even if the company doesn’t yet jump in to buy out Turquoise Hill minority shareholders.But what then? Rio has manageable debt and ample cash — $9.2 billion in free cash flow in 2019, the highest level in almost a decade — and deals look cheaper as shares in copper-heavy Freeport and First Quantum Minerals Ltd. have roughly halved since 2018. Perhaps, though, not cheap enough to warrant wrestling with Freeport’s U.S. liabilities or First Quantum’s Zambian operations.Rio isn’t shrinking quite yet. It has exploration projects, and iron-ore production already did better in the second half, albeit still short of the company’s ultimate target. Yet with Oyu Tolgoi mired in arbitration and geological complexities, and the economy swiftly shifting, it might be time for Rio to consider just how creative it can get.To contact the author of this story: Clara Ferreira Marques at cferreirama@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-02-24	2020-02-24 23:00:00	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Freeport CEO Says ‘Everybody Is on Edge’ With Virus Uncertainty	(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus “took the legs out” of copper’s rally and is rattling everyone from miners to equipment suppliers, according to the head of the world’s largest publicly traded producer of the metal.“Everybody is on edge, and they’re taking it very seriously and the uncertainty around it,” Richard Adkerson, chief executive officer of Freeport-McMoRan Inc., said Monday in an interview at the BMO Global Metals & Mining Conference in Florida.The virus has dented demand for copper, quashing hopes for a rebound this year. Before the outbreak, traders were betting that a pickup in manufacturing and easing trade tensions would help push the metal higher. Adkerson said that while Freeport hasn’t had significant issues with its supply chain yet, shutdowns in industries in China are causing a buildup of exchange stockpiles.Copper has dropped more than 7% this year in London, after jumping almost 8% last quarter on optimism over prospects for a U.S.-China trade deal.A prolonged virus would slow mine development and deepen a production deficit in the metal, he said. The impact of a lengthy outbreak of the disease could also spill over into Phoenix-based Freeport’s parts and maintenance program, according to Adkerson. He said he has spoken with the CEO of Caterpillar Inc., who reassured him it’s still operating its plants in China.Adkerson also addressed repeated comments that Barrick Gold Corp. CEO Mark Bristow has made about the possibility of some sort of future tie-up between Freeport and Barrick. Freeport’s investors want it to stay focused on its current portfolio, Adkerson said, reiterating previous comments that now is not the time for large-scale M&A.He also pointed out the difficulties of melding copper and gold companies. There are different objectives between gold and copper investors, and it’s a “challenge” to mix the two, he said.Ebola ExperienceTom Palmer, CEO of Newmont Corp., the world’s biggest gold miner, said in a separate interview at the conference that his company also isn’t yet seeing an impact from the virus on its operations. The Greenwood Village, Colorado-based producer is monitoring the situation closely, he said.“The places that we operate are pretty protected from the virus at this stage -- so Canada, the U.S., Australia, we are not seeing any impact operationally,” Palmer said.Palmer pointed to the experience in handling the 2014 Ebola virus in West Africa, which killed more than 11,000. Ebola prompted the company “to put in place some good systems to manage the virus,” he said.Barrick is also benefiting from its experience with highly contagious diseases such as Ebola, CEO Bristow said in comments following a Bloomberg TV interview at the BMO conference.In addition to expanding its health checks across the entire organization, Barrick is increasing supplies of raw materials such as cyanide and cement at its mines, Bristow said. The company will have three to four months worth of those “consumables” on hand, compared with the one-and-a-half months it normally keeps, he said.“The thing about these epidemics is that you have to respond before they hit you,” Bristow said. “We have an emergency action plan.”To contact the reporters on this story: Danielle Bochove in Toronto at dbochove1@bloomberg.net;Joe Deaux in New York at jdeaux@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Joe Richter, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-ceo-says-everybody-edge-175251233.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-14	2020-02-14 12:40:37	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	The Interview That Should Terrify Owners of Freeport-McMoRan Stock	On paper, there's an intriguing bull case for miner Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX). Freeport-McMoRan stock looks cheap. Copper prices have dipped of late, but have at least one important long-term tailwind. And Freeport has steadily improved its balance sheet in recent years, cutting net debt by over $12 billion between the end of 2015 and the end of 2019.Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.com But the key phrase is &quot;on paper.&quot; In practice, there's a huge stumbling block to the bull case for FCX stock. Even if Freeport-McMoRan can drive higher free cash flow, as bulls and the company itself project, there's a long-running concern as to where that cash flow is going to go.The answer, according to a recent interview with Freeport-McMoRan's chief executive officer, is not to shareholders. Given the history not just of Freeport but the entire mining industry, that's a significant problem.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Case for Freeport-McMoRan StockFCX stock already has been a solid investment in the last few years. Shares bottomed in January 2016 below $4, as pressure on the company's since-divested oil and gas assets weighed on the stock. From that bottom, Freeport-McMoRan stock has more than tripled -- and there's a case for more upside ahead.  * 20 Stocks to Buy From the Law of Accelerating Returns After all, production should increase nicely in the next two years. After its fourth-quarter report last month, Freeport guided for copper sales to reach 3.5 billion pounds in 2020, up from 3.3 billion in 2019. In 2021, however, the figure should spike to 4.3 billion, as the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, of which FCX owns 49%, returns to normalized output after a shift to underground mining.From there, copper prices need to cooperate, and that's always a risk. Copper prices are notoriously sensitive to the global economy; the commodity has been nicknamed &quot;Dr. Copper&quot; for its ability to provide a leading indicator of macroeconomic strength. A poorly-timed recession -- or even continued softness in key markets in Asia -- could pressure prices and thus Freeport's earnings and cash flow.But there's one potential long-term driver for copper demand: electric vehicles. EVs are &quot;copper hogs,&quot; meaning growth from the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) can boost copper prices. and those prices drop almost straight to Freeport's bottom line. It's not as if shares are expensive even in the current moderate-price environment; should copper spike higher from here, Freeport stock likely does the same. Balance Sheet and Cash FlowFinally, Freeport's balance sheet is in much better shape. As noted, debt has come down dramatically in a matter of years. The company has over $5 billion in liquidity, and a higher stock price if it wants to make an acquisition. If Freeport doesn't make a deal, free cash flow should impress -- particularly if copper prices rise.Indeed, with its fourth-quarter presentation, Freeport-McMoRan modeled solid free cash flow in a higher-price environment. At $3 per pound, up from a current ~$2.60, operating cash flow in 2021-2022 would be in the range of $5 billion.Capital expenditures currently estimated at $2.4 billion for 2021 suggest free cash flow around $2.6 billion. Put even a 10x multiple on that figure and FCX gains over 50%; increase the multiple, and the upside could be even higher. Where Does the Cash Go?To be sure, that paper case does require some help from copper prices. Models for 2021-2022 at $2.75 a pound suggest free cash flow under $2 billion. A market capitalization currently near $19 billion thus likely doesn't see that much upside without pricing help. But investors in mining stocks are looking for leveraged returns on gains the underlying commodity -- and on paper FCX stock is set up to provide precisely those returns if copper gains.But that gets to the practical problem, and the interview CEO Richard Adkerson gave to Reuters at the end of last month. Adkerson noted the potential for higher cash flow and a higher stock price which would allow the company to make acquisitions.&quot;I'm looking forward to having a new experience in my career toward accessing alternatives and deciding which way we go…We don't have a clear directive now on what that direction could be, but we will be attractively situated and will have an opportunity to add value through investments,&quot; he told Reuters.Those investments could include not just acquisitions but the construction of new mines.In other words, the incremental free cash flow Freeport-McMoRan hopes to drive isn't going back to shareholders. It's going back into the business under Adkerson's direction. And that should worry, if not terrify, FCX shareholders. Adkerson's HistoryAdkerson was named CEO on Dec. 10, 2003. Under his watch, Freeport-McMoRan stock has declined by 42%.There isn't an external reason for the pressure. Copper prices, according to data from YCharts, have increased 174% over that span. Meanwhile, diversified miner BHP Group (NYSE:BHP), which has significant copper holdings, has seen its stock more than triple. Including dividends, BHP has posted a total return of more than 450%. For Freeport-McMoRan stock, total returns remain modestly negative.One big reason for the decline was the aforementioned move into oil and gas, spearheaded by Adkerson. Freeport-McMoRan spent $20 billion on two acquisitions in 2012 at the height of the oil boom. The moves were instantly criticized by Wall Street and by investors; Freeport stock dropped 16% in a single day on the announcement. Allegations of self-dealing soon followed.Less than four years later, Freeport managed to get less than $4 billion for its assets at the nadir of the oil bust. Over $16 billion in shareholder value was destroyed.An investor might believe -- or want to believe -- that Adkerson and the Freeport board have learned their lesson from the disastrous acquisitions. There's no evidence they have.The Freeport-McMoRan dividend was slashed in 2014; the board hasn't hiked the payout since despite a paltry 1.6% yield and the expected growth in free cash flow. Adkerson, at least per his interview, is looking to spend more shareholder money after the company spent the last four years recovering from its foray into oil and gas.There are thus two scenarios here. Copper prices fall or stay roughly flat, and Freeport-McMoRan stock likely does the same. Or copper prices rise, giving Adkerson free reign to go and spend billions of dollars more of shareholder funds. Neither sounds particularly attractive. The Mining ProblemTo be somewhat fair, this is not a Freeport-only problem. As I detailed back in 2018, gold miners like Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) have done a disastrous job of fulfilling their mission of providing leverage to the gold price. Barrick, Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) and AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE:AU) all saw their shares fall by over 60% even in a rising-price environment.Recent performance for mining stocks has been better, but it's still not as good as it should be in theory. Even the gains in Freeport stock over the last few years are more a case of the stock rallying sharply from 2016 lows than any real improvement on the ground. FCX stock actually is down 20% over the past three years despite basically flat copper prices. The Bottom Line on Freeport-McMoRan StockWhat makes a stock like FCX particularly problematic is that the exchange-traded fund revolution has created far better alternatives. An investor who is bullish on copper can simply buy copper through an ETF. She can lever up that bet through the use of margin or a 2x or 3x ETF. Those trades have risk if copper prices decline of course; so does FCX.But if copper prices rise, that investor doesn't have to let Adkerson determine what to do with her gains. ETFs do have fees, but they're generally minimal; meanwhile, Adkerson's pay packages from 2016 to 2018 alone totaled over $50 million, according to Freeport's most recent proxy statement.If Freeport-McMoRan and Adkerson truly had learned their lesson and were looking to use potentially higher cash flow for increased shareholder returns, that would be one thing. Clearly, they're not. History, and the -42% returns under Adkerson's 16-year tenure, both suggest that it is a real problem for Freeport-McMoRan stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2020-01-24	2020-01-24 16:28:09	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Freeport McMoRan Is the Best Stock to Buy for 2020	The terms &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; and &quot;copper miner&quot; do not obviously relate to one another. But in the case of the company I'm about to tell you about, they do.Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.com And this connection is one of several reasons why this stock has become a compelling speculation -- and my pick for the top stock of 2020.One of the world's largest copper producers, this company has been testing an artificial intelligence, or &quot;machine learning,&quot; model at its Bagdad copper mine in Arizona.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis machine learning model uses data from sensors around the mine to &quot;tailor&quot; the ore processing method to each of the seven distinct types of ore that come from it.This test has been a remarkable success, so the company is now planning to roll out its new technology across all of its operations in the Americas.By doing so, this company expects to increase its annual copper production by a hefty 5%.And I expect that to produce triple-digit gains in 2020.Take a look … Boosting ProductionThe machine learning program is just one of three major initiatives Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) says will boost its copper production by 30% in 2020.The other two production drivers are:  * A ramp up in Freeport's new underground mining operations at its massive Grasberg mine in Indonesia.  * The company's new Lone Star copper development in Arizona is going into production.Combined, these three initiatives should produce a significant jump in earnings, even with no change in current copper or gold prices. At a minimum, the company should earn about 55 cents a share in 2020 and $1.40 in 2021.  * 7 Healthcare Stocks With 100% Street Support Those results would give Freeport's stock a price-to-earnings ratio of 24 in 2020, which will then fall to just nine times earnings in 2021. Remember, though, these earnings estimates assume no change in copper prices during the next 12 months.But that's not what I'm assuming.I believe the price of copper is on the verge of a major upside move that will carry it above the five-year high of the $332 a pound mark it hit in late 2017.Source: InvestorPlace Five main factors will power this big move. Three of them are the &quot;usual suspects,&quot; while two are unusual ones.First, the usual ones:  * Copper supply is falling short of copper demand, which is creating a deficit in the market.  * The copper deficit is likely to grow much larger over the coming decade.  * The Federal Reserve has recently stated its intention to hold interest rates low throughout 2020, which should ignite commodity prices.In addition to these bullish forces, copper prices could gain a tailwind from two nontraditional factors:  * Improving international trade relations, especially between the United States and China.  * The global boom in electric vehicles and energy storage.Let's take a closer look at each of these five factors … Fueling Up for the Copper RallyFirst, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has stated clearly that the Fed would refrain from raising short-term interest rates in 2020. Instead, he plans to hold rates below 1.75% throughout the year.I have no idea what the &quot;appropriate&quot; level of interest rates ought to be. But as recently as one year ago, the members of Powell's Federal Open Market Committee expected the appropriate level for short-term rates in 2020 to be 3.13%.Clearly, the Fed is pursuing an &quot;easier&quot; monetary policy than most investors had been expecting during the last several months. Generally speaking, &quot;easy money&quot; monetary policies tend to produce periods of rising commodity prices.Supply deficits are a second factor that could push copper prices higher. For most of the last few years, the global supply of refined copper has been falling slightly short of demand. But according to most forecasts for the copper industry, the current supply deficit will not merely persist during the next few years; it will grow much larger.Source: InvestorPlace Thanks to this supply deficit, coupled with the Fed's low interest rates, Freeport's earnings and cash-flow results are likely to surprise on the upside in 2020 -- especially as the copper price breaks out of its current basing formation around $2.60 a pound and challenges its 2017 highs closer to $3.50.Even a modest move to $3.25 a pound would produce a major lift to Freeport's results. The company's annual operating cash flow would swell by more than $1 billion -- from roughly $3 billion to $4 billion. Electric VehiclesBut remember, Freeport also produces nearly 1 million ounces of gold per year and 92 million pounds of molybdenum (a metal that's highly resistant to corrosion). So if either of those metals took a major swing to the upside, Freeport would benefit as well.That said, copper is the major driver of the company's profitability. So let's take a closer look at the two unusual &quot;one-off&quot; factors that could spur strong copper demand … and a rising copper price.First, the two-year trade war between the United States and China seems to be ending, with both nations signing a Phase 1 agreement last week. So, trade frictions between the world's two largest economies seem to be dissipating.As normalized trade resumes between the U.S. and China, economic growth could gain a tailwind that boosts demand for essential commodities like copper.Importantly, China is the world's largest importer of refined copper. So if the Chinese economy gains renewed vitality, the copper market will notice. And let's not forget that China is also the world's largest producer of electric vehicles, which are &quot;copper hogs.&quot;Source: InvestorPlace Electric vehicles require about four times as much copper as internal combustion vehicles. Therefore, as EVs continue to gain market share, they will absorb a growing slice of the global copper supply. The Bottom Line on FCX StockI believe Freeport-McMoRan will produce triple-digit gains in 2020, both because its copper production will ramp up over the next several months and because copper prices will likely soar toward $3.50 a pound.  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy I began researching my potential &quot;stocks of the year&quot; in early December and immediately saw the potential in Freeport. Clearly I was on the right track, because the stock has jumped as much as 20% since then. That's good news.The even better news is that I still expect much larger gains -- even triple-digit gains -- throughout 2020.Regards,Eric FryP.S.

2020-01-22	2020-01-22 15:58:08	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Freeport Looks Poised to Turn Corner After Five-Year Bumpy Road	(Bloomberg) -- It’s been a rough haul for Freeport-McMoRan Inc., but the future may be looking up.In the past five years, the world’s largest publicly traded copper miner was forced to sell assets and shares to manage debt as it weathered fall-out from the collapse of the commodity super cycle. It emerged from multiyear talks over its Indonesian mine to secure long-term rights, and hung on as production at the flagship operation tumbled during the switch from open pit to underground mining.And in the past year, it has been buffeted by global trade winds and hit by crossfire from demonstrations against a competitor in Peru.When the Phoenix-based company releases fourth-quarter results on Thursday, the market will be more than ready for some good news.Morgan Stanley’s “bull case” for the stock predicts a 40% rally to $18 a share. While the ramp-up of underground mining at Grasberg, Freeport’s massive Indonesian copper-and-gold asset, remains challenging, the bank believes the miner “is well positioned to deliver on execution,” analyst Carlos De Alba said in a note this week.The trend to global electrification, fed by the need to provide lower-carbon power for transport and industry, is expected to increase demand for copper, potentially resulting in supply deficits. For those companies poised for production increases, the result will be long-term growth in free cash flow, even if other factors keep prices for the metal subdued, according to Jefferies LLC.Freeport expects to double cash flow, boost copper and gold production and cut costs 25% within two years, Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said in an interview last month. The company also is boosting production with investment in its Lone Star project in Arizona.With copper futures at $2.77 a pound, Freeport -- as well as First Quantum Minerals Ltd. -- are likely to move from negative to double-digit yields over the next five years, Jefferies analyst Chris LaFemina said in note, with Freeport hitting 10% yields from 2022. Even in a bearish scenario in which copper falls to $2, cash flow should be positive for both miners, he said. The companies are Jefferies’ top mining picks.“Freeport could have a positive quarter, helped by sales deferred from Q3 and continued progress at Grasberg and Lone Star,” Sam Crittenden, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a note.&#92;--With assistance from Aoyon Ashraf.To contact the reporter on this story: Danielle Bochove in Toronto at dbochove1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven Frank, Joe RichterFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-looks-poised-turn-corner-155808367.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-31	2019-12-31 17:28:20	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	3 Stocks To Trade That Are Ready to Move in 2020	The 2019 scoreboard turned out great for equity bulls, but it was tumultuous for all markets. It's been a series of trading headline after headline -- making it difficult to have confidence on Wall Street. All sectors were affected, and toda,y we examine three such stocks to trade as we head into 2020.Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) and Nio Limited (NYSE:NIO) investors had to withstand big rallies and collapses throughout the year. Just recently, X fell off a cliff, Nio doubled in one day and FCX rallied 50% in a couple of months to salvage its year performance.  * 7 'A'-Rated Stocks to Buy Under $10 With those types of performances, these clearly are stocks to trade into next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Stock Ready to Trade in 2020: Nio Limited (NIO)  Click to Enlarge Source: Charts by TradingView Nio is a momentum stock like its competitor Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meaning that it runs fast in both directions. Monday, it doubled on the positive reaction to its upside surprise in vehicle delivery report. While this sounds tremendous, the stock has fallen almost 90% since its highs in March; So, it's digging its way back out of an abyss.On the way down, it looked like it was headed to zero. So, this sudden upside burst is tempting to chase. But, before investors back up the truck and load up on Nio, they should consider that the giant rally sliced through all short-term levels too fast.The Monday high was exactly the ledge from which the stock collapsed in May. So, the first retest of it faces tremendous resistance. This is not the same as saying it will never happen -- but usually, the bulls need a few attempts before they retake prior accident scenes. $5 per share is in fact resistance until the buyers can prove they can retake it and use it for forward footing.Combine this enthusiasm with the recent adoration of Tesla stock, and you get a situation where sentiment has suddenly swung too far positive too fast. So, there will likely be better entry points into NIO stock than now -- especially if the goal is short-term profit.Nio now needs to hold $3.50 per share or else it risks filling the gap to $2.65. The problem with fast profits is that it creates a bunch of weak hands. Those make for shaky bases, so it needs a shake out of a few of them before the buyers can flex more muscle. This morning pop needs to hold so that the bulls have a chance at a new leg of the prior glory recovery. U.S. Steel (X)  Click to Enlarge Source: Charts by TradingView In early December, U.S. Steel stock showed great technical promise. The chart was finally hinting at a big breakout, but then it all fell apart on a headline mid month when management hit the trifecta of bad news. They downgraded the outlook, cut the dividend and the buybacks. The investors panicked out of X stock in droves, and it is now 20% lower with almost no light at the end of the tunnel.However, this makes it so that there are few incremental sellers left. Everyone that wanted to sell did so already, so this leaves the upside potential in 2020 the more likely scenario. The Warren Buffet mentality applies here: Buy when everyone else is afraid. The trick is to make sure to set limits to potential losses because having solid stop loss levels makes for more successful trading. Otherwise, catching falling machetes like X stock would cause investors to lose many fingers.  * 7 Stocks to Buy to Get 2020 Started the Right Way The U.S. Steel fans need to defend the recent lows, as it is imperative to stay double digits and not revisit the August lows. This will limit the damage done by the recent headline and the bulls can rebuild the upward momentum. The real battle would then be to breach through the $14 to $15 per share zone. The descending wedge still offers the best opportunity for X to recover by mid-2020. Freeport McMoRran (FCX)  Click to Enlarge Source: Charts by TradingView Freeport-McMoRan stock is ending the year up as much as the S&P 500, but it wasn't all rosy. Most of the gains came from a late 50% rally off the October lows, and FCX stock is now trading inside a tight price range. This usually means that it will breakout soon from it, and the trade is to chase either side when it's breached.It is important to note that this is a trade more so than an investment. But, if the breakout happens to the upside, then FCX could use the momentum to take out the recent failure point near $15 per share and start another significant rally. So in a sense, this short-term trade could have long-term upside repercussions.This action in FCX is happening above a very long-term consolidation zone that dates back more than 15 years. Moreover, it bounced off the pivot levels from April of 2003. Back then, this served as a spring board to a 130% rally in a few months -- and then ultimately, ended up more that 500% at the highs of 2008.This alone doesn't mean that this rally here will have the same results, but it does suggest that FCX stock bulls have the benefit of strong support below. Responsibility is on the bears to find new reasons to go back to single digits.This also means that the bulls will have more than one attempt at breaching the resistance here and at $15 per share. Of course, for this to happen, management will have to avoid creating its own drama with balance sheet issues or strategic flubs.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

Freeport-McMoRan currently trades at a 2020 EV/EBITDA of 6.81. This is still attractive considering the point that Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO) trades at a 2020 EV/EBITDA of 9.96. FCX stock can cool-off after a massive rally, but the uptrend is likely to remain intact in 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Copper Will Trend Higher in 2020The primary reason for FCX stock surging higher is the fact that copper has been trending higher. Last week, copper touched a seven-month high on the London Metal Exchange. There are reasons to believe that the uptrend for copper will sustain in 2020.  * 7 Stocks to Buy to Get 2020 Started the Right Way With the United States and China reaching a phase one deal, easing trade tensions can boost global GDP growth. The International Monetary Fund also expects emerging markets to grow at 4.6% in 2020 from 3.9% in 2019. If growth in China and India accelerates, the demand for copper will ensure that the commodity continues to move higher. This will be positive for FCX as EBITDA margin will expand along with growth in free cash flows.Another reason to be bullish on copper is the fact that the Federal Reserve has been pursuing a renewed expansionary policy. The central bank's assets have swelled from $3.8 trillion in September to $4.1 trillion in December.With easy money in the financial markets, depressed asset classes are likely to move higher. In the last ten years, commodities have been the most depressed asset class and the next decade can be different. Lower investments in mining expansion due to depressed prices have narrowed the demand-supply gap. It is expected that copper market will go from surplus to deficit in 2021.Clearly, fundamental factors support the bull story for copper and as the commodity trend higher, FCX stock will follow. Financial Flexibility Will Support GrowthFor 2020, Freeport-McMoRan expects to incur capital expenditure of $2.6 billion. With cash of $2.2 billion and undrawn credit facility of $3.5 billion, FCX is fully funded for 2020 and 2021.FCX also generated an operating cash flow of $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2019. This implies an annualized OCF of $1.7 billion. Therefore, with copper prices trending higher, FCX is well-positioned to reduce its net debt position in 2020.In the last 24 months, deleveraging has ensured that credit metrics improve for FCX. With prospects of higher commodity prices, FCX stock is positioned to debt re-rating. In addition, dividends can possibly increase towards the end of 2020 or into 2021.I want to add here that the sale of gold will also add to cash flow in addition to copper sales. Freeport-McMoRan expects gold sales to increase from 0.87 million ozs in 2019 to 1.45 million ozs in 2021.Gold is trading near $1,500 an ounce and I am positive on gold as expansionary policies are bullish for the precious metal. Therefore, over the next 24 months, gold is likely to support EBITDA margin expansion and cash flow upside. My Final Thoughts on FCX stockIf we go back by 24 months to 3Q17, FCX had $14.8 billion in total debt. In addition, the company had a relatively uncertain outlook due to negotiations with the government in Indonesia. Currently, total debt has declined to $9.9 billion and there is a firm agreement with the Indonesian government. In addition, the outlook for copper is bullish and gold has been trending higher.Clearly, FCX has made significant progress in terms of sale of non-core assets, deleveraging. The next two years will be focused on production ramp-up, which will translate into EBITDA and cash flow upside.This makes FCX stock worth considering even after the strong rally in the last few months. However, investors can wait for some profit booking before fresh exposure for 2020.As of this writing, Faisal Humayun did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-20	2019-12-20 16:53:31	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	3 Reasons Why Freeport-McMoRan Stock Is an Easy Buy	As the world increasingly becomes digitalized, I believe longer term that the case for commodities will only improve. Ironically, as technology advances, so will demand for the physical facilitation of those innovations. But over the past few years, this concept generally hasn't worked well for companies like Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX). During the trailing five-year period, FCX stock has dropped 44%.Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.com Why? Mostly, the commodities sector, particularly precious metals like gold and silver, peaked early this decade. Subsequent trades have attempted to push the physical assets market higher, only to be met with biting disappointment. Of course, that didn't suit Freeport-McMoRan stock well. The underlying company specializes in the industrial metals copper and molybdenum. It also has exposure to the gold market.Frankly, FCX stock was on track to be a disappointment this year as well. Up until late October, shares were down compared to January's opening price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, Freeport-McMoRan stock experienced a dramatic resurgence the day after Halloween. Since the unofficial holiday, shares have jumped 33%.  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade Naturally, with such a strong spike, investors question if enough momentum remains for 2020 and beyond. If that's you, all I can say is, oh yeah! FCX stock is primed to rock and roll. Here are three reasons why: The Federal Reserve's Dovish StanceAmong the many people not on President Donald Trump's Christmas card list is probably Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Routinely, Trump has bitterly complained that Powell refuses to aggressively cut benchmark interest rates. Just in that context, that might not appear beneficial for Freeport-McMoRan stock.But the reality is that the Fed has been more than accommodating for the administration and the broader economy. Powell has several times noted that he and his team of central bankers will monitor economic conditions and act accordingly.Irrespective of executive pressure, Powell is doing the right thing, applying a balanced, rational but nevertheless dovish strategy. And the best news of all came recently. According to the Washington Post, Powell sees no need to raise interest rates anytime soon.It's not what Trump wanted. However, it's good news for him, the economy and FCX stock. At the end of the day, the Fed is still accommodative. Naturally, this provides inflationary upside for commodities, something that Freeport-McMoRan hasn't seen for some time. Copper Prices Will (Finally) Support FCX StockAs I briefly mentioned up top, Freeport-McMoRan is a major player in the copper market. Barring extremely unusual circumstances, high copper prices (demand) is always good for FCX stock.If you need math to convince you, consider this: from January 1995 to through November 2019, the correlation coefficient between Freeport-McMoRan and the copper price per metric ton stands at a whopping 88%. In other words, as copper demand goes, so too does FCX.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto And that's very good news for stakeholders and prospective buyers, according to Capital Economics' commodities expert Ross Strachan. He wrote:Constrained supply growth and surging demand from electric vehicles mean that we think that the price of copper will rise by over 60%, to nearly $10,000 per tonne, by 2025 … This rally is almost three times higher than consensus estimates.Perhaps surprisingly to many readers, &quot;green&quot; technologies use substantial amounts of copper. Strachan notes that this is especially the case for &quot;electric vehicles, which use a lot more copper than cars with internal combustion engines.&quot;But copper has conductivity and other vital attributes that are critical for most industries. Furthermore, as developing nations transition to developed status, copper (and other metal) demand will surely increase.That's positive for copper prices and therefore Freeport-McMoRan stock. Golden Bonus for Freeport-McMoRan StockAlthough the industrial metals are where FCX stock makes its most money, Freeport-McMoRan is nevertheless an important gold player. While gold has been a temptress - skyrocketing in the summer but shedding momentum in the fall - I believe this market will also turn around.Again, consider the Fed's dovish policy. While it doesn't meet the aggression standards of Trump and his goldbug followers, it's still aggressive enough. Apparently, we are going to get our inflation: the bickering is over the magnitude.Beyond monetary policy, I think investors are anxiously eyeing both U.S. politics and geopolitics. Like gold, a meaningful resolution to the U.S.-China trade war has seductively eluded investors until just recently. But even then, things can go from great to terrible in a blink of an eye under this administration.If any fissures develop, gold is back on the upswing. And I believe that the uncertainties of the 2020 election will help boost the precious metal. Either way, I think you're looking at a positive, inflationary environment for Freeport-McMoRan stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long gold and silver bullion. He is also considering a long position in FCX stock in the next 72 hours.

2019-12-12	2019-12-12 20:42:39	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Barrick CEO Says He Has Plenty of Financial Firepower for Deals	(Bloomberg) -- Barrick Gold Corp.’s chief says the gold miner has the financial heft it needs to support its loftiest ambitions -- and some day those might include a merger with Freeport-McMoRan Inc.“Barrick, by end of next year, or during next year, will be net debt zero,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said Thursday in a phone interview. “We’ve definitely got the firepower to build a mine or to support a transaction. We don’t need any external support, for any of our ambitions, as we stand today.”The world’s second-largest gold miner has been generating more cash flow, with higher bullion prices, even as it has sold assets. By the end of this year net debt will be under $2 billion, Bristow said. “We’re going to settle all the near-term debt, and we’re left with debt that’s only due from 2023 onwards.”In an interview last month, Bristow said there’s a logic to combining Barrick with Freeport as part of a broader gold strategy.While it makes sense to start an “intellectual conversation” about a deal with the Phoenix-based copper miner, Barrick spent three years putting together its tie-up with Randgold Resources Ltd. and has no plans to rush into anything, he said Thursday. Any tie-up with Freeport would also have to be friendly.“There’s no way we would do something in a hostile way because there’s too much risk in a transaction of that size and nature,” Bristow said.Freeport didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.‘Focused on Quality’Most of the mining companies that are capable of taking on Grasberg, Freeport’s massive copper-and-gold mine in Indonesia, wouldn’t dare because of the risks, Bristow said. But “if you’re focused on quality, you’ve got to look at the world’s biggest gold mines.”Freeport emerged from a multi-year saga in 2018 which forced it to divest part of its stake in Grasberg in order to secure long-term mining rights in the country. The mine has also been the subject of global criticism for its waste-treatment practices.For now, Bristow said there’s more chance of Barrick selling copper than buying it. Asked if that means a sale of its Lumwana copper mine in Zambia is imminent, he said the company has “received inbound interest, as you can imagine” but it doesn’t need to sell the asset.The Toronto-based miner has a long-term gold strategy, not a copper strategy, Bristow stressed. However, “if we want to be a materially relevant organization focused on gold, we’re going to have to get our head around copper.”“Freeport, undoubtedly is a company with a cluster of tier 1 assets and it’s the purest of all the copper miners,” he said.&#92;--With assistance from Aoyon Ashraf.To contact the reporter on this story: Danielle Bochove in Toronto at dbochove1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven Frank, Joe RichterFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-says-barrick-plenty-financial-204239608.html?.tsrc=rss

Together, they entertained attendees at a dinner hosted by the company Wednesday with uplifting renditions of classics including “O-o-h Child” and “Oh Happy Day.”For traders, miners and investors attending LME Week this year, there hasn’t been much else to celebrate, at least in the short term. The mood is a reversal from a year ago, as demand for most metals suffers due to the U.S.-China trade war.“It would all be good if we didn’t have this damn trade war,” Adkerson said. “There was a negative mood coming into this week.”Still, there’s potential for an uplift on the horizon, he said.“An improvement in economic conditions, which is in everybody’s interest in this world, has the potential for having a major near-term uplift in copper prices,” he said. “We’re not predicting it, we’re not running our business on that, but I think it’s a real possibility.”To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Burton in London at mburton51@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Liezel Hill, Nicholas LarkinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/copper-market-bleak-miners-turning-091443270.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-29	2019-10-29 18:57:21	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Even a Lifelong Copper Bull Isn’t Sure Next Move Will Be Up (1)	(Bloomberg) -- As head of sales for copper-mining giant Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Javier Targhetta overflows with arguments for why the metal’s prospects are bright.Yet even the five-decade metals veteran and copper bull acknowledges the miserable mood seeping through the industry’s annual gathering in London this week. For now, any talk of constraints on new supply or higher consumption as the world’s cities expand is drowned out by worries about sagging demand fueled by the U.S.-China trade war.It’s a dramatic shift from a year ago, when just about everyone in the industry was bullish on the metal used in pipes and wires.“The fundamentals for the market are very positive in the short-, mid- and long-term, but the mood is not that great,” Targhetta said in an interview. “We keep hoping and expecting that when the uncertainties clear up, it will jump in a vivid way.”Here’s what the metals world was saying about copper this time last yearAt about $5,900 a ton, London Metal Exchange copper is near the bottom of a tight range it’s held since the trade war broke out in mid-2018. Mounting evidence of a consequential collapse in manufacturing output has helped to keep a lid on prices even as supply issues stack up. Prices have fallen 4% in the past year. The gloomy sentiment at this year’s LME Week isn’t limited to copper. Commodities consultancy CRU Group on Tuesday offered a downbeat assessment of the prospects for industrial metals in the coming year. Global demand will drop this year for copper, aluminum, zinc and lead, according to CRU's estimates. There are even doubts that nickel — the star performer this year — may struggle to hold its gains in the face of deteriorating demand. Nickel’s rally has been fueled by an expedited ban on raw ore exports from Indonesia, and a sharp drawdown in inventories on the LME. Nickel’s supply shock has been too big for traders to ignore, but they’ve been happier to discount simmering issues in top copper producer Chile, where the worst social unrest in decades has led to disruptions at several major ports and mines.“The mood is not that great”Mine supply in the copper market is already constrained, and Freeport will push for a further reduction in the processing fees it pays smelters to reflect that tightness, Targhetta said.So-called treatment charges for mined copper concentrates were set at a six-year low of $80.80 per ton of processed ore this year, and it wouldn’t be surprising to see them fall below $70, he said.Copper ore is becoming harder to find and mine, which means the industry will struggle to meet the world’s needs, Targhetta said.There’s also plenty of compelling reasons on the demand side to bet on higher prices, he said.What a Difference a Year Makes: Gloom and Doom at Metals WeekFreeport calculates that the mining industry will need to find an additional 100 million tons of copper over the next two decades to feed rising consumption in renewable energy, electrified transport and urbanization projects, he said.That’s about five times current annual output, and isn’t far short of the 160 million tons of additional metal that was needed over two decades to feed China’s unprecedented economic expansion, Targhetta said.(Adds drop in copper prices over the past year to the fifth paragraph. )To contact the authors of this story: Mark Burton in London at mburton51@bloomberg.netJack Farchy in London at jfarchy@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Liezel HillNicholas LarkinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/even-lifelong-copper-bull-isn-134527006.html?.tsrc=rss

The world's largest publicly listed copper miner has already warned that production at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia is expected to slip as it switches its operations to underground mining from open pit.  Meanwhile, demand for copper, especially from top consumer China, has declined in the past year as the prolonged Sino-U.S. trade war stifles global growth and hurts prices.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-freeport-posts-quarterly-loss-123000136.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-14	2019-10-14 15:46:28	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	3 Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Goldman Sachs	Undervalued stocks are nothing new on Wall Street. And Goldman Sachs making a bullish call to defend a company's shares is not exactly news either. But combine the two and add in price charts that confirm a bottom, and it's clear that there's plenty of potential in some underloved stocks. Specifically, I'm talking about the diversified and superior potential in American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN).There are bulls in investing and then there's Goldman Sachs. One of the market's most storied investment firms certainly maintains reasons for being generally optimistic in its market calls. That's not to say Goldman isn't making prop side bets or that it's always bullish. But when it comes to paying customers, underwriting and the likes, a bull market is good for business.Given how this well-oiled machine operates, a buy recommendation from Goldman isn't exactly a rarity. Nevertheless, when the firm's chief U.S. strategist acknowledges major market headwinds, but sees superior upside potential in several undervalued stocks -- such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) -- with 50% or more upside, it's time to take notice.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 But from there, we can whittle down that list of names to these three stocks to buy, since they have charts that can actually justify all the fuss. With that said, let's dive a little deeper into what makes AAL, UAA and REGN stock worth a buy. Undervalued Stocks to Buy: American Airlines (AAL)As most investors may be aware, AAL stock has been left behind over the past few years while the broader market has continued to rally to all-time-highs. Shares are also down several percentage points since Goldman's initial call.But now AAL looks ready to take-off!American Airlines' weekly chart has confirmed a large pattern double bottom dating back to 2016 with a smaller variation of this formation. With shares of this undervalued stock also showing a supportive stochastics divergence during the development of the just-completed double bottom, it's time to go long AAL stock with confidence.AAL Stock Strategy: Goldman sees upside potential nearing 60% over the next 12 months for this undervalued stock. Use the failure of the paired double bottoms to contain losses if needed and take initial profits at $35 for a stronger risk-adjusted position. Under Armour (UAA)Under Armour is the next of our undervalued stocks to buy. Shares have been rallying for the last two years since initially falling out of favor with growth investors back in 2016, which was compounded by a series of missteps and earnings disappointments. But while UAA stock has gained ground since bottoming in 2017, as this past summer's price action attests, it hasn't been without incident.The good news is right now the home field advantage on the price chart goes to bullish investors in shares of Under Armour.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Buy Now UAA Stock Strategy: Goldman sees about 65% upside possible for UAA stock. I see diversification, a stop-loss slightly beneath the higher-low pattern low at $17.35 and a bonafide slam dunk if this undervalued stock can capture the firm's price objective. However, I'd gladly take the opportunity to trim profits along the way and inside the last earnings gap near $25 a share. Regeneron (REGN)Not that I've saved the best for last, but this undervalued stock to buy does happen to have the largest potential for upside according to Goldman. The firm estimates Regeneron has room to run by roughly 79%. What shares also have going for them is a prolonged bearish market of nearly four years. This may have finally bottomed on the monthly price chart.This view of REGN stock reveals shares have just confirmed a fresh lower low pivot within the biotech's downtrend. With the September pivot just narrowly undercutting the last important low from 2018, a double bottom is in place on the monthly chart. Because the pattern also has the backing of a bullish oversold stochastics crossover, this undervalued stock is a name to buy today.REGN Stock Strategy: Use an out-of-the-money bull call spread because of the risks associated with biotechs like REGN stock and its long history of price volatility.I'd also suggest sticking with the chart for exiting and taking profits along the way. Specifically, use $270 for containing downside exposure and $400 - $425 for reducing upside risk.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management currently own positions in Under Armour (UAA) securities and its derivatives but no other securities mentioned in this article.

Though it peeled back from its intraday high and volume was soft, the S&P 500 still ended Thursday's action up 0.64%.Source: Shutterstock Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) led the charge, gaining nearly 5% after Goldman Sachs dished out some kind words about the company. Despite its price-target cut, the investment bank still likes the stock, suggesting it only posed a &quot;modest risk&quot; relative to expectations. Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) rallied roughly as much in response to an upgrade from UBS. The bank is a fan of the fact that the mining outfit is selling off some of its weaker assets, and further predicts copper prices will rise from here.  * Boston Beer Company Stock Is a Credible Threat to Big Beer Holding the market back was PG&E (NYSE:PCG). The beleaguered utility name, driven to bankruptcy due to its role in California's devastating wildfires, plunged 29% when a judge ruled that key owners of the company's bonds would be allowed to submit a bankruptcy proposal of their own that could work against equity owners.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNone of those names are as compelling as stock charts of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Chubb (NYSE:CB) are today. Here's why they earned a spot on watchlists. Applied Materials (AMAT)It has been anything but a straight-line move, but Applied Materials shares have made reliable progress since December's bottom. The ebbs and flows have left behind a well-defined set of rising support and resistance levels, plotted as light blue dashed lines on both stock charts.Assuming the pattern is still repeating itself, there's more upside ahead following August's rebound. Last week and this week gave us more evidence that AbbVie is en route to the upper boundary of its trading range. On the other hand, a couple of new concerns have taken shape.  *   Click to EnlargeChief among the concerns is the possibility that horizontal resistance has taken shape around $52.40, where the stock topped out in July and then again in September.  * The other bearish red flag here is the lack of volume behind the current advance, and the fact that the weekly chart's momentum is waning. That is, the once-rising MACD lines are flattening out.  * The good news is, the purple 50-day moving average line served as technical support last week and this week, upping the odds of a breakout beyond the ceiling at $52.40. Chubb (CB)The bears have tried to knock Chubb off of its bullish course several times since December's low. Each time the bulls stepped up to the plate, rekindling the rally. The end result is the establishment of a rising support line marked in yellow on both stock charts.That floor is being tested now thanks to this week's selloff. But, this time is notably different than the prior instances. This time, CB stock is ripe for a lot of profit-taking, and the bulls are on their heels. One more bad day could start a selling avalanche.  *   Click to EnlargeOn the weekly chart the vulnerability is evident in two ways. One of them is the fact that shares reached a full RSI-overbought condition in August. The other is this week's MACD crossunder.  * Those aren't the only red flags on the weekly chart. While it took a day-by-day effort to make it happen, the sheer size and scope of the setback this week translates into the biggest weekly selloff since October of last year. That sweeping change of heart (for no discernible reason) is telling in and of itself.  * Underscoring this week's big losses are a couple of days of high volume selling. The would-be sellers have largely tipped their hand. They're worried. AbbVie (ABBV)After an incredible 2017, AbbVie investors have experienced little more than misery. Shares peaked in early 2018, and the downtrend in the meantime was renewed just around each time it looked like it would finally come to a close.The rebound effort that's taken shape since August may end the same way. But, the bottom leading into that rebound was different than any of the previous ones. It may have cut deep enough to act as a capitulation. We need one more good 'umph' to know for sure, as that would finally get a pent-up rebound underway.  *   Click to EnlargeThe make-or-break line now is the line that connects all the key peaks since May of last year, plotted as a red dashed line on both stock charts. That resistance is being tested right now.  * The selling may have hit a climax and set the stage for a prolonged reversal in August, as the weekly chart finally saw its RSI indicator line finally move to the sub-20, oversold level then.  * Underscoring the bullish case is the recent action at and around the gray 100-day moving average line. ABBV stock failed to hurdle that line on three attempts earlier this year, but found support there at the beginning of this month (highlighted).As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Second, it's below all of its major moving averages and retracement levels.Even on Thursday, the stock's rally is being cut down by the declining 20-day moving average. At this stage, FCX is the very definition of a &quot;prove-it&quot; stock. Let's see how it does with the 50-day moving average at $9.58 and the 78.6% retracement at $9.77.  * 10 Super Boring Stocks to Buy With Super Safe Returns Assuming these levels reject FCX, bulls will want to see the stock put in a higher low, potentially signaling that shares have bottomed. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Coupa Software (COUP)Coupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP) has been demonstrating some relative strength over the past few weeks. For that very reason, it was a red-to-green trade candidate for me on Thursday morning.We pulled the trigger -- tweeted here -- as the stock has now gone on to post strong gains on the day. It's over that troubling range resistance between $148 and $150, as bulls look to see if it's got enough juice in the tank to take out its highs at $156.16.Above that mark could fuel a further rally. On a pullback, let's see if $148 to $150 acts as support. Below it puts the 50-day moving average in play. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Hexo (HEXO)There will be a lot of cannabis investors shaking their heads at Hexo (NASDAQ:HEXO) today.The company slashed its fourth-quarter revenue estimates and yanked its outlook for up to $400 million in full-year sales. It sparked a wave of selling throughout the industry, with many names down double-digit percentages and/or hitting new 52-week lows.Hexo stock is no exception, down 23% and hitting new lows as we speak. The announcement also comes about a week after the company's CFO resigned.This one is a no-touch from me, particularly below its December low of $3.02. Above that mark could spark a rebound back up to its prior channel (blue lines), but even then, prior channel support may very well act as resistance. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Cronos Group (CRON)Down about 6.5%, Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) is not getting hit as hard as many of its peers. The move in cannabis stocks comes just a day after we looked at Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), warning investors of the precarious setup.Like CGC, Cronos has been making a series of lower lows and lower highs, a bearish technical development. However, it still has a significant level of support at ~$7.50, as well as channel support near current prices.Below $7.50 and the October 2018 low of $6.50 is on the table. If support holds and shares bounce, look for a test of the 20-day moving average. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Aphria (APHA)Aphria (NYSE:APHA) stock is down over 13% on the day, erasing all of its enormous post-earnings rally from August (and more).Below $5 should have bulls cautious and below $4.55 should have them worried. Below the latter and the December low of $3.75 is on the table. For it to look better on the long side, APHA needs to reclaim $5 and the 20-day moving average.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-09-16	2019-09-16 13:36:09	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Monday’s Vital Data: JPMorgan Chase, Freeport-McMoran and Apple	Oil prices are flying after an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil processing facility, and oil fields required the country to cut production by 50%. After a volatile overnight session, Crude oil futures are set to open up 10.5%. U.S. stock futures are trading lower amid the elevated uncertainty.Source: Shutterstock Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.37%, and S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.37%. Nasdaq-100 futures have shed 0.62%.In the options pits, calls outpaced puts by a wide margin on Friday. Approximately 20.9 million calls and 16.3 million puts changed hands during the session. However, the distance between call and put volume narrowed at the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.62. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average slipped just under 0.62 -- a two-month low.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOptions activity was elevated in a variety of stocks on Friday. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) saw options volume jump alongside its breakout to record highs. Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) continued to benefit from a rotation into metal and mining stocks. Finally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1.9% after suffering a downgrade by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).Let's take a closer look: JPMorgan Chase (JPM)The ongoing recovery in stock prices has been oh-so-good for JPMorgan shares. On Friday, the banking behemoth clinched a rousing breakout to record highs making it one of the best financial stocks on the Street to buy.  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy With the resistance breach, JPM stock completed long-term basing pattern that was almost two years in the making. The jump could kickstart its long-term trend, which had been stuck in neutral during the consolidation. In the short run, JPM is overextended having rallied eight days in a row. So, a pause or pullback would be a welcome development to provide lower-risk entries on the daily time frame.The breakout sparked a flurry of activity on the options trading front. Popularity was split virtually 50-50 between calls and puts, and total activity zoomed to 235% of the average daily volume, with 139,772 contracts traded.Implied volatility has been on a downward trajectory this month, falling to a six-week low. At 23%, it now sits in the lower quartile of its one-year range. That means options are cheap. Long calls or call spreads are the way to go if you're speculating on further upside. Freeport-McMoran (FCX)Metal and mining stocks have awoken, and Freeport-McMoran is seeing some serious inflows. I count six accumulation days so far this month. FCX stock just had its best week of the year, rallying 14%. The surge carried the shares back above their 20-day and 50-day moving averages.Unfortunately, much work remains before its long-term downtrend is fully reversed. The 200-day moving average still looms heavy overhead, and we've seen many rallies that have started with strength ultimately fail this year. That said, the volume signs and sector rotation into mining stocks certainly looks promising for a bottoming attempt in FCX.On the options trading front, traders came after calls with a vengeance. Activity climbed to 214% of the average daily volume, with 105,602 total contracts traded. Calls ran the tables accounting for 86% of the day's take. Implied volatility didn't budge at all throughout the week, remaining at 43% or the 22nd percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of 29 cents or 2.7%. Apple (AAPL)Just two days after launching to an eleven-month high, Apple suffered an unexpected downgrade by Goldman Sachs. The bank said Apple's accounting plans for the launch of Apple TV Plus would shrink the iPhone's profit margins and lowered the stock's price target from $187 to $165.The company issued a response stating, &quot;we do not expect the introduction of Apple TV+, including the accounting treatment for the service to have a material impact on our financial results.&quot;Drama aside, AAPL stock was likely due for a pullback anyways. Friday's 2.4% drop returned AAPL to its breakout zone providing another attractive entry for those that missed last Wednesday's surge. Its price trend remains bullish with rising moving averages across time frames.  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now On the options trading front, traders favored calls on the session. Total activity climbed to 184% of the average daily volume, with 900,312 contracts traded; 56% of the trading came from call options.The increased demand drove implied volatility higher on the day to 25% placing it at the 19th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums remain cheap and are pricing in daily moves of $3.44 or 1.6%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Freeport-McMoran, AT&T and Advanced Micro Devices	U.S. stock futures are extending Monday's gains this morning.Source: Shutterstock Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.35%, and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.38%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.56%.With Monday being a day of recovery and calm after Friday's plunge, options volume fell well below average levels. Calls led the way with about 15 million contracts traded versus only 13.3 million puts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe action at the CBOE sent a similar message with the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dropping back to 0.58. As is so often the case, Friday's high reading of 0.88 signaled capitulation and gave way to a relief rally. Monday's drop pulled the 10-day moving average down to 0.72.Options activity was actually pretty dull in individual stocks on Monday. Very few stocks exceeded their average daily volume. Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX), AT&T (NYSE:T) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were among the more interesting ones.Let's take a closer look: Freeport-McMoran (FCX)Freeport-McMoran made a rare appearance atop the options leaderboard. Its performance this year has been plagued by persistent weakness in mining and metal stocks. Back-to-back disappointing earnings reports haven't helped either. Since peaking mid-April at $14.68, FCX stock has fallen 40%.  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills Deteriorating fundamentals and terrible technicals make FCX an impossible stock to buy here. The news was nonexistent Monday, and its price action was subdued. Volume was normal as well, so we don't have a catalyst to pin the sudden emergence of options trading on.Traders loved calls throughout the session. Total activity grew to 225% of the average daily volume, with 90,584 contracts traded; 91% of the trading came from call options alone.The increased demand drove implied volatility higher on the day to 49%, placing it at the 43rd percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of 27 cents or 3.1%. AT&T (T)AT&T shares have been a bastion of strength during the recent market turmoil. The outperformance was on full display Friday with only slight give back during the market rout. And Monday traders came after calls with a vengeance. More on that in a second. First, here's the technical take.T stock's ascent accelerated in June and has now lifted the telecom titan to a year-to-date gain of 22%. The bullishness stands in stark contrast to the two-year descent that lopped as much as 39% off its share price. Shareholders are cheering the turnabout. The 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages are all cruising higher to confirm buyers now control the trend across every time frame.On the options trading front, calls were the hot commodity. Activity grew to 94% of the average daily volume, with 89,363 total contracts traded. Calls accounted for 81% of the take. The fact that AT&T made the top ten without eclipsing its average volume shows just how dead it was in the options market on Monday.Implied volatility drifted at 21%, remaining at the 24th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are baking in daily moves of 47 cents or 1.3%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Advanced Micro Devices clinched the tenth spot atop the options leaderboard Monday with a scant 75% of its average daily volume. The activity wasn't all that memorable, but it gives us an excuse to take a renewed look at what has long been viewed as a hot stock by momentum traders.The upward trajectory of AMD stock's trend has turned this month. With the uptick in volatility and minor victories by bears, the stock's short-term trend is now pointing lower, and its intermediate-term trend is treading sideways. We're using the 20-day and 50-day moving averages as indicators for both.  * 7 5G Stocks to Connect Your Portfolio To Buyers should watch the $32 resistance zone. A pop above that could set the stage for a return to the all-time high of $35.55. Until then, AMD is a tough trade.On the options trading front, the theme of call dominance continued.

2019-08-20	2019-08-20 06:22:23	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	BHP Should Stand Pat on Copper	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- All major miners agree that copper has a bright future. The trouble is how to get at it. Take BHP Group, set to be the world’s biggest producer this year after Freeport-McMoRan Inc. sold down its stake in Indonesia’s Grasberg mine. Costs at BHP’s massive Escondida pit in Chile, which accounts for about one in 20 tons of copper mined globally, keep on disappointing. They’ll rise from the current $1.14 a pound to a range of $1.20 to $1.35/lb next year, the miner said in annual results Tuesday, well above its ambitions to keep them shy of $1.15/lb.When the copper price is trading close to three-year lows at $2.61/lb, that still makes for a pretty profitable business. But with  production for the whole copper business seemingly capped at around 1.75 million metric tons a year, it isn’t clear where volume growth will come from. Miners love copper because it’s seen as a way to make a bet on a clean-energy future. Electric cars contain between four and 10 times as much copper as conventional ones, and wind and solar generators are forecast to consume 813,000 tons annually by 2027. It’s not clear that projects currently in the pipeline will be sufficient to produce enough metal to keep the market supplied once those sources of demand start ramping up around the middle of the next decade.BHP’s main expansion at the moment is an extension of its Spence mine in Chile, which is set to go into production by December next year. That should add about 185,000 tons of annual production – barely enough to offset the the gradual exhaustion of the Cerro Colorado and Antamina pits, which have less than a decade of reserve life left in them.Beyond that is the potentially massive, geologically difficult expansion of South Australia’s Olympic Dam mine. That pit has long been a challenge. Its significant uranium content would make BHP a major and low-cost producer of the atomic fuel. The risk, though, is that such a large influx of supply would crash the uranium oxide market and weaken the high-stakes economics of the project itself. In theory, there ought to be interesting opportunities for M&A in the current environment. Freeport, for instance, could almost double BHP’s copper production, and has a lot less political risk attached now the long tussle with Jakarta over Grasberg is over.With return on capital employed of about 11%, it’s outperforming the underlying 6% return in BHP’s copper business and could be bought for about nine months’ cashflow. But with Elliott Management Corp. still a lingering presence on the shareholder register, management are unlikely to want to do anything too splashy. Indeed, BHP’s rivals are prime examples of the risks that can be run from being too bold around copper. Rio Tinto Group’s Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia could cost as much as $1.9 billion more than forecast, with first production from the expanded project delayed until the middle of 2023, the company said last month. Glencore Plc this month announced plans to shut its Mutanda copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo due to rising costs and weak pricing for cobalt, an important by-product from the operation.There may be a lesson in that. For all the billions BHP has spent on copper over the past decade, its returns from the red metal are still among the worst in the group. Rather than chasing volume, it might be better off watching the pennies, letting the market tighten and hoping prices rise to justify the money that’s already been spent. When the cards on the table look weak, there are worse things to do than just stand pat.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-08-16	2019-08-16 12:15:10	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: Freeport-McMoRan, Microsoft and Coca-Cola	It could have been worse. At one point on Thursday, the S&P 500 was down as much as 0.5% before rallying back to end the session up a quarter of a percent. Investors entertained doubts about the idea that the recent yield curve inversion has to lead to a recession.Source: Shutterstock Walmart (NYSE:WMT) gets the bulk of the credit for yesterday's gain. Shares of the retailer jumped more than 60% after the company delivered second-quarter numbers that exceeded expectations. E-commerce revenue remains particularly impressive for the world's biggest retailer.Yet, though the broad market made gains, the number of advancers was only slightly higher than the number of decliners, and bearish volume was actually greater than buying volume.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWeighing stocks back more than any other name was General Electric (NYSE:GE), down more than 11% on accusations that it has been doctoring its accounting statements in a way that covers up a great number of liabilities that will cost the company billions. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) plunged nearly 9% after serving up lackluster guidance stemming from the tariff war underway with China.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On As the last trading day of the week kicks off, however, it's the stock charts of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) that merit the closest looks. Here's why. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Although most stocks bounced back from recent weakness on Thursday, it's not surprising that Freeport-McMoRan didn't. Shares have been trapped in a downtrend for years, and that selloff was renewed at the beginning of last year when a rising support line was snapped.It's possible, however, yesterday's 4% tumble may have also served as a capitulation that ends up becoming the low point of the current bearish swing. That dip pulled the stock back to an established floor, forcing the bulls and the bears -- if not both -- to finally make a commitment.  *   Click to EnlargeAlthough you have to go back to 2017 to see the initial low that serves as the first node of a falling support line, plotted in blue on both stock charts, it's clear that FCX has been getting pushed toward the tip of a converging wedge pattern.  * The weekly chart also indicates Freeport-McMoRan shares broke below what had been a technical floor at $9.50, marked in yellow on the weekly chart that also plots the rising support line, in red, that snapped in the middle of last year to let a new pullback take shape.  * Although technically weak and suffering from bearish momentum, Thursday's kiss of the lower boundary of a descending wedge pattern opens the door to the possibility FCX could attempt to rebound from here. The upper boundary of the wedge, in white, remains intact though. Microsoft (MSFT)Giving credit where it's due, Microsoft shares have impressively stood up to marketwide weakness that started to seriously undermine other stocks late last month. Since peaking in July, MSFT shares have only fallen less than 6%. The S&P 500 is also still decidedly below most of its key moving average lines, while Microsoft is still above its key lines, or only modestly below the ones it's under.Microsoft shares are slowly slipping into a funk, however, putting pressure on key support levels, and failing to find support at others. One, perhaps two, more bearish days could push MSFT over the proverbial cliff and pull the rug out from underneath this name that has rallied about as far as it can feasibly go for the time being.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul   *   Click to EnlargeThe key floor now under attack is the straight-line span connecting February's, June's and now this month's low, plotted as a light blue line on the daily chart.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart of Microsoft it becomes clear that this year's rally has pushed MSFT stock to the upper edge of a rising bullish channel, where it has started to fade. Notice the weekly chart's MACD line is now below zero, after several weeks of lower lows.  * Assuming history will repeat itself, MSFT shares are now positioned to slide back to the lower edge of that range plotted with a yellow line on the weekly chart. It now stands at $111.70, but is rising quickly. Coca-Cola (KO)Finally, Coca-Cola shares have been on a rampage since March, rallying more than 20% for the five-month stretch. More than that though, the advance has pushed KO stock out of a long-term trading range and into uncharted waters. Although overbought, shares even confirmed the strength of this breakout thrust by pulling back, finding support at a key line in the sand and then bouncing back above a long-term technical ceiling.While the momentum is undeniable, the scope of the rally thus far is unnerving. The risk of a wave of profit-taking is abnormally high. The good news is, the make-or-break line in the sand has already been identified and verified.  *   Click to EnlargeThe support level in question is the 50-day moving average line, plotted in purple on the daily chart. That line prompted the reversal that materialized two weeks ago, and is highlighted on the daily chart.  * Backing out to a weekly chart, the basis of the worry becomes clear. Just in the past few weeks, KO stock has broken above a technical ceiling that has kept shares in check since 2013. It's plotted in white.  * Although there's plenty of risk of a pullback that would bring Coca-Cola stock back to the trading range's floor near $46, marked in yellow, there has been an impressive amount of buying volume persistently through this unparalleled advance.At the time of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

In the last 10 years, the average annual return for commodities has been a negative of 5.2%.Commodities therefore still remain undervalued even as liquidity and fundamentals have triggered a bull market in several asset classes globally.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI believe that with renewed prospects of expansionary monetary policies, commodities are due for a rally and Freeport-McMoRan stock is well-positioned to leverage on the upside.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels In addition, years of depressed commodity price have translated into lower investment in the mining sector. I believe a tight demand-supply scenario will translate into upside for copper and other industrial commodities.Besides industrial commodities, I am also bullish on gold as the precious metal is likely to trend higher on potential catalysts. This includes expansionary monetary policies, central banks mopping up gold, and higher geopolitical tensions.The bullish view on industrial commodities and gold forms the basis of my positive view on Freeport-McMoRan stock. FCX Stock Fundamentals Remain StrongAs of June 2019, Freeport-McMoRan reported cash and equivalents of $2.6 billion. Further, with an undrawn credit facility of $3.5 billion, the company's total liquidity buffer stands at $6.1 billion.With planned capital expenditure of $5.2 billion for 2019 and 2020 combined, FCX is fully financed for the next 24 months.In addition, Freeport-McMoRan reported operating cash flow of $1.1 billion for 1H19. This implies an annual operating cash flow in the range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion. Therefore, the capital expenditure for the next 24 months can be largely funded through internal cash flows. In other words, the company's leverage is unlikely to increase.It is also worth noting that for the last 12 months ended June 2019, Freeport-McMoRan reported EBITDA of $4 billion. For the same period, the company's interest expense was $930 million. With EBITDA interest coverage of 4.3, debt servicing is likely to remain smooth.Importantly, high coverage implies that Freeport-McMoRan has the financial headroom to leverage if the company wants to accelerate capital expenditure in the coming years.The key point from the financial analysis is that Freeport-McMoRan has navigated challenging times with a relatively healthy balance sheet.I don't see any financial concerns. On the other hand, if copper and gold start trending higher, the company's leverage will decline further. FCX Copper and Gold Production GrowthFreeport-McMoRan expects copper production to increase from 3.3 billion lbs in 2019 to 4.2 billion lbs in 2021.I believe that copper prices will trend higher during this period and translate into revenue and EBITDA growth. No major copper discoveries in the past decade, lower investments, and declining copper grade are factors that support commodity price upside.For 2Q19, Freeport-McMoRan reported price realization of $2.78 per lb. For the same period, the net unit cash cost was $1.85 per lb. As price trends higher and cost declines (company guidance), there is clear visibility for higher operating cash flows over the next 24 to 36 months.Freeport-McMoRan is likely to deliver gold production of 0.8 million ounces for 2019. Production is expected to increase to 1.5 million ounces in 2021.Gold has been trending higher after a long consolidation in the range of $1,100 to $1,300 an ounce. If expansionary monetary policies are pursued in the United States, it is a strong reason for dollar weakening and gold surging. Even the broad industrial commodity space will trend higher on dollar weakness.Therefore, with a bullish outlook for copper and gold, Freeport-McMoRan stock is attractive for the medium- to long-term.A counter argument is that copper can remain weak on sluggish global growth expected for 2019 and 2020. However, the slowdown factor is discounted in copper prices and tight market fundamentals will dictate the price trend. Concluding Words on Freeport-McMoRan StockFreeport-McMoRan is a leaner organization than it was a few years ago.The sale of oil and gas assets has been a positive. The company's financial flexibility allows for higher-than-planned capital investment if economic prospects brighten.FCX stock has been largely sideways amidst volatility in the last 12-months. I am of the opinion that this is a good time to accumulate the stock.Higher copper and gold production coupled with higher commodity prices can take the stock significantly higher in the next 24-36 months.

While the loss, the company's first since 2016, wasn't as steep as analysts had expected, it comes as Freeport is spending billions of dollars to expand Indonesia's Grasberg copper and gold mine underground, a two-year process that is vital to the company's future.  Freeport reported a second-quarter net loss of $72 million, or 5 cents a share, after earning a net profit of $869 million, or 59 cents per share, a year earlier.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-freeport-swings-quarterly-loss-123925087.html?.tsrc=rss

Freeport-McMoRan swings to loss in second quarter	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.  said Wednesday it swung to a net loss of $72 million, or 5 cents a share, in the second quarter, after income of $869 million, or 59 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. The mining company said its adjusted per-share loss was just 4 cents, better than the 5 cents loss consensus of FactSet analysts. Revenue fell to $3.546 billion from $5.168 billion, edging ahead of the FactSet consensus of $3.543 billion. Consolidated sales totaled 807 million pounds of copper, 189 thousand ounces of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum. The company is expecting full-year consolidated sales to come to 3.3 billion pound of copper, 0.8 million ounces of gold and 94 million pounds of molybdenum, including 830 million pounds of copper, 230 thousand ounces of gold and 25 million pounds of molybdenum in third-quarter 2019, it said in a statement. The company said it succeeded in ramping up underground production in the Grasberg minerals district, which is expected to produce big quantities of copper and gold in future years. Shares fell 1.7% premarket, but have gained 13% in 2019, while the S&P 500  has gained 20%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/528db54e-9989-3e9b-8e5e-a01fb0afbfb4/freeport-mcmoran-swings-to.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-01	2019-07-01 15:17:29	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Freeport Sags as Copper Price, Output Dent Second-Quarter View	(Bloomberg) -- Freeport-McMoRan Inc. fell the most in seven weeks after the miner said lower copper prices and reduced production at its Indonesian operation will trim second-quarter sales and earnings.Freeport expects to generate adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation of about $430 million in the quarter “and to record an approximate 5-cent per share loss to net income before any non-recurring items,” the company said in a statement Monday. Jefferies LLC had forecast the company to report EBITDA of $774 million and per-share profit of 16 cents.Copper sales will be recorded at an average of about $2.73 a pound, below analysts’ estimates of $2.95, the company said. The Grasberg site in Indonesia opened an additional mining area during the quarter, delaying access to high-grade material and trimming copper and gold output. That will result in higher unit net cash costs than previously estimated.“We see this could also be a potential warning across the copper-gold sector of rising cash costs, unless the recent price recovery of the metals is sustained during 2H,’’ Eily Ong, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note.Copper prices in London fell about 11% in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier as concerns over the U.S.-China trade war and the prospect of slowing global economies eroded investor demand.The Phoenix-based company expects consolidated sales for the year to be in line with the April estimates of 3.3 billion pounds of copper and 800,000 ounces of gold.Freeport fell as much as 6.5% to $10.86 a share in New York, the biggest intraday decline since May 13.To contact the reporter on this story: Joe Richter in New York at jrichter1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Joe RichterFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-sags-copper-price-output-151729228.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-01	2019-07-01 13:40:00	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Freeport-McMoRan's stock drops after lowered outlook, citing drop in copper prices	Shares of Freeport-McMoRan Inc.  dropped 4.8% in morning trading Monday, after the metals miner lowered its second-quarter outlook given the drop in average copper prices during the quarter. The company said copper prices  averaged $2.77 per pound on the London Metal Exchange during the second quarter, compared with the average price of $2.94 a pound recorded at the end of the first quarter. The metals miner expects the impact of lower copper prices to lower second-quarter revenue by about $85 million. The company said current analyst estimates reflect an average copper price of about $2.95 a pound. As a result, Freeport-McMoRan said it estimates the impact on second-quarter revenue of lower copper prices, including adjustments for provisionally priced sales recorded at March 31, to be about $260 million. The company said it expects to record a loss of 5 cents a share to net income as a result of the estimated prices. Freeport-McMoRan's stock has shed 15.7% over the past three months through Friday, while the SPDR Materials Select Sector ETF  has gained 4.2% and the S&P 500  has tacked on 3.8%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/82e25aae-3470-386e-bcd7-8afbc1254d2f/freeport-mcmoran%26%2339%3Bs-stock.html?.tsrc=rss

The shares were further pressurized as gold prices fell following signs of easing trade tensions between the United States and China that reduced the attraction of safe-haven assets.  Freeport also cut its gold sales outlook for the quarter ended June 30 to about 190,000 ounces from 265,000 ounces.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-freeport-mcmoran-expects-post-131952791.html?.tsrc=rss

Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) shares cratered after the company missed earnings estimates and lowered forward guidance. Target (NYSE:TGT) took the opposite route, rallying almost 8% after smashing expectations. Finally, Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) fell to a five-month low amid continued selling pressure in metal stocks.Let's take a closer look: Lowe's (LOW)Lowe's stepped up to the earnings plate yesterday morning and whiffed. The home construction giant reported earnings-per-share of $1.22 on $17.74 billion in revenue. Analysts were forecasting earnings of $1.34 on $17.7 billion revenue. Forward guidance was also disappointing with the company cutting fiscal year earnings guidance from over $6 to $5.45 - $5.65.  * 10 Names That Are Screaming Stocks to Buy LOW stock fell as low as 14% before battling back to close the day down 11.8%. Over 22.7 million shares changed hands on the session marking the highest volume day since last August. The down gap has completely upended the stock's uptrend, driving it from above all major moving averages to below in a single session. Bears now control the chart so consider all future rallies suspect.On the options trading front, calls and puts proved equally popular on the day. Total activity zoomed to 1,212% of the average daily volume, with 116,402 contracts traded. Calls accounted for 51% of the tally.Heading into the report, premiums were forecasting a move of $4.93 or 4.4%. That makes the actual gap a massive outlier bringing untold pain to traders swinging short volatility trades like iron condors into the number. By day's end, implied volatility fell to 26% landing it at the 29th percentile of its one-year range. Target (TGT)Target shared the spotlight with Lowe's Wednesday morning. Unlike the latter, though, Target was able to deliver. For the first quarter, the company earned $1.53 per share, handily beating analyst calls for $1.43. Revenue also came in ahead of expectations at $17.62 billion versus $17.5 billion.Both measures marked robust growth from the same quarter last year. While sales jumped 5%, earnings grew by 15.9%. Yesterday's buying binge erased much of what was lost during the stock's recent slide. TGT stock closed the session up 7.8% amid heavy volume. Overhead resistance at $78.50 ultimately halted the rally. I suggest waiting for a break above this level before deploying bullish trades.On the options trading front, traders aggressively chased calls all day. Activity swelled to 458% of the average daily volume, with 129,630 total contracts traded; 69% of the trading came from call options alone.Traders were looking for a move of $3.94 or 5.5% ahead of the report, so chalk up the 7.8% pop as a win for volatility buyers. Implied volatility sank to 24% or the 19th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of $1.18 or 1.5%. Freeport-McMoran (FCX)Metal and mining stocks have been sinking like a stone, and Freeport-McMoran might as well be the poster child. Since peaking last month at $14.68, FCX stock has cratered 31%, placing it a stone's throw from multi-year lows. The news was light this week, but that didn't prevent a surge in options activity landing the company on the leaderboard.Here's a quick technical analysis take. Its price trend is ugly and sits beneath all moving averages. With multiple resistance zones overhead, rallies are suspect. Volume patterns favor sellers with multiple distribution days over the past month showing institutions are net sellers. The next major support zone looms at $9.70, so consider that the first downside target.  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy On the options trading front, traders favored calls despite the day's thrashing. Activity ramped to 172% of the average daily volume, with 81,899 contracts traded. Calls claimed 83% of the total.The uptick in demand drove implied volatility higher on the day to 45%, placing it at the 32nd percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of 29 cents or 2.9%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) delivered first-quarter results April 25 before the markets opened. Investors didn't like the news, so FCX stock plunged 10% on the day. Source: Nick Bastian via Flickr (Modified)InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, investors who bought Freeport McMoRan stock at the end of 2018 are still up by almost 20%, including dividends, in 2019.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares Now many owners of FCX stock are wondering if the mediocre report means it's time to take profits or buy more on weakness.Here are my thoughts about both sides of the argument.  Cut and Run From FCX StockFreeport McMoRan's first-quarter results are best described as mediocre. On the top line, it delivered revenues of $3.79 billion, 0.66% lower than analysts' consensus estimate. On the bottom line, Freeport McMoRan's earnings per share came in at $0.05, three cents lower than analysts' average outlook. It's never good when a company misses the consensus estimate by more than 30%.  What's worse is that this is the second consecutive time that FCX's results have missed badly. Its Q4 EPS came in at $0.11, 48% less than analysts' consensus estimate. As for the future, analysts, on average, expect Q2 earnings of $0.15 and revenue of $4.04 billion; for  fiscal 2019, they expect revenue of $15.01 billion and EPS of $0.50. That's not too bad until you realize that FCX had revenue of $18.6 billion and EPS of $1.78 in 2018. There's a reason for the significant haircut in 2019.Specifically, FCX is  beginning to tap a new, underground mine in its open-pit gold and copper district in Indonesia, one of the world's largest deposits of copper and gold. Moving to the new mine will enable FCX to  continue to mine in the area until at least 2041.As PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI) president Tony Wenas said in December, the underground mine is critical to PTFI's future success. As a result of the transition,the owners of FCX stock can expect lower revenues and earnings until at least 2021. Any owners of FCX stock who don't have the patience to wait this out should sell their shares because FCX could experience more pain between now and when it announces its second-quarter results in July.  Buy More FCX Stock On the surface, Freeport McMoRan's earnings report looks terrible. Its Q1 revenue tumbled 22% year-over-year, while its overall costs were $62 million higher. That led to operating income of just $321 million, 78% lower than a year earlier. I get it. You can't put lipstick on a pig. However, its slump should be temporary. Once the underground mine is operating at full production and copper prices rise a little, Freeport McMoRan's Indonesian business will once again become a big moneymaker for FCX. In Q1 of 2018, the company's Indonesian business reported an operating profit of $896 million.  Last quarter, its operating profit fell to $72 million, due to the transition. But the numbers will improve going forward. &quot;As PT-FI transitions mining from the open pit to underground, its production is expected to be significantly lower in 2019 and 2020, compared with 2018. Metal production is expected to improve significantly by 2021 following a ramp-up period,&quot; FCX stated in a press release following its Q1 results.Over the next five years, the company expects production to ramp up to 130,000 metric tons of ore per day. Since copper is a significant component of electric vehicles -- the average electric vehicle uses three times as much copper as a conventional vehicle -- the future is going to be brighter for copper producers such as Freeport McMoRan. Citigroup predicts that electric cars will account for two-thirds of the increased demand for copper between 2018 and 2030.Any further dip in the price of FCX stock is an opportunity to profitably bet on electric vehicles without buying Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or one of the other electric-vehicle manufacturers.  The Bottom Line on FCX StockIf you can afford to hold FCX stock for three to five years, the current dip in its price is a buying opportunity. If Freeport-McMoRan stock falls below $10, where it's traded only once in the past five years, it would be an absolute steal. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-18	2019-04-18 13:14:46	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Thursday’s Vital Data: Intel, Netflix and Freeport McMoRan	U.S. stock futures are rallying into the open this morning.Source: Shutterstock Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.17% and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.22%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.18%.Resistance near last year's peak flexed its muscles Wednesday, thwarting the market rally. In the options pits, calls continued to dominate and overall volume climbed to above-average levels. Specifically, about 19.1 million calls and 14.6 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, over at the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio fell to 0.55. The 10-day moving average continued hovering near 0.60.Options traders swarmed in the following stocks: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Freeport McMoran (NYSE:FCX)Let's take a closer look: Intel (INTC)In yesterday's vital data we highlighted the unexpected settlement between Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) that sent QCOM stock skyrocketing. It turns out Intel was another beneficiary to the news. With AAPL officially befriending Qualcomm for all of its 5G needs, Intel decided to abandon its efforts at developing cellphone modems designed for 5G internet.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever Rather than punishing Intel for the lost opportunity, investors are rewarding the chipmaker for exiting what was likely to be an unprofitable venture.With Wednesday's 3.26% gain, INTC stock closed at a fresh 19-year high. Its uptrend is on solid footing heading into next week's earnings announcement.On the options trading front, calls ruled the roost. Activity swelled to 447% of the average daily volume, with 280,589 total contracts traded. Calls claimed 63% of the day's take.The pre-earnings volatility ramp continued with a rise to 31% or the 44th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $1.14 or 1.9%. Netflix (NFLX)Netflix entered its earnings release with the specter of Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Disney Plus hanging over its head. Fortunately for the streaming king, its quarterly numbers were sufficient to lay investor fears to rest for now. NFLX stock ended the day down 1.31%, which is an extremely quiet reaction compared to some of its monster gaps from past quarters.For the first quarter, Netflix earned 76 cents per share compared to analyst expectations of 57 cents. Revenue also came in above expectations at $4.52 billion versus 4.50 billion.On the options trading front, calls outpaced puts by a slim margin despite the day's descent. Total activity climbed to  241% of the average daily volume, with 392,668 contracts traded. Calls accounted for 55% of the sum.Traders were baking in an earnings gap of 6.5%, so the 1.31% slide came in well below expectations. Chalk this quarter up to a massive win for volatility sellers. Freeport McMoRan (FCX)FCX stock was percolating on Thursday as traders jockeyed for positions ahead of its earnings announcement. The copper and gold company traded up 5% before profit-taking slammed it back to unchanged on the day.This year's recovery has taken FCX shares up some 40% to reclaim the high side of its 200-day moving average. The 20-day and 50-day moving averages are also rising loyally beneath to confirm buyers have wrested control of the short- and intermediate-term trends. Bulls shouldn't rest on their laurels, however. The past four earnings announcements have generated intense selling pressure. Here's to hoping next week's event doesn't undo this year's progress.On the options trading front, traders came after calls with a vengeance. Activity jumped to 385% of the average daily volume, with 192,024 total contracts traded. 86% of the trading came from call options alone.Implied volatility rallied to 47% placing it at the 36th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of 42 cents or 3%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig held neutral options positions in Disney.

The S&P 500 edged 0.21% higher, still struggling with the weight of the impressive gains seen since late December.Dow (NYSE:DOW) led the way, gaining another 5% as investors continue to celebrate its split with DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP). At the other end of the spectrum, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell more than 8% following a first-quarter delivery report that was shockingly lower than its fourth quarter figures.Headed into the final trading day of the week, it's the stock charts of Hartford Financial Services Group (NYSE:HIG), Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) that are of the most interest.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Morgan Stanley (MS)In mid-March, Morgan Stanley shares had proven they were range-bound. Although the bulls had proven they were willing to take their shot, they hadn't proven that could actually get MS stock over the proverbial hump. On the other hand, at least Morgan Stanley stock was finding support in all the right places, remaining in the hunt for yet another breakout effort.  * 7 Biometric Stocks to Watch as AI Rises The effort the buyers made on Thursday has pushed MS shares just a hair above a nagging resistance line and is challenging another one. One more good day could do the trick, although realistically speaking, Morgan Stanley will still likely need to fall back again before putting in the breakout effort that takes hold once and for all.  Click to Enlarge • The technical ceiling that has been cleared is the $45 area, where MS peaked in January and again in March. It's plotted in yellow on both stock charts.• Shares of Morgan Stanley are also testing the white 200-day moving average line, but clearly paused there when put to the test.• Although momentum has actually been building for weeks, between Wednesday's opening gap (highlighted on the daily chart) and waning volume on the way up, the bulls may need to slide back first and fill in that gap before punching through the big ceiling. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)The last time we looked at Freeport-McMoRan back on March 21, it had just pushed off of support offered by its 50-day moving average as part of the bigger-picture rebound effort that began in January. At the time, however, it wasn't above the more pivotal line in the sand.That's happened in the meantime. While it took some time and work, Thursday's session cleared a huge technical hurdle.  Click to Enlarge• That ceiling was the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. It was resistance in February, but was unable to hold the buyers back this time around.• Bolstering the bullish case are not one but two instances of support at the purple 50-day moving average line. Each is highlighted on the daily chart.• Zooming out to the weekly chart, we can clearly see the downtrend that shaped most of 2018's selling, framed by blue lines, has been broken, yielding to a new, bullish trading range plotted by red lines on the same chart. Hartford Financial Services Group (HIG)Like most other names, Hartford Financial Services Group enjoyed a fantastic January and February, erasing a miserable October through December. But also like most stocks, HIG stock has been stagnant since March, mostly moving sideways.That has changed this week though, and decisively so on Thursday. Shares are up and over a pretty big technical hurdle, and they've cleared it with some compelling underpinnings.  Click to Enlarge • The hurdle in question is $49.70, plotted in yellow on both stock charts. That level had been resistance a few times over the past few weeks, but yesterday's close of $50 puts in in the rearview mirror.• Zooming out to the weekly chart we can see the $49.70 area has been a ceiling before, as well as support.• The clincher is the &quot;golden cross&quot; plotted on the daily chart. That's where the purple 50-day moving average line has crossed back above the white 200-day moving average, hinting at a new bullish uptrend.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

EXPLAINER-How countries are getting tougher with mining companies	A mix of political populism,  higher commodity prices and the expectation electrification will  spur demand for some raw materials has led resource-holding  governments to change the rules for miners operating in their  countries.  In most cases, governments are seeking to increase their  share of profits, rather than all-out resource nationalism,  although Mongolia has been trying to nationalise a stake in a  copper mine.

2019-03-21	2019-03-21 11:29:18	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Freeport-McMoRan, 3M and Marathon Oil	Although it spent most of the day in the black, when push came to shove at the end of the day, the S&P 500 ended Wednesday in the red. It was the second straight day of modest losses, but underscored by rising bearish volume.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) set the tone, if not the pace, falling 3.4% largely thanks to news that the Federal Reserve was dialing back its plans to raise interest rates this year. Lower interest rates general translate into modest bank profits. Rivals Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) booked oversized losses too, however.At the other end of the spectrum, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) jumped 4.6% on bullish comments from RBC analyst Mark Mahaney. Mahaney cites, among other things, continued positive perceptions from its customers and the fact that new competition underscores the further legitimization of the alternative to traditional cable television.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNone of those tickers make for particularly great trading today, however. Rather, it's the stock charts of Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) of the most interest. Here's why. 3M (NYSE:MMM)It's not over the final hump just yet, but 3M stock is knocking on that door. And, it's doing so with the most bullish of backdrops.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly If MMM can muster one more big thrust, it could set off a chain reaction of buying that may well reclaim much of what was lost in 2018.  Click to Enlarge • The &quot;final hump&quot; is $211.80, where 3M stock peaked in December and again in February. It peeled back from the February effort, but is moving back within striking distance.• As of today, the purple 50-day moving average line is above the white 200-day moving average line. This so-called &quot;golden cross&quot; generally portends more bullishness.• It was the February setback and rebound that got the breakout effort renewed in perfect form. The gray 100-day and the 50-day moving average lines both acted as the support they needed to be … something neither had done in some time. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Back on Feb. 20, Freeport-McMoRan was highlighted as a breakout candidate. Shares had then-recently pushed through a couple of technical resistance levels, and were acting as if they were ready and willing to keep trucking.They didn't. After hitting their 200-day line that very day, the profit-takers came out of the woodwork. The bigger-picture bullish effort has been renewed though, exactly where and how it needed to. The next dance with the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts, could prove a bullish catalyst.  Click to Enlarge • The reversal back into a bullish trend took shape right at the purple 50-day moving average line. This is precisely where one would want to see the bulls take a stand.• Although the volume is still below average, notice that the selling volume was waning on the way down, while the bullish volume has been building on the way up this week.• The white 200-day moving average line near $13.40 is still likely to act as resistance, but if it yields to the uptrend, there's little left that stands in the way. The next line in the sand is around $14.50, which lines up with the major peaks hit in the first half of last year. Marathon Oil (MRO)Finally, Marathon Oil is at an inflection point. Most oil and energy names are, prodded by rising oil and gas prices in an environment that suggests the slow uptrend is built to last. More than most other tickers from the energy sector though, MRO is well-positioned for a sizeable move higher.  Click to Enlarge • The inflection point is $17.90, plotted with a white line on the daily chart. That level was a floor in October, but became a ceiling in November.• Like many other stocks, MRO is pushing up and off of support offered by the purple 50-day moving average line early this month.• Zooming out to the weekly chart of Marathon, we find that the December low is also a push up and off the same support line that has guided shares higher since 2016's bottom. Assuming the upper boundary of the range remains in play, MRO could rally back to at least $24 before hitting its ultimate resistance.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Others, however, warn that copper’s path isn’t clearly bullish, given its close ties to demand from China, its biggest consumer.  “We could witness enormous growth in what I believe is the ‘metal of the future’, thanks to [copper’s] exceptional [electrical] conductivity and the lack of competitively priced alternative metal,” says Frank Holmes, chief executive at U.S. Global Investors.  Holmes expects copper to rise on increased demand for renewable energy and electric vehicles and a “looming supply gap.” Electric vehicles consume three to four times as much of the metal as those powered by traditional internal-combustion engines, he says.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5d221d85-8346-315d-8332-0975cd29786b/will-copper%E2%80%99s-revival-last%3F.html?.tsrc=rss

The quiet open comes after stocks extended their rally Tuesday. Small-caps led the charge, notching their seventh up day in a row.But it was gold that stole the limelight. Weakness in the dollar fueled a breakout that sent the yellow metal to a new 10-month high. Gold prices have now risen 15.5% since bottoming last August at $1,167.10.Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.07% and S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.02%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.13%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCompared to Friday's enthusiastic bid for call options, demand for derivatives fell dramatically yesterday. Only about 16.6 million calls traded, compared to 13.7 million puts. The continued market strength has all but erased investors' desire for put protection.Given the ultra-low reading in the CBOE single-session equity put/call volume ratio on Friday, it's no surprise the reading popped back. This is common once cooler heads prevail following a mad dash for calls. The measure lifted to 0.61 while the 10-day moving average held its ground at 0.60.Here are three hot stocks landing atop the most-actives list. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) soared after reporting robust e-commerce sales during the fourth quarter. Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX) scored a mouth-watering breakout on the heels of strength in gold and copper prices. Finally, CVS (NYSE:CVS) options were hot ahead of this morning's report.Let's take a closer look: Walmart (WMT)Walmart laid fears of a poor holiday performance to rest yesterday by reporting impressive fourth-quarter earnings results. The retail ringleader earned $1.41 per share on revenue of $138.8 billion. It also announced a boost in its quarterly dividend from 52 cents to 53 cents. Investors were particularly excited with its growth in e-commerce sales, which showed the company is faring very well in an Amazon-dominated world. For the full year, WMT's e-commerce sales grew by 40%.  * 10 Smart Money Stocks to Buy Now Though its early-morning gains were trimmed by the closing bell, WMT stock still closed 2.21% higher amid strong volume. With the stock perched well above rising moving averages across all time frames, the path of least resistance is higher. That means price dips are buying opportunities.On the options trading front, calls ruled the roost. Total activity increased to 380% of the average daily volume, with 148,710 total contracts traded. 67% of the trading came from call options.With the uncertainty of earnings now in the rearview mirror, implied volatility sunk like a stone to 19%. That places it at the 23rd percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of only $1.21, or 1.8%. Freeport-McMoran (FCX)Mining stocks are on the mend. Buoyed by renewed strength in copper and gold, not to mention investors' newfound infatuation with small-caps, Freeport-McMoran scored a 6.6% gain on Tuesday. And it's up another 2% in premarket trading.A survey of the news revealed few developments of note, so traders should view yesterday's surge as a technical-driven move. On top of the jump in commodity prices fueling the rally, FCX also broke above a critical resistance level. Chart watchers know breakouts tend to bring all the buyers to the yard.Before this week, the $12.70 zone had kept a lid on previous rally attempts. But no longer! FCX has a date with $15, so consider that the next upside target.As far as options trading goes, the resistance breach had speculators bidding up calls all day long. Activity jumped to 276% of the average daily volume, with 167,437 total contracts traded. Calls accounted for 77% of the day's take.Implied volatility held firm at 44%, keeping it at the 29th percentile of its one-year range. With premiums pricing in 37-cent moves, traders continue to anticipate daily fluctuations of 2.8%. CVS Health (CVS)CVS stock is tumbling 8.8% after reporting mixed results for the fourth quarter. The company raked in earnings of $2.14 on revenue of $54.42 billion. According to Refinitiv's survey of analysts, the Street was anticipating earnings of $2.05 on $54.58 billion in revenue.The rally that carried CVS into today's earnings is being rapidly unwound premarket. At $63.79, the stock is poised to open near its low for 2019. Major support looms at $62.50 so if that gives way, watch out below.On the options trading front, calls dominated the session. Needless to say, traders who were buying in hopes of an up-gap will be sorely disappointed this morning. Total activity ramped to 397% of the average daily volume, with 99,374 total contracts traded. Calls contributed 70% to the session's sum.The expected move heading into earnings was $2.43, so this morning's -$5.86 thrashing falls well outside of expectations. Chalk this up as a win for volatility buyers. Implied volatility should fall on the day, but it's descent could be muted in light of the blowout gap.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-20	2019-02-20 11:48:56	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	3 Big Stock Charts for Wednesday: Freeport-McMoRan, Cabot Oil & Gas and Microsoft	It wasn't a particularly pretty effort, but the bulls managed to get the job done on Tuesday. The S&P 500 ended yesterday's action up 0.15%, possible solidifying the recent move above the 200-day moving average line. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq finally crossed above its long-term moving average line, gaining 0.19%. Neither move unfurled on especially strong volume.Ford (NYSE:F), amazingly enough, led the way with its 3.4% advance in response to news that it was shuttering commercial truck operations in Brazil. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) rallied 2.2% on the heels of another surprisingly strong quarterly report.At the other end of the spectrum, Uniti Group (NASDAQ:UNIT) fell more than 30% while former parent Windstream Holdings (NASDAQ:WIN) saw its stock tumble more than 60% after a federal judge ruled that the split of the two companies violated a key covenant of one of its bond issues. The potential liability isn't entirely clear. What is clear, however, as that investors see more than a little bit of liability in the matter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHeaded into Wednesday's trading, the stock charts of Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG), Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are of the most interest. The rising tide has started to pull these names out of their respective ruts. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)In late November, Freeport-McMoRan shares were teasing with a bounce. They'd fallen roughly 50% from the early 2018 peak, but the selling looked like it had come to a climax. Things looked like they couldn't get any worse for FCX.  * 7 Financial Stocks With Accelerating Growth As it turns out, they were able to get a little worse. Following a small recovery effort in early December, Freeport-McMoRan ended up making an even lower low in late December. Ever since then, however, the then-oversold stock has made huge progress that suggests it has shaken off all that weakness.  Click to Enlarge • The new uptrend is most readily evident on the daily chart. FCX stock has pushed above the purple 50-day moving average line that had helped guide it lower for the latter half of last year.• That same daily chart, however, also shows how overextended the stock is now. At least some measure of pushback or profit-taking is in the cards.• Even with a pullback, though, the heavy lifting has been done. We've seen two huge accumulation days since last week. The bulls have tipped their hand. The convergence of the gray 100-day and the blue 20-day moving average lines around $11.70 is the most plausible support area from here, should it be needed. Cabot Oil & Gas (COG)It has undeniably got more to do with the broad (though inconsistent) rebound in the price of crude than it does with Cabot Oil & Gas itself. Nevertheless, of all the oil stocks gearing up for a recovery move, COG stock is better positioned for follow-through than most.You just have to stand back from a distance to see it, and fully appreciate it.  Click to Enlarge • While very uneven, Cabot Oil & Gas has made a slow, bowl-shaped move out of last year's downtrend and into an uptrend. We've logged a couple of higher lows since October's bottom.• While it had to be tested multiple times, the key lows between mid and late 2018 confirm the bulls have drawn some sort of line in the sand.• Though the bulls are chipping away at a ceiling, the brewing uptrend would be confirmed by the purple 50-day moving average starting to diverge away from the white 200-day moving average line. Microsoft (MSFT)Finally, it was only a few days back Microsoft shares were hinting at another round of selling. The 100-day moving average line was acting as a ceiling, and another straight-line resistance level was forming.That potential selloff never took hold though. Rather, it was the bulls that persisted, punching through a minor ceiling.  Click to Enlarge • The escape from a potential setback is clear enough on the daily chart. MSFT stock bumped into the gray 100-day average several times in January and early February. Shares broke through last week though.• There's still a chance the bears could roll Microsoft over. The expanding trading range, framed with white dashed lines, has established another technical ceiling around $109.00.• Bolstering the bullish argument is the bullish MACD cross that has taken shape as of yesterday.• Working against the budding uptrend is a distinct lack of volume, and the fact that the purple 50-day moving average line is still under the white 200-day average, and the gray 100-day average line is about to pull under the 200-day moving average.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-14	2019-02-14 20:15:49	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	10 Hot Stocks Leading the Market’s Blitz Higher	A combination of factors is helping push U.S. equities to fresh highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising to levels not seen since early December on Wednesday.These include hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal (with President Trump reportedly pushing back a tariff deadline), optimism over a budget deal in Congress (hopefully avoiding another government shutdown) and ongoing ease with the Federal Reserve's newly dovish stance.The bulls are going from strength to strength, shifting the focus of their buying as the post-December uptrend matures and changes its nature. From a focus on beaten-down big-cap technology stocks, new areas are piquing the interest of value hunters in areas like energy, industrials and healthcare.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best ETFs You Can Buy With that in mind, here are 10 hot stocks to watch as they lead the market higher: Philips 66 (PSX)Energy stocks like Philips 66 (NYSE:PSX) are coming back to life as crude oil starts to stir, with shares breaking out of a two-month resistance range as the 20-day moving average extends a rise above the 50-day average.

Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.1 per share on revenues of $24.7 billion. When the company last reported on Feb. 8, earnings of $4.87 beat estimates by $1.98 per share on revenues of nearly $29 billion. Hess (HES)Hess (NYSE:HES) is another energy stock to watch, with shares moving to challenge the 200-day moving average to cap what looks like an inverse head-and-shoulders reversal pattern that traces a move to back to the early October high near $75. The company, along with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) recently announced positive results from two offshore wells in Guyana.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever The company will next report results on May 1 before the bell.

When the company last reported on Jan. 30, a loss of 31 cents per share beat estimates by 7 cents on a 30.3% rise in revenues. AMD (AMD)AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shares are consolidating a recent breakout, with the 20-day moving average extending away from its 50-day and 200-day moving averages presaging a break of prior highs and a challenge of the September levels. This would be worth a gain of more than 50% from here. In its most recent quarter, despite weak guidance from management, investors focused on a 9% increase in revenues for its computing and graphics segment thanks to a ramp in its Ryzen processors.The company will next report results on April 30 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 2 cents per share on revenues of $1.25 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 29, earnings of 8 cents per share matched estimates on a 5.9% rise in revenues. Microsoft (MSFT)Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares look ready to emerge from a sloppy looking downward channel that started back in October with a break above a resistance line near $108. Such a break would set up a challenge of the early December high near $112, which would be worth a gain of 5% from here.  * 10 Stocks That Every 20-Year-Old Should Buy The company will next report results on April 25 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1 per share on revenues of $29.9 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 30, earnings of $1.10 beat estimates by a penny on a 12.3% rise in revenues. General Dynamics (GD)General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) shares are holding steady above their 20-day and 50-day moving averages, setting up a run at the prior highs near $185, which coincides with the 200-day moving average. Defense stocks have constantly been listed as hot stocks amid fresh tensions with Iran and steady budgetary support from the Trump White House and Congress.The company will next report results on May 1 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.45 per share on revenues of $9.3 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 30, earnings of $3.07 per share beat estimates by 8 cents on a 25.4% rise in revenues. Deere (DE)Deere (NYSE:DE) is strongly tied to the fate of U.S.-China trade negotiations, given its focus on heavy machinery as well as agriculture equipment used for U.S. food exports. As such, shares are consolidating near prior highs set in early 2018. Watch for an upside breakout following the release of confidence guidance from management.  * 7 Reasons to Own Coca-Cola Stock The company will next report results on Feb. 15 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.8 per share on revenues of $6.9 billion. When the company last reported on Nov. 21, earnings of $2.30 per share missed estimates by 15 cents on a 17.6% rise in revenues. DR Horton (DHI)DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) shares have climbed back up and over their 200-day moving average, setting the stage for a sustained move to test the prior high set in August. In its most recent post-earnings call, management noted that buyer traffic remained strong -- raising hopes for a strong spring selling season.The company will next report results on April 26 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 86 cents per share on revenues of $4 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 25, earnings of 76 cents per share missed estimates by a penny on a 5.6% rise in revenues. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shares are extending above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, looking ready for a run at the prior highs as worries about a baby powder lawsuit fade. The company recently unveiled a plan to buy robotics company Auris Health for roughly $3.4 billion.  * 7 Reasons Stock Buybacks Should Be Illegal The company will next report results on April 23 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.1 per share on revenues of $19.7 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 22, earnings of $1.97 per share beat estimates by 2 cents on a 1% rise in revenues. Under Armour (UAA)Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) shares have bounded above their 200-day moving average to close in on levels not seen since early December, capping a rise of 33% from its recent lows. While shares remain mired in a three-year-old sideways range, watch at the very least for a retest of prior channel highs near $24, which would be worth around a 10% gain from here.The company will next report results on May 14 before the bell. The company last reported results on Feb. 12, with earnings of 9 cents per share beating estimates by 5 cents on a 1.5% rise in revenues. The company remains in turnaround mode here at home, with revenues falling 6% in North America in the most recent quarter. But international growth remains a bright spot, up 24%. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Shares of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) are looking ready to emerge from a multi-month basing pattern going back to October, with the 20-day moving average extending a move above its 50-day moving average as the new uptrend gains momentum. The company was recently upgraded by Morgan Stanley analysts citing expectations that the company is likely to see an earnings boost from higher copper prices.  * 7 Athletic Stocks That Could Run Higher The company will next report results on April 23 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 10 cents per share on revenues of $3.8 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 24, earnings of 11 cents per share missed estimates by 8 cents on nearly a 27% drop in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

This week the options have been active and the calls have overwhelmed the puts. Yesterday LLY options traded 727 times its daily average volume. While the split favors the bears slightly, it's even enough to leave the bias neutral.  * 9 U.S. Stocks That Are Coming to Life Again Usually when options get to be this active, it means that there is an imminent move in the stock. This much action in it above the normal levels is unusual. Such a tense situation will resolve itself soon, but unfortunately we don't know the direction of the breakout.So we rely on the charts and the levels to tell us when to go long or short. Eli Lilly stock is at all time highs so clearly it's having a great year. Shorter term, it is stuck between $120.30 and $118.10 per share. A breach of either side of this range will carry momentum in that direction. The secondary targets from those edges are $121.40 versus $117.05. Those, too, are potential catalyst levels. It is best to trade the triggers rather than anticipate the moves. Twitter (TWTR)Twitter reported earnings recently, and the stock collapsed more than 10% on the headline. This was a shame, since TWTR stock was in the middle of a breakout from $34 per share. Luckily for bulls, on Wednesday it spiked sharply on the 13-F news that Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has a new 5.6% stake in the stock. Investors chased the stock up but closed off the highs.So it is no surprise to see Twitter stock options trade 138 times their daily average. Moreover, 70% of the Wednesday options were calls to only 30% puts. It is clear that traders now expect a rebound from the earnings rout.Before chasing, it is important that it maintains the short-term higher-lows trend. So losing $30.30 would cause a deflation in the immediate rally. Conversely, a breach above $31.82 would trigger a buy signal to fill the earnings gap and target $34 per share. It would be a tall order to expect much more of it here. Freeport McMoRan (FCX)FCX reported earnings in January and the stock fell more than 15% on its heels. Since then, it completely recovered from it. But there might be even more good news and the options markets know it.On Wednesday, FCX options traded 204 times their daily average. More to the point, the mix was 76% calls to only 24% puts and this suggests a very bullish bias. The technicals point to much more upside off the breach of $12.10 per share.If the bulls can continue past $12.30 it could continue on its way to $13 or higher. There are resistance areas in between but this breakout has momentum. The concern from here that this stock moves fast but in both directions. And this fast recovery from earnings left a big gap below that beacons.Tight stops are a must when trading FCX stock. Those who are in it for an investment should trade it according to their fundamental opinions of it. I recently wrote a bullish article about the upside potential in FCX.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-02-11	2019-02-11 15:41:18	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Freeport McMoRan Stock Is Loaded With Untapped Upside Potential	Trading Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) stock is difficult. It being a mining company makes it heavily influenced by the price of commodities. Chief of those is oil and it is heavily manipulated. OPEC can move prices with mere words. Add to it that non-OPEC members, including the U.S. production capacity, is now also a big factor. Gold is also finally making a recovery this year.But these are mere symptoms. The real problem for commodities and FCX stock is the U.S. dollar. The greenback has been on a tear for months. This is the byproduct of the Federal Reserve policies. What the Federal Reserve decides to do with rates moves the USD. While the U.S. is raising rates, most of the rest of the world is still in QE mode. So that keeps the U.S. dollar bid strong, and therein lies the problem for FCX.Finally, recently we saw the Fed capitulate and now they are in line with investors' hopes. After months of pressure from President Trump and Wall Street, Federal Reserve Chairman finally admitted that he is data-dependent. This is code that he now has the same stance as his predecessor Yellen had which is a dovish stance. This weakens the Dollar a bit.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFundamentally, FCX is cheap from a price-to-earnings perspective but since this is a stock that has a lot of outside influencers, it is best traded with more technical analysis than fundamentals. Often enough, the price of the stock has little to do with its short-term price action. Just consider what happened to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) when it fell from grace last year.While Freeport-McMoRan stock is far from its 2010 highs, it's starting 2019 strong. Year-to-date, it's up 13%, which is better than the S&P 500 so the move is legitimate. These are momentum stocks, so when they move, they tend to do it fast and overshoot. Just since last October, FCX stock has had half a dozen moves larger than 15%.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months Trading such momentum stocks poses a problem for fundamental investors, so I rely on levels. How to Trade FCX StockMid-January, FCX rallied into $12.70 and failed in a big way. But this was almost destined to be the outcome since this is a major pivot. In the middle of October, the stock fell apart from exactly that level. Then it failed twice and ruined two massive rallies.So is it doomed to always fail there? No. This is how breakouts happen. The bulls usually need more than one try to break through resistance. Once a stock loses a ledge, that level becomes forward resistance until the bulls muster up enough energy to retake it. Needing several attempts is normal.The good news is that once they do, they overshoot higher. In this case, if FCX bulls can push the stock past it, they can target $13.30 or higher. The pattern would then resemble a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders.There are several lower time-frame levels to consider between the current price and the breakout line; $12.14 is a mini-breakout level to watch. It could bring in a measured move to the $12.60 battle zone.  * 7 Breakout Stocks In Early 2019 Conversely, losing $11.42 could cause another 40 cent dip. There, the bears will have the opportunity to push it even further to $10.50. Although this is not a forecast, it is a scenario that is in play just like the upside breakout. That is why I don't want to anticipate the moves so I wait for the price to cross my lines before chasing it.Rallies in FCX stock will probably need the general market's help. So anyone trading the breakout potential must do so diligently with tight stops. I don't want to turn a trade into an investment. This stock moves fast and I could find myself buried in red for a while.Click here for a bonus video that I recently shared discussing FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) that could help with the concepts discussed here..

  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output in this company's sector is contracting



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is low for FCX with fewer than 5% of shares on loan. The last change in the short interest score occurred more than 1 month ago and implies that there has been little change in sentiment among investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices.

ETF/Index ownership | Negative

ETF activity is negative. Over the last one-month, outflows of investor capital in ETFs holding FCX totaled $18.72 billion. Additionally, the rate of outflows appears to be accelerating.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Negative

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index (PMI) data, output in the Basic Materialsis falling. The rate of decline is significant relative to the trend shown over the past year.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Neutral

The current level displays a neutral indicator with a strengthening bias over the past 1-month. Although FCX credit default swap spreads are decreasing, they are near their highest levels for the past 1 year, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.83% and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.87%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 1.18%.

In the options pits, call volume outpaced puts by a modest margin, even as overall volume held steady near average levels. Specifically, about 15.5 million calls and 14.5 million puts changed hands on the session.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Moving to the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.72 -- a two-week high. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average ticked higher to 0.64.

Earnings reports continued to dominate options activity yesterday. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) options activity surged ahead of last night's earnings report. Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) plunged after releasing terrible fourth-quarter numbers. Finally, PG&E (NYSE:PCG) was flooded with activity after California state regulators declared the company was not responsible for the 2017 Tubbs Fire.

Let's take a closer look:

### Starbucks (SBUX)

Starbucks got a little slippery ahead of last night's earnings report. The ubiquitous coffee company fell 5.3% intraday before paring back its losses into the close. The anxiety turned out to be all for naught because SBUX delivered better-than-expected earnings. Traders are rewarding the company with a 4%-plus gain in premarket trading.

Earnings per share came in at 75 cents compared to estimates of 68 cents per share. Revenue for the quarter grew to $6.63 billion topping estimates of $6.49.

On the options trading front, calls won the popularity contest. Activity climbed to 531% of the average daily volume, with 187,709 total contracts traded. Calls added 54% to the day's tally.

Pre-earnings jitters drove implied volatility higher on the day to 36%, placing it at the 100th percentile of its one-year range. The options board was pricing in an expected earnings move of $4.27, or 6.6%. With SBUX stock trading $2.86 higher (4.4%) this morning, the gap is arriving well inside of expectations.

### Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)

Freeport-McMoRan stepped up to the earnings plate Thursday morning and whiffed mightily. The stock was summarily punished with a massive 13.1% decline amid heavy volume.

For the fourth quarter, FCX earned 9 cents per share on revenue of $3.68 billion. The Street was expecting earnings per share of 21 cents on $3.85 billion in revenue.

On the options trading front, calls dominated the session despite the massive selloff. By the end of the session, activity rose to 270% of the average daily volume, with 123,445 total contracts traded. 59% of the trading came from call options.

Option premiums were only pricing in a move of 32 cents, or 2.6%, so yesterday's $1.61 shellacking blew expectations out of the water. The outsized jump serves as a good reminder that stocks sometimes move way more than what's priced in if the company releases a significant upside or downside earnings surprise.

### PG&E (PCG)

PG&E shareholders finally received a bit of good news. California's largest utility surged 75% on news that a state regulator found the company was not responsible for the 2017 Tubbs wildfire.

Previous to the news, PG&E shares were circling the drain due to massive losses from their exposure to the 2018 Camp Fire which was California's most destructive wildfire ever.

On the options trading front, put volume led the charge. Activity swelled to 359% of the average daily volume, with 322,273 total contracts traded. Puts accounted for 57% of the day's take.

Implied volatility remains sky-high, reflecting massive uncertainty for PCG moving forward. At 211%, the reading sits at the 76th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of $1.85 or 13.3%.

2019-01-24	2019-01-24 21:14:33	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	5 Top Stock Trades for Friday: Freeport, Xilinx, Lam Research	"Stocks are about flat on Thursday, as investors continue to digest the big rally to start the year and this week's so-far miniature pullback. Let's look at some top stock trades.

### Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #1: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)

Shares of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) aren't having a very good day, falling about 13% after the company reported disappointing earnings. It came at a terrible time on the charts, too.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The 21-day moving average was just crossing above the 50-day, meaning that short-term momentum was really starting to come back to the bulls' side. However, the decline thrusts FCX below both moving averages, as well as back below downtrend resistance (blue line).

If short-term uptrend support (black line) can't support Freeport, the December lows are back on the table.

### Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #2: Bristol-Myers

Bristol-Myers (NYSE:BMY) reported decent earnings results but shares are down slightly on the day. At this point though, it's all about the $74 billion merger with Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG).

Bristol-Myers isn't a bad company and is getting a good price for Celgene, in my view. Since it's a cash and stock offer, investors can find alpha in CELG provided the deal goes through.

For those in BMY, it's encouraging to see shares holding up above the 21-day moving average. If they can push through the 50-day moving average, we can get a move up to the 200-day near $54.

### Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #3: Lam Research

Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) ripped 15% on Thursday after the company beat earnings and revenue expectations. In fact, it helped spark a rally within the semi sector too. Let's see if Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) can keep the momentum going when it reports after the close.

With LRCX, it's very encouraging to see the stock surge through downtrend resistance (blue line), but the stock is now coming in $165 resistance and the 200-day moving average.

I would love to see some consolidation below this mark and even a pullback provided Lam stays above prior downtrend resistance. If so, it will setup a breakout over $165. If Intel reports good numbers, perhaps that will be enough for LRCX.

### Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #4: Xilinx

Another big earnings mover? Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), which is up almost 20% on its strong earnings results and guidance. Unlike most stocks though, XLNX was incredibly strong in the fourth quarter.

Given that, today's explosive move higher shouldn't be too surprising. However, it's too much for me to chase, so perhaps bulls should consider waiting for a pullback.

I like XLNX back near channel resistance (blue line) or on a pullback down to $95. Although I don't expect the latter to come to fruition, short of a large market correction.

### Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #5: Ford

Ford (NYSE:F) is up nicely on Thursday, climbing about 3% despite mixed fourth-quarter earnings results. If the 50-day moving average and downtrend resistance hold F stock in check, bulls can consider buying down near $8.20 or so.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



It's encouraging to see Ford stock rallying on what is not exactly great news. That said, the trend is still lower -- for now. We need to see Ford break through resistance to become a more convincing buy. Otherwise, it's hard to buy on the hope of a breakout.

Source: Nick Bastian via Flickr (Modified)

Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) starts off the earnings report for the fourth quarter of the year with earnings per share of 11 cents. This is a major drop from the company's earnings per share of 51 cents from the same time last year. It was also a blow to FCX stock by missing Wall Street's earnings per share estimate of 18 cents for the quarter.

The Freeport-McMoRan earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2018 also includes a net loss of $5 million. This is down from the company's net income of $1.21 billion reported in the fourth quarter of 2017.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Operating income in the Freeport-McMoRan earnings report for the fourth quarter of the year came in at $316 million. The U.S. mining company's operating income from the same period of the year prior was $1.48 billion.

The most recent quarter for Freeport-McMoRan also has it reporting revenue of $3.68 billion. This is a decrease from the company's revenue of $5.04 billion reported in the fourth quarter of the previous year. It is also another bit of bad news for FCX stock due to analysts expecting revenue of $3.80 billion for the period.

## China’s slowdown

China’s slowdown appears to be the biggest challenge for global markets. The country’s slowdown has been amplified by the trade war with the US (SPY). Several indicators, including automotive sales, have pointed to a deeper slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. What do China’s copper imports tell us about its economy?

China (FXI) doesn’t have enough copper reserves. However, China is the largest copper importer. The country’s copper imports are seen as a leading indicator of its copper demand and economic activity.

## Imports fell 

In December, China imported 429,000 metric tons of unwrought copper. The imports fell 4.7% YoY (year-over-year) and were also lower on a sequential basis. China’s unwrought copper imports have fallen on a yearly basis for two consecutive months. China’s copper ore and concentrate imports fell to 1.46 million metric tons in December from 1.7 million tons in November. The imports also fell 11.5% YoY. In December, the imports were at the lowest level since February.

## Analysis 

The fiscal 2018 picture looks strong. Unwrought copper and copper ore imports rose on a yearly basis. However, what we’ve seen over the last few months is a slowdown in China’s copper imports. So far, leading copper miners including Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) have maintained that the underlying demand from China has been strong. However, falling Chinese copper imports might persuade copper miners to tone down their expectations for China’s copper demand (BABA). Apple (AAPL) also lowered its revenue forecast due to the slowdown in China’s sales.

2019-01-09	2019-01-09 14:41:13	FCX	Freeport-McMoRan Inc.	Why Goldman Sachs Expects Iron Ore Prices to Drop to $60	"Why Goldman Sachs Expects Iron Ore Prices to Drop to $60

## Resilient iron ore prices

As we noted in Is the Party Over for Commodities as China Steel Feels the Heat? in November, iron ore prices started collapsing after Chinese steel mills’ margins gave way.

In iron ore’s typical price pattern, prices once again started rising and increased ~11% in December. Prices have rallied back to over $70 per ton.

## Goldman Sachs says prices could drop to $60

According to Bloomberg, in a note released today, Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts, including Hui Shan, stated that while the industry’s fundamentals have improved, more supply is on the way, which should restrict the rise in prices.

The bank expects iron ore prices to fall to $60 per ton in the next six months. Goldman’s analysts argue that $75 per ton for iron ore is not sustainable for two reasons: “First, part of the rally was fueled by mills restocking ahead of the Chinese New Year. Second, supply is set to increase in 2019.”

## Downside ahead for iron ore?

Morgan Stanley (MS) also expects to see losses in the commodity (XME). On January 7, it said, “We’re iron ore bears from here, though, expecting falling crude steel output and growing seaborne supply to ultimately bring price back to the mid-low-$60s/ton.”

Moreover, big miners such as Vale (VALE), BHP (BHP), and Rio Tinto (RIO) have been enjoying higher premiums on higher-grade ore due to China’s switch in a bid to control pollution. This switch was supported by higher margins. As margins have waned, it seems like the party might be over for iron ore miners, at least in the short term. The producers of metals such as copper (FCX) and aluminum (AA) have also been under pressure due to China’s muted demand outlook.

Indonesia forecasts drop in Grasberg copper concentrate exports in 2019	Copper concentrate exports from  Indonesia's Grasberg mine, the world's second-largest copper  mine, are forecast to plunge this year because of a lag in  output as operations move from open pit to underground mining, a  government official said on Wednesday.  In 2019, copper concentrate exports are expected to drop to  200,000 tonnes from about 1.2 million tonnes last year, said  Yunus Saefulhak, the director of minerals at the Energy and  Mineral Resources Ministry.  Grasberg's operator, U.S. miner Freeport McMoRan Inc  , has documented the output decline, which is the result  of the switch from the depleting open pit mine early this year  but before a massive expansion of a coexisting underground mine  ramps up to full production.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/indonesia-forecasts-drop-grasberg-copper-082138960.html?.tsrc=rss

Freeport CEO Says Miner Not Actively Looking to Sell Itself Soon	“I certainly don’t consider it to be something that we would look at in the near term given our share price,” Adkerson told analysts Wednesday on Freeport’s third-quarter earnings conference call.

Freeport’s shares have also dropped in 2018, also partly because of uncertainty about when the Grasberg issues will be resolved.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-ceo-says-miner-not-171727540.html?.tsrc=rss

Barrick agreed to buy Randgold this week in a deal to create the world's largest gold company with an aggregate market valuation of $18.3 billion (14.03 billion pounds).  As a result of the takeover, Barrick will become the owner of Randgold's 45 percent stake in the Kibali mine in Congo but Congolese Mines Minister Martin Kabwelulu said the shareholder change would need to be approved by the government in accordance with Congo's new mining code.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/randgold-faces-pushback-congo-over-200459080.html?.tsrc=rss

Although the company announced a non-binding head of agreement with the Indonesian government, it still needs to sign a definitive agreement and address the environmental claims made by the Indonesian government. In this part, we’ll discuss Freeport-McMoRan’s valuation given its risk-return trade-off.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d60d4a9d-0287-3afa-85e4-cc10ded4f10e/freeport-mcmoran%E2%80%99s-valuation%3A.html?.tsrc=rss
