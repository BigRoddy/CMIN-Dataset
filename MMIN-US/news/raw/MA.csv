For most locations across the U.S., the company hopes to have workers in by September.“Human connection is such an important part of who we are and what we do,” Miebach said in the memo. “With that in mind, I want to bring us back together. And it starts by returning to the office.”The company’s initial expectation is that workers will return at least two days a week, giving workers flexibility “to manage the transition in your personal life,” according to the memo. Mastercard plans to increase employees’ time in the office to three or more days a week “as the situation improves.”As more and more people receive Covid-19 vaccines, New York’s biggest employers are unveiling plans to bring workers back to offices more than a year after sending them home to stem the spread of the pandemic. Mastercard, based in Purchase, New York, has been planning a new site in Manhattan’s Flatiron District for a technology hub that will create almost 500 new jobs in the coming years.The company -- which recently committed $10 million to efforts to fight Covid-19 in India -- said it will continue to encourage vaccination efforts. Workers in the U.S. can self-report their vaccination status to the company, Miebach said.“I look forward to seeing you over coffee chats and unexpected run-ins,” Miebach said.(Updates with company comment on flexibility in fourth paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-maps-plans-return-u-144045078.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-17	2021-05-17 12:00:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard, Mercado Libre, Common Cents Lab, and IDB Join Forces to Improve Financial Resilience among entrepreneurs and gig workers	"The two-year program in Latin America will use behavioral science to help build resilient futures as economies continue to recover.The impact of in-app modifications and notifications on profits, savings, and use of insurance products, considered as the three paths toward financial resilience for small businesses and gig workers, will be studied within digital platforms. MIAMI and MEXICO CITY and DURHAM, N.C., May 17, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- If you’ve been thinking more and more about saving money during the past year, you're not alone. While the pandemic has upended our personal finance habits, small changes in our routine can make a big difference. A new initiative in Latin America supported by Mastercard, Mercado Libre, the IDB’s Retirement Savings Laboratory, and Common Cents Lab, a financial behavior research lab at Duke University, seeks to use behavioral science to help entrepreneurs and SMEs in the region make better financial decisions. According to the IDB’s COVID-19 Labor Market Observatory, during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 31 million people lost their jobs in Latin America, and the United Nations anticipates the worst recession for the region in a century. Small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs who are actively working, or those who are deciding to enter the digital economy at this stage, must have sufficient financial resilience to overcome this period and be even better prepared to weather financial shocks. The partners collaborating in this program agree that financial resilience is the ability to prepare for, deal with, and recover later from economic shocks. With support from the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth for the next two years, Common Cents Lab team will work with digital platforms including Mercado Libre, the largest e-commerce site in Latin America, to design strategies based on behavioral science, which can be validated and adopted by multiple players in the region. Thus, these strategies will contribute to the growth of digital platforms offering greater financial resilience for the most vulnerable entrepreneurs and workers. The program will launch first in Mexico and will then be implemented in other countries where the e-commerce platform operates. ""This partnership strengthens our commitment to the SMEs in Mexico because it will allow us to better understand them and be a real driver for the country's economic reconstruction,"" added Davido Geisen, Managing Director of Mercado Libre México. ""It represents great pride and responsibility for us to be the first technology company in the region to implement a study of this magnitude to improve the impact on thousands of entrepreneurs through behavioral science."" Behavioral Economics is the study of how people behave and make decisions. Integrating technology with learnings from Behavioral Economics in the financial services space, may help people make financial decisions that are more beneficial to their life in the long run. “Common Cents Lab has proven the power of applied behavioral science in the United States and a number of other countries around the globe,” said Luz Gomez, director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth. “Their expertise and insights will be a powerful counter to the urgent and rapidly growing financial needs of people in this region.” To improve the financial resilience of thousands of SMEs in Mexico and the Latin America region, the program will use the expertise of its partners, to develop changes and notifications within the Mercado Libre platform and study its impact on profits, short- and long-term savings, or the use of credit products among its sellers. “The experience we have accumulated at the IDB shows us that we can improve the lives of citizens and their financial habits by using technology and facilitating decision-making,” said Oliver Azuara, lead at the IDB’s Retirement Savings Laboratory. “We are excited to launch this new initiative with the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth and our partners in the region as a way to measurably help those affected by the pandemic recover and better prepare for future financial emergencies,” said Common Cents Lab co-founder Mariel Beasley. “By designing behavioral-informed interventions that exist within these digital platforms, we can produce significant improvements in financial decision-making and resiliency that will serve as a model for best practices in other countries.” This initiative builds on Mastercard’s ongoing efforts to address the economic challenges facing individuals in the region. Last year, the company united technology leaders in Latin America, including Mercado Libre, to launch the Tech for Good Partnership, a first-of-its-kind private sector agreement to accelerate digital and financial inclusion in the region. Together, its partners pledge to use their resources, assets, and expertise to prioritize digital and financial inclusion efforts in the wake of COVID-19.

2021-05-13	2021-05-13 06:24:16	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Musk Sends Bitcoin Tumbling With Shock U-Turn on Payments	(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said the electric-vehicle manufacturer is suspending purchases using Bitcoin, triggering a slide in the digital currency.In a post on Twitter Wednesday, Musk cited concerns about “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions,” while signaling that Tesla might accept other cryptocurrencies if they are much less energy intensive. He also said the company won’t be selling any of the Bitcoin it holds.The largest cryptocurrency dropped as much as 15% to just above $46,000, before paring some of the retreat. It was down about 6% to $51,210 as of 7:03 a.m. in London on Thursday. Other tokens such Ether and Dogecoin also slid. The rush to sell briefly caused outages at some cryptocurrency exchanges. Bitcoin is still up more than fivefold in the past year.Musk’s move comes after Tesla disclosed in February that it had purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and planned to accept it as a payment. That announcement added legitimacy to the cryptocurrency as an increasingly acceptable form of payment and an investment, especially coming from a large member of the S&P 500 with a high-profile CEO who commands a big following among retail investors and the general public.Tesla’s website, which had a support page dedicated to Bitcoin, noted that the token was the only cryptocurrency that Tesla accepts in the continental U.S. Musk has also tweeted frequently about Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency started as a joke in 2013 -- and he quipped about being the “Dogefather” before and during his stint hosting the “Saturday Night Live” show on May 8. He tweeted on Tuesday, “Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?”Tesla’s addition of Bitcoin to its balance sheet was the most visible catalyst during this year’s rally in the digital currency. Bitcoin jumped 16% that day, the biggest one-day gain since the Covid-19 induced financial markets volatility in March 2020.Optimism grew after Mastercard Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and other firms moved to make it easier for customers to use or invest in cryptocurrencies, fueling the mainstream resurgence that took Bitcoin from about $29,000 at the end of last year to as high as almost $65,000 in April.Bitcoin mining is consuming 66 times more electricity than it did back in late 2015, and the carbon emissions associated with it will likely face increasing scrutiny, according to a recent Citigroup Inc. report.Musk is no stranger to considering the issue of crypto’s environmental impact.Musk Splits From Cathie Wood’s Ark on Bitcoin Environmental CostCathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management LLC published a report last month saying cryptocurrency mining can drive investment in solar power and make more renewable energy available to the grid. Twitter Inc.’s Jack Dorsey retweeted a post on the white paper with the comment that Bitcoin “incentivizes renewable energy.” Musk replied to Dorsey’s tweet, saying simply, “True.”‘Confusing’Musk’s tweet on Wednesday took many in the cryptocurrency community by surprise, including Nic Carter, founding partner at Castle Island Ventures, and a leading voice among defenders of Bitcoin’s energy use.“Surely he would have done his diligence prior to accepting Bitcoin?” Carter said. “Very odd and confusing to see this quick reversal.”It’s unclear what prompted the decision and Musk and Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla’s chief financial officer, didn’t immediately respond to an email inquiry for comment. Kirkhorn in March added the tongue-in-cheek title “Master of Coin,” according to a regulatory filing.Tesla’s first-quarter earnings were bolstered by the sale of 10% of its Bitcoin holdings. Musk said last month the disposal was intended to demonstrate the token’s liquidity, and added that he’s retained his personal investment in the cryptocurrency.Kirkhorn said on the firm’s earnings call in late April that Tesla believed in Bitcoin’s long-term value and planned to accumulate the tokens from transactions with customers.(Updates markets in the third paragraph.

2021-05-12	2021-05-12 22:19:45	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Apple-Epic Judge Hints at Compromise in Feud Over App Store	(Bloomberg) -- The judge overseeing the high-stakes trial between Epic Games Inc. and Apple Inc. hinted at a compromise that could quell at least some of the game maker’s concerns: the ability for app developers to inform users that the iPhone maker’s virtual store isn’t their only shopping option.U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers appeared to be looking for middle ground while hearing from economists called by both companies as expert witnesses in a case that threatens to upend the multibillion-dollar marketplace for apps which run on mobile phones around the world.Epic and Apple are feuding over access to V-Bucks, the virtual currency used to buy upgrades inside of the blockbuster game Fortnite. To buy V-Bucks, Apple requires use of its own payment system that takes up to a 30% cut from developers. Epic tried to replace that system with its own, circumventing Apple’s fees and leading to Fortnite’s removal from the App Store and the ongoing trial.The judge this week questioned that Apple rule, which also blocks developers from including a link or other information in their apps to steer users away from the store to buy virtual goods elsewhere online at a discounted rate.The anti-steering policy is targeted in the lawsuit Epic filed last year alleging that Apple maintains a near-monopoly and juices profits with its App Store rules and fees. Epic is seeking to unravel those rules and pave the way for alternative payment systems.There’s more at stake than Fortnite V-Bucks. If Apple were to remove its anti-steering policy, it would likely do so for all app developers. Spotify Technology SA, Netflix Inc., and Match Group Inc. all have complained about the policy, and the major music and video streaming services have removed the ability for users to subscribe to their services from their iPhone apps altogether.Evidence in the case shows that Microsoft Corp. sought an App Store work-around as early as 2012. Representatives of the Windows software maker asked Apple if users could be allowed to subscribe to Office on Microsoft’s website, rather than inside the iPad app, to ensure a consistent user interface. Apple rejected that request despite Microsoft saying it would still pay a commission to the Cupertino, California-based company.“What’s so bad about it anyway, for consumers to have choice?” Gonzalez Rogers asked Richard Schmalensee, an economist and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, who was testifying Wednesday as an expert witness for Apple in the second week of trial in Oakland, California.Apple, Epic Games Have Simple Way to Avoid Trial: Fully ChargedHer question drew pushback from Schmalensee, who highlighted the downside for Apple: a decline in its App Store “revenue stream.”The professor noted that the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 2018 ruling, threw out a lawsuit that accused American Express Co. of thwarting competition by prohibiting merchants from steering customers to cards with lower fees.“If the app vendor can say, if you press this button you can buy this for less, that means the App Store can’t collect its commission,” Schmalensee said. That amounts to “undercutting” Apple’s App Store sales, he said.Sensor Tower estimates the App Store generated $22 billion in commissions last year for Apple, much of which stemmed from in-app-purchases.Gonzalez Rogers said she didn’t think the situations were “factually the same.” At real stores, customers can see signs that say they can use Visa, MasterCard and other credit card options -- unlike in the App Store. “Visual indications of options don’t exist in this circumstance.”“If Apple didn’t have these rules, would the problem be solved?” Rogers asked Epic’s economist, David Evans, who also pushed back at the compromise solution when he was on the witness stand Tuesday.“That wouldn’t eliminate the market power Apple has here, but it would certainly diminish it,” Evans said. For many apps, including game apps that don’t have alternative payment systems, “it would not be much of a solution at all,” he said.Gonzalez Rogers has been wrestling with antitrust claims against Apple’s App Store for almost a decade. An antitrust case filed by app buyers in 2011 that claims Apple’s 30% fee on developers raises consumer prices went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court before returning to her court, where it’s still pending.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-epic-judge-hints-compromise-200626636.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-05-12	2021-05-12 20:55:23	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook’s Crypto Project Reboots With Smaller Ambitions	(Bloomberg) -- The Diem Association, a group of Facebook Inc. and 25 other companies and nonprofit groups once known as Libra, is moving its main operations to the U.S. and partnering with a bank to issue a cryptocurrency backed by U.S. dollars.The new plan includes an agreement with Silvergate Capital Corp., a prominent player in the cryptocurrency industry, which will issue the coin and manage Diem’s reserve of U.S. dollars, the association said Wednesday in a statement.Diem said it’s still building out a global payments network, with the idea that it could serve its own stablecoin or even central bank digital currencies if world governments decide to issue them.“It’s critical for the U.S. to foster innovation in this space. The U.S. can’t really afford to fall behind here,” said Diem Chief Executive Officer Stuart Levey. Levey said Diem’s payments network will be able to lower the cost of sending money around the world, whether it’s through a Diem-issued coin or the central-bank digital currencies that many countries are considering.Shares of Silvergate Capital jumped about 20% in extended trading after the deal’s announcement.While more straightforward to achieve, the new plans are a big comedown from the vision unveiled by the Libra Association in 2019.That June, Facebook and 27 partners announced the project to great fanfare with large ambitions. The Libra Association, as the Diem Association was then known, said it planned to launch a global stablecoin backed by a basket of currencies, including the U.S. dollar, euro and others.The blowback from world governments was fierce. Even though Facebook executives said they were just one of equal partners in the association, U.S. lawmakers said its involvement gave them concerns about protecting user data or giving the already powerful company a toehold in financial services. Some lawmakers even posited that libra could be a threat to the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.Amid the criticism, the Libra Association lost some of the members most equipped to address financial regulators, including Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., and PayPal Holdings Inc. Eventually, the Libra Association decided to delay the launch of a multi-currency coin in favor of separate cryptocurrencies linked to individual countries’ money. The association also rebranded as Diem, but never received a necessary license from the financial regulator in its headquarters country of Switzerland.Now, Diem’s ambitions are tightening once again. The association’s members currently include Facebook, crypto-focused companies like Coinbase Global Inc., and others such as ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc. and commerce platform Shopify Inc. Diem said while it expected eventual approval in Switzerland, it’s withdrawing the application for its license and moving most operations to the U.S.Diem’s U.S. subsidiary plans to register as a money-services business with a division of the U.S. Treasury Department.Though Diem’s path forward might be easier that Libra’s, the association could struggle to explain how the project differs from myriad dollar-backed stablecoins that already exist, such as USD Coin.In an interview, Levey said the association believes that the way it’s implementing the coin, with built-in consumer protections and anti-crime provisions, will be appealing to regulators and companies that want to use the network.Many central banks, including those of the U.S., Europe and China, are in the process of researching or building their own digital currencies. If those come to pass, Levey said, Diem can adjust its network to accommodate them.Diem declined to say when the pilot would launch.(Updates with Silvergate share price move in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-crypto-project-reboots-smaller-201500894.html?.tsrc=rss

More than 90 per cent of respondents across the region indicated that they would consider using at least one ""emerging payment method"" in the next year, while 84 per cent of consumers said they have access to a wider range of digital payment options than they did a year ago. ""People in the Asia-Pacific region haven't just adopted new payment technologies - they've made deliberate shifts based partly on necessity, but also on considerations around personal safety, security and convenience,"" said Sandeep Malhotra, executive vice-president of products and innovation at Asia-Pacific Mastercard in a press release announcing the survey on Tuesday.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. The Mastercard New Payments Index looked at over 15,000 online consumer interviews conducted across 18 different markets globally between February and March. It includes participants from Australia, India and the United States but excludes responses from Hong Kong and China. QR codes have become particularly popular in the region, says the survey. Consumers see them as a convenient and hygienic way to make in-person payments on their mobile devices while the risk of Covid-19 infection still looms. Six out of 10 consumers said that while the pandemic continues they would avoid businesses that do not accept electronic payments. Almost 70 per cent of respondents said they were more excited to shop at retailers who offer the latest payment method. A similar Mastercard report released last month revealed that purchases made online have spiked and generated an additional US$900 billion of digital spend around the world. The card payment giant expected roughly 20 to 30 per cent of the shift to digital caused by Covid-19 to be permanent. ""While consumers were stuck at home, their dollars travelled far and wide thanks to e-commerce,"" said Bricklin Dwyer, Mastercard's chief economist. ""This has significant implications, with the countries and companies that have prioritised digital continuing to reap the benefits. Our analysis shows that even the smallest businesses see gains when they shift to digital."" Hong Kong's official digital payment platform, the faster payment system (FPS), has seen rapid growth in adoption. Its average daily turnover in October 2020 reached 452, 000, an eightfold increase since it was launched in 2018.

2021-05-03	2021-05-03 09:30:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard seeks role as bridge to facilitate cross-border use of China's digital yuan	"Central bank digital currencies such as that being piloted by Beijing could be circulated outside their home countries and converted into foreign currencies via a card clearing network acting as the conversion agent, according to Mastercard. The card payments giant is in talks with multiple central banks across the world, including the People's Bank of China (PBOC), to enable cross-border use of their respective digital currencies, said Ling Hai, co-president for Asia-Pacific in an interview with the Post. The plan would make use of the group's vast payment network that includes 2 million automatic teller machines (ATMs) and 70 million merchant partners worldwide. It is already happening in the Bahamas. The Caribbean island chain's central bank is one of the world's first to issue a digital sovereign currency, called the Bahamas Sand dollar. Travellers to the country can readily convert their fiat currencies through a prepaid card on Mastercard's network. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. The prepaid card is linked to a digital wallet where the Sand dollars are issued, said Ling Hai, who prefers to go by both his names. The PBOC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are currently exploring ways to broaden the use of the digital yuan across the Greater Bay Area, which comprises nine mainland cities, as well as Hong Kong and Macau. ""While central banks can address their domestic issues associated with digital sovereign currencies, the role we can always play is on interoperability when the payment goes beyond a country's borders,"" said Ling Hai. ""For us, supporting a central bank digital currency is similar to adding another fiat currency onto our network."" With transactions having already passed 2 billion yuan (US$310 million) in several pilot cities such as Suzhou, Xiongan, Shenzhen and Chengdu, the PBOC's digital yuan is expected to provide another alternative for retail digital payments. Cashless payment is already well entrenched in China, with Alipay and Tencent's WeChat Pay dominating some 90 per cent of the market. But the potential use of digital yuan appears to have moved beyond just retail since it was first mooted by the PBOC back in 2014. In a digital currency ""bridge"" announced in February, the PBOC has joined its counterparts in Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates to explore cross-border payments using central bank digital currencies. Although accounting for just 2.4 per cent of the market, well shy of the US dollar's 38 per cent, the yuan's popularity as a currency for cross border payment is increasing. The rapid development of the digital yuan has raised speculation about how it could be a pathway for increasing the yuan's global dominance. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has already said China's digital currency ""is not one that would work here"". Geopolitical obstacles aside, ""conversion across a hybrid of both fiat and digital currencies could hold the key to broadening merchants' acceptance of central bank digital currencies"" said Ling Hai. Extending the experience of the Bahamas Sand dollar, in the future a Hong Kong resident with a prepaid card could convert their Hong Kong dollars into digital yuan and reduce the need for currency conversion when travelling within the bay area. At the wholesale level, Mastercard has been using blockchain technology to enable buyers to track the provenance of food supplies, so that the digital identity of produce such as avocado, beef and abalone can be validated across the entire supply chain, according to Sandeep Malhotra, executive vice-president for products and innovation, Asia-Pacific. ""In global trade finance, the use of blockchain is not just limited to payment. Our private blockchain technology is also supporting data exchange, contract validation, and authenticity validation of goods traded,"" Malhotra said. Last year, Mastercard's joint venture in China won in-principle approval from the central bank to conduct bank card clearing in the vast onshore market. It was given one year to prepare for launch. Ling Hai said the joint venture is working with regulators to obtain the licences required to start the business. ""Once we get the licence, our priority is to help people understand that our brand is also synonymous with the domestic Chinese market,"" he said. In China, state-backed UnionPay is the dominant player in the country's card market with over 90 per cent share. Outside China, UnionPay cards are issued in 70 countries and regions.

2021-04-29	2021-04-29 15:58:55	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard Drops After Warning Expenses Will Climb at Least 30%	(Bloomberg) -- Mastercard Inc. dropped the most in more than a month after warning it will step up spending on new products.The company plans to invest more in data and cybersecurity products and boost spending on advertising and marketing, it said on a conference call Thursday. Expenses in the second quarter will climb by a percentage in the low 30s, it said, a bigger jump than the 11% increase analysts in a Bloomberg survey were expecting.The coming jump in costs overshadowed a surprise increase in revenue that Mastercard posted for the first three months of the year.“We think that given the positive momentum that we’re starting to see on the top line, it’s the right time for us to be stepping up on expenses,” Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra said in an interview.Mastercard shares fell 2.5% to $385.80 at 11:22 a.m. in trading in New York, paring this year’s gain to 8.1%, in line with the advance of the S&P 500 Information Technology Index.Revenue got a boost from a smaller-than-expected drop in overseas spending on the firm’s cards. Such transactions are often the most lucrative for both Mastercard and its rival Visa Inc. While such spending dropped 17% in the first quarter, Mastercard said cross-border volume climbed 66% in April from a year earlier. Spending on cross-border travel climbed 166% this month.After consumers spent much of last year sheltering in place, Mastercard and Visa Inc. are set to benefit as travel picks up and vaccines for the coronavirus begin to proliferate around the world. Visa on Tuesday said it has seen a pick-up in Americans visiting Mexico and certain countries in the Caribbean that have opened their borders to tourists.“This nightmare will be over at some point, hopefully soon,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Miebach said on a conference call with analysts.Better-than-expected overseas spending helped fuel a 4% jump in net revenue, to $4.2 billion, topping the $3.99 billion average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Mastercard said overall spending on its cards climbed 10% to $1.3 trillion, helped by a 27% surge in debit volume. Results were boosted by stimulus payments the U.S. government sent directly to consumers’ bank accounts.Excluding the impact of currency swings and expenses tied to acquisitions, costs are set to rise by a percentage in the “low 20s” in the second quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, Mastercard said.“Management is opportunistically stepping up strategic investments, which combined with acquisitions will weigh on near-term estimates,” Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, said in a note to clients.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-drops-warning-expenses-climb-155855773.html?.tsrc=rss

It is also an MM broker, or market maker, which means it actively quotes two-sided markets, providing offers and bids. Forex.com can also make trades for its own account. eToro Second on the list of the best U.S. forex brokers is eToro, which was founded in 2007 and is regulated by officials in the U.K., Australia, Cyprus and Spain. The company is an NDD and STP broker. NDD means ""no dealing desk,"" and NDD brokers offer a trading platform that provides open access to interbank market exchange rates. eToro provides straight-through processing of forex trades and publishes different rates and prices than what market-making brokers publish. STP stands for ""straight-through processing,"" which means they send the trader's orders straight to major banks for processing and fulfillment. eToro accepts deposits via Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Yandex Money, Webmoney, Qiwi, Skrill, Neteller, Sberbank, Ukash, wire transfer and China UnionPay. The minimum deposit amount is $50. IG Third on the list is IG, the oldest forex broker among the top seven U.S. forex brokers. The firm was founded in 1975 and is regulated by authorities in six different countries. IG is a DMA broker, which means it is a direct market access broker that allows traders to route their orders to specific exchanges directly. Traders can also route them to electronic communication networks and market makers. IG is also an MM broker and accepts Visa and MasterCard for deposits with a minimum deposit amount of $0. TD Ameritrade TD Ameritrade is regulated by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a non-profit organization that has recovered billions of dollars for investors. It is also regulated by FINRA. Founded in 1974, it accepts deposits via checks or wire transfers, with a minimum deposit of $2,000. Like IG, TD Ameritrade is a DMA broker. Saxo Bank Saxo Bank is an excellent forex broker, but one downside is that the minimum deposit amount is a massive $10,000. The firm was founded in 1992 and is an ECN and STP broker. Officials in several countries regulate Saxo Bank, and it accepts deposits via Visa, MasterCard and wire transfer. OANDA OANDA was founded in 1996 and is regulated by officials in Australia and the U.K. It accepts Visa and MasterCard for deposits and has a minimum deposit of $1. Interactive Brokers This firm is one of the most well-known names on the list, and it is almost as old as TD Ameritrade, having been founded in 1977. Interactive Brokers is regulated by the CFTC and the FCA and accepts checks and Bpay for deposits. Like Saxo Bank, the minimum deposit is $10,000. Interactive Brokers is an MM broker. There are many forex brokers in the world, and most of them want to say they provide services in the U.S. However, not every broker is registered in the country, so it's important to look for one that is. The forex brokers on this list have been prescreened, so you can trust that they provide the best services. Tapping into the forex market becomes much easier when you have an excellent broker.

2021-04-12	2021-04-12 15:12:45	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	MTN Values Mobile-Money Arm at $5 Billion, Considers IPO	(Bloomberg) -- MTN Group Ltd. values its mobile-money arm at about $5 billion and will consider a listing of the division, joining African wireless carriers trying to monetize a service that is particularly popular on the continent.The move comes after Mastercard Inc. and TPG Holdings LP invested $300 million in Airtel Africa Plc’s mobile-money business at a $2.65 billion value.“With similar valuations to that of Airtel, our valuation would sit at 75 billion rand, or about $5 billion,” said MTN Chief Executive Officer Ralph Mupita. “No decision has been made as yet, but listing will be an option considered if that will be the best approach to unlock value.”Johannesburg-listed MTN has previously said it was looking to spin off its entire fintech business, which includes mobile money. That has been valued by Nedbank Group Ltd. at 87 billion rand ($6 billion), according to a March 26 note, adding the process could take as much as a year.MTN shares traded 1.7% higher at the close in South Africa’s commercial capital, and have gained 48% in the year to date.Mobile money, where users store and manage cash in an account linked to a mobile phone, is one of the fastest-growing sources of income for wireless-network companies operating in sub-Saharan Africa, such as MTN and Vodafone Group Plc- controlled Vodacom Group Ltd. and Safaricom Ltd. The region, which struggles with limited banking infrastructure, has more mobile-money accounts than anywhere else in the world, with about 548 million at the end of 2020, or 54% of all customers, according to the GSMA, the global industry group.Safaricom, based in Nairobi, is the largest mobile-money provider in the region through its M-Pesa service. Potential exists for further growth, with the two most-populous countries, Nigeria and Ethiopia, yet to roll out of the service.MTN’s valuation was reported earlier by the Financial Times.(Updates with Nedbank valuation in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mtn-group-values-mobile-money-090702372.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-31	2021-03-31 13:48:59	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard faces £32m fine for 'cartel' that harmed vulnerable customers	"Mastercard faces fines of up to £32 million for its involvement in a cartel that affected the most “vulnerable members” of society over six years. The payments watchdog found Mastercard and four other firms had colluded to share the prepaid card services market, commonly used by public bodies for welfare payments to the homeless, domestic violence victims and asylum seekers. Public bodies were potentially deprived of lower prices and better quality services as a result, the Payments Systems Regulator said. Between 2012 and 2018, Mastercard funded a network made up of public sector bodies and programme managers Allpay, APS, and PFS, which issued prepaid cards for Mastercard. The network was set up by a firm called Sulion, which the PSR said promoted the use of prepaid cards to the public sector. During this period these firms arranged for programme managers not to target or poach each other’s public sector customers. In the early days of the network, the parties also colluded to allocate leads between them, the PSR found. The regulator raided several of the firms’ offices in 2018 as part of the investigation. Last month Mastercard, Allpay and PFS agreed to settle with the regulator and now face fines totalling over £32 million. The Telegraph understands that as the largest firm Mastercard will pay about 98pc of this fine. Chris Hemsley, of the Payment Systems Regulator, said: “By colluding in this way, we consider the parties were acting as a cartel. Because of the reduced competition local authorities may have been missing out on an alternative supplier or products that were either cheaper or better suited to both their needs and the needs of those using the prepaid cards.” A spokesman for Mastercard said the breach resulted from the actions of “two former employees”. The firm said: “Mastercard is committed to upholding all regulatory and legal standards and we apologise that the actions of two former employees resulted in the standards expected of us not being met in this instance.” A spokesman for Allpay said it had informed the watchdog after becoming aware of potential breaches of competition law and cooperated fully with the investigation. He said: “Allpay has today accepted the decision made by the regulator regarding a significant case involving breaches of competition law, affecting local authority payments to vulnerable people.” A spokesman for APS, also known as Cashplus, said the firm was confident that its activities did not cause customer or market detriment. ""Today's announcement concerns alleged competition issues within a market in which APS operated at very small scale and exited more than five years ago,"" he said. PFS and Sulion could not be reached for comment. The PSR said the investigation was ongoing."	https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-faces-32m-fine-cartel-134859002.html?.tsrc=rss

The 25 companies included payment providers Visa Inc (NYSE: V) and Nexi SpA (OTC: NEXPF) (OTC: NEXXY), carmakers Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM), and Mercedes and healthcare company GlaxoSmithKline PLC (NYSE: GSK). “We believe a similar forum to the FSB is urgently needed to prevent fragmentation and strengthen international co-operation and consensus on digital governance issues. There is a window of opportunity right now to strengthen collaboration,” said the president of strategic growth for Mastercard, Michael Froman. The initiative was focused on promoting trust in new technologies while avoiding deviating industry standards following the intensification of the global internet rules. The Data and Technology Forum would provide recommendations on the global coordination of tech governance. Data flows have posed an increasing challenge for G7 countries lately. Last year, the European Court of Justice struck down Privacy Shield that allowed U.S. companies to receive E.U. data. Questions remained around approaches to technology ethics despite government collaborations in areas ranging from autonomous weapon systems to algorithmic bias. Price action: SFTBY shares closed higher by 0.77% at $45.55 on Monday.

2021-03-19	2021-03-19 20:41:07	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa Faces U.S. Probe Over Its Debit-Card Routing Practices	(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an antitrust investigation into Visa Inc.’s practices regarding debit-card transactions.The department is looking into the network’s rules for routing transactions both in stores and online, according to a person familiar with the matter. Representatives for the Justice Department declined to comment.“The U.S. Department of Justice has informed Visa of its plans to open an investigation into Visa’s U.S. debit practices” and is cooperating with the department, the company said in a regulatory filing Friday afternoon. “We believe Visa’s U.S. debit practices are in compliance with applicable laws.”Last year, the department sued Visa to block a $5.3 billion deal the network had signed with Plaid Inc., saying that the combination would further limit competition in the market for online debit-card transactions. Visa and Plaid ultimately abandoned the deal.Visa shares slumped 6.2% to $206.90 Friday, their biggest one-day decline in almost a year. The Wall Street Journal first reported the investigation earlier Friday.In its suit against Visa last year, the Justice Department said Visa already possessed monopoly power in the market for online debit-card transactions, arguing that roughly 70% of such transactions in the U.S. routed over the firm’s network.At the heart of the Justice Department’s issues with Visa is the 2010 law known as the Durbin Amendment, which requires banks to include two networks on their debit cards. The idea is that merchants are then supposed to be given the choice of routing over a major network like Visa’s or the one run by rival Mastercard Inc. versus a smaller alternative such as Pulse, Star or NYCE. Those alternative networks can be cheaper for merchants.New TechnologyThat system generally works for in-store transactions. The problem, the Justice Department has said, is that Visa has created new technology that makes it harder for online transactions to be routed over alternative networks.“As a result, merchants do not use PIN networks in any significant volume to process online transactions, and instead pay higher fees to use Visa,” the Justice Department said in its lawsuit last year, referring to the personal identification numbers debit-card customers use when paying.Merchants’ complaints over their struggle to route online debit-card transactions over alternative networks has only intensified during the coronavirus pandemic, with consumers turning to online shopping in droves. Retailers already spend more than $100 billion a year to accept cards and other electronic payments, an amount that’s swelled in recent years as consumers shifted away from cash, and banks dangled rewards and perks to spur more card usage.Visa, in its response last year, argued that the Justice Department cherry-picked its definition of the online debit-card market to make it seem like the network holds more power than it does. Visa also said the department’s claim that it doesn’t face real competition from Mastercard was “dubious.”What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Visa’s defense against a new U.S. Department of Justice probe may be the superior security of the company’s network vs. cheaper options, which we view as a sound argument and one that Apple may invoke against Epic Games. The Visa investigation will take at least a year and could spur a lawsuit that would further delay resolution.”--Julie Chariell, senior industry analyst, and Meryl Thomas, associate analyst“Nothing could be further from the truth,” Visa said. “In recent years, Mastercard has convinced numerous banks to switch their debit-card portfolios from Visa to Mastercard and competition has driven down overall pricing on accounts.”For years, Visa has reported in regulatory filings that the Department of Justice’s antitrust division issued the company a civil investigative demand in March 2012, seeking documents and information tied to its debit-card practices.“Although it’s not clear what specifically the DOJ might be looking at currently, we believe the threat of regulation has historically proven to be a near-term multiple compressor, as was the case with the Durbin Amendment, but note the financial implications were less impactful,” Daniel Perlin, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.While Visa hasn’t received a civil investigative demand from the Justice Department yet, it did get a notice to preserve relevant documents, the company said in its filing Friday.(Updates with Visa comment in third, last paragraphs.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-faces-u-probe-over-204107908.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-03-19	2021-03-19 18:00:13	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	DOJ Probes Visa Over Alleged Anti-Competitive Debit-Card Practices: WSJ	Visa Inc (NYSE: V) attracted a Justice Department (DOJ) probe for alleged anticompetitive practices in the debit-card market, the Wall Street Journal reports. The DOJ’s antitrust division probed into Visa’s possible role in restricting merchants’ ability to route debit-card transactions over cheaper card networks. The probe also inquired into in-store issues. The probe emphasized the network fees that merchants passed on to the customers in the form of higher prices. The investigation focused on Visa’s possible market domination via unlawful activities. The DOJ also questioned Mastercard Inc’s (NYSE: MA) role in the debit-card marketplace and whether financial-technology firms posed competition to Visa and Mastercard. In November, the DOJ prosecuted Visa, alleging the perpetration of Visa’s monopoly in the online debit market via the acquisition of financial-technology firm Plaid Inc. Plaid allegedly posed a threat to Visa through the development of cheaper payment technology. Visa refuted the allegations. The companies dropped the deal in January, citing litigation complexities. Merchants have for years alleged the inability to route Visa or Mastercard branded online debit-card purchases over smaller networks like Shazam or NYCE, leading to higher network fees compared to the smaller networks. The DOJ reportedly investigated Visa’s potential manipulation of routing preference via financial incentives to banks. The DOJ also probed into debit-card routing practices tied to newer payment methods, including mobile wallets like Apple Pay or conventional payment terminal. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission was also probing Visa and Mastercard over debit-card routing. Price action: V shares were trading lower by 5.06% at $209.52 on the last check Friday. MA shares traded lower by 2.42% at $358.12.

2021-03-19	2021-03-19 14:11:26	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	The Compelling Bull Case for MasterCard Stock	MasterCard (NYSE:MA) just notched a record high after blasting through a long-term resistance zone. But you don’t have to chase the financial giant at the highs. Yesterday’s rug-pull in risk assets brought MA stock back to a lower-risk entry point. It’s a gift I suggest you open. Today’s article will show you how. Source: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com Rising interest rates once again took center stage on Thursday. Spooked traders took one look at the 10-year yield launching to a fresh 52-week high and decided to jettison stocks from their portfolios. The selling was particularly nasty in the technology sector. Energy had its own issues with crude oil plunging more than 8%. Do you know who didn’t get caught up in the drama? Financials. They remained the lone sector in the green. Sure, they didn’t close at their highs, but ending up 0.52% when the rest of the market is getting destroyed is a massive win.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Twin Tailwinds for Financials While rising rates hamper high multiple, growth stocks, it’s a boon for banks. More specifically, when long-term rates rise while short-term rates remain pinned at zero, it boosts their bottom line. As a result, much of the cash flowing out of technology is moving into financials. And, in case you didn’t know, stocks move somewhat sympathetically with their sector. What’s good for financials is good for MasterCard. 7 Retail Stocks That Are Far Too Close to Failing As if the rising rates theme wasn’t compelling enough, there’s also the overarching reopening theme that works to MA stock’s benefit. Tens of millions of freshly vaccinated consumers are ready to be unleashed on the economy. A broad swath of them just received the largest round of stimulus checks yet. Those who have homes are sitting on a great deal more equity than only a few years prior. According to CoreLogic, national homeowner equity increased by $1.5 trillion or 16.2% in Q4 2020 versus the year-ago quarter. This all points toward more spending and thus more profits for the likes of MasterCard. MA Stock Chart Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade A bullish price chart buttresses the rock-solid fundamental case. Just last week, MasterCard breached the ceiling, which had halted each advance over the past six months. The zone between $360 and $365 had been where rallies go to die. Until March 8, that is. Buyers swarmed to deliver a convincing accumulation day. If you missed the breakout day, you either had to chase at higher prices or wait for a pullback. For those that took the second route, the patience has finally paid off. With Thursday’s tumble, MA stock retreated to the rising 20-day moving average. It’s also now testing the old breakout zone, which should have a good chance of turning into new support. That would be the ideal scenario, but the longer-term uptrend tells me this dip is a buy regardless of how low it goes. Given the significant size of yesterday’s drop, it would be ideal to see some type of reversal candle form before pulling the trigger. The Trade If the higher price of $367 has you skittish, then try using options instead. The implied volatility rank sits at a lowly 6.15%, making long premium strategies my trade of choice. Long calls would be in play if the stock were cheaper, but at the current cost, bull calls are better. The Trade: Buy the May $380/$390 call vertical for around $3.40. The max loss is limited to your original cost of $3.40 and will be lost if MA stock sits below $380 at expiration. The max gain is $6.60 and will be captured if MA rises above $390 by expiration.

2021-02-18	2021-02-18 15:26:39	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Employee Training Programs Are A Big Deal At Some Of America's Biggest Companies; Here's Why	The following is a contributed article from a content partner of Benzinga For the last 23 years, Fortune Magazine alongside people analytics firm, Great Place to Work have been publishing the 100 Best Companies to Work For list. The list is derived from what is considered America’s largest ongoing annual workforce study and more than 4.1 million employees participated in the study in 2020. The study contains 60 survey questions in which employees describe how their experiences at their workplaces help them trust their employers and to reach their full human potential. For companies investing in employee training and professional development programs, the upfront investments in time and money often yield significant returns in the long run in terms of low employee turnover, enhanced employee capacity, and hours saved from firing and re-hiring. In this post, I examine how many of America’s biggest publicly traded companies are in a constant battle to outdo one another in making their workplaces places of learning and professional development. Employees are the most important assets of any company Ensuring that employees get access to quality and consistent professional development programs could be the bedrock for having competent employees and ensuring high company morale. Hence, it is not surprising that some of the worlds biggest companies such as Mastercard Inc. (NYSE: MA) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) invest hundreds of millions of dollars into the professional development of their employees. For instance, Goldman Sachs starts off professional development for its employees with a New Analyst program where undergraduate and graduate students in their final years of study can apply. Once enrolled in the program, the students can expect to gain access to resources, skills, and networks that could potentially get them started in the company. Junior employees can then go on to access more educational resources in the Goldman Sachs University program where they can “focus on building foundational professional and technical skills. Similarly, MasterCard also invests heavily in the professional development of its employees. The “MasterCard Launch” program, for instance, is designed to expose recent graduates to opportunities to enhance their professional skills, receive mentorship, and network. MasterCard also has an in-house MBA program where junior employees participate in a rotational leadership program across several business units of the company. The investments that Goldman Sachs and MasterCards make in their employee, in turn, impacts the quality of service that those employees deliver and it is not surprising to see the value of the stocks of MasterCard and Goldman Sachs rising by more than 300% and 100% respectively over the last five years as seen in the chart above. Stiff competition among some of America’s biggest companies in employee training The quest to invest heavily in employee training programs is very competitive among some of the world’s biggest companies and no company can afford rest on its laurels. Consider the case of Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), which was number 1 on Fortune’s list of 100 Best Companies to Work For in 2016 and 2017. By 2018, the company had been knocked off the top 10 spots and it hasn’t managed to come back up in 2019 and 2020. Hilton Worldwide Holdings (NYSE: HLT) has maintained the Number 1 position on the list of 100 Best Companies to Work For in both 2020 and 2019; the 2020 achievement is particularly impressive when you consider the fact that the world was practically in a lockdown for much of 2020 and the hospitality business in which Hilton operates was one of the hardest-hit industries. However, 3 years ago in 2018, Hilton wasn’t anywhere near the top 10 on the list. Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE: CRM) is another example of the stiff competition among America’s companies to provide the best professional development programs to their employees. In 2020, Salesforce was Number 6 on the list of 100 Best Companies to Work For, but one year earlier in 2019, it was Number 2 on that list, and in 2018, it was Number 1 on that list. In 2018, Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ: WDAY) was Number 7 on the list of 100 Best Companies to Work For, in 2019 it had moved up to the Number 4 position before dropping to Number 5 in 2020. Similarly, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) wasn’t anywhere near the top 10 on the list of 100 Best Companies to Work For in 2016, 2017, or 2018; however, by 2019 the company has pushed itself to number 6 on the list and by 2020, it had climbed up two more rungs to the number 4 position. However, it would be simplistic to assume that there’s any straight correlation between the share price and revenue trajectories of the companies mentioned above. The chart above merely presents the growth in their share prices and quarterly revenue for informational purposes and more research will be necessary to unearth if there’s any direct relationship between the two variables. Here’s why enterprises are committed to employee development programs Probably the first reason why many enterprises are committed to employee development programs is that the presence of such programs helps them to attract and retain great talent. However, attracting and retaining great talent is not an end in itself, the end goal is that enterprises with professional development programs be more attractive to high-performant talents who, in turn, produce provide an edge that helps the company to outpace its competitors. Secondly, employee development programs can have measurable financial cost-saving benefits for the company. To start with, effective professional development programs empower employees to become multiskilled and to apply their expertise and experience into new areas of the business. Hence, the company ends up having a pool of talent with a diversified skill set to perform a wide range of functions and to transition into different roles instead of the traditional model of hiring people for specific job functions. Lastly, employee development programs can help an organization entrench a culture of innovation. These professional development programs can ensure that the company’s workforce is abreast of emerging trends and changes in their industry. By keeping up with such changes, incumbents can lead the charge for innovation within instead of being stuck with the status quo and losing market share to more nimble and daring startups.

2021-02-16	2021-02-16 14:47:44	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Bitcoin Jumps to $50,000 as Record-Breaking Rally Accelerates	(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin blew through another milestone, surging past $50,000 for the first time as the blistering rally in the largest cryptocurrency continues to captivate investors worldwide.The world’s largest cryptocurrency jumped as much as 4.9% to $50,548 and is now up about 70% so far this year. Bitcoin pared its gain after setting the record high. Ether, a rival crypto, hit a record on Friday and is up about 140% year-to-date.After ending last year with a fourth-quarter surge of 170% to around $29,000, Bitcoin token jumped to $40,000 seven days later. It took just nearly six weeks to breach the latest threshold, buoyed by endorsements from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Stan Druckenmiller and Elon Musk. Bitcoin traded for a few cents for several years after its debut more than a decade ago.Tesla Inc.’s announcement that it added $1.5 billion in Bitcoin to its balance sheet was the most visible recent catalyst, sending the price up 16% on Feb. 8, the biggest one-day gain since the Covid-19 inspired financial markets volatility in March. Optimism grew after Mastercard Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. moved to make it easier for customers to use cryptocurrencies, while Bloomberg reported Saturday that Morgan Stanley may add Bitcoin to its list of possible bets.“Whether it’s Musk, Mastercard or Morgan Stanley, the mood, music and momentum is impossible to ignore,” said Antoni Trenchev, managing partner and co-founder of Nexo in London, one of the biggest crypto lenders. “To the annoyance of many, the Bitcoin express has left the station.”MicroStrategy Inc. doubled down on its big bet on Bitcoin. The enterprise software maker said Tuesday that it would sell $600 million of convertible bond, with the intention of adding to its Bitcoin stash. This is the second time in three months that the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company issued debt to fund the purchase of Bitcoin.The 400% rally over the past year comes amid a backdrop of near zero borrowing rates from central banks and unprecedented stimulus from governments in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Bitcoin advocates have criticized the moves as money printing even though inflation remains subdued.Mastercard, in a blog post last week, singled out so-called “stablecoins,” which often peg their value to that of another asset, such as the U.S. dollar. Mastercard has already partnered with crypto card providers such as Wirex and BitPay, but has required digital currencies to be converted into fiat before processing payments for transactions on its network.Trenchev cautioned that investors should be prepared for a wild ride after the latest milestone, pointing to last month’s 30% pullback as evidence.“Short-term volatility is very much a feature of this bull market and investors should prepare accordingly,” he said.Read more: Does Bitcoin Boom Mean ‘Better Gold’ or Bigger Bubble?

2021-02-15	2021-02-15 13:40:25	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Bitcoin’s Epic Run Is Winning More Attention on Wall Street	(Bloomberg) -- Signs of a widening embrace across the financial services industry sent Bitcoin to new heights, with the cryptocurrency closing in on $50,000 for the first time before falling back.A week after Tesla announced its $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin, the digital asset continues to make inroads into traditional finance, including news that an investment unit of Morgan Stanley is considering whether to bet on Bitcoin. Canada also approved the first North American Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.And there’s evidence that more companies are beginning to add services for cryptocurrencies -- an asset class that is still lightly regulated and controversial among policymakers. On Thursday, BNY Mellon said it’s formed a new team that’s developing a custody and administration platform for traditional and digital assets. Mastercard Inc. has said it will begin allowing cardholders to transact in certain cryptocurrencies on its network.The combination of luminaries like billionaire Elon Musk and powerhouse banks is adding fresh ammunition to Bitcoin’s meteoric gains. The cryptocurrency neared $50,000 in weekend trading before retreating. Prices are up some 40% in February, and were at about $48,000 as of 1:39 p.m. in London on Monday.Read more: Why a U.S. Bitcoin ETF Could Be a Real Thing: QuickTake“The key for Bitcoin’s path higher is to win over more corporate endorsements,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. “Bitcoin is no stranger to massive weekend moves and the next several days could easily see some wild swings.”There remains a fierce debate over whether Bitcoin is a legitimate asset with any real purpose or value. The token has been derided for its role in money laundering and scams, and recently Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of “The Black Swan,” said he’s getting rid of his Bitcoin. A currency is never supposed to be more volatile than what you buy and sell with it, Taleb said on Twitter, adding that you can’t price goods in the cryptocurrency. “In that respect, it’s a failure (at least for now).”Even so, the price trend has been up, and Bitcoin stands as another example of the speculative excesses that are defining this bull market -- along with penny stocks and cannabis companies.There are hints that more Wall Street heavyweights could dip into the crypto market. In an interview with CNBC, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Co-President Daniel Pinto said that client demand isn’t there yet on Bitcoin, but he’s certain that’ll change.Bloomberg reported that Counterpoint Global, a unit of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, is exploring whether the cryptocurrency would be a suitable option for its investors, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Moving ahead with investments would require approval by the firm and regulators.“With each major announcement like the one BNY Mellon made, other institutions are spurred to more rapid adoption and deployment of digital assets,” said Patrick Campos, chief strategy officer at Securrency, a developer of blockchain-based financial and regulatory technology, on Friday.“Tesla’s recent announcement will embolden other large corporates and institutions to accept crypto as not just a worthy asset class, but perhaps even an essential one,” he said.Read more: Does Bitcoin Boom Mean ‘Better Gold’ or Bigger Bubble?

2021-02-12	2021-02-12 22:17:30	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Argo Blockchain’s 1500% Rise Comes with a Warning: Don’t Buy Me	Since December, Argo Blockchain (OTCMKTS:ARBKF) stock has ridden the Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) rocket ship to new heights. After listing on the OTC markets last year, the U.K.-listed blockchain mining company has seen shares rise from $0.17 to $2.72 — a stunning 1,500% return. The reason for the outsized returns is simple: cryptocurrency miners have incredibly high operating leverage. That means the doubling in Bitcoin prices since late last year will increase mining profitability by an even greater magnitude. Source: Shutterstock But dig deeper and another truth emerges: U.S. investors are so starved for suitable cryptocurrency investments that value has ceased to matter. As ARBKF stock continues to outrun its primary U.K. listing, smart traders will quickly realize the lunacy of the situation. So, buyer beware. ARBKF’s latest rise is not what it seems.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips ARBKF Stock: Detached from ARB Argo Blockchain runs a relatively simple business, operating around 18,000 cryptocurrency mining machines across Quebec, Canada. The company also owns a large chunk of Bitcoin. Beyond that, however, things start to get complicated. 8 Cheap Stocks Under $20 That Could Double That’s because it has two different listings. Its ordinary shares list on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), generating about 70% of the firm’s trading volume. But it also has stock that trades over-the-counter in the United States. These grey-market shares make up the balance of the stock’s trading volume. Typically, shares on different exchanges should march in lockstep since they represent ownership in the same company. Arbitrage traders can eliminate any difference with long-short strategies, earning themselves virtually risk-free profits in the process. But these are not regular times. On Friday, ARBKF jumped about 44% as investors digested news of Argo opening a Texas-based mining operation. The OTC listing now trades at an over 40% premium to its London-based counterpart, a spread that would make most arbitrage traders blink in disbelief. Source: Data courtesy of Thompson Reuters Can Regular Investors Profit? In practice, taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities is harder than it seems. ARBKF stock’s run came fifteen minutes after the London Exchange’s closing bell, so buyers would have needed access to an after-hours market. And on the U.S. side, most brokerages do not allow investors to short OTC stocks, making ARBFK far harder to sell. The price difference, however, should serve as a clear warning to investors buying ARBKF stock. Though prices can act irrationally in the short-run, they eventually converge to fair value. A similar run sent the stock soaring to $0.75 on Dec. 28, a 200% premium to its underlying London shares. The two converged the following day, leaving U.S. investors nursing significant losses. When markets reopen next week, investors can expect the same story to eventually play out. Argo to Investors: “Crypto Investing is Broken” It’s easy to see the allure of cryptocurrency stocks like ARBKF stock. With significant companies — from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to Mastercard (NYSE:MA) — starting to get into Bitcoin, any firm that provides the tools of the trade should profit. And mining companies fall in that bucket. The mania, however, has also highlighted the flaws in cryptocurrency mining businesses. In January, Argo announced they had bought 172.5 Bitcoin, joining Marathon Patent Group (NASDAQ:MARA) in switching from mining the currency to buying it outright. That’s because cryptocurrency mining is a low-margin business — miners exist only to convert cash and electricity into cryptocurrency. Few of them have any special sauce of their own. Instead, most mining firms wait for months to buy the latest Antminers (mining hardware), usually at a handsome premium to list prices. And by the time these firms receive the machines, a new generation of miners would have rendered the old ones halfway-obsolete. Instead, they rely on rising cryptocurrency prices to outweigh their massive energy costs. The winners, meanwhile, are companies like Bitmain and MicroBT that produce mining equipment. Some believe these firms are worth upwards of $50 billion. What to Do with Argo Blockchain? As investors look for their next cryptocurrency investment, they should remember this: crypto miners are a leveraged play on Bitcoin prices. People looking for the same upside can buy Bitcoin options on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). And as a bonus, call options have limited downside. So, when it comes to companies like Argo Blockchain, investors might consider BTC options instead of ARBKF stock. Because when shares on a London exchange rise only slightly one day and the same stock on the OTC one goes up over 40%, something is amiss.

2021-02-12	2021-02-12 15:01:47	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	A Look Into Mastercard's Price Over Earnings	In the current market session, Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) is trading at $341.47, after a 0.48% decrease. However, over the past month, the stock spiked by 5.63%, and in the past year, by 0.07%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently under from its 52 week high by 7.02%. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. View more earnings on MA Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Mastercard Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 96.68 of the IT Services industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. P/E ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance. Depending on the earnings makeup of a company, investors can become unable to attain key insights from trailing earnings.

2021-02-11	2021-02-11 20:57:03	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	PayPal Looks to Stock Trading, Savings in Push Past Checkout	(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. is weighing a foray into stock trading and high-yield savings accounts as the firm pushes beyond its iconic checkout button.The payments giant expects the number of active users on its sprawling platform to climb to 750 million by the end of 2025 -- roughly double the current level -- as it expands into new areas of financial services, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said Thursday at the company’s investor day. With its latest plans, PayPal aims to become the world’s next financial super-app, akin to Chinese firms Alipay and WeChat Pay.“There’s few companies in the world that can even aspire to this vision,” Schulman said. “It requires capabilities that cross industries, from financial services to payments to shopping to technology.”PayPal is coming off a record year, when spending on its platform soared 31% as consumers turned to online shopping in droves after the pandemic shuttered stores around the globe. The firm added 72.7 million users during the year as revenue climbed to $21.5 billion.The performance came even as PayPal’s main business of speeding up the online checkout process has seen intense competition from the likes of Apple Inc. as well as payment giants Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. Still, it’s an area PayPal dominates: The firm’s button has been added to nearly three-quarters of the leading U.S. retail sites, according to a survey last year by Pymnts.com.One StopNow PayPal has set its sights on turning itself into a one-stop shop for consumers and merchants alike to conduct their finances. The firm said new products could include stock trading and high-yield savings accounts as well as bill-payment capabilities and check-cashing services.The firm’s new digital wallet will be divided into a financial services tab, a payments tab and a shopping tab, Schulman said in an interview following the investor-day event. PayPal hopes to debut the new features within the next two years.“We are doing a lot organically because our platform and our product capabilities are as robust as they’ve ever been,” Schulman said in the interview. “But we’ll also look to partner with people,” he said, adding that “we’re also looking at the potential of acquisitions where that might make sense.”The company is leaning into the success it’s already seen from adding the ability for users to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies in digital wallets in recent months. Half of all customers who took advantage of the feature now log into the app every day -- meaning PayPal has become a destination for those customers, rather than a place they turn to on an as-needed basis.Driving Revenue“This is precisely the type of engagement that we want to see as we add these additional financial services,” Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said.That’s because that sort of activity, in turn, drives revenue. Schulman said the firm now expects the average amount of revenue it collects from each user to grow substantially over the next five years.PayPal is now on track to more than double revenue to $50 billion in 2025 as payments volume on its platforms triples to $2.8 trillion. The firm also expects to generate $40 billion in free cash flow over the next five years.PayPal’s shares rose 0.5% to $284.62 at 3:28 p.m. in New York, after climbing as much as 6.7% in earlier trading.

2021-02-11	2021-02-11 20:40:18	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Bitcoin Hits Record as Mastercard, BNY Mellon Embrace Crypto	(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin jumped to a record high after Mastercard Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. moved to make it easier for customers to use cryptocurrencies.The largest digital asset rose as much as 8.1% to $48,663, surpassing the all-time high reached Monday after Tesla Inc. announced it would hold $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency on its balance sheet. The wider Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index also touched a record.“Bitcoin appears to be in a near-perfect storm for higher prices, and Tesla has helped solidify about $50,000 as the next whole number resistance target,” said Mike McGlone, a Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist.Mastercard singled out so-called “stablecoins,” which often peg their value to that of another asset, such as the U.S. dollar. Mastercard has already partnered with crypto card providers such as Wirex and BitPay, but has required digital currencies to be converted into fiat before processing payments for transactions on its network.Bank of New York Mellon Corp. said Thursday it will hold, transfer and issue Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for institutional customers.Interest in cryptocurrencies has accelerated yet again as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, emerged as a central figure for the crypto faithful, supporting arguments among proponents that Wall Street and the mainstream are becoming more receptive to the asset class. Detractors maintain speculators are behind Bitcoin’s rise and the bubble will once again burst.Even before announcing Tesla’s bet on Bitcoin, Musk said he was a supporter of Bitcoin on a social audio app and made multiple tongue-in-cheek references on Twitter to Dogecoin -- a Shiba Inu-themed crypto started as a joke -- sending prices soaring.Mastercard is also “actively engaging” with central banks around the world on their plans to launch new digital currencies, the company said in a blog post on Wednesday.“The announcements from both Mastercard and BNY Mellon confirm the fundamental shift that financial institutions are committing to cryptocurrencies,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. “This is great news for further mainstream acceptance with cryptocurrencies and will likely continue to keep the excitement going for Bitcoin.”JPMorgan Sees Tesla Bitcoin Bet as Too Bold for Others to FollowTwitter Inc. has also done some “upfront thinking” around how to handle Bitcoin, including if employees and vendors ask to be paid in the cryptocurrency and whether the firm needs to have the digital asset on its balance sheet, CFO Ned Segal said in an interview on CNBC. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has been a long-time advocate of Bitcoin. Square Inc., which Dorsey also co-founded, has invested in the cryptocurrency.“These are just the early innings of corporate adoption, as digital currencies are beginning to play a larger role in robust balance sheet management,” said Nathan Cox, chief investment officer at Two Prime, an investment firm specialized in digital asset and derivative strategy management.While Tesla’s investment put the focus on whether more companies will buy Bitcoin, the purchase is a drop in the ocean compared to the holdings of America’s blue-chip corporates. The purchase is worth just 0.05% of about $2.79 trillion of cash and cash-equivalents held on the balance sheets of S&P 500 members, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Wall Street Bets, the popular Reddit forum at the center of the retail investor frenzy, is talking about cryptocurrencies as well. The unverified Twitter account “Wallstreetbets mod” posted a call to buy Bitcoin and marijuana stocks.Regulatory scrutiny remains a wild card for crypto investors. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, speaking at a Treasury forum for financial sector innovation, warned misuse of cryptocurrencies was a growing problem. Yellen has previously raised concerns about the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit financing.Read more: Does Bitcoin Boom Mean ‘Better Gold’ or Bigger Bubble?

2021-02-11	2021-02-11 15:51:30	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	A Look Into Mastercard Inc's Price Over Earnings	In the current session, Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) is trading at $345.26, after a 3.27% increase. Over the past month, the stock increased by 5.61%, and in the past year, by 1.26%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 5.99%. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 103.15 in the IT Services industry, Mastercard Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 52.47. Shareholders might be inclined to think that the stock might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued. There are many limitations to P/E ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings.

2021-02-11	2021-02-11 02:50:29	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard Expands Cryptocurrency Support, Citing Growing Interest	Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) said Wednesday it planned to expand its cryptocurrency program, citing worldwide consumer and merchant interest in digital tokens. What Happened: The move allows holders of payment cards to buy, hold, and exchange multiple traditional currencies and some cryptocurrencies. Consumers would be able to convert their cryptocurrency into fiat money, which they can spend. “Currency will always enter Mastercard’s network as traditional fiat currency,” Mastercard said in a statement. “The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and Mastercard is driving it forward, creating safe and secure experiences for consumers and businesses in today’s digital economy,” said Executive Vice President Raj Dhamodharan. Why It Matters: Mastercard previously supported cryptocurrency transactions through its partnerships with Wirex and Bitpay, which would convert the digital assets into fiat currencies. Institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC) has been growing. On Monday, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) said it invested .5 billion in the apex cryptocurrency and in the near future will support BTC as a payments option. PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) last year announced a service that allows users to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies. The company also announced cryptocurrency as a funding source for merchants at the time.

Square stock has surged almost five-fold since April. But, as long as its growth story stays in motion, expect valuation concerns to remain secondary. Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Why? Chalk it up to the strong performance of its customer-facing Cash App business. Now making up two-thirds of its revenue, this platform has moved beyond just peer-to-peer payments. The platform has found success offering trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (CCC:BTC). Its recent move into stock brokerage services has shown success as well, and could benefit from the recent controversy surrounding Robinhood.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What about Square’s Seller Ecosystem (point of sale, Square Capital) segment? As seen in its last quarterly results release, this unit has continued to grow, albeit moderately. But this could pick up going forward. Why? The “digitalization of payments” megatrend (more below) could start to accelerate post-Covid. In addition, this segment could perform better than expected, if we get over the pandemic in the coming year. 8 Biometric Stocks to Consider as We Eye a Return to Normal The Cash App segment may be getting the most attention. But, the Seller Ecosystem remains an important part of this fintech supermarket. Of course, it’s not guaranteed that good times will continue for Square stock. Given its frothy valuation, shares could see a downsized pullback if the stock market starts heading in the wrong direction. But, outside of general market risk, there’s little on the horizon to make this “story stock” fall out of favor with investors. In short, a good chance shares continue to trend higher. Square Stock, and the Runaway Success of Cash App The future looks bright for Square, thanks to the runway success of its CashApp segment. As InvestorPlace’s Louis Navellier discussed Jan. 29, CashApp has delivered triple-digit growth in the past three quarters. We have yet to see results for the quarter ending Dec. 31. But it looks likely we’ll see a fourth consecutive quarter of blockbuster results. Like I said above, it’s more than just peer-to-peer payments that’s fueling growth for CashApp. The company has also found success with its crypto and stock trading services. With the controversy surrounding Robinhood after the GameStop (NYSE:GME) “short squeeze saga,” CashApp’s brokerage growth could speed up, as longtime Robinhood users move over to this other retail-friendly platform. On the other hand, there’s no guarantee there will be a mass exodus from Robinhood. In fact, there’s evidence that all the attention surrounding the GameStop affair has helped to increase downloads of the popular retail brokerage app. Yet, this possible outcome played a role in Mizuho Securities’ latest “buy” rating on Square stock. Mizuho’s analyst team is not only bullish on CashApp’s prospects, but also the potential of its overlooked Seller Ecosystem unit. Speaking of this unit, there are two potential developments that could improve its results. Both in the coming year, and throughout the 2020s. Why Digitalization of Payments Will Boost Its Legacy Business The past year has been a banner one for Square. However, far from just seeing a short-term boost from pandemic-related tailwinds, the long-term appears bright as well for Square. Analysts at Cowen recently broke down how the “digitalization of payments” megatrend is set to accelerate in a post-Covid world. In other words, the eventual move to entirely cashless transactions. This may mostly benefit Square’s fintech rival, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), as well as legacy payment giants like Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V). But, Square stands to gain from this as well. Large companies may be early adopters of all-cashless point-of-sale transactions. But, over time, smaller businesses like restaurants will likely make this shift as well. Besides this longer-term catalyst, there is also the Covid recovery factor to consider as well. InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst Luke Lango mentioned this on Feb. 1, when he made the case why Square stock is headed to $300 per share. In short, as in-person businesses like restaurants and retailers get back to normal in 2021, the Seller Ecosystem segment should see a strong performance over the next few quarters. Outside of a Market Crash, Shares Could Continue to Climb In my book, Square looks overvalued. All it will take is one hiccup for this top -performing stock to reverse course. Yet, so much remains on its side. Outside of an overall market correction/crash, I don’t see shares heading lower anytime soon. Instead, as more positive news comes out (such as its upcoming Q4 earnings release), Square stock will likely head towards higher price levels. Tread carefully, but this remains a solid opportunity for growth-minded investors. On the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a LONG position in bitcoin.

2021-01-27	2021-01-27 15:44:22	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	KeyBanc Downgrades Mastercard, Visa On Industry Trends	Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) and Visa Inc (NYSE: V) are likely to generate cross-border revenue short of the Street expectations, given that rising COVID-19 cases, the pace of vaccine rollout and the government response to the situation are weighing on demand for international travel, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The Payments Analyst: Josh Beck downgraded both Mastercard and Visa from Overweight to Sector Weight. The analyst raised the Mastercard price target from $325 to $345 and reduced Visa's from $225 to $210. The Payments Thesis: Consolidation has reduced the number of processors, and cloud evolution is “giving rise to a growing number of players on the edges focused more directly on consumers, merchants, and/or banking relationships,” Beck said in an industry note. “Visa and Mastercard (payment volume) trends through November generally indicated a gradual moderation since early September,” the analyst said. Referring to 2021 prospects, he said investors should “expect robust domestic spending trends to be offset by weak x-border trends leading to in-line to slightly below results. Expect limited guidance with a focus likely to be on QTD trends, which we expect have moderated slightly from prior November updates with continued travel headwinds.” Beck lowered the 2021 earnings estimate for Mastercard from $8.35 per share to $8 per share and for Visa from $6.75 per share to $6.50 per share.

He noted that the pandemic has accelerated the move toward digital payments and away from cash, a trend that should ""further strengthen the long-term structural bull case"" for Mastercard, Visa Inc.  and PayPal Holdings Inc. . Consumers have shown a growing preference for debit spending over credit spending during the pandemic, but Kupferberg thinks there could be a ""narrowing of the gap between debit and credit volume growth"" in the second half of the year as consumers could start spending more heavily on discretionary categories like travel and events, which are the types of purchases often made with credit cards.

2020-12-28	2020-12-28 22:35:37	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	China Shows Jack Ma What an Activist Can Do	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The rare activist moment staged by China’s central bank was too late and too crude.For years, when it came to innovative business ideas, Beijing’s stance has been to let them flourish — there would always be room to regulate and rein things in later. And thus gig economy superstars blossomed. China’s version of Uber Technologies Inc., DoorDash Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. are even more ubiquitous than their U.S. counterparts at home. The other side of the coin is that billions of dollars in paper gains can be made and destroyed within days thanks to regulatory whims. Here, Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. is a cautionary tale.On Sunday, China’s central bank released a statement saying that Ant has “little legal awareness,” “despised” regulators’ compliance requirements and engaged in antitrust behavior. Ant needs to go back to its core payment business, the People’s Bank of China said. In the first two trading days since then, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which owns roughly one-third of Ant, lost over 15% of its market value. Even before the PBOC’s interference into Ant’s business models on Sunday, Alibaba's shares were whacked by a terse, one-sentence announcement from Beijing about probing the company’s antitrust behavior on Christmas Eve. Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed shares are entering the year-end just 1.4% away from being in the red. That’s a further blow to Ma, whose blunt words, likening China’s financial system to pawnshops, cost him the world’s biggest initial public offering in early November. Ant had been on track to raise $35 billion, with a valuation of more than $300 billion, until regulators pulled it two days before its trading debut.The company’s digital-payment business has become commoditized. The newer, faster growing consumer-lending operation, which the PBOC now seeks to limit, is Ant’s high-margin cash cow. So even if the company can somehow regain Beijing’s favor and look to go public again, its valuation will be questioned. Ant will no longer be China’s MasterCard, but merely its PayPal, which has a lower market value. As a longtime observer of Ant, I have often marveled that it ventured to become a public company at all, because it operates in such treacherous regulatory waters. In July, my colleague Anjani Trivedi and I wrote that its IPO would run the risk of exposing how volatile and unsteady China’s financial regulations can be. A blockbuster listing felt almost too good to be true. This isn’t the first time Ant has had a run-in with regulators. The PBOC noticed its flawed lending model as early as 2017. Back then, Ant was packaging consumer loans into asset-backed securities and selling them to institutional investors — often banks. The central bank, worried about the underlying quality of securitized products — which had collapsed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. — called a halt to that practice. So Ant found another way to build its business. Currently, Ant connects banks with consumers, and almost all of the loans it originates sit only on banks’ balance sheets. With China being one of the most indebted nations in the world — its debt-to-GDP ratio is edging close to 300% — the PBOC is justifiably worried about bad loans. By asking Ant to put in a capital buffer itself, as Sunday’s statement implies, the central bank is essentially telling Ma not to get too clever. But why is the PBOC making this public statement now? If only it had published a vaguely worded warning three months earlier, investors and bankers wouldn’t have whipped up such frenzy over Ant’s IPO and come out this disappointed. The fact is, the PBOC does see problems, but often lacks the political capital to do anything about them.Consider the backdrop. Ant first sought a dual listing in July, when China’s tech stocks were staging a bull run, even as the economy struggled to recover from the Covid-19 lockdown. Back then, Beijing was fast-tracking unicorn IPOs, hopeful that a tech infrastructure build-out could stimulate growth. Granted, the PBOC stepped back from open-market operations as early as June, worried that earlier rounds of easing would spur speculative bubbles, but bureaucrats bit their tongues on Ant. President Xi Jinping didn’t want to hear about risk control then. Fast forward to December. China’s economy has recovered, and curtailing debt once again tops Beijing’s economic agenda. The 67-year-old Xi, who is virtually president for life, always wanted to deleverage China, because he doesn’t want a Minsky Moment to blow up during his lifetime. He started that campaign in late 2017 — around the time the PBOC halted Ant’s securitization of its microloans — but got derailed by Donald Trump’s trade war and Covid-19. Now that both hurdles are gone, the risk managers at the PBOC have found their voice. Of course, it should come as no surprise that China’s central bank lacks independence. But that trait matters to global investors, who have piled into China this year because it’s the only major economy growing in the pandemic era. Ant is a good reminder that Beijing’s politics matter. A vaguely worded statement after years of inaction can wipe out billions of dollars in a blink. Ma’s fiasco has turned into a farce, just as ESG investing turned a corner and became a major trend this year. For all the big investment houses rushing to enter China, it’s perhaps time to step back and ask: is the country really ready for the global stage?(Updates in fifth paragraph with effect of the People’s Bank of China’s statement on the shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.)This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2020-12-27	2020-12-27 23:00:20	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	A Data-Driven End to Capitalism as We Know It	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- From interest rates to fashion, pandemics in the past — like the Black Death in the 14th century — have left deep imprints on economic life. This time may be no different. In the aftermath of the coronavirus, governments can reimagine capitalism by giving all of us a stake in the most valuable byproduct of our day-to-day living: data. But make no mistake. It will still be a Faustian bargain. A global data profit will be a very different GDP from gross domestic product. The case for technology companies to share it with we, the people who supply them the bits and bytes, is compelling. In fact, it could even emerge as a better universal basic income — another revolutionary concept whose time may have come — for the post-Covid world.A state-provided allowance can improve citizens’ well-being, a widely studied Finnish experiment has shown. Yet only a small group of developed countries would even have a chance of sustaining a meaningful subsidy, provided taxpayers agree. Most developing nations would balk at the expense. Inequality between the global North and South would worsen.This is where a share of global data profit for the 63% of the world population that’s already online could prove helpful. The FANG quartet — Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. — garners $140 billion in combined operating earnings. China’s BAT trinity of Baidu Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. hauls in another $50 billion. Throw in device makers like Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Xiaomi Corp., payment processors like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., and Paypal Holdings Inc., and the available profit pie of our data overlords is at least $350 billion. Their combined revenue is in excess of $1.3 trillion.The arrival of 5G telecommunications networks and Internet of Things, plus rapid growth of new-age fintech players like China’s Ant Group Co., India’s Jio Platforms Ltd., and Southeast Asia’s Grab Holdings Ltd. and Gojek, will see the industry’s profit exceed $1 trillion well before the end of the decade. Even now, governments shouldn’t mind tapping companies that for the most part did well out of the pandemic to put some extra money in the hands of citizens left poorer and jaded by it. The problem is that Big Tech is notorious for moving profits to where they’re taxed least. There has to be a better way to take it back from them. One powerful suggestion has come from Columbia Law School Professor Katharina Pistor. In a recent paper, she argued that it will be useless for us, as information producers, to get authorship rights on our individual raw data. They have very little value. Yet, when algorithms analyze billions of data points, they glean insights about our behavior. Big Tech shares the intelligence for a profit with providers of goods and services, who then use the knowledge to influence our choices as consumers and make a further gain.Instead of being participants in a free market, this power game makes us victims, twice over.  No notice-and-consent privacy law or antitrust regulation can improve our bargaining position. We need partial ownership not of the data, but the databases. Put another way, if technology has made it our destiny to be “ruled by data,” then we must have rights in a depository trust of data. Pistor explains:This trust would have a right to a share in the earnings the company derived from the data and would have the task of channeling these earnings to the data producers. The trust would also exercise voting rights on behalf of the data producers.The argument hinges on debunking a popular myth: Our information footprints, the professor says, are not oil, or anything resembling a regular commodity or asset. Beyond seeking protection against hacking, the technology industry hasn’t relied on legal protection to assert its property rights. It has simply captured data as “res nullius,” or wild animals, and enjoyed supernormal profits. It’s time governments ended the ambiguity over ownership, and gave data the status of “res communis,” or community property. This is what a depository achieves. To be sure, no governments are actually considering this yet. But imagine the shakeup to power in Big Tech and people’s sense of ownership in society if political authorities tried to resolve what University of Westminster sociologist Christian Fuchs sees as a Marxian “antagonism between digital commons and digital commodities.” There are two questions. First, how would the depository pass on pro-rated dividends it receives from harvesters to producers? Second, would China come on board with the plan, or would this profit sharing end up being a permanent drag only on Western tech?The answers may be interlinked. The last-minute quashing of Ant’s initial public offering and the regulator’s order that the fintech behemoth return to its roots as a payment services provider have been the strongest signal yet of Beijing’s intention to rein in the rising power of its data czars. But that’s not the end of it. Eventually, all major central banks will issue widely distributed digital currencies, emulating an experiment already under way in China. The anonymity of cash will disappear sometime during the decade. It’s conceivable, therefore, that dividends from data depositories could simply hit official digital currency wallets on our mobile phones. In the process of spending, we’ll be leaving a data trail for central banks.Europe after the Black Death was hit by a wave of “life is short” consumerism. After this year’s trauma, we, too, are yearning for a vaccine and a more carefree 2021. But can we, as producers, consumers, and people, ever be fully rid of the scars? Even if we want to forget, will governments let us drop our guards? The rise of contact tracing during the pandemic has introduced us, willingly or otherwise, to the idea that our smartphones can keep us safe — by spying on us.Sacrificing some more of our freedom to eternal state surveillance could become a deal with a devil we’re growing to know only too well. We’ll take it, but only if technology gets us a real stake in 21st-century capitalism in return.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

It has been the exact opposite on Wall Street because stocks are still setting new records despite all of this year’s madness. There have been tremendous winners and among them is Square (NYSE:SQ) stock, which we will discuss today.

Usually there is a small group of stocks that trade with a lot of momentum. When they rally, they do it so hard that it makes them impossible to buy with conviction. This year, that group is huge, including a slew of special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) in the electric vehicle sector. Just yesterday, we saw an explosion in them because of the rumor that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wants to produce a self-driving EV by 2024.
Given all the general hype on the market lately, a key question arises for SQ investors. Is it appropriate to buy Square stock, even at these altitudes?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
There isn’t one clear answer for all investors. The decision to buy a stock depends on several factors. The first is your timeline. How long you are looking to hold a stock will play a big role in the decision. If the goal is to invest in SQ for years, then it’s fine to buy a partial position now. A few bucks above or below are not going to matter much. Otherwise, this is not an obvious starting point for new buyers.
Square Stock Is Already a Super Star
Source: Charts by TradingView

Year-to-date it has already rallied over 280%, so the easy work is done. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), which has also had a good year, is only up 125% for the same period. Square stock has outperformed its cohort by at least a double and is up 20 times more than the S&P 500. Such performance is hard to maintain for the short term.

Looking at the chart for SQ, we can clearly see an ascending channel with a steep slope. It is currently skirting the upper edges of it, so logic dictates that it should revert to the mean soon. This does not suggest that it will collapse because it has several lines of support along the way. It would be perfectly normal for it to fall 10% and still remain a very bullish chart. $220 per share would be the first available pivot point with another one $20 lower.
I would not expect catastrophe unless the entire market corrects. Even if it collapses, it would make for an unbelievable opportunity to initiate or double down near $185 per share. I am by no means calling for that price to happen all by itself. Management has worked hard at positioning the company right for the future. Square and PayPal quietly outsmarted the legacy credit card companies Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). They are quickly becoming the way people want to transact financially.
The novel coronavirus pandemic forced the world to seek electronic ways of transferring money while quarantining. Square was there and even made it possible for deposits to happen. Then bitcoin entered the fray with its incredible rally this year. Much to the chagrin of the naysayers, bitcoin broke through $24,000, crushing the prior high of 2017. Square has benefited from the rally because they have their finger on that pulse already. Any which way you slice it, this company is ready to take financial transactions to the next level. It can even create its own ecosphere for other business ventures in e-commerce.
Square Is Cheap
Most traditional investors see the ramp in a stock like this and immediately judge it as expensive. I contend that this is a perfect example of where value is in the eye of the beholder. This is absolutely a growth company because it almost quintupled its revenues in four years. Growth like this cannot come cheaply, so it’s okay for the company overspend. Besides, their net income went from a $172 million loss in 2016 to a trailing-12-months $311 million profit. I fail to see why critics find fault in that.
Statistically, SQ has a price-to-sales ratio of 15x, which is is four points higher than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and nine points lower than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). It is not outrageous by any means, even if the price-to-earnings ratio is 382x. Once again I stress the fact that “cheap” is not what investors should seek in a growth stock. Just ask those who shorted Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for a decade on that notion. Shorting a high P/E for companies like this is a recipe for disaster for the bears.
Only time will tell if they’re worth the effort. Meanwhile, investors should give them the benefit of the doubt. We circle around to the original question if it’s appropriate to buy the stock now, the answer is yes. However, investors have to acknowledge the potential for 10% dips in such a steep rising wedge chart. Therefore, it is definitely not appropriate to take a full-sized position all at once. I would prefer to buy it on dips.

Leave Room for Error
If I use options, I can do that now and leave room for error. For example, an investor can sell the Feb $185 put and collect $2.5 per contract. This means that they would retain maximum profits even if the stock falls 25% from current levels. The break-even on such a trade would be $182.5 per share.
Buying shares in a stock requires homework, and a thesis. From those two elements, investors gain conviction. In this case, I am confident that if the markets are higher in the future, Square stock will be leading it. I am absolutely not confident that I would be picking the perfect entry point if I buy it today.

2020-12-23	2020-12-23 14:30:31	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Baillie's Slater Explains How to Beat the S&P 500	"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- How does one outperform the S&P 500 Index by more than 10 percentage points? For Tom Slater, this week’s guest on the Masters in Business podcast and head of the U.S. equities team and long-term growth portfolios at investment firm Baillie Gifford & Co., the answer is ""growth at an unreasonable price."" The U.K.-based firm manages about $324 billion. Slater helps run the firm’s Long Term Global Growth portfolios and the U.S. Equity Growth Fund, which is up 135% this year.Slater explains how only 4% of stocks account for almost all equity returns. This has three major ramifications for fund managers. The first is a mandate to identify those few candidates that can be “winner take all” companies. Slater’s top holdings include many of those firms, such as Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Shopify Inc., Zoom Video Communications Inc., Netflix Inc., Alphabet Inc., Chegg Inc. and Mastercard Inc.The second is how this impacts the discipline around the decision of when to sell, forcing fund managers to think even longer term than they normally tend to do. Third, a successful fund needs clients who exhibit patience and are willing to ride out normal periods of volatility and weaker returns. Slater also explains why a concentrated portfolio is more likely to outperform than one that resembles an index fund.A list of his favorite books are here; A transcript of our conversation is available here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras on iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher, Google, Bloomberg, and Acast.

National Center on Sexual Exploitation had met with Visa and Mastercard earlier this year and urged them to stop processing payments to Pornhub. Diane Hawkins, senior vice president and executive director with the organization, said, ""we are grateful that both companies will make these significant changes."" AP reports that Pornhub called the action ""exceptionally disappointing"" in a statement. ""This news is crushing for the hundreds of thousands of models who rely on our platform for their livelihoods,"" it added.Reportedly, two days ago, Pornhub announced steps to protect against images of abuse, nonconsensual activity, and underage models on the site.Victims rights lawyer Carrie Goldberg said in a statement on Twitter that the scrutiny on hosting material related to sexual violence and child abuse needs to extend to major platforms like those of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB).""For every [one] case involving a rape tape on Pornhub, I have 50 involving rape and CSAM being disseminated on [Instagram] and FB,"" Goldberg tweeted.""Pornhub is far from perfect. But mainstream big tech is far worse and have a built-in mechanism for harassing victims directly.""Price Action: On Thursday, MA shares closed lower by 1.58% at $331.52, V shares were down by 0.94% at $207.61.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * French Privacy Watchdog Fines Google, Amazon 3M Over Cookie Management: Bloomberg  * Asia Slips, Europe Steady After Nasdaq's Fall, Stimulus Deadlock(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Kristof argued that Pornhub doesn’t adequately block content depicting violence and allows videos to be downloaded from its site, which means that material can spread even after it’s removed.Mastercard said Saturday that it doesn’t tolerate illegal activity on its payment network, and that it’s reviewing ties to MindGeek. Visa’s review was reported Sunday by the Associated Press.Pornhub said any assertion that it allows child sexual-abuse material is untrue. The site is “unequivocally committed to combating” the content and has implemented an “industry-leading trust and safety policy to identify and eradicate illegal material,” Pornhub said in a statement.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-joins-mastercard-pornhub-review-150437262.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-27	2020-11-27 14:58:07	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	A Look Into Mastercard's Price Over Earnings	In the current market session, Mastercard Inc. (NYSE: MA) is trading at $340.91, after a 0.20% drop. However, over the past month, the stock increased by 18.04%, and in the past year, by 18.93%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently under from its 52 week high by 7.17%.  The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. View more earnings on MADepending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Mastercard Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 78.09 of the IT Services industry.

2020-11-26	2020-11-26 17:32:09	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Bitcoin Plunges Along With Other Coins	(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin plunged on Thursday in a sell-off that saw other digital assets fall more than 20%, a slide likely to stoke speculation about the durability of the latest boom in cryptocurrencies.The largest token fell as much as 14% in Thursday trading, heading for one of its worst days since the pandemic-spurred liquidation in March.The rout began just hours after Bitcoin rose to within $7 of its record high of $19,511, the culmination of a more than 250% surge in past nine months. Fears over tighter crypto regulation and profit-taking after a frenetic rally were among the reasons cited for the sudden drop.The sell-off gathered pace late Wednesday after Coinbase Inc. Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong tweeted about speculation the U.S. is considering new rules that would undermine anonymity in digital transactions.“News that the Trump administration may clamp down on crypto might have been a trigger for the drop,” said Antoni Trenchev, managing partner of Nexo in London, which bills itself as the world’s biggest digital-coin lender. “But any asset that rallies 75% in 2 months and 260% from the March lows is allowed to undergo a correction.”Other coins including XRP tumbled as much as 27%, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.After garnering more support from Wall Street money managers and fund providers, the rally in cryptocurrencies had looked over-heated. The fierce retreat could stir yet another debate over the their value in diversifying portfolios.“Conditions are very massively overbought and bound for a correction,” said Vijay Ayyar, head of business development with crypto exchange Luno in Singapore. “So I don’t think it’s unusual.”Crypto believers tout purchases by retail investors, institutions and even billionaires, as well as the search for a hedge against dollar weakness amid the pandemic, as reasons why the boom can last.Skeptics argue the cryptocurrency’s famed volatility portends a repeat of what happened three years ago, when a bubble burst spectacularly. Some see signs of retail investors piling in to chase momentum for fast gains, storing up an inevitable reckoning.Concern about potential U.S. crypto rules help explain Thursday’s price drop across most major digital assets, said Ryan Rabaglia, global head of trading at OSL brokerage in Hong Kong.“It’s also not unusual to see a short-term pullback following periods of significant, accelerated gains as traders look to take profits before resetting once volatility subsides,” he said. “Once the dust settles, we’re back to business as usual with all medium to long-term bullish indicators still in play.”Proponents of digital assets say the current focus on cryptocurrencies compared with three years ago is different because of growing institutional interest, for instance from the likes of Fidelity Investments and JPMorgan Chase & Co.Just this week, Van Eck Associates Corp. launched a Bitcoin exchange-traded note on the Deutsche Boerse Xetra exchange. In October, PayPal Holdings Inc. said it would allow its customers access to cryptocurrencies.There is also a buzz around Ethereum, the most-actively used blockchain in the world, which is set for a network upgrade that would allow it to process a similar number of transactions as Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. The shift to the new system could curb the total supply of Ether, whose price has quadrupled so far this year.Luno’s Ayyar said he expects Bitcoin to stabilize and achieve all-time highs. But that would be followed by a larger drop in the cryptocurrency, he said.Soravis Srinawakoon, chief executive of Bangkok-based Band Protocol, said the plunge in crypto was healthy.“This is just a normal pull back after seven weeks straight of Bitcoin in the green, due to many people over-leveraging.”(Updates prices)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-plunges-along-other-coins-173209793.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-23	2020-11-23 11:34:36	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	World Leaders Urge Pressing the Pedal on Stimulus: NEF Update	(Bloomberg) -- Hillary Clinton joined corporate chieftains in calling for more U.S. stimulus now as the pandemic threatens hopes for a global recovery. On the second day of the four-day Bloomberg New Economy Forum, the former Secretary of State said Donald Trump’s Covid-19 stimulus had not reached those in the greatest need and that she hoped for an agreement on new relief before the new U.S. Congress takes over in early January.Mastercard Inc. Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga said a fresh batch of U.S. fiscal support is needed as a renewed surge in coronavirus cases threatens to impact consumer spending. Earlier in the day, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde reiterated that her institution will “recalibrate” its stimulus in December, widely understood as meaning it will add more monetary support for the economy.In a panel on cities, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is keen to attract foreign investment to modernize the country’s urban centers following the pandemic. Top CEOs including Anheuser-Busch InBev’s Carlos Brito, Unilever’s Alan Jope, HSBC Holdings’ Noel Quinn and BlackRock Inc.’s Larry Fink are scheduled to discuss green investment on the third day of the New Economy Forum, which is organized by Bloomberg Media Group, a division of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.Hillary Clinton Says Covid-19 Stimulus ‘Not Sufficient’ (11:09 a.m. HKT)“The original stimulus post-Covid was not sufficient,” Clinton, the former Democratic presidential nominee said on the Bloomberg New Economy Forum’s “Financing the ‘Real’ Economy” panel. “It really did not reach those people -- either the employees or the small businesses -- that were in the greatest need.”Clinton also said there had been “quite a disturbing action by the Chinese government with respect to Alibaba and Ant,” without elaborating. Beijing in recent weeks has sought to curb the influence of major corporations like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and suspended Ant Group Co.’s $35 billion initial public offering.Ultimately, Clinton said, “even China is going to have to sell into and work within a global economy and we need to reestablish new standards to replace the standards of the past.” -- Karen LeighAirAsia Focusing on Domestic Travel Markets for Next 3-6 Months (10:17 a.m. HKT)AirAsia Group is “doubling down” in the Asean region as domestic travel recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, AirAsia.com CEO Karen Chan said at the New Economy Forum. AirAsia is confident about a recovery in travel, led by Asia, and the airline is selling passes for unlimited travel within its networks for a certain period in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, she said. -- Kyunghee ParkCarnival CEO Says Not Worried About Demand for Cruises (9:44 a.m. HKT)While travelers are trickling off of airplanes and into hotels, the cruise industry is keeping ships ashore as it grapples with the challenge of keeping passengers safe, said Carnival Corp. CEO Arnold Donald. Business will bounce back once those problems are solved, he said.“We’re not worried about demand, and we’re not worried ability to price to attract people,” Donald said. “We need to make certain that we’re able to sail safely again, and that the destinations are comfortable.” -- Patrick ClarkMastercard’s Banga Calls for New Fiscal Stimulus Quickly (9:41 a.m. HKT)Mastercard Inc. Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga said at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum a fresh batch of U.S. fiscal support is needed as a renewed surge in coronavirus cases threatens to impact consumer spending.“We need the fiscal stimulus and we need it relatively quickly,” he said. “Because I can see where the second wave is coming. You can see consumer spending beginning to get impacted again.”He said that consumer spending now is in “relatively good shape” and that companies have reached a form of “normalization” amid the virus. “It’s a new normal,” he said. “We’re not really doing the things we used to.”Nevertheless, he said there will likely be an economic recovery in the second half of next year, returning to a “pre-Covid kind of stage” as vaccines are widely distributed. -- Dan Reichl, Jonas BergmanWorst Over for Indonesia, Weak Consumption a Hurdle: Indrawati (9:22 a.m. HKT)While Indonesia is past the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, risks remain and weak consumer confidence is a major hurdle to reviving businesses and growth, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said at the New Economy Forum. Southeast Asia’s biggest economy probably saw the deepest impact from the virus in the second quarter and a rebound in the third quarter, but “we still need to be very careful” as the virus is flaring up again in some countries, she said. -- Claire JiaoTokyo Steps Up Efforts to Lure Businesses (8:23 a.m. HKT)Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said her government has bolstered its push to attract international businesses looking to expand operations to the Japanese capital from Hong Kong.Tokyo’s government set up an office in Hong Kong last month to help companies make the change. The push comes after a new security law imposed on Hong Kong by China earlier this year has raised question about the city’s autonomy. -- Isabel ReynoldsChina Ex-State Planner Calls for Green Development Focus (8:10 a.m. HKT)The world needs to join forces in order to achieve sustainable development in the post-virus era, said Zhang Xiaoqiang, a former vice-chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, the nation’s economic planning agency. In opening remarks to the NEF, Zhang said efforts should be made in areas such as maintaining an open world economy, investing in green development and digital transformation, as well as enhancing support for small and medium sized enterprises. -- Lin ZhuECB’s Lagarde Sees Risk of ‘Financial Spillover’ (1 p.m. NYT)European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned that a key challenge facing policy makers is to stop the current economic crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic morphing into a financial crisis.A “risk I see is that potential financial spillover, which we managed to avoid so far,” Lagarde said at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum on Tuesday. “We need to stay really clear of that because that would be an aggravating factor.”New lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus have put the euro zone on the verge of another slump as winter starts. While the prospect of effective vaccines soon is encouraging, they’ll come too late to avoid more economic damage.Lagarde signaled that policy makers expect to focus on their 1.35 trillion-euro ($1.6 trillion) emergency bond-buying program and their long-term bank loans as the main tools. Investors see an interest rate cut unlikely. — Paul GordonAtlanta Mayor Maps Path to Recovery From Pandemic (12 p.m. NYT)Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said that the Georgia city has developed a roadmap for recovery as it struggled with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the number of people and businesses that need assistance is substantial and growing.“It’s going to be relevant to many more people who didn’t expect to see themselves in this position,” Bottoms said during a Bloomberg New Economy Forum panel on Tuesday. “There’s going to be a large economic impact that will likely last for years.”The mayor of the southeastern U.S. city said that the combination of the virus and social unrest “made us focus on what our goals were.” Affordable housing, jobs and funding for economic development projects are priorities of Atlanta’s plan. As the pandemic continues, Bottoms said she believes that the region’s technology sector will prove resilient, but other areas of the local economy, such as the many small minority-owned businesses at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, will need more assistance to recover. Many airline workers have been furloughed and passenger traffic is down substantially. — Brett PulleyCoronavirus Pandemic Is an ‘Attack on Humanity’ (11:20 a.m. NYT)Efficient government involvement during the coronavirus pandemic is key in controlling this public health crisis, Mohamed Alabbar, chairman of Dubai-based real estate company Emaar Properties, said during the Bloomberg New Economy Forum on Tuesday.“Leadership is so critical,” Alabbar said. Since the spread of the pandemic, which he described as an “attack on humanity,” the United Arab Emirates, where Dubai is located, has been “very serious about managing its affairs.” — Abeer Abu OmarWith Covid Under Control, Travel Recovers in China (10:50 a.m. NYT)In China, the travel and transportation industries are showing signs of life as the coronavirus pandemic heads toward the end of its first year.Jean Liu, president of Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing Inc., said in a panel at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum. That business fell “off a cliff” when the pandemic started in January and February. But Liu gradually saw a recovery in April, and Didi is now racking up 60 million rides every day. “Right now we are fully back,” she said.Liu said she is most proud of the initiative her company came up with to shuttle healthcare workers around the city when there was no public transportation. Around 140,000 drivers volunteered, she said.Neil Shen, founding and managing partner at Sequoia Capital China, sees “travel coming back pretty quickly” in China. “The good thing is Covid is well under control,” he said. —Isabelle Lee‘15-Minute Cities’ Can Speed the Urban Comeback (10 a.m. NYT)Covid-19 has devastated communities across the globe, but as with disease outbreaks of the past, cities can not only survive but see themselves transformed for the better.“In every crisis there is also an opportunity,” Lord Mayor Hazel Chu of Dublin said in a panel at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum. Dublin, Chu said, has been rolling out a series of transportation improvements in light of the pandemic to help people move around. Among the ideas the city is pursuing is the establishment of a “15-minute city,” in which the needs of all residents can be met within a walking or biking system.But it’s critical to prevent the 15-minute concept from becoming a “bubble” for wealthy citizens, Chu said: The Covid crisis is also exposing the deep inequalities inside cities, and accelerated the need for healthier buildings, more efficient public transit to prevent crowding, and better integration among communities of different socioeconomic backgrounds. — Linda PoonIndia’s Modi Seeks Funding to Build Smart Cities (9 a.m. NYT)Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is keen to attract foreign investment to modernize India’s urban centers following the coronavirus pandemic.Covid-19 has given governments the chance to accelerate the “process of making cities more livable for people,” Modi said in his speech on Tuesday. “We are looking at a future where a major chunk of education, healthcare, shopping, may happen online. Our cities need to be ready for the convergence of the physical and digital worlds.”India, the world’s second-most populous nation, has completed work on two-thirds of its $30 billion of planned projects to build 100 smart cities, Modi said. —Archana Chaudhary and Bibhudatta Pradhan(Corrects comment from Neil Shen to clarify timeline)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-leaders-urge-pressing-pedal-034511584.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-03	2020-11-03 08:05:59	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	That Pricey Buyout Now Looks Like a Bargain	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It looked like proof that private equity had more money than sense — a pricey $6 billion consortium deal for Nordic payments group Nets A/S led by Hellman & Friedman in late 2017. The transaction may yet prove the naysayers wrong.At the time, Hellman & Friedman Chief Executive Officer Patrick Healy told the Financial Times the buyout firm had paid more than it wanted to, but “that’s what was required to get the deal done.” Three years on and Italian payments peer Nexi SpA is in talks to buy Nets in exchange for a stake in the enlarged company, taking it public for the second time in five years.Nexi says it would value Nets on an equivalent multiple of 2020 expected Ebitda. Its own multiple was nearly 18 times as of Friday but has been higher in recent months. On that basis, Nets would be worth around 7.2 billion euros ($8.4 billion) assuming its roughly 400 million euros of Ebitda last year has held firm. Deduct net debt and the equity is then worth around 5.4 billion euros.The Hellman & Friedman consortium wouldn’t get all that value. Nets bought another payments group, Concardis, for stock in 2019. Assume that diluted the original private equity owners to an 80% holding and their share of the value from a Nexi tie-up would be worth around 4.3 billion euros. Still, the equity in the original buyout was just 2.7 billion euros, a Nets bondholder presentation suggests. If no other money has gone in or out since, the annualized returns would be running in the high-teens percent.Those gains partly reflect the fact that Hellman & Friedman is selling Nets on a higher multiple of profit than it originally paid. No buyout baron should ever bet on achieving that. Even so, the reality is that listed payments groups trade on stronger profit multiples now than they did three years ago. Leverage amplifies the effect.Did Hellman & Friedman add any value itself? Its overhaul of the business isn’t immediately apparent in revenue and Ebitda numbers that look barely changed from 2017. But the private equity owners added capabilities Nets lacked, in mobile payments and analytics, and expanded its footprint with the acquisition in Germany. A subscale division was sold to Mastercard Inc. Without this re-jigging, Nets would have arguably been a less desirable partner, too narrow in its services and its geographical presence.The final returns will emerge over time whenever the consortium chooses to sell down. The realization of the touted financial benefits of a Nexi merger — an unitemized 150 million euros annually — would provide some extra uplift. Public-market investors in Nets will be wondering if they shouldn’t have sold. But it didn’t feel that way at the time, and it’s not clear they would have endorsed the strategy and leverage that private equity brought to bear here. As things stand, Healy looks set to claim vindication.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

2020-10-29	2020-10-29 07:58:03	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard Dips 8% As 3Q Profit Disappoints; Street Sticks To Buy	Shares of Mastercard fell 8.1% on Wednesday after its 3Q earnings of $1.60 decreased 26% year-over-year and lagged the Street estimates of $1.66, due to weak travel spending amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The payments processor's 3Q revenues of $3.8 billion missed analysts’ expectations of $3.95 billion and declined 14% from the year-ago quarter.Mastercard (MA) reported gross dollar volume growth of 1% year-over-year, on a local currency, while cross-border volume declined 36% year-over-year. Switched transactions grew 5% in 3Q from the year-ago quarter.Mastercard’s CEO Ajay Banga said during the earnings call that “we have seen some improvement in domestic travels in the quarter including spending in categories such as lodging and restaurant. Cross-border travel however remains constrained.” He added “while we have seen some improvement in travel within the EU [European Union] during the quarter, cross-border travel outside the EU has shown only limited recovery.”Banga commented that cross-border travel is improving, but full recovery is “going to take some time, and it will be positively impacted by the broad availability of successful therapeutics and vaccines.” (See MA stock analysis on TipRanks).Following the results, Raymond James analyst John Davis maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $345 (18.4% upside potential) on the stock. The analyst said “despite the cross-border headwind, we expect MA to come out the other side of COVID a winner as the pandemic has accelerated the shift to contactless and e-commerce.”Davis, cautioned though that “until we receive a vaccine or some therapeutic, cross-border will continue to be a drag on forward estimates as volumes take longer than originally estimated to recover.” He recommends to buy the stock over the longer-term as “there are few better assets from both a competitive moat and earnings compounding perspective.”Currently, the Street has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus is based on 21 Buys and 3 Holds. The average price target of $368.50 implies upside potential of about 26.5% to current levels. Shares have declined by about 2.4% year-to-date.Related News:  Mastercard, ACI Worldwide Team Up On Real-Time Payment Solutions  eBay Slips 4% As Online Goods Growth Volume Slows  Pinterest’s Blowout 3Q Sends Shares Up 32% More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Wyndham’s 3Q Sales Plunge 40%; Street Says Buy   * Eli Lilly Strikes $375M Covid-19 Antibody Supply Deal With US Government   * Bed Bath & Beyond Down 12% As 3-Year Plan Fails To Impress Investors   * Sanofi, Merck Join Forces On Ketruda, THOR-707 Combo In Cancer	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-dips-8-3q-profit-075803204.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-10-29	2020-10-29 06:27:49	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa, Mastercard Earnings Hit By Lack Of Cross-Border Transactions	Visa Inc (NYSE: V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) earnings on Wednesday failed to impress, as the American shopper held back from spending in the middle of the pandemic, the Financial Times reports.Both Visa and Mastercard reported a year-over-year revenue decline -- at 16.9% and 14.10%, respectively.What Happened: Total retail spending excluding petrol in the September quarter remained in the low growth mode, rising 1.8% YoY, according to Mastercard.Total domestic spending on Mastercard and Visa network grew 4% and 7.5%, respectively -- unchanged since summer.Moffett Nathanson payments analyst Lisa Ellis said that total spending volumes were weaker than expected but called Visa's earnings better than Mastercard. The former has more exposure to the U.S. and debit cards, FT reports.The revenue declines for both companies resulted from a lack of higher fees for cross-border transactions, as global travel remains limited.View more earnings on VMastercard reported a 36% YoY drop in cross-border transactions while Visa reported a 29% YoY decline.Wolfe Research analyst Darrin Peller had anticipated stronger earnings from both companies considering the pandemic-driven rise in electronic transactions. Still, the earnings showed how cross-border transactions affect the entire business. Why It Matters: Mastercard Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra ties the return of cross-border transactions to vaccines and therapeutics' availability.Mehra remarked on the company conference call that personal travel will bounce back faster than business travel.According to Mastercard President Michael Miebach, contactless payments are growing in popularity with 41% penetration of in-person purchase transactions.Miebach expects e-commerce spending to remain elevated from pre-pandemic levels due to altering consumer payment behavior, reports the Wall Street Journal.V, MA Price Action: Visa shares declined 4.8% to $180.87, and MA shares fell 8.11% to $291.38 on Wednesday's close.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * European Markets Today: Stocks Hit Lows On Rising Coronavirus Fears  * China EVs Are Catching Up With Tesla(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The new Mastercard campaign seeks to support consumers and small businesses as they return to a new normal.MIAMI, Oct. 08, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Latin America and the Caribbean are entering a new reality: many countries are reopening their borders, governments are easing distance measures, and non-essential businesses are opening to the public again.During this new phase, Mastercard announced its new regional campaign, “Lo Esencial” (The Essentials) to highlight those everyday moments that became essential after COVID-19. The campaign will provide consumers and local businesses with safe shopping experiences, tools, and education that help fulfill their everyday needs.To develop this initiative, Mastercard conducted a survey in 13 countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean including, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Argentina, and Peru, to better understand consumption and purchase habits after the period of confinement.According to the “Lo Esencial” survey, 67% of Latin Americans surveyed said they have a greater appreciation for their family than before the quarantine. The survey also highlights an increased awareness of other essentials such as health (47%), taking personal time (41%), mental health (32%), and spending time with friends (26%).As consumers engage in their return to a new normal, 6 out of 10 people (57%) plan to invest in the quality of their family experiences. Additionally, 46% of Latin Americans indicated their wish to support local businesses more in this return phase, than before the pandemic.In terms of payment experiences, for purchases made in person as well as online, the essentials cited by consumers include, security (59%), speed (23%), and convenience (17%). Purchases with chip cards and contactless payments were the most popular options for payment. Furthermore, 62% of Latin Americans stated that they used a home shopping service during the quarantine. In fact, almost half of them (46%) said that they would continue to use this service in the future.As a leader in the payments industry, Mastercard is committed to developing a global technology infrastructure and use its brand strength to positively impact society with safer, faster, and more efficient payment experiences. This new regional campaign reflects this commitment and seeks to highlight everyday moments that have become “The Essentials” (Lo Esencial) in the aftermath of the pandemic. The campaign will continue to provide unique shopping experiences, relevant consumer education, and tools to help society thrive.“The pandemic helped us realize the importance of the everyday moments we lost and grew to miss as we all did our part to stay at home. The experience associated with getting our morning coffee, or meeting up with friends have a renewed level of appreciation, and the ability to recover these essential moments today is priceless,” said Roberto Ramirez Laverde, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications for Mastercard Latin America and the Caribbean. “This campaign seeks to help individuals welcome a new normal with a new sense of gratitude while also helping consumers and small businesses make them a reality as part of our role as the strategic partner for local businesses.”About Mastercard (NYSE: MA), www.mastercard.com  Mastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry.

2020-10-08	2020-10-08 11:42:40	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	White House Curbs on Chinese Payment Apps Pose Risk to Ant	(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration’s potential restrictions on two Chinese payments giants would reverberate far beyond politics, potentially affecting multibillion-dollar deals, shaking up international commerce and even shaping the evolution of the global financial system.U.S. officials have stepped up behind-the-scenes talks in recent weeks about possibly restricting the expansion of Ant Group’s Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat Pay over concerns that the digital-payment platforms threaten national security, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.If the administration proceeds, the most immediate hit would be to Ant Group’s plan for a stock listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong, a deal that could rank as the world’s largest initial public offering. Some international companies have been working with the payment apps and could see those strategies hurt or derailed. And while restrictions may ultimately head off potent competitors to U.S. and European banks, it could also -- depending on how China responds -- thwart their own planned expansion into the world’s second-largest economy.Here’s a breakdown of the many companies with business at stake as President Donald Trump’s administration weighs its decision:Ant’s IPOInvestors have been eager to pile into Jack Ma’s Ant Group. After gauging early interest, the company is seeking to raise at least $35 billion in its IPO, people familiar with the matter have said, potentially topping Saudi Aramco’s record $29 billion sale. Ant lifted the target based on an increased valuation of about $250 billion, which would exceed the market capitalization of Bank of America Corp., the second-largest U.S. lender.Restricting Alipay would cast a pall over the sale. It’s unclear whether U.S. investors would be allowed to buy shares. American funds including Silver Lake Management LLC, Warburg Pincus LLC, and Carlyle Group Inc. already put at least $500 million in the fintech giant in 2018. The sanction also could give pause to non-U.S. funds such as Singapore state investors Temasek Holdings Pte and GIC Pte. -- existing backers that could boost their stakes in the IPO.Ant Group generates the vast majority of its revenue in China. But the Trump administration’s deliberations may at least prompt investors to recalibrate expectations for the payment apps’ international growth.The prospect of someday offering services to U.S. consumers “is a huge shot of adrenaline to the heart of the business,” said David Menlow, president and founder of IPOFinancial.com. Now, investors “will be thinking twice.”U.S. banks Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley are working as sponsors for the IPO in Hong Kong -- which alone could raise about $17.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. It’s unclear how U.S. restrictions would affect the investment banks’ hard-fought relationship with Ant.Global PaymentsFor U.S. officials, the concern is that the growing popularity of Alipay and WeChat Pay internationally gives China unprecedented access to banking and transaction data that could ultimately include personal information on hundreds of millions of Americans. The question is whether authorities in China might raise similar concerns about U.S. firms.Initially, Alipay’s foray into the U.S. focused on places where Chinese consumers visit and shop, such as luxury stores in New York or tourist destinations in California. But last year, things began accelerating as Alipay inked deals with retailers like drugstore chain Walgreens, placing the app’s logo in front of millions more U.S. consumers.At the same time, U.S. payment networks have been pushing into China. In November, Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. announced deals allowing their cards to be added to the WeChat Pay and Alipay wallets -- making it easier for cardholders from outside China to shop on the mainland, where the apps already dominate all forms of commerce.“We will look at any partnerships that we need to according to whatever regulations are in place,” Ann Cairns, Mastercard’s vice chairman, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Our strategy, though, is to have an open system and to work with as many players as we can around the world.”The card networks have longed to expand into China. “I couldn’t be more excited,” Visa Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly told investors in May. There was more progress recently, with American Express Co. getting approval in June to start bank-card clearing services in China.Now, any actions against Alipay or WeChat Pay could spell trouble for the U.S. networks’ ambitions.Investment BanksFor U.S. banks, the news comes with upsides and downsides. American bankers have long feared domestic consumers would one day embrace Chinese-style payment apps, which seamlessly allow people to shop, order takeout, pay bills and manage brokerage accounts using mobile phones. A variety of banks and technology companies have tried and failed to gain the kind of dominance allowing them to head off outside competition.On the other hand, U.S. banks have been eyeing China as fertile ground for revenue growth.Wall Street giants such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan have waited for decades to move into the nation’s $45 trillion financial market. Five top U.S. banks had roughly $70 billion of combined exposure to China in 2019. But even that’s small compared to their ambitions for expansion there.JPMorgan’s joint venture in the region has begun offering brokerage services, investment advisory and underwriting businesses. Goldman has said it wants to take full ownership of its joint venture in China. It hopes to double its workforce in the country as it ramps up asset- and wealth-management offerings.If financial-services firms are dragged into a tit-for-tat between the two countries, it could complicate such strategies and threaten the relationships they have spent years trying to build with giant Chinese companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which owns a one-third stake in Ant.U.S. PartnershipsBrands including Marriott hotels and KFC restaurants in China use Ant’s Alipay superapp, building their own lite apps that can help users book rooms and order food. Asset manager Vanguard Group set up a joint venture with Ant to provide automated financial-advisory services in China. The robo adviser lured more than 100,000 people in the country as of June. Ant is also working with the joint ventures of mutual fund operators such as Invesco Ltd.Still, the Trump administration’s guideline for Tencent’s instant-messaging app WeChat could offer clues to how the U.S. might handle payment platforms. It has allowed U.S. companies to continue working with WeChat outside of the U.S. Alibaba’s shares reflected optimism that Ant’s business would remain mostly insulated, rising 1.4% in the U.S. and trading little changed in Hong Kong.(Updates with Mastercard interview in 13th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-curbs-chinese-apps-211703925.html?.tsrc=rss

(NASDAQ: DNKN) is experimenting with the new and fast-growing self-checkout concept. What Happened: Dunkin is testing a new checkout-free payment system at sports stadiums at a time when consumers demand faster speed of service with less human contact at restaurants, The Wall Street Journal reported. The concept makes use of cameras, scanners and softwares that lets consumers pick what they want in a store and then leave.Dunkin is testing a payment system powered by Mastercard Inc. (NYSE: MA) at undisclosed stores in California that will be rebranded as Dunkin' Dash, according to WSJ. Customers need to register a credit card in advance and they will receive a unique QR code.Why It's Important: The new concept faces some near-term hurdles to overcome, including how to encourage consumers to go through a sign-up process just to enter a store, the report continued. Consumers will need to sign up for each store that uses Mastercard's technology.Retailers are likely to promote campaigns based speed and safety with little to no wait times on entry and exit although this may not be enough. Retailers may be forced to offer customers discounts and other incentives.What's Next: Retailers of all shapes and sizes will likely be closely monitoring current trials from Dunkin and others. The estimated cost of just installing a system is $100,000. The hardware and code setup costs as much as $3 million, brand experience consultant Tim Manning told WSJ.Related Links:Piper Sandler Upgrades Dunkin' Brands: 4 Reasons WhyDunkin, TikTok Star Charli D'Amelio 'Making Their Relationship Official'Courtesy imageSee more from Benzinga  * Cramer Reacts To Johnson & Johnson's Coronavirus Vaccine Update: 'Not A Hype Company'  * 5 Reasons Pivotal Upgrades Twitter To Buy  * 4 Stitch Fix Analysts Unpack Q4 Report As Stock Plunges(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-21	2020-09-21 09:03:51	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard vs Visa: Which Financial Giant Makes A More Compelling Investment?	The pandemic-led lockdowns and social distancing restrictions hurt spending on several discretionary goods, travel, entertainment and fuel, thus impacting payment network giants Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. However, these companies are experiencing improved metrics with the easing of lockdowns.Moreover, the pandemic has created an opportunity for payment networks due to a surge in e-commerce and the preference for contactless payment options. Last month, Mastercard revealed the results of its survey of small businesses across North America and said that 76% of these companies indicated that the pandemic prompted them to become more digital with 82% changing how they send and receive payments.The TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool will help us place Mastercard and Visa alongside each other and see which of these leading payment companies offers a better investment opportunity.Mastercard (MA)Leading financial services company Mastercard has a presence in over 210 countries and serves customers through 2.2 billion Mastercard branded cards and 417 million Maestro cards. COVID-19’s impact on consumer spending reflected in the company’s 2Q revenue, which declined 19% Y/Y to $3.3 billion and led to a 28% decline in adjusted EPS to $1.36.However, one positive aspect in the second quarter was the 12% rise in other revenues to $1.1 billion due to growth in the company’s Cyber and Intelligence as well as Data and Services solutions.As per Mastercard’s 3Q business update, the company is experiencing continued moderate improvements. Notably, switched transactions (reflects the number of transactions initiated, authorized,  cleared and settled through Mastercard network), grew 5% in the week ending August 28 compared to 3% in the week ending July 21. Cross-border volume was down 35% in the week ending August 28 compared to a 40% decline in the week ending July 21.Meanwhile, the company continues to pursue opportunities in priority areas such as open banking, real-time payments, cyber and intelligence Solutions and B2B themes. In June, Mastercard announced an agreement to acquire Finicity, a leading provider of real-time access to financial data and insights, to bolster its open banking platform.Last month, Mastercard expanded its partnership with TransferWise to allow the issuance of cards in any country where Mastercard is accepted and TransferWise is licensed. Mastercard is also enabling checkout-free shopping through the rollout of its Shop Anywhere platform with several retailers from October.Aside from Shop Anywhere, another frictionless solution that that company introduced is the AI Powered Drive Through platform, provided in partnership with SoundHound Inc. and Rekor Systems. This new platform will help fast-food and quick-serve restaurant brands speed up a drive-thru or drive-in interaction through vehicle recognition, voice ordering, and artificial intelligence.Mastercard has also accelerated its Crypto Card Partner Program and has granted Wirex a principal membership license, making it the first native cryptocurrency platform to issue Mastercard payment cards. (See MA stock analysis on TipRanks)On Sept. 11, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a Buy rating for Mastercard, stating “Near term COVID-19 pandemic-driven weakness will be overcome by an acceleration in electronic payment and service adoption, which will drive further acceleration in Business Performance trends.”The Street is also bullish about Mastercard and has a Strong Buy consensus based on 22 Buys, 5 Holds and no Sell ratings. The stock has risen 12% so far this year and a possible upside of 6.8% lies ahead based on the average analyst price target of $358.Visa (V)Visa, the global payments industry leader with a vast presence in over 200 countries, could not escape the COVID-19 led weakness in transactions and posted a 17% decline in its revenue of $4.8 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which ended June 30. Adjusted EPS fell 23% Y/Y to $1.06.Earlier this month, Visa reported a 7% Y/Y rise in its August US payments volume which was slower than the 8% growth in July, reflecting the impact of the expiration of the elevated unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, global processed transactions grew 3% in August compared to a 1% growth in July due to accelerating domestic transactions triggered by the easing of social distancing restrictions. Cross-border volume (excluding intra-Europe transactions) was down 43% in August compared to a 44% fall in July.Meanwhile, Visa is capturing the demand for contactless payments amid the COVID outbreak through its tap-to-pay solutions. In the US alone, Visa added over 80 million contactless cards in the first six months of this year. It expects tap-to-pay to accelerate post-COVID when consumers start going back to the office and conduct smaller transactions for their commute, pay transit fares, and buy food and drinks.Also, the rapid shift to e-commerce works well for Visa as its share of digital commerce is about three times greater than the physical point of sale.The company has been entering into strategic partnerships to expand in key growth areas. It has partnered with UK-based fintech Conferma Pay to integrate Visa virtual cards in the Conferma Pay mobile app. The collaboration will allow companies to provision virtual Visa commercial cards to employees' digital wallets, enabling tap-to-pay and simplify expense reimbursement.In January, Visa announced a $5.3 billion agreement to acquire fintech Plaid, which has products that enable consumers to share their financial information with many apps and services such as Acorns, Betterment, Chime, Transferwise and Venmo. Visa expects to complete this deal by the year-end.To capitalize on the accelerated shift to digital payments amid the pandemic, Visa recently extended its global partnership with PayPal. The expanded partnership will enable consumers and small businesses to move their money faster through PayPal and Visa Direct capabilities. (See V stock analysis on TipRanks)Last month, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev initiated coverage of Visa with a Buy rating and a price target of $250. The analyst believes that card penetration is the key driver of Visa's volume growth, and channel work points to accelerating card penetration and a boost to US volume growth. He also believes that the long-term stability of the company's &quot;best-in-class&quot; terminal margins should merit mid-teens revenue multiples.Likewise, the Street is bullish about Visa with 16 Buys, 2 Holds and no Sell ratings adding to a Strong Buy consensus. The stock has risen about 8% year-to-date and the average analyst price target of $222.33 reflects an upside potential of 10% in the coming months.The better financial playBoth Mastercard and Visa have strong business models that stand to benefit in the digital world. They are on the path to recovery as economies are reopening- though COVID-related impact on travel and other businesses continues to be a major drag on cross-border volumes.Mastercard has a dividend yield of 0.48% compared to Visa’s yield of 0.59%. Moreover, a lower valuation multiple and higher upside potential ahead as indicated by the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool make Visa a more attractive investment currently.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-09-16	2020-09-16 00:00:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	The Argus Dividend Growth Portfolio	Often overlooked amid the market's gyrations, dividend income is an important element of total return. Consider recent results: in 2015, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 1.4%, including dividends -- but excluding dividends, the market was down 0.7%. Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors. And dividend payments softened the blow in 2018, when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks, particularly in a slow-growth or recessionary economic environment.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ee2cb308-3324-39c8-b0ae-47798c9d8c19/the-argus-dividend-growth.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-09	2020-09-09 06:21:07	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard Sees Continued Improvement In August; RBC Says Buy	Mastercard (MA) has now updated its operating metrics through the week ending August 28, revealing continued modest improvements. Switched transactions increased +5% y/y vs. +3% y/y. That’s thanks to the relaxing of social distancing measures, partially offset by the expiration of US elevated unemployment benefits.According to MA, most markets are in the Normalization phase domestically. This phase occurs when social distancing and mobility limitations are relaxed and spending begins to gradually recover, says Mastercard, with some sectors recovering faster than others.“In particular, we are seeing continued improvement in travel and entertainment related categories such as lodging, restaurants, auto rental and gas” says the company, adding that its Switched Volume growth rates excluding travel and entertainment are now similar to pre-pandemic levels.From a geographic perspective, the US was relatively stable with volume up +5% y/y in the last week of August vs. +5% in the last week of July, while Worldwide (ex-US) was +1% y/y vs. down (3%) y/y previously.Meanwhile Cross-Border Volumes declined (35%) y/y in the week ending August 28, slightly better than the (40%) y/y reported for the week ending July 21. Management noted improvement in every region, with intra-European travel outpacing other areas.Card present growth continues to show gradual improvement, particularly in travel and entertainment, says MA, while card not present growth has been comparatively more resilient over the last several months.However, MA added that online travel related spend, which accounted for roughly a third of card not present cross-border volume in 2019, remains low. (See MA stock analysis on TipRanks)Shares in Mastercard are currently up 10% year-to-date, and the stock scores a bullish Strong Buy Street consensus. That’s with 18 recent buy ratings vs 5 hold ratings. Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $353 indicates 7% upside potential from current levels.Following the latest update, RBC Capital’s Daniel Perlin reiterated his MA buy rating with a $372 price target. “Mastercard remains one of our best ideas in the space given our belief that investors should look to focus on long-term, secular-driven stories that provide solid organic growth with opportunities for margin expansion” he commented.Related News:  Carnival Gains Over 5% As It Resumes Sailings  Goldman Downgrades Wynn Resorts On Challenges At Its Macau Unit  Grubhub-Just Eat Merger Deal Extended By 6 Months More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Trillium Spikes 38% After-Hours On Updated Blood Cancer Data   * Slack Tanks 19% In After-Hours As 2Q Billings Miss Estimates   * Lululemon Skids 6% As 3Q Profit Expected To Drop   * Microsoft Joins Forces With Nutanix On Hybrid Cloud Solution	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-sees-continued-improvement-august-062107952.html?.tsrc=rss

The global payment solution provider said that the card was launched on August 31.The deal provides Mastercard (MA) with a strong customer base, given Samsung Pay’s leading market position in the South Korean digital payment market. Samsung Pay had approximately 19 million users at the end of August. Since Samsung Pay’s launch in 2015, the app has generated accumulated payments of 80 trillion won ($67.5 billion).On July 30, Mastercard reported better-than-expected 2Q results. The company’s revenues of $3.3 billion surpassed analysts’ expectations of $3.2 billion. Its earnings of $1.36 per share beat Street estimates of $1.15. (See MA stock analysis on TipRanks).On August 28, Truist Financial analyst Andrew Jeffrey raised the stock’s price target to $415 from $375 and reiterated a Buy rating. Jeffery believes that the stock will make a comeback given its &quot;leading Services strategy, long-term share opportunity, inherent scalability and shareholder-friendly capital allocation.&quot; Notably, PayPal has gained 77.4% year-to-date while Mastercard is up just 12.2%.Currently, the Street has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus is based on 18 Buys versus 5 Holds. The average analyst price target of $353.14 implies upside potential of 5.4% to current levels.Related News:   Samsung Nabs $6.6B Verizon Network Equipment Order   FBL Financial Jumps 31% On Minority Stake Buyout Proposal   Goldman Downgrades Wynn Resorts On Challenges At Its Macau Unit More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Regeneron, Sanofi’s Dupixent Shows Sustained Asthma Benefits In 3-Yr Trial   * Boeing Dreamliner Faces FAA Probe Due To Manufacturing Flaws – Report   * Zscaler Earnings: Prepare For Strong Results, Cheers RBC Capital   * Starbucks Rolls Out Plant-Based Foods In Asia To Meet Healthier Lifestyle Trend	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-expands-south-korea-samsung-064612554.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-06	2020-09-06 13:30:21	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	What Credit Companies Offering Installment Payments Means For Investors	Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) recently announced a partnership with TSYS, a global payments company, that will allow customers to use their Mastercard to split transactions into installments before, during or after checkout.Mastercard Joins Paypal: Three out of four Americans have used installment plans during the pandemic and will continue to do so in the future, Mastercard said in a press release, citing its own research. Mastercard, which is accepted in 210 countries, said it's &quot;creating a future where payments keep pace with the way we live.&quot;An Installment Trend: This announcement comes on the heels of Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) announcing it's adding an interest-free installment payment plan option on certain purchases in a new program called &quot;Pay in 4.&quot;Both of these companies are joining the &quot;buy now, pay later&quot; industry and players such as Affirm and Afterpay.Affirm is partnered with companies like Wayfair Inc (NYSE: W) and ADIDAS AG/S ADR (OTC: ADDYY).Mastercard's installment plan is notable for being available wherever Mastercard is accepted, and not only with certain partner companies, as with Affirm. The Credit Environment: Last month, consumer spending slowed after months of large increases. And credit dependence has dropped in recent months.The New York Fed released a report earlier this summer that said credit card debt has decreased nationwide. This was attributed in part to added government transfer payments intended to provide relief during the coronavirus pandemic. Competition Or Desperation? Mastercard's foray into the &quot;buy now, pay later&quot; world may be an attempt to drum up usage of their cards and perhaps convince users to try other Mastercard services, outside of a desire to be competitive with PayPal and Affirm.PayPal does charge a late fee if a payment is missed in their &quot;Pay in 4&quot; program; the official release from Mastercard did not indicate if a late fee would be charged if a payment was missed.Be on the lookout for other partnerships from major credit card companies.

2020-09-04	2020-09-04 12:56:51	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Looking Into Mastercard's Return On Capital Employed	Mastercard (NYSE: MA) posted Q2 earnings of $1.71 billion, an increase from Q1 of 22.8%. Sales dropped to $3.33 billion, a 16.81% decrease between quarters. In Q1, Mastercard earned $2.21 billion, and total sales reached $4.01 billion.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q2, Mastercard posted an ROCE of 0.26%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on MAReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For Mastercard, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q2 Earnings Recap Mastercard reported Q2 earnings per share at $1.36/share, which beat analyst predictions of $1.16/share.See more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For August 27, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-02	2020-09-02 19:24:32	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard Is at a Peak and Is Too Expensive to Buy Now	Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is up over 19% year-to-date and most of that gain came in the last month which showed a 16%+ rise. The bottom line now is that MA stock is simply too expensive.Source: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com Most investors should probably wait for a pullback in the stock before taking a position in this fine company. At that point, there might at least be a notion of a margin of safety in buying it.The stock's rise in August came after Mastercard reported its second-quarter earnings on July 30. Analysts were expecting adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.18, but the company outperformed with adjusted EPS of $1.36. However, this was still down 28% from last year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Looking at the Valuation CarefullyThe company indicated in its presentation and its conference call that it would not provide any guidance for Q3 or even for the year. That helps, thank you very much. Just when analysts and investors need some guidance, there is no way to tell if things are improving.We will have to wait until the company provides its Q3 numbers, probably at the end of October. Let's look at what some analysts are projecting.  * 10 Long-Term Stocks to Buy to Profit From Secular TrendsHere is where MA stock stands now, in terms of valuation. Yahoo polled 31 analysts who estimate on average that 2020 EPS will be $6.69. That puts MA stock on an astounding 54 times 2020 earnings.Here is what that means. If you bought 100% of Mastercard's shares today, it would take 54 years for your purchase price to reach breakeven. This assumes that earnings don't rise or fall.But what if earnings grew on average 10% per year for 10 years. By year 10, earnings would have compounded by 236% to $15.35 by the end of 2029. Moreover, the cumulative earnings would add up to $106.62.That works out to 29.8% of today's price of about $359. In fact, it would take between 22 and  23 years for all the cumulative earnings to equal today's price.That is a long time to wait for breakeven, and it illustrates how highly expensive MA stock is at present. Even if you take into account projected earnings for 2021, at $8.71, it still trades for over 42 times earnings. To put it succinctly, this is not a bargain stock. Long-Term Growth Vs. ValuationTen years ago, in 2009 the company made $11.19 per share, fully diluted. However, on Jan. 22, 2014, there was a 10-for-1 stock split. So, in effect, earnings per share were $1.119 in 2009 on an adjusted basis.Therefore, earnings over the past 10 years have risen from $1.119 to $6.69 this year, or 5.97 times. But, on a compounded annualized growth rate (CAGR) basis, that represents 19.58% growth every year.I am impressed with that level of growth. That is twice the 10% number assumed in our calculation above. For example, now if you bought 100% of MA stock, it would take just 14 to 15 years to reach breakeven with its historical 19.6% annual growth rate.That is much earlier than the earlier estimate of 22 to 23 years with a 10% annual growth.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA It also explains why investors are willing to buy a sliver of the company at today's estimated 54 times earnings. For example, using its historical growth rate, in 1o years, EPS will be five times higher at $33.45 per share.In other words, in 10 years the stock's price today of $359.19 is only 10.7 times its earnings. In fact, in just five years, the EPS would be $16.358 per share.As the chart on the right show, that would mean it is selling for just 21.9 times earnings in five years. Now the stock looks much cheaper - in just five years. That is how investors justify paying today's high price. They assume the company's 20% earnings growth rates justify the high P/E ratio. What to Do With MA StockThat is fine unless you think that a $356 billion market capitalization stock may eventually succumb to the law of large numbers. In other words, Mastercard's historical 19.6% growth rate might begin to slow due to its size.I tend to believe that it will. Therefore, absent any guidance from the company, I believe that paying 54 times earnings, even if it means 21 times earnings in five years, is too expensive.I suspect that there will be an opportunity to buy the stock cheaper some time in the future.On the date of publication, Mark R.

2020-09-01	2020-09-01 13:55:18	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard Sees Auto Rentals Gaining Share of Spending on Travel	(Bloomberg) -- Consumers are traveling again, but instead of using planes and trains, they’re turning to cars and scooters.The U.S. saw the return of the great American road trip this summer, according to analysis by Mastercard Inc. of spending on credit and debit cards, along with estimates for cash and check payments. Globally, auto rental’s share of total transportation spending nearly doubled in the second quarter to 17% as consumers kept more of their traveling local amid the coronavirus pandemic.In the U.S., people aren’t using cars alone to get around. By the end of July, spending on so-called “micro-mobility” travel options -- such as bicycle and scooter rentals -- had surpassed their 2019 levels. That helped counter broader declines in U.S. travel and entertainment outlays.“Gas spending, restaurant spending, bike-rental spending -- all are improving, showing that the rebound is happening but is focused on local travel and local spending,” Steve Sadove, a senior adviser to Mastercard, said in a statement Tuesday. “In other words for those of us in the U.S., the great American road trip has returned in a new way.”Here are other key insights from the report:Overall retail sales excluding auto declined 3% for the period from June 1 to Aug. 15 from a year earlier.When consumers are traveling, they’re increasingly choosing to say at smaller, boutique hotels over national chains, Mastercard found. The recovery rate of independent hotels outpaced that of large hotels by more than 50%.Commercial spending on airfare was down 84% in July from a year earlier, likely the result of businesses reducing risks and costs, Mastercard said. The decline was less dramatic for consumer air travel, with spending down 73%.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-sees-auto-rentals-gaining-135518205.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-27	2020-08-27 18:36:11	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	BofA Picks Visa Over Mastercard, Raises Price Targets	In the past month, shares of Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) have gained 15.9%, more than double the 7.6% gain by competitor Visa Inc (NYSE: V) in that time.On Thursday, one Wall Street analyst said Mastercard's recent outperformance underscores the fact that Visa is the better investment at this point.The Analyst: Bank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg reiterated his Buy rating for Visa and raised his price target from $227 to $234. He also reiterated his Hold rating for Mastercard and raised his price target from $324 to $358.The Thesis: Kupferber said much of Mastercard's outperformance in recent weeks was likely driven by what was perceived to be better second-quarter earnings numbers. However, he said Mastercard management was clear on its earnings call that client incentives drove revenue upside largely due simply to timing. Management also mentioned timing as a primary factor in operating margin upside as well.After adjusting for the timing impacts, Kupferberg said Mastercard's quarter was essentially in-line with Visa's.Looking ahead to the second half of the year, Kupferberg said Visa is better-positioned to potentially report some meaningful earnings beats, and the stock also has more valuation upside given it currently trades at a 12% earnings multiple discount to Mastercard.Mastercard bulls may argue that the company's 13.5% US debit volume growth compares favorably to Visa's, at 8%, but Kupferberg said those numbers are a bit misleading given Mastercard's debit volume is only half the size of Visa's.&quot;Given current choppiness in consumer spending, we believe the higher mix of debit (which tends to be linked to more non-discretionary purchases) is a plus,&quot; Kupferberg said.Benzinga's Take: It's difficult to get a clear picture of the underlying trends for both Visa and Mastercard these days. Kupferberg said stimulus funds, including unemployment benefits in many states, created significant noise in both companies' second-quarter numbers.Related Links:Facebook Forms New Group To Rationalize Payments Across Apps Sarat Sethi Likes American Express See more from Benzinga  * Pending Home Sales Up 5.9% In July, Ahead Of Expectations  * Investors Cheer Powell's New 'Average Inflation Targeting' Policy  * 'No Obvious End In Sight': Experts React To Another 1 Million Weekly Jobless Claims(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-26	2020-08-26 06:45:53	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Jack Ma’s Ant Is More MasterCard Than PayPal	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Valuing billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant Group, which filed its prospectus for a mega initial public offering Tuesday, will be more art than science. It looks like a financial-services company but sells itself as a technology firm. Is it a MasterCard or a PayPal?On a number of counts, Ant is more like the former.First, the company has made a lot of progress diversifying its business operations over the past year. Online loans to consumers and small businesses have overtaken mobile payments – the segment Ant is best known for — as the group’s largest revenue generator, accounting for 39.4% of the 72 billion yuan ($10.4 billion) business in the first half. As of June, its lending platforms had a 2.2 trillion yuan credit balance.Then consider the company's loan offerings. There’s Huabei, a revolving credit product that gives consumers interest-free loans for up to 40 days. And for cash loans on larger consumption transactions with no strings attached, borrowers can go to Jiebei. Most interest rates at these two platforms are capped at 0.04% daily, or 15.6% on an annualized basis. Both are unsecured.The way Ant handles credit risk looks a lot like a credit-card company, too. The prospectus repeatedly reminds readers that Ant doesn’t use its own balance sheet or provide guarantees. As of June, about 98% of its credit balances were underwritten by partners, such as banks or trust companies, or packaged and sold off as asset-backed securities. Ant, in turn, earns service fees from its partners.Ant also has its own licensed small-loan subsidiaries that provide consumer-credit loans through its CreditTech platform. Loan receivables enabled and retained by these totaled 36.2 billion yuan at the end of June.Ant has tried to beef up its technology credentials, boasting that 63.9% of its 16,660 employees work in technology functions. But since it’s responsible for loan-collection services for its financial partners, you can bet management is more concerned with credit cycles and delinquency rates than big data algorithms.Ant says it will rely on “intelligent decisioning systems” to ensure it takes on worthy borrowers before passing them on to partners. But what happens when that system doesn’t work? “In the event that the creditworthiness of borrowers deteriorates or we cannot track the deterioration of their creditworthiness, the criteria we use for the analysis of borrower credit profiles may be rendered inaccurate, and our risk management system may be rendered ineffective,” according to the prospectus.In the current economic environment, that’s a big if. The company acknowledges in its filing that it hasn’t tested a full credit cycle in China.As asset quality gets worse and household incomes drop amid Covid-19, Ant’s delinquency and default rates could climb. So while the company doesn’t hold the loans itself, Ant will likely end up being a significant doorkeeper for its partner banks and trust companies, which are already laden with bad debt. Over the past six months, delinquency rates on consumer loans past due by over 30 days rose to 2.97% in July from 1.76% in January, after peaking at 3.01% in May.Having deep trenches in the financial sector also means Ant will be subject to a shifting regulatory landscape. On Aug. 20, for example, China lowered the cap on interest rates for private lending to 15.4%. While this ruling doesn’t apply to licensed players like Ant, the company acknowledges it needs to prepare for the possibility that the regulation will be extended to its small-loan subsidiaries.With the information available, putting a fair valuation on Ant will be difficult. The company breaks down its revenue by segments, but not at the cost or profit levels. We can only speculate that its newer digital-finance business, from online loans to wealth management, is highly lucrative, because Ant’s gross and operating profit have risen.We also have little sense of how volatile Ant’s earnings can be. In its filing, Ant disclosed annual — not quarterly — figures for the three years through 2019. That could obscure its sensitivity to Beijing’s policy flip-flops. Starting late 2017, for example, Ant had to drastically alter its online credit business as Beijing launched sweeping regulations to clamp down on debt.There are many mystic animals in Chinese folklore; some take the head of an elephant and the legs of a monkey. Ant could end up having aspects of both MasterCard and PayPal, or neither. Until it discloses more information, we won’t know how to value it.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2020-08-25	2020-08-25 07:49:13	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	U.S., China Signal Progress on Trade Deal as Relations Fray	(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks Covid-19’s impact on trade. Sign up here, and subscribe to our Covid-19 podcast for the latest news and analysis on the pandemic.The U.S. and China reaffirmed their commitment to the phase-one trade deal in a biannual review, demonstrating a willingness to cooperate even as tensions rise over issues ranging from data security to democracy in Hong Kong.The two countries discussed steps China has taken, including ensuring greater protection for intellectual property rights and removing impediments to American companies in financial services and agriculture, the U.S. Trade Representative said. Both sides agreed to create conditions to push the deal forward, according to China’s Ministry of Commerce.Resolving the trade war between the U.S. and China has emerged as a rare area of cooperation as the relationship sours on a number of other fronts. Yet Beijing is far behind where it needs to be to meet its promises to increase purchases of agricultural, energy and manufactured goods from the U.S.China would need to buy about $130 billion in the second half of this year to comply with the original terms of the agreement signed in January, in which it agreed to purchase an additional $200 billion of American goods and services over the 2017 level by the end of 2021.“The statement at least tells us that Trump’s administration still treasures the trade deal,” said Raymond Yeung, greater China chief economist with Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “China’s buying of U.S. agricultural and energy products is still an attractive proposition before the presidential election. This suggests that we are not really seeing a full decoupling of the two economies.”U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He Monday evening Washington time, according to the U.S. statement. The USTR later corrected that statement as they misspelled Liu’s first name, a mistake that drew attention on Chinese social media.“The parties also discussed the significant increases in purchases of U.S. products by China as well as future actions needed to implement the agreement,” the U.S. said in its statement. Both sides also discussed enhancing macro-policy coordination, according to the Chinese readout.Call DelayedThe call took place on the evening of the first day of the Republican National Convention, at which some speakers criticized Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden’s alleged friendliness to China.President Donald Trump marked his official nomination for a second term with a speech that included a warning that China will “own” the U.S. if Biden wins the election in November.Both sides had been expected to talk two weekends ago as part of a six-month review since the agreement, signed in January, took effect Feb. 15. But President Donald Trump said he canceled those plans because he’s unhappy with China over its role in the Covid-19 pandemic.Prior to the talks, Bloomberg News reported that China would raise the issue of Washington’s recent crackdown on businesses including TikTok and WeChat. The topic was not mentioned in the statements from the two countries. TikTok on Monday asked a federal judge to block the Trump administration from enacting the ban on its app.Some ProgressChina has made some progress on its commitments. It modified regulations to allow imports of a variety of American farm and food products, while removing foreign equity caps in insurance, securities, and futures. It also lowered other financial market barriers and gave the green light to enterprises like American Express Co., MasterCard Inc. and Fitch Ratings Inc. to enter its market.U.S. oil exports to China are set to reach a record next month, with about 19 tankers signing provisional bookings to load American crude for the Asian nation in September, according to shipping fixtures, which are subject to change. If all of them set sail, exports could total 37 million barrels, the most on record for a single month.China’s customs has also strengthened a crackdown on counterfeits and released quarterly reports as set out in the agreement. The Supreme Court has issued a series of work guidelines and implementation plans on ensuring and improving legal enforcement of violations of intellectual property rights, while the National Intellectual Property Administration also published a work plan for strengthening IP protection in 2020 and 2021.Trump has projected a more conciliatory tone than he did in early May, when he threatened in a Fox News interview that “if they don’t buy, we’ll terminate the deal, very simple.” In recent days he has sounded more satisfied with Beijing’s compliance with the trade deal even if he’s not about China’s handling of the coronavirus.(Adds comments by Donald Trump on China in ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-china-discussed-phase-one-010145225.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-06	2020-08-06 19:45:12	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Seismic Shifts In The Cryptocurrency Market May Be Ahead, With Stablecoins Soaring	Recent developments indicate major shifts may be ahead in the cryptocurrency market, with the importance of stablecoin growing, PayPal rumored to announce a partnership with Paxos to offer crypto trading, and Mastercard expanding its own cryptocurrency program. In an economy still reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, replete with lockdowns, shifts to telecommuting and business closures, cryptocurrency trading is becoming an attractive alternative to many businesses and investors alike. With recent moves to introduce or expand crypto-based services by more established and commonly-used payment providers, a mainstream adoption of digital currencies may not be far off. Here is what you need to know about it. The Drift towards Stability on the Cryptocurrency Market: Stablecoins Recently, stability has increased as a factor of importance in the cryptocurrency market.After the massive value growth of cryptocurrencies throughout 2017 and the subsequent bursting of the bubble in early 2018, the market see-sawed until the beginning of 2020. Just when it seemed another growth spike was taking off, the pandemic stock market crash sent it tumbling again. Since April, crypto values have roughly returned to February levels.Throughout this period, one sector of the cryptocurrency market has outpaced the others in terms of growth - stablecoins. Unlike currencies whose value is volatile and driven by supply and demand, stablecoins are typically bound to a fiat currency, although some are pegged against other cryptocurrencies. Prominent examples of stablecoins include Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), or Binance USD (BUSD), all equivalent to $1.Stablecoins have been on the rise, measured by market cap and transaction volume, since the 2018 crash. This indicates their buyers value both their innate crypto advantages and the much lower volatility of fiat currency. It also suggests the use of cryptocurrency as a vehicle for speculation is now giving way to actual use for transfers and longer-term holding.In the tailwind of the crisis, many of these stablecoins have been doing well. For example, immediately after the stock crash in March, Tether's daily transaction volume shot up from around $50 billion to nearly $100 billion. This spike was fueled by buyers converting both from USD and other cryptocurrencies, leading the currency issuers to make several billion new USDT available, for a total market cap now exceeding $10 billion. Now, as the volatile currencies are approaching pre-crisis values, USDT transaction volumes are sinking again.Breaking into the Cryptocurrency Market - PayPal partnering with Paxos Though official confirmation is still lacking, it has emerged that payment processor PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), with its mobile payments division Venmo, is now set on breaking into the cryptocurrency market. A letter from PayPal to the European Commission, leaked earlier this week, shows that the payment provider was working on crypto capabilities even before March.Now, it seems, the process is coming to fruition, with an announcement by PayPal expected as early as the end of this week.Reportedly, it has picked the Paxos Trust Company, a regulated financial institution that digitizes and mobilizes assets, as its partner in offering the service, over principal rival Coinbase.Less than a week ago, Paxos introduced Paxos Crypto Brokerage, a new API-based solution that allows companies to integrate cryptocurrency buying, selling, holding, and sending capabilities into their own applications. Paxos takes care of the underlying regulatory and technological complexity.Paxos had previously struck up partnerships with fintech leaders such as Square (NYSE: SQ), Robinhood, and Revolut. Some of these have been highly profitable, with Square reporting its first-quarter revenue from Bitcoin-based services at $528 million, surpassing its mainstream financial services. A PayPal partnership is a step up for both Paxos and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. With over 300 million users globally, PayPal is among the largest payment facilitators - and now set to become a key gateway into the cryptocurrency market for millions of its clients.Bringing Cryptocurrency to Everyday Life - Mastercard Delves Deeper into the Market Another push towards the mainstream is aided by Mastercard (NYSE: MA) recently announcing an expansion of its cryptocurrency partner program. A practical limitation for many cryptocurrencies, until recently, was that they're accepted by only a few brick-and-mortar businesses. From gas stations and supermarkets to hairdressers and pharmacies, cryptocurrency holders find themselves stymied when it comes to using their holdings to purchase services and products.Mastercard's announcement means that crypto-wallet providers can now issue secure, compliant, Mastercard-branded payment cards to their customers. Thus bringing cryptocurrency into everyday life.The initiative was launched as part of Mastercard's Accelerate program, with the London-based cryptocurrency platform Wirex as its first major partner.Technically, Mastercard does not enable clients to spend cryptocurrency directly with merchants. It converts cryptocurrency into fiat first, which is then used for transactions. This saves users from the effort and time needed to convert to fiat themselves for a given purchase. With the notorious short-term volatility of some cryptocurrencies, the automation of the conversion process is a welcome relief to many.Overall, this increase in fungibility marks a defining shift towards legitimacy in the still-nascent cryptocurrency market.&quot;The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and Mastercard is driving it forward, creating safe and secure experiences for consumers and businesses in today's digital economy,&quot; Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's executive vice president for digital asset and blockchain products and partnerships, said in a comment.Mastercard is in good company. In a pioneering effort, Coinbase launched its own card in 2019 - in partnership with Visa, Mastercard's principal competitor. The Drift towards Stability and the Mainstream Altogether, recent developments suggest an overall drift towards stability in the cryptocurrency market, as well as an accelerating movement towards opening it up to the mainstream. The wider implications of this shift in the cryptocurrency market remain to be observed. It seems clear that the increased proportion of stablecoins in the overall market is making other cryptocurrencies relatively less attractive. At the same time, that market is expanding rapidly, and one major use of stablecoin is easier trading of other cryptocurrencies.Other questions - such as whether PayPal users will widely adopt cryptocurrencies, or whether crypto owners will want to expend their holdings on everyday purchases with Mastercard's offer, rather than speculate or hold onto them as investments - remain open. Overall, the situation is summed up well by Simon Taylor, head of ventures at fintech consultancy firm 11:FS, in an interview with CNBC: &quot;This is less a watershed moment and more part of a broader, slow and steady legitimization of crypto as the global regulators increasingly put systems and controls in place.&quot;See more from Benzinga  * 10 Fastest-Shrinking Cities In America Since 2010  * Are Drivers Staying Out Of The Market To Collect Unemployment?

2020-07-31	2020-07-31 17:04:24	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Tala Gives Tech Firms a Good Name, Finally!	Most of you reading this article are connected to the mainstream financial institution, through major banks and credit institutions. However, that alone puts you in a very privileged class. Several years ago, BBC reported that the world's average salary is merely $1,480 a month. That implies a significant economic base that is untouched by big finance. Tala would like to change that, and it's this impetus that has many vying to invest in Tala stock.Source: Alfa Photo/ShutterStock.com A Santa Monica, California-based company, technology firm Tala specializes in microloans. According to CNBC.com, these are loans that range from $10 to $500, made to people in emerging nations. Aside from the small denominations, which I'll address in greater detail below, previous attempts to reach such borrowers were stymied by their lack of credit profiles.Obviously, when you're dealing with small figures relative to developed nations' economies, you're outside the financial system. Therefore, a prospective borrower in developing nations lack a transactional history. And that means lenders have no information to assess credit risk, other than taking a borrower at his/her word. Clearly, this is no way to do business sustainably.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEnter Tala. The company fills the void via leveraging telecommunications. Specifically, credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) had interesting insights into how organizations like Tala can fill the void. From Mastercard's website, &quot;…15 countries account for over 60% of the global unbanked population, where 607 million people have a mobile phone, but do not yet have a bank account.&quot;  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for Beginners to Income Investing Incredibly, Tala claims that it can use a prospective borrower's text messages and other behavioral data to establish a credit profile and quickly. Now you can see why so many want to invest in Tala stock. Invest in Tala Stock to Solve Banking's &quot;Last Mile&quot; ProblemOn multiple fronts, this tech firm presents humanitarian reasons why you should invest in Tala stock. Primarily, the underlying platform gives borrowers lost in the shadow of western banking hegemony access to leverage. And this theoretically enables broader economic growth in the target country, promoting overall global equity.However, prior attempts to close this gap have failed because of banking's &quot;last mile&quot; problem. With the advent of digitalization and mobile innovations, though, we may finally address this dilemma.In the logistics realm, insiders are all too familiar with last mile delivery costs. Here, 90% of shipments are at scale astonishingly efficient. It's the last 10% of the logistics trail - when the products get to your door - that is the most expensive.At first glance, this might appear counterintuitive. Let's say I order a rare trinket through Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the product is located halfway across the world. Why would 90% of the product's shipment cost less than 10% of the miles traveled?Individually, it doesn't. But at scale, we're talking about a countless number of products in transit. And these long-distance trips are actually the most efficient because they don't have barriers on their routes, such as traffic lights or stop signs.That's not the case when the product is on the delivery truck making its way to your home. And the same principle applies with banking. Simply, small loans at extremely large scales don't make economic sense. For instance, it takes too much work to verify creditworthiness for borrowers only seeking $100 in capital.But with Tala's technology, it can deploy artificial intelligence-based platforms to replace costly banking mechanisms, facilitating microloans; hence, the surge in questions on how people can invest in Tala stock. Not All Roses and Gummy BearsBefore you decide to invest in Tala stock, you should be aware of the risk factors. Like any other investment, you're not guaranteed success. And with private-equity opportunities like Tala, you must perform more due diligence than say an established blue-chip stock.Primarily, one of the biggest risks to Tala is that the underlying business could be &quot;flawed.&quot; Again, microloans are practically impossible without technology. So, when you invest in Tala stock, you're betting more on tech than a brilliant, unique business model.Unfortunately, this invites competitors. Let's face it - this isn't the only fintech platform. As well, mobile apps can potentially disrupt this space.Second, I wonder about the longer-term effects of the microloan industry. I think it's fair to assume that those participating in such vehicles are not the most sophisticated borrowers. Invariably, this would lead to people misusing or perhaps abusing the platform. In the worst-case scenario, microloaning could create a new class of dependent borrowers - not a great look if you're going for financial and social equity.Third, the timing proposition to invest in Tala stock isn't the greatest. With a severe, extended economic crisis possibly headed awaiting us, the frontier of microloaning may not pan out. A Disruptive Opportunity for Those Who Can Handle the HeatUltimately, Tala is a feel-good story that's putting its acumen toward the betterment of humanity. For instance, management developed a program to mitigate the impact of the novel coronavirus called the Covid-19 Rebuild Fund. CNBC notes:Through the fund, it has disbursed long-term 0% interest loans to hundreds of entrepreneurs who are providing jobs and essential services such as clean water and accessible food to their broader communities. The company also is offering flexible payment plans and waiving late fees to help customers who are struggling.That's what we need more of these days. It's this corporate ethos that may serve Tala very well.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies. Over the past several years, he has delivered unique, critical insights for the investment markets, as well as various other industries including legal, construction management, and healthcare. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Over the past month, the stock increased by 2.77%, and in the past year, by 15.35%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 10.50%.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.View more earnings on MADepending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 18.88 in the Credit Services industry, Mastercard Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 39.55. Shareholders might be inclined to think that Mastercard Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It's also possible that the stock is overvalued.There are many limitations to P/E ratio.

2020-07-22	2020-07-22 00:45:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	WeWork Said to Lose Major Tenant in Japan as Rakuten Exits	(Bloomberg) -- WeWork, the troubled co-working giant backed by SoftBank Group Corp., is set to suffer the loss of a major tenant in Japan as Rakuten Inc. exits, according to people familiar with the matter.Rakuten, a Japanese e-commerce giant, will let its contract run out in August without renewing, the people said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. That will leave about 700 desks empty in Tokyo. Rakuten is moving staff in its financial tech arm from the co-working spaces into its new offices, one of the people said.Spokespersons for Rakuten and WeWork declined to comment.Shared offices around the world emptied out as the number of coronavirus infections mounted earlier this year. But even as the pandemic subsides in certain areas, it’s not clear tenants will return. WeWork’s short leases make it particularly vulnerable to budget cutbacks, while its dense office layouts run counter to new social distancing norms. Many firms have also discovered working from home to be a viable alternative.Japan is an important market for WeWork in part because it is home to SoftBank. The Japanese conglomerate bailed out the co-working startup last October after its initial public offering attempt imploded and now owns about 80% of the company. A month later, SoftBank’s founder Masayoshi Son cited WeWork’s Japanese operations, which were profitable at the time, as the reason he was convinced the business can be turned around.WeWork’s Escape Plan Is Buried in the Books at Its Tokyo OfficeWeWork’s higher proportion of large corporate clients in Japan, including SoftBank, has helped it weather the first wave of the pandemic better than it has in other markets. Still, it saw occupancy plunge to about 60%, one of the people familiar said, describing the current situation as dire. Occupancy is key for pulling out of the red and was over 90% for Tokyo locations late last year. In addition to Rakuten, WeWork Japan is also losing smaller tenants including publisher Kadokawa Corp. and Oyo Hotels, another SoftBank company. Kadokawa and Oyo didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Even before the virus hit, WeWork was already cutting costs worldwide and freezing expansion to focus on profitability. The New York-based company responded to the outbreak by offering some tenants discounts to minimize cancellations amid government-mandated quarantines. It also hasn’t paid rent for some locations and has approached landlords regarding rent abatements, revenue-sharing agreements and other lease amendments as it seeks to trim liabilities.But the outbreak has also created new sources of demand for WeWork, as companies seek to distribute their workforces over a greater geographic area, according to a separate person with close knowledge of WeWork’s operations. Outside Japan, the company has succeeded in attracting major new tenants recently, including Mastercard Inc. and TikTok-owner Bytedance Ltd., the person said asking not to be named. Microsoft Corp. is moving its Tel Aviv development center to a WeWork location, while drug maker Merck & Co. signed a lease in New Jersey, according to media reports.WeWork is on track for positive cash flow in 2021, Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure told the Financial Times earlier this month, without giving further details. The company had previously targeted cash-flow positive by 2023 and positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 2021.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wework-said-lose-major-tenant-004500189.html?.tsrc=rss

Back then, many experts said investors needed to become more nimble going forward or risk being exposed when the next crisis hit.Thing is from the March 10, 2009, market bottom through July 10, 2020, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) jumped 456%. That time frame certainly qualifies as &quot;long term&quot; and includes an array of pitfalls for riskier assets. These include the European sovereign debt crisis, the taper tantrum, a trade war with China and the March 2020 slide at the hands of the novel coronavirus.That SPY performance is proof positive long-term investing isn't, but what does change over time are the names that qualify as the best long-term stocks. I'm going to use Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). For generations, the world's largest soft drink maker would have qualified as a great &quot;set it and forget it&quot; stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'm bringing up Coca-Cola because recently, I saw some folks on Twitter saying the stock only delivered returns of 3% over the past 22 years. Initially, I didn't believe it. Sure enough, it's true. Worse yet, an investor that bought Coca-Cola in 1998 would have been down 50% a decade later and needed 15 years just to get back to even. That's not best long-term stock status.  * 15 Growth Stocks That Are Being Propped Up By Low RatesGood news is there are some names out there today that could be sound set it and forget ideas. Here are a few to consider.  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  * Mastercard (NYSE:MA)  * Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Best Long-Term Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT)Source: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com By constructing this list in 2020, it's almost impossible to leave Microsoft off and not simply because this is the largest domestic company by market capitalization. The company is firing on all cylinders today. And, while MSFT stock is up 49% over the past year, the name is buoyed by an array of positive fundamental factors.First, a brief history lesson. Microsoft is 45 years old and went public in 1986. At a time when so many investors are smitten with shiny new objects, those factoids could be construed as strikes against Microsoft. Actually, the opposite is true because this middle-aged company is showing it's adaptable and has levers for growth.Microsoft is the second-largest cloud computing company, an impressive feat when considering the company didn't even enter that business until 2020. Today, the Azure unit is one of the fastest-growing cloud computing entities on the market, confirming Microsoft can enter a competition late and still scale its way to dominance.Adding to the case for Microsoft as one of the best long-term ideas is adaptability nurtured under the stewardship of CEO Satya Nadella. For example, core products such as Microsoft Office 365 used to be sold on a one-off basis. Now, Microsoft runs a more lucrative subscription model. This makes revenue visibility easier to ascertain - a favorable trait for long-term investors.The combination of strong leadership, a fortress balance sheet and leadership in some trends that are becoming secular tailwinds make MSFT stock an ideal long-term holding for investors of varying demographics and risk tolerances. Mastercard (MA)Source: Alexander Yakimov / Shutterstock.com Like Microsoft, Mastercard is classified as a technology stock, though investors often view it through a financial services lens. Put those two concepts together and you've got fintech, as known as the way of accessing growth in the financial services arena.There are more nimble, growthier fintech names than Mastercard to consider, such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ). That pair is positioned for long-term success, too. Mastercard is included here because it's less volatile than those fintech names, meaning its drawdowns over long holding periods should be less severe.Obviously, a big part of the long-term fintech thesis is the move away from cash to card and digital payments, a trend Mastercard stands to benefit from. Importantly, cards only recently surpassed cash as the world's primary payment option. This indicates the cashless trend is still in its early innings.An important feather in the cap of Mastercard is that, like other beloved companies in other industries, it's able to leverage the network effect. This is a fancy way of saying Mastercard is able to effectively monetize users even though those customers aren't directly paying the company.  * 15 Growth Stocks That Are Being Propped Up By Low Rates&quot;Payment networks such as Mastercard benefit, unsurprisingly, from a network effect,&quot; notes Morningstar. &quot;The more consumers that are plugged into a payment network, the more attractive that payment network becomes for merchants, which, in turn, makes the network more convenient for consumers and so on.&quot; Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com Johnson & Johnson is the oldest and sleepiest of the stocks highlighted here and it's far from glamorous relative to other healthcare names. Those aren't knocks on JNJ and those traits don't mean this stock will succumb to the aforementioned woes of Coca-Cola. Plus, JNJ has some potential for excitement due to its participation in the Covid-19 vaccine race.JNJ isn't a growth biotechnology stock. It is able to source growth through its medical devices division, which puts the company at the corner of one of the healthcare sector's more compelling growth segments.Owing in large part to an aging population, &quot;the United States remains the largest medical device market in the world: $156 billion (40 percent of the global medical device market in 2017).

2020-07-16	2020-07-16 18:47:16	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Walmart, Kroger Grapple With Coin Shortage, Urge Cards Instead	(Bloomberg) -- First it was toilet paper and face masks, then it was meat. The latest shortage caused by the coronavirus pandemic? Pocket change.Retailers including Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co. are grappling with a nationwide shortfall of coins that’s left them posting signs at some checkout lines alerting customers about the problem and encouraging them to use credit or debit cards -- or pay with exact change, if possible.“The Federal Reserve is experiencing a significant coin shortage across the U.S., resulting from fewer coins being exchanged and spent during the Covid-19 pandemic,” Cincinnati-based supermarket chain Kroger said in an emailed statement. “Like many retailers and businesses, we are adjusting to the temporary shortage in several ways while still accepting cash.”The coin shortage could amount to a small win for card companies Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., which were already benefiting from consumers avoiding cash over virus-transmission fears. While Kroger and Walmart are still accepting cash, promoting card use at the point of sale is unusual for many stores. Retailers have publicly lamented the fees they have to pay when consumers swipe their cards at checkout.“What we are seeing is a negative sentiment towards cash -- fewer people want to touch cash,” Mastercard Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra told investors at a conference last month.Still, Mastercard and Visa have struggled as spending on their cards has slowed with consumers staying home and many businesses remaining shuttered to slow the spread of Covid-19.In the U.S., cash has remained a popular way to pay, with paper currency and coins used in 26% of all purchases, according to a 2019 study by the Fed. It’s even more popular for transactions of less than $10, accounting for almost half of such payments.While paper currency remains easy to come by -- ATMs are almost everywhere -- coins are a bigger problem, with the closure of stores and bank branches squeezing supplies. While the U.S. Treasury puts the total value of coins in circulation at roughly $47.8 billion -- up from a year ago -- the slower pace of circulation means change isn’t always showing up where it’s needed.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told the House Financial Services Committee last month that the central bank is aware of the issue and has been working with the U.S. Mint to get coins moving again. This month, the Fed planned to convene a U.S. Coin Task Force, with participants including representatives from the Mint, banks, credit unions, retailers and armored carriers, to mitigate the shortage.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-kroger-grapple-coin-shortage-184716238.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-02	2020-07-02 15:56:59	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	3 Tech ETFs to Short Along With Covid-19’s Resurgence	This is the most enthusiasm I've ever seen in stock markets. Not from the size of the rally, but rather because the indices are setting all-time highs in the face of the toughest economic conditions ever. We still have 20 million people unemployed, if not more. Yet Wall Street is blindly buying tech ETFs in droves. The equity markets have already recovered in a &quot;v&quot; and more. The government aide packages are hiding the deep wounds that still exist in our economy. Just this morning, Congress passed the extension of the Paycheck Protection Program.Much of the risk appetite is favoring high risk momentum stocks. These are companies whose products and services serve the new world order of digital delivery and subscription models. Some of the ones making new highs are Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) and even the older gurus like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). The Nasdaq recovered best out of the quarantine crash, and in fact it has already set all-time-highs this morning with no let-up in sight.The bulls are tag-teaming MVP's, so they sell one group to rotate into another. For a while they chase mega-cap tech like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Then on other days when they sell those, they roll their profits into frothier tickers like ZM and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI am usually optimistic about the stock markets, but I have serious worries these days. Last year, I wrote about buying every dip stemming from the China trade war headlines. This is different because the U.S. went from full employment last year to maximum unemployment this year. The economic reports may look fine, but the wound from the quarantine is bleeding internally. This is not evident while the government is spending trillions of dollars supporting the deficit. The election season will pass and the politicians will lose interest in quantitative easing programs.Caution is warranted while markets behave like it's 1999. Investors should fade this extreme exuberance in the Nasdaq using the following three exchange-traded funds. I feel a little guilty for my negative tone, but in my defense, I suggested going long on the April 21 dip. Back then, it served as the base for this incredible 25% rally in these tech ETFs:  * Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ)  * VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH)  * Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK)I will start by sharing my order of preference on these bearish bets. Out of these three tech ETFs, the SMH seems the weakest because it has the most lower-highs in the last two weeks. Then the XLK because it has at least one recent failed breakout. Finally, only the QQQ is in open space and has no recent fails since it just made new highs. Tech ETFs to Trade: Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)Source: Charts by TradingView The QQQ is the main Nasdaq ETF that traders most often use. It is heavily concentrated with the top dogs and they are the great American companies led by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). The top five make up almost half of the the entire basket. The call today is to fade the rally into the Fall season. Placing a bearish bet on the QQQ stock is simple when using options. Shorting the stock outright is too risky because it opens unlimited risk for as long as the rally continues.I realize that doing this now is going against the grain because it suggests fighting the Federal Reserve and the tape. Using options, investors can buy a long-term debit put spread to capture at least a 10% correction. This is a directional position that needs a drop to profit and time is its enemy. At the close of yesterday, traders could buy the December $242 / $232 debit put spread for $3 debit. This is the maximum potential loss per contract. To win, the QQQ has to fall ideally through both legs. The maximum upside potential is then $7 per contract. Those who have a bigger risk appetite can buy the $232 put naked for a cost of $12.80 per contract. In this runaway market that's a big ask.To lower or eliminate the entry cost, an alternative method is sell bear call spreads, which would leave room for error. The advantage here is that profits can come without a correction. All it needs to win is that the QQQ not rally more than 10% from here. For example, the December $280 / $285 credit call spread could pay $1.50 per contract. The advantage of this is that the price can rally and it can still win. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)Source: Charts by TradingView The XLK is another popular tech ETF and it is also heavily weighted with Microsoft and Apple, which make up more than 40% of it. But the XLK is also heavily influenced by Fintech. Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to name three make up almost 15% of it. This complicates matters a little bit for the bears because they would be shorting two different hot concepts. Wall Street is not only in love with tech, but they are almost even more enamored with Financial Tech. PYPL stock rallied 115% off the Covid-19 low and is now miles above its prior highs. This is a good illustration of my concern.I understand the concept of momentum trading very well, but I usually prefer chasing a specific breakout. In this case, the bids are system wide and investors are buying whatever regardless of thesis. Investing is not that easy and there will be pain for many. The first step is to avoid chasing into such froth, and placing a few bearish bets makes sense. Both concepts here are over extended, so they are vulnerable to hiccups.Again, here the easy method is to buy some downside scenarios in the put options out until the end of the year. Placing shorter-term bets could pay quicker but then time becomes a worse liability. The XLK stock is just as exposed as the QQQ, so it comes down to a matter of taste. I find it easier to manage my trade with the QQQ than this one.The XLK has support through $100 per share, but if they lose it, the bears could try to target another $5 drop. Once again, my call today is not one of doom and gloom, but it would be normal to retrace prices back to the May breakout levels without changing the overall bullish thesis. The bulls can retain control for as long as they maintain the higher-low trend. Meaning, I would buy the dips when they come. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)Source: Charts by TradingView Another concept that investors are loving this year are chip stocks and they are best represented by the SMH. This tech ETF is heavily weighted by Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). These three account for almost 30% of the fund. I am a big fan of Intel and Nvidia stock and I wrote about buying every dip in them. Like the XLK, SMH's chart has support just below current levels and a pivot zone at $142 per share. The bulls will defend the zone vigorously because they are an emotional bunch over these stocks. To short the SMH from relative safety, buy the Nov $130 / $120 debit put spread for under $2 per contract. This is a reasonably priced opportunity to capitalize on a correction this Fall.As noted earlier, these ideas go against the grain when it comes to tech ETFs. In addition, the Nasdaq is going into a seasonally bullish period. Although, I don't usually trade hype like this, it is important to acknowledge that this is yet another reason why shorting this insane rally caries unusual risk. The methods discussed today use finite potential, so they are not reckless. There are dozens of other ways to approach tech ETFs today, but simple vertical put spreads are the easiest to explain and execute.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

Before the coronavirus pandemic swept the globe, the Amtrak Guest Rewards World Mastercard was a great deal for David White.  White, who lives in Baltimore and works for a software firm, used to ride the train frequently — and with the credit card, he was able to rack up points that he could convert into free tickets.  Adding to White’s frustration: The card comes with a $79 annual fee, and there aren’t many competitive options to redeem the rewards points for non-travel-related uses.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/aedeeebb-8d6a-3ca7-8d24-c5a080693224/as-coronavirus-cancels.html?.tsrc=rss

The Federal Reserve recently released the results of 2020 bank stress tests, and while no banks are in serious danger, some would see capital levels fall a bit too low for comfort in a prolonged and deep COVID-19 recession.

We will continue to work with all parties and stand ready to take any necessary action.”Wirecard filed for insolvency Thursday, citing over-indebtedness and inability to assure it can continue as a going concern.

The company also promised to promote human rights in the use of its network, particularly for issues affecting the Black community.“For more than 50 years, Mastercard has been a trusted way to pay,” Banga and Miebach said in the memo. “But we also know the broader financial system is fraught with inconsistencies, injustice and exclusion. We need to expand what we’re talking about when we say the ‘integrity of our network’ to ensure our technology is benefiting all.”Companies across finance and other industries have spent the past month addressing racial discrimination. The moves follow public outcry after the killings of African Americans including George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, which have led to protests nationwide and growing awareness of systemic racism in the U.S.By 2025, Mastercard will increase the amount it spends with Black suppliers by more than 70%, to $100 million a year, including contracts with manufacturers, service providers and law firms, according to the memo. The network will also strengthen its prohibitions on using prison labor in its supply chains.Banga said during Mastercard’s annual shareholder meeting this month that employees had been calling for the firm to be a leader in addressing systemic racism. Mastercard’s 30-person management committee has no Black members, and the company has just one Black director.“We are enhancing our end-to-end talent program to ensure we’re recruiting, developing and retaining Black employees at every level,” Banga and Miebach said in the memo.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-promises-increase-black-leadership-215101272.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-24	2020-06-24 17:03:51	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Brazilian Authorities Suspend WhatsApp Payments	(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s Central Bank and antitrust regulator suspended Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp messenger payment features in the country, the app’s second-biggest market with more than 120 million users.The bank decision aims to “preserve an adequate competitive environment, that ensures the functioning of a payment system that’s interchangeable, fast, secure, transparent, open and cheap,” the monetary authority said in a statement on its website. Bank authorities requested that Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. stop payment and money transfer activities through the app.Meanwhile, Brazil’s antitrust regulator, known as Cade, said on Wednesday it is suspending WhatsApp’s partnership with electronic payment company Cielo preemptively. According to an statement on the regulator’s website, the vast WhatsApp user database coupled with Cielo’s high market share in payments could prove too high a barrier for any new competitors. Since the deal wasn’t presented for evaluation, regulators needed to act fast to avoid competition concerns, the statement read.A suspension without presenting further arguments is “an unusual, extraordinary move by the central bank, especially in payments arrangements and technology market,” said Tiago Severo Gomes, a partner at Caputo, Bastos and Serra and a specialist in fintechs and banking regulation.The decisions are a setback for Facebook, which introduced WhatsApp’s payments system in Brazil earlier this month after testing it over the past two years in a handful of markets, including India and Mexico. Payments are a key element of WhatsApp’s long-term plan to offer commerce within the app. More than 5 million merchants around the world use a business version of the messenger app, and in countries like India and Brazil, WhatsApp serves as the main or only online presence for many mom-and-pop retailers.“Our goal is to provide digital payments to all WhatsApp users in Brazil using an open model and we will continue to work with local partners and the Central Bank to make this possible,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said. ”In addition, we support the Central Bank’s PIX project on digital payments and together with our partners are committed to work with the Central Bank to integrate our systems when PIX becomes available,” the spokesperson said, referring to Brazil’s proposed instant-payment system.The company was surprised by the Central Bank’s decision, and the two sides were in regular contact in the run-up to the payments launch, said a person familiar with the talks who asked not to be named discussing private deliberations.Brazil’s Central Bank said the suspension will let it evaluate any possible risk to the country’s system of payments and to determine whether the payments system meets the necessary rules. Starting the service without the regulator’s green light could generate “irreparable damage to the system, especially what concerns competition, efficiency and data privacy,” the banks said, adding that Mastercard and Visa could face fines if they don’t comply.In a regulatory filing, Cielo said they suspended the services, and will keep the shareholders informed of developments.(Adds antitrust regulator comments in the third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brazil-central-bank-suspends-whatsapp-235003197.html?.tsrc=rss

The central bank said in a statement that rolling out the service without previous analysis by the monetary authority could damage the Brazilian payments system in the areas of competition, efficiency and data privacy.

2020-06-16	2020-06-16 04:55:21	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	AmEx May Find China Can Live Life Without It	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- After years of trying, American Express Co. is finally cracking into the China market. Now the hard work begins.On Saturday, AmEx got the green light to start processing yuan payments, making it the first of the big three U.S. card companies to get access to the mainland. The license, initially approved in 2018, gives AmEx a portal to some of the world’s biggest spenders, and will pit the company against state-backed China UnionPay Co., which dominates the market. Currently, holders of AmEx, MasterCard Inc. and Visa Inc. cards can only use them for foreign-currency payments outside China or on overseas websites.  Competition will come not just from UnionPay cards, which dominate the market, but also mobile-payment apps, where Ant Financial’s Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat Pay are big players. AmEx’s partner, LianLian, is tiny by comparison. To top it off, China is also testing out the digital yuan, another budding rival in the payment space. “Having a foreign branded card in your wallet used to mean you have made it in China, but now matters little,” says Zennon Kapron, the founder of a fintech consulting firm.Another challenge is that fees in China are lower than in the U.S., so companies need to win scale to make the big bucks: The card-clearing fee rate is 0.065% for domestic banks and the acquiring fee rate ranges from 0.5% to 1%. In the U.S., issuers like AmEx charge between 1.4% and 3.5%. AmEx and its Chinese partner will also have to convince local banks to issue cards processed on their network, and get more merchants to accept them. Because of the high fees it charges compared with rivals, AmEx tends to be used less in Asia and Europe. Still, there is money to be made if AmEx plays its cards right. One strategy that’s worked in the U.S. is offering plenty of rewards. A large card firm told Kapron, the consultant, that even with the thinnest slice of the market, it would still be profitable. There will always be spenders who like premium cards they can use at home and overseas, he says.Banks, too, could benefit from choice beyond UnionPay, notes James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific fintech leader at Ernst & Young LLP in Hong Kong. More competition can only be a good thing for their merchant clients and cardholders.To AmEx’s credit, just getting to this point is a step in the right direction. It’s been a long slog.(2) Both Visa and MasterCard have been waiting since 2006 to gain access to China.  AmEx cleared a key hurdle in early January when regulators accepted its application to start a bank-card clearing business with LianLian. Last March, MasterCard refiled its application, raising its stake in a joint venture with NetsUnion Clearing Corp., or Wanglian, a clearing house for online payments. There’s little clarity on the progress of Visa’s application, which was made in July 2018 without a mainland partner. Of course, there is a whiff of politics in the timing of all this. As tensions between Washington and Beijing intensify amid the coronavirus outbreak, China appears to be holding up its end of the phase one trade deal. The preliminary agreement signed in January included measures to speed up the opening of mainland financial markets, with plans to accelerate approvals for AmEx, MasterCard and Visa, specifically. By starting with AmEx, Beijing is picking off the low-hanging fruit; its mainland partner stands to benefit from any increased business, too.But with Covid-19 wreaking havoc on the economy, it’s going to take more than Beijing’s blessing to get shopaholics back in force, beyond some revenge spending. AmEx, whose slogan is “Don’t Live Life Without It,” may find becoming indispensable in China its toughest sell yet. (1) In 2012, the World Trade Organization ruled in favor of a U.S. claim that argued foreign payment providers should have been given access to the domestic clearing market in 2001, when China acceded to the WTO.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

2020-06-15	2020-06-15 17:41:10	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook Rolling Out WhatsApp Payments in Brazil	(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp messenger launched a payments feature in Brazil, the app’s second-biggest market with more than 120 million users.Payments on WhatsApp will be free for users, whether sending to friends on the app or to pay a business for goods and services. The Facebook unit will charge business owners a fee for purchases and is partnering with Cielo SA, Brazil’s largest payments company, to process transactions.WhatsApp has tested payments in a handful of markets over the past two years, including India and Mexico, but Brazil is the first where the service will go through a full-scale rollout of the feature. Facebook started a small test of the product in Brazil about a month ago, WhatsApp Chief Operating Officer Matt Idema said in an interview, adding that the country is among the leaders when it comes to people using WhatsApp to interact with merchants.Payments are a key element of WhatsApp’s long-term plan to offer commerce within the app -- and Facebook has been testing and building its payments product for the past two years. More than 5 million merchants around the world use a business version of the messenger app, and in countries like India and Brazil, WhatsApp serves as the main or only online presence for many mom-and-pop retailers.WhatsApp wants to be the primary way these small businesses interact with their customers -- a new version of email or a 1-800 number -- and also serve as a storefront for users to buy products, Idema said.Progress to date hasn’t been entirely smooth. In India, WhatsApp’s largest and most important market, regulators have pushed back against Facebook’s payments plan.Read more: WhatsApp Gets a Raw Deal in Payments: Andy MukherjeeStill, WhatsApp has started to push its commerce plans more aggressively after years of questions about its eventual business strategy. In April, Facebook invested $5.7 billion in Reliance Jio, the owner of some of India’s most popular digital services, including a commerce platform called JioMart. In early June, Facebook also revealed it had invested in Gojek, the largest startup in Indonesia, which has evolved from a ride-hailing service to a suite of digital services that includes payments.Facebook’s investments have been geared toward helping WhatsApp better integrate into national economies and give the company more access to local merchants who might want to use the service.Read more: Facebook Seals Biggest Deal Since WhatsApp With AmbaniWhatsApp is relying on what Idema calls an “open partner” model for payments, too. “We want it to be possible for any person to send money to anyone or pay any business inside the app,” he said. “If that’s your vision, then to achieve it you have to have an open partner approach.”Becoming a Facebook partner can be lucrative, at least in the short term. Cielo stock on Monday jumped about 35% after news of the WhatsApp arrangement. Rival payments companies StoneCo Ltd. and PagSeguro Digital Ltd. fell as much as 8.5% and 10%, respectively.In Brazil, that approach means partnering with three banks: Banco do Brasil, Nubank and Sicredi. WhatsApp users who have accounts with any one of those banks will be able to add their Visa Inc. or Mastercard Inc. debit or credit card to Facebook’s payments system for use on the app. Facebook will charge merchants a 3.99% processing fee for accepting payments on WhatsApp.Eventually, this system will also work across Facebook’s apps, Idema said.Users who sign up for payments on WhatsApp will do so through the company’s Facebook Pay feature, which is also rolling out on Messenger and Instagram. Once Facebook makes it possible for users to send messages between all its services -- a long-term project the company announced last year -- they’ll also be able to send money between apps as well.Payments on WhatsApp will be available to those in Brazil in the coming weeks and will expand to other countries soon, said Idema.(Updates with stock prices in the 10th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-rolling-whatsapp-payments-brazil-120000211.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-12	2020-06-12 12:50:56	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Trust Stamp Review: This Insurtech Startup Offers Facial Recognition for Good	"Facial recognition technology has suddenly become very controversial.Source: Shutterstock Both International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently limited their use of the technology in the United States, fearing its abuse by police. The Electronic Frontier Foundation calls it especially bad at recognizing African Americans.This makes it ironic that one of the hottest young companies in insurance technology is Trust Stamp, which builds biometric templates against fraud.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Trust Stamp Review: The BackgroundTrust Stamp was launched through the Advanced Technology Development Center at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, and the MasterCard (NYSE:MA) Start Path accelerator in 2018. Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), a major credit card issuer, was another early backer.  * 7 Great Biotech Stocks to Buy and Hold Now Governments and financial companies all have trouble with identity. Personal identifiable information (PII), like Social Security numbers, isn't supposed to be collected or sorted, and it can also be faked. Trust Stamp gets around this with biometrics.Trust Stamp separates biometric data into 128 metrics. It converts this into what it calls a unique, non-reversible identifying sequence called an ""Evergreen Hash"" or EgHash. Each EgHash acts as ""digital DNA,"" which Trust Stamp calls more unique than a fingerprint. It's also a form of tokenized identity computers can store. Because it can't be reverse engineered, the EgHash is not considered PII and can be stored on a public or private database. You can also share it.One early test case of the EgHash came in 2018, a system created with law enforcement to identify victims of cross-border human trafficking. Another early project is ID4Africa, which was used to test the reliability of the EgHash technology. Who's Behind Trust Stamp?CEO Gareth Genner is an interesting story all by himself.He is a British lawyer and president of a Catholic college, as well as a serial entrepreneur. He launched Trusted Mail, which uses biometrics to secure email, in 2017. Before that he launched Edevate, which uses online courses to create ""micro degrees,"" in 2011.Andrew Gowasack is the technology guy and has been working on Trust Stamp for almost five years, building a team of about a dozen young developers. There are a total of 47 employees. Money Keeps ComingNow Trust Stamp is raising money from all directions, hoping to become a de-facto standard before competitors can launch. Its investor presentation claims that biometrics will help authenticate $2 trillion in transactions by 2023. With authenticators securing about 0.5% of that revenue, that's a $10 billion market.Trust Stamp got $100,000 in startup capital from OnRamp. It has done a standard Series A funding round with over $1 million from MasterCard and other investors. It has also raised almost $3.2 million through SeedInvest, and hopes to raise a total of $5.6 million there.The next step is a public offering. Trust Stamp plans a float of 29 million euros, about $32.4 million, on the Euronext Dublin exchange as early as September. The company has also launched a new research facility in Malta, backed by a government grant.Trust Stamp would be the first IPO done by Euronext Dublin this year. The Bottom LineTrust Stamp is an all-or-nothing deal. If it succeeds, Trust Stamp becomes a standard that can make a ton of money. If it can't get scale, the company could be out of business within a very short time.Trust Stamp faces a host of competitors like Okera, BridgeCrew, Robust Intelligence and Manetu, all working around problems of identity, security and the use of artificial intelligence.It could fail, but it could work.

Over the past month, the stock increased by 14.71%, and in the past year, by 18.31%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently under from its 52 week high by 10.11%.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 18.37 in the Credit Services industry, Mastercard Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 39.69. Shareholders might be inclined to think that Mastercard Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It's also possible that the stock is overvalued.There are many limitations to price to earnings ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings.See more from Benzinga  * A Look Into Mastercard's Price Over Earnings  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * P/E Ratio Insights for Mastercard(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-06-09	2020-06-09 14:36:58	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard Sees Improvement In May Switched Transactions As Lockdown Eases	Mastercard Inc. (MA) said on Tuesday that switched transactions continued to improve since the week ended May 7, partly due to the relaxation of social distancing measures in several markets and the impact of fiscal stimulus in the U.S.The total number of switched transactions by Mastercard fell 7% in the week ended May 28 compared with a 12% drop for the week ended May 7. The improvement comes after switched transactions declined 20% during the month of April.Mastercard said that switched transactions trends were similar to what the credit card company was seeing in switched volumes, as it continues to actively monitor the COVID-19 impact globally.“We have seen a greater improvement in card present growth rates in particular, including in discretionary categories such as clothing, gas, home improvement, restaurants and domestic travel,” Mastercard said in a statement. “Card not present growth rates remain healthy.”From a geographic perspective, Mastercard said it is experiencing positive year-over-year growth rates in some markets that have opened up, including countries such as Italy, Poland and Australia. Meanwhile, cross-border volume continues to be impacted by the travel freeze and remains essentially unchanged.“We continue to see strong demand for our data & analytics and cyber solutions,” Mastercard said. “In Q2, we expect services growth will continue to outperform our core products and deliver positive growth.”Earlier this month, Visa (V) provided a business update indicating a solid uptick in consumer spending from April to May.Since plunging to a multi-year low in March, Mastercard shares have rallied some 52%, recovering all of this year’s losses. The stock was trading little changed at $309.50 in Tuesday’s early morning trading.Five-star analyst Moshe Katri at Wedbush this month raised the stock’s price target to $330 from $300 and maintained a Buy rating, saying that he believes “gradual improvements in card metrics trends, as well as travel spending will help further expand forward P/E multiples from COVID-19's lows, getting closer to pre-COVID-19 levels”.The rest of Wall Street analysts are also bullish on the stock. The Strong Buy consensus boasts 19 Buy ratings versus 3 Hold ratings. Following the recent sharp gains, the $313.10 average price target means shares are almost fully priced.

As a result, investors have been sent scrambling to find the safest dividend stocks to buy.Stocks are reeling, interest rates are plumbing the depths and the specter of defaults and bankruptcies are on the horizon. Income investors now more than ever need to be able to trust their dividend stocks. Hefty yields do no good if a company cuts or suspends its payout. By the same token, even the slimmest yield is immensely valuable if there's little to no chance it will come under duress.In short, income investors need super safe dividend stocks right now, and we know some good ways to find them.One option is to monitor the DIVCON system from exchange-traded fund provider Reality Shares. DIVCON's methodology uses a five-tier rating to provide a snapshot of companies' dividend health, where DIVCON 5 indicates the highest probability for a dividend increase, and DIVCON 1 the highest probability for a dividend cut. And within each of these ratings is a composite score determined by cash flow, earnings, stock buybacks and other factors.These are 15 of the safest dividend stocks to buy right now. Each stock has not only achieved a DIVCON 5 score, but a composite score within the top 10% of all stocks that DIVCON evaluated. This makes them the crème de la crème of dividend safety - and more likely to keep the dividend increases coming going forward.

2020-06-01	2020-06-01 07:32:55	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Anonymous Vows to ‘Expose’ Minneapolis Police, Site Attacked	(Bloomberg) -- The Minneapolis Police Department’s website has shown signs of a cyber-attack since late Saturday, days after a video purported to be from the hacktivist group Anonymous promised retribution for the death of George Floyd during an arrest.Websites for the police department and the city of Minneapolis were temporarily inaccessible on Saturday as protesters in cities around the U.S. marched against police violence aimed at black Americans.By Sunday morning, the pages sometimes required visitors to submit “captchas” to verify they weren’t bots, a tool used to mitigate hacks that attempt to overwhelm pages with automated requests until they stop responding.Officials with the police department and the city didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Anonymous posted a video on their unconfirmed Facebook page on May 28 directed at the Minneapolis police. The post accused them of having a “horrific track record of violence and corruption.”The speaker, wearing a hoodie and the Guy Fawkes mask that’s a well-known symbol of the group, concludes the video with, “we do not trust your corrupt organization to carry out justice, so we will be exposing your many crimes to the world. We are a legion. Expect us.”The video was viewed about 2.7 million times on Facebook, during a weekend in which violence swept the U.S. as protesters clashed with law enforcement and National Guard troops.While many demonstrations have been peaceful, others have devolved into rioting. Several cities issued curfews and police have at times turned their rubber bullets and mace on the activists and on journalists covering the protests.President Donald Trump on Sunday cast blame on the media for stoking the violence that’s followed the death of Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota police custody.Anonymous began appearing as a loose collective of hacktivists around 2003, emerging from message boards like 4chan, and launching attacks against organizations from the Church of Scientology to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the terrorist group ISIS. Among their other targets were Mastercard Inc., white supremacists and members of the Ku Klux Klan.During the Arab Spring in 2011, its hackers took down government websites in Tunisia and Egypt and would go on to infiltrate government websites with distributed denial of service attacks in Malaysia, India, Syria, China and Nigeria.A 2012 cyber attack on PayPal in retaliation for shutting off service to Julian Assange’s Wikileaks cost the company millions.In 2014, Anonymous attacked Ferguson City Hall’s website after Michael Brown was shot and killed, prompting riots throughout the city. The group threatened the St. Louis County police chief with the public release of his personal family information if he didn’t release the name of the police officer who shot Brown. A member of the group initially misidentified the officer. The group then went on to threaten police and the local government with cyber-attacks if protesters were abused or harassed.In the years since several of its members have been arrested and charged with computer crimes and hacking attacks. Among them was Deric Lostutter, who in 2017 was sentenced to two years in federal prison for hacking a high school football team’s website in connection with a 2012 rape case.Last November, James Robinson was sentenced to six years in prison for distributed denial of service attacks on police and local government in Akron, Ohio in 2017.(Updates with Anonymous background from 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anonymous-says-ll-expose-minneapolis-202934147.html?.tsrc=rss

Its focus, addressable market and day-in-day-out ability to execute make V stock one of my favorite blue-chip stock picks.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com Founded in 1958, Visa has grown to become one of the Big Three names in the credit card industry along with Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP).Today, it's a $400 billion behemoth -- and even in light of the novel coronavirus pandemic this year, the company is holding its own, and the stock is reaping the rewards.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere's a look at some of what makes V stock such an attractive pick moving forward: Visa Is Robust and Betting on ItselfIt's almost always good when you see established, blue-chip companies like Visa betting heavily on themselves. That has been the story of 2020 thus far for the credit card giant, beginning the year with the acquisition of the hot fintech startup Plaid for $4.9 billion in cash.  * 7 Red-Hot Vaccine Stocks Racing to Develop a Coronavirus Cure Visa may have been born in the '50s, but you don't earn a value of $400 billion by 2020 if you're not willing to adapt with the times, and the acquisition of Plaid, which helps other fintech firms connect with their customers' bank accounts, is a perfect example of Visa's savvy.Firstly, the move will further entrench Visa in digital payments; it's already the largest credit card network in the U.S., handling $2.1 trillion in transactions last quarter alone. To stay as relevant as it is today, Visa needs to embrace the fintech space and the world of e-commerce. It continued doing just that in the Plaid acquisition.Second, buying Plaid with cash -- instead of, say, a deal financed entirely with V stock -- shows just how much executives believe in the company longer term. The company was saying: ""No, we don't believe our stock is overvalued, and we're willing to put our money where our mouth is.""That sentiment was followed up last quarter as the company bought back $3.2 billion in V stock. Not only that, it reiterated its intentions to buy back $9 billion in Visa shares on the year -- one of the most uncertain years in our lifetimes. Good Earnings, Better Trends for V StockIt's no wonder Visa is beating the market this year. It even managed to boost both revenue and earnings in the difficult March quarter, seeing revenue jump 7% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share increase 9%.Going forward, an increasingly cashless economy will continue to be a long-term tailwind for Visa, and rollouts of contactless card technology will make the company increasingly relevant for in-store purchases as well.Visa's stock is also well-positioned for the unstoppable shift to e-commerce that has been ongoing for years now, and which has been accelerated by the pandemic. Nobody's using cash when shopping on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and that's good for payment processors like Visa, which saw e-commerce volumes rise 18% in April.Visa is one of the rare names that investors can buy and hold for 10 years without sweating whether the company will exist or still be a player. V stock, which has outperformed the market in a very tough year for investors, looks poised to do so for years to come.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-05-29	2020-05-29 16:43:43	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Resilient Square Stock Will Defeat the Bears	"I recently published my top recommendations of the best stocks to buy for a post-coronavirus bump. There are huge opportunities for strong profits as the economy rebounds, so this is a great time for investors. But one of those names, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock, deserves a closer look.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Let's do that now.I'm already on the record as saying I think SQ is the ideal stock to buy for the 21st century economy. Mom-and-pop businesses, food trucks, Girl Scout cookie sales. They all can easily process credit card payments by using Square's dongles attached to a mobile device.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd now that we live in a world touched by the novel coronavirus, people are going to be much less willing to handle cash. In turn, they will be more inclined to make payments with their Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), American Express (NYSE:AXP) or Discover (NYSE:DFS) cards.Even payment options from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) will likely see more traffic as people decide transferring money from person to person isn't the most hygienic thing in the world. SQ Stock at a GlanceSquare is trading close to $80 right now and is up nearly 30% year to date. But that doesn't represent the absolute whipsaw that SQ put investors through so far this year.The stock price fell more than 55% in March as the pandemic shuttered many businesses across the country. And it disproportionally hurt SQ, as a huge percentage of Square's revenue comes from small businesses that make less than $125,000 annually.  * 7 Red-Hot Vaccine Stocks Racing to Develop a Coronavirus Cure The rally really caught fire earlier this month when Square issued its first-quarter earnings, in which the company reported revenue of $1.4 billion that beat Wall Street's estimates of $1.3 billion.Square's Cash App saw its revenue jump nearly 200% to $528 million. The app is becoming more important for users because it offers access to CARES Act stimulus payments approved by Congress.However, Square reported a net loss for the quarter of $106 million as it increased its reserves in preparation for likely loan losses. The company issued a stark warning to investors that, while it should come as no surprise, seems to have scared some analysts off:""We recognize that the macroeconomic environment is having a significant impact on people around the world, including many of our customers. This may cause a variety of outcomes for our financial results in upcoming quarters, depending on the length and severity of the impact from COVID-19, and we expect a material impact to our second-quarter results."" The Bears Are Coming OutSquare has been rallying nicely, but bearish sentiment is emerging. Frankly, the origin of that sentiment is off the mark.Bank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg recently downgraded SQ stock from ""buy"" to ""underperform,"" while expressing doubt that small businesses will be able to bounce back once their government stimulus checks run out.UBS analyst Eric Wasserstrom also issued a downgrade, from ""neutral"" to ""sell,"" while raising his price target from $54 to $63. He cited what he called a ""weak outlook"" for Square's seller business.Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell also issued a downgrade. He said Square will be hurt by small and mid-sized business that he expects will struggle through 2021.With all due respect, the bearish commentary on SQ stock is short-sighted right now.The company is building amazing depth. Square also has Square Register, Square Payroll and Square Capital. These solutions give it the resources to handle both personal and business finance.The company also received approval in March to open its own bank, which opens the door for it to offer personal and business banking services.Cash App also features the Cash Card, which works like a debit card and lets customers buy and sell bitcoin and invest in stocks.

2020-05-26	2020-05-26 13:00:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Amazon-Backed Voice AI Startup DefinedCrowd Sets Sights on IPO	(Bloomberg) -- DefinedCrowd, an Amazon.com Inc.-backed startup that provides data sets to train artificially intelligent speech programs, is setting its sights on a public listing in the next five years as voice interactions between humans and machines become more common.The Seattle-based company raised $50.5 million in a recent funding round led by existing investors, paving the way for an initial public offering within the next five years, Chief Executive Officer Daniela Braga said in an interview. The company declined to comment on its valuation.“It’s the road to an IPO,” Braga said, adding her company’s ambition is to support the development of AI so that people eventually will “communicate with machines the same way we do with humans.”Founded by Braga in 2015, DefinedCrowd curates voice and text data for clients including BMW AG and Mastercard Inc. to train virtual assistants and customer-service chatbots. The company designs the sets to be diverse and balanced, representing certain dialects or age ranges for audiences most likely to use the systems. Revenue grew 656% last year and is expected to triple this year, Braga said.Once the pandemic subsides, Braga said she expects businesses from a range of industries – including telehealth and education – to build AI personal assistants to better serve customers, something that might require more specific data that incorporates an industry’s vocabulary.Amazon, Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have come under fire over revelations they used recordings of customers’ interactions with virtual assistants to train their AI systems. A former contractor working on Apple’s Siri transcription project in Ireland last week complained to European privacy authorities over the “massive violation of the privacy of millions of citizens.” The companies said they’ve made changes to provide users with more control over their data.By contrast, DefinedCrowd uses a crowdsourcing platform, Neevo, to generate data from a paid community of more than 290,000 members in 70 countries. Crowd members are asked to complete tasks like recording their voices or transcribing and annotating recordings rather than pulling data from customers who are using voice AI products.Braga said the newly raised funds will help the company expand its products and nearly double the number of employees in 2020. The company current employs around 268 people. Existing investors that participated in the funding round include Evolution Equity Partners, Kibo Ventures, Portugal Ventures, Bynd Venture Capital, EDP Ventures, and Ironfire Ventures as well as new investors Semapa Next and Hermes GPE.Amazon and Sony Corp., which is also an existing investor, didn’t increase their stakes in the latest round, Braga said, adding it was a strategic move not to increase the involvement of other companies as DefinedCrowd moves toward an IPO.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-backed-voice-ai-startup-130000531.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-22	2020-05-22 16:37:26	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Here’s How PayPal Stock Is Ringing Up Massive Gains	"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock has been a huge winner in 2020. The company has suffered only a modest negative impact from the novel coronavirus. And while the company has had to increase reserves for potential credit losses due to the virus, it's made up for that and more with a huge surge in payments activity. As a result, its shares are up an astounding 39% year-to-date. And for anyone that bought at the March lows, PayPal has soared 76% since the bottom.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com That said, the good news is that Paypal stock could have further to go still. That's because PayPal is one of the best-positioned companies out there for dealing with the current economic environment. With the virus still a lingering threat, who wants to be handling grimy physical cash right now? Many transactions have moved online, and PayPal is there to facilitate them.In the span of a few months, we've seen years worth of economic activity move into the digital realm -- and PayPal is right at the heart of the action. That said, it gets even better. PayPal is seeing demand soar even while the credit card companies are witnessing declining volumes for a reason we'll discuss in a moment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOverall, PayPal is in the sweet spot, and its shareholders are reaping the benefits. Leading The Contactless Retail RevolutionPayPal should be a huge beneficiary of post-coronavirus ""contactless"" retail practices. While contactless retail may seem like a simple phrase, it encompasses a ton of territory. You have traditional e-commerce, curbside pickup, cashier-less checkout in stores, in-app payments and more. The good news is that many of these options put PayPal on equal footing with the credit card networks. Therefore, plastic's traditional monopoly on digital payments is breaking down.  * 10 Stocks on a Bankruptcy Watch Contactless retail is hardly just a U.S. phenomenon either. In the United Kingdom -- for example -- thanks to the coronavirus, a major card company raised the limits on transaction sizes for many contactless payments. For British pound-based commerce, the limit increased from 30 pounds to 50 pounds per transaction. Following the increased limit, the average contactless transaction size has jumped nearly 50%, to 14 pounds each, and the contactless channel is earning tremendous market share, picking up nearly half of purchases within that price range.Of course, skeptics will say that this sort of uptake is happening primarily due to the crisis. And once it passes, people may return to their old ways. Some will, undoubtedly, but many won't. And once people become accustomed to the ease of contactless payments, many shoppers will stick with it forever -- thus increasing PayPal's share of the overall ecosystem. Astounding ResultsOverall, we can see this playing out in the company's most recent operating results. During April, PayPal gained 7.4 million new accounts and grew processed payments 18%. Given the sharp overall drop in economic activity, these are staggering figures. The total commerce pie shrank dramatically during April, yet PayPal managed to produce strong double-digit growth.This is in stark contrast to the major credit card companies. In fact, both Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) suffered 20% or greater declines in transaction activity over the same period.This shows another advantage to PayPal, as it tends to be favored by younger and more online customers who have rising earnings power as they get older. Visa and Mastercard are undoubtedly great brands. However, some of their most profitable business is tied to established business customers who will be reining in spending for the foreseeable future.Up until this crisis, Visa and Mastercard were widely viewed as the most powerful and entrenched payments companies out there. However, as PayPal gains market share, its valuation will continue to catch up with the credit card titans. Paypal Stock VerdictSimply put, PayPal is an innovative market force that will continue to lead. The company was already producing fantastic results before the current pandemic started, and what's going on with the health crisis will be an unbelievable shot of adrenaline for the war on cash. Therefore, as long as people are being careful, PayPal will take more market share -- not only from cash, but also from credit cards.Yes, Paypal stock is rich. It is trading at 46 times forward earnings, and nearly 10 times revenues. Both of those are way up there, but it is deserving of its premium price. The company has grown its earnings at more than 30% a year compounded over the past five years, and analysts see 20% earnings per share (EPS) growth going forward. These are tremendous numbers in any environment, and especially so with the coronavirus-induced recession causing slowdowns for so many other leading companies.Even the credit card companies have been showing signs of weakness thanks to the economic situation. Yet, Visa and Mastercard routinely trade for more than 30x earnings, and were trading for as much as 20x sales prior to the March market crash.Collectively, PayPal doesn't look bad at all by comparison, so don't let its valuation scare you too much. The company's fundamentals fully support a bullish outlook right now.Eric Fry is an award-winning stock picker with numerous ""10-bagger"" calls -- in good markets AND bad. How?

2020-05-14	2020-05-14 07:44:24	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard Sees Steady Improvements As Spending Begins To Recover	Mastercard (MA) has released its updated Q2/20 operating metrics through the week of May 7th, showing continued improvement across all major categories.Notably, MA is starting to see the transition from the Stabilization phase to the Normalization phase beginning in some markets, although it is very early days.The company is monitoring the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and related actions being taken by governments as it relates to border restrictions, social distancing measures and opening of businesses, and the resultant impact on spending levels.The Stabilization phase is characterized by spending stabilizing around new lower levels as a result of compliance with social distancing and mobility limitations. The Normalization phase occurs when these restrictions are relaxed and spending begins to gradually recover from the new lower levels, with some sectors recovering faster than others.Mastercard has now recorded an additional two weeks of activity, and notes that Switched Volume and Switched Transactions are showing improvements over the past two weeks, in part due to the relaxation of social distancing measures in several markets and the impact of fiscal stimulus in the US.For instance, Switched Volumes are now down 12% y/y vs. its previous update (data through the week of April 21), which was down 20% y/y.Additionally, MA continues to see strong demand for its Data & Analytics and Cyber solutions. “In Q2, we expect services growth will continue to outperform our core products and deliver positive growth” says Mastercard.However, Cross-Border Volume continues to be impacted by the decline in travel, although MA has seen modest improvements over the last week in part due to an increase in intra-Europe travel.“Overall recent trends are encouraging, with steady improvements continuing into May, which suggest the uptick was not just an April bounce” comments RBC Capital analyst Daniel Perlin.“Although cross-border remains depressed, we believe investors can put a stake in the ground to create base-case scenarios, which enables a floor to be put in and around cross-border revenues.” He has a buy rating on the stock and $308 price target.Indeed MA scores a bullish Strong Buy Street consensus with 18 recent buy ratings vs just 3 hold ratings. Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $312 indicates 16% upside potential from current levels. MA stock has dropped 10% on a year-to-date basis.

The company defined the &quot;stabilization phase&quot; as spending at new lower levels as a result of social distancing and stay-at-home orders, in place across the globe to stem the spread of the coronavirus. &quot;The normalization phase occurs when these restrictions are relaxed and spending begins to gradually recover from the new lower levels, with some sectors recovering faster than others,&quot; it said. Cross-border volume is still taking a hit by the decline in travel, &quot;although we have seen modest improvements over the last week in part due to an increase in intra-Europe travel,&quot; Mastercard said. Shares of the company rose nearly 3% in the extended session after ending the regular trading day down 1.1%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/524a600f-7cf4-3164-bb32-e7ab1ab62549/mastercard-sees-slight.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-06	2020-05-06 19:10:49	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	7 Safe Dividend Stocks With Big Dividend Growth Potential	Dividend growth might have been an investing staple of the past decade or so. But these past few months, dividend stocks have been pinching their pennies.Dozens of companies have announced dividend cuts or suspensions since the start of March. That includes more than 5% of the S&P; 500 Index. In fact, in April, more S&P; 500 companies reduced or killed off their dividends than announced payout raises.Investors - especially those nearing or in retirement - who are banking on regular cash income have been backed into a corner. The number of dividend stocks that are able to sustain their payouts is thinning, and those that can briskly grow those distributions over time are an even smaller group. (Remember: Income growth is vital; inflation erodes the spending power of stagnant dividends over time.)So where you can you look for dividend growth? Consider the DIVCON system from exchange-traded fund provider Reality Shares. DIVCON uses a five-tier rating, from 1 to 5, to gauge companies' dividend health. A DIVCON 5 rating indicates not just a healthy dividend, but a high likelihood of dividend growth. DIVCON 1 dividend stocks, on the other hand, are the likeliest to cut or suspend their payouts.Within each DIVCON rating is a composite score based on factors including free cash flow-to-dividends, profit growth, buybacks as a percentage of dividends and more.Here are seven safe dividend stocks with big dividend growth potential. Not only do these stocks boast the top DIVCON rating of 5, but they generate enough cash profits to pay their dividend several times over: a good indication that dividend growth will continue well into the future.

2020-04-29	2020-04-29 20:50:13	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: Vaccine Hopes Overcame Contracting GDP	Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) isn't a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but reports out today that the company's drug remdesivir is proving effective in treating the novel coronavirus were one reason why broader equity benchmarks surged.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 jumped 2.66%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on 2.21%  * The Nasdaq Composite soared 3.57%  * Its first-quarter earnings report was bad (no surprise there) and  the company announced it would cut 10% of its workforce, but Boeing (NYSE:BA) was still the Dow's top performer today, surging 6.16%.The remdesivir news took precedence over headlines about first-quarter GDP, which contracted 4.8%. That's the worst shrinkage experienced by the world's largest economy since the dark days of the global financial crisis.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn a related note, the Federal Reserve held interest rates near zero, with Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledging the current quarter will bring more weak economic data while saying the central bank &quot;will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.&quot;  * 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades Powell added that there are &quot;medium-term&quot; risks to the economy, but that didn't derail stocks' ascent today as 26 of 30 Dow components were higher in late trading. Sympathy PlaysBoosted by better-than-expected earnings from rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Dow members American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Visa (NYSE:V) were the next-best performers in the benchmark after Boeing.In the case of American Express, there's probably some likely some remdesivir ebullience behind today's rally. The sooner the coronavirus is put to bed, the sooner business and leisure -- two vital components of the Amex story -- can start rebounding.As for Visa, the Mastercard numbers are notable because the Dow member delivers its own earnings report Thursday after the close. Reopening…MaybeDisney (NYSE:DIS) is facing uncertainty regarding when Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California will reopen, but speculation that the former could open sometime over the next several weeks lifted the stock today.At this point in the coronavirus cycle for companies with heavy tourism exposure, something is better than nothing. But investors banking on more of the same news out of California helping Disney probably shouldn't. Golden State policymakers are under pressure to relax the current stay-at-home order, but it's hard to imagine the state reopening theme parks in the near-term. Apple WarningDon't worry, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) itself isn't issuing a warning in advance of its Thursday afternoon earnings report, but an analyst is telling investors to not expect a major 5G upgrade supercycle for the iPhone maker.&quot;We do not expect 5G to trigger a supercycle and believe the consensus revenue and EPS estimates for 2021 are too optimistic about the impact of 5G on iPhone sale,&quot; said LightShed Partners analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Gallone in a note out earlier today. Retreating From WalmartClosing lower by almost 3%, WalMart (NYSE:WMT) was by far the worst Dow offender today Gordon Haskett's Chuck Grom downgraded the stock, citing valuation concerns. Interestingly, the analyst raised his price target on the retail behemoth to $140 from $130. Go figure. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayNot to be lost in the remdesivir news is the fact that, as noted above, U.S. GDP slid 4.8% in the first three months of the year. That's one way, and an accurate one at that, of quantifying the impact of Covid-19, but long-term consequences may not be as dire as market participants previously believed.&quot;Current economic forecasts, including the most pessimistic, imply long-run economic consequences that are much less severe than the post-global financial crisis impact in both the U.S. and euro area,&quot; according to BlackRock.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-04-29	2020-04-29 16:26:07	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard to Slow Expense Growth Amid a Pause in Buybacks	(Bloomberg) -- Mastercard Inc. shares rose after the company vowed to slow expense growth as the global collapse in overseas travel crimped spending on its network.The firm is reviewing costs as it seeks to lessen the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its business. Operating expenses rose 7.3% to $1.8 billion in the first quarter, Purchase, New York-based Mastercard said Wednesday in a statement. But the company said expenses in the second quarter would only rise by a percentage in the “low single digits” as the firm pares spending on items including travel promotions.“We’re carefully managing our expenses, but we will continue to invest in areas that differentiate our company,” Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga told investors on a conference call on Wednesday.Mastercard shares rose as much as 7.7% Wednesday. The stock has sagged 5.6% this year, compared with a 0.2% decline for the 71-company S&P 500 Information Technology Index.Cross-border spending on cards -- among the most lucrative transactions for Mastercard and its rival Visa Inc. -- fell 3% in the quarter, the first decline in at least two years. The company said that the trend continued this month, with such transactions falling 49% in the week ended April 21.Spending on Mastercard’s network advanced 5.4% to $1.15 trillion, above the $1.13 trillion average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Still, the company said it would suspend its share repurchase activity “due to the continued uncertainty around the duration and severity related to the Covid-19 pandemic.”Appliances, SubscriptionsThe firm has seen a pick-up in spending on its cards after the U.S. government began sending out stimulus checks in recent weeks. Mastercard is also hopeful that spending on debit and prepaid cards will hold up in the crisis.“We’ve started to see more recently, in the last few weeks, the spend has gone into other categories like clothing, like home improvement and appliances,” Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra said in a telephone interview. “We’re seeing recurring subscription services” get a boost as well, he said.Banks have begun to reach out to Mastercard for data and analytics around how to manage their card portfolios, including steps to tighten customers’ lines of credit.“They don’t take a one-size-fits-all approach of ‘Let’s cut credit lines all together,’” Mehra said. “We mine the data to say this is the profile of the customer you’ve got in question, here’s what you want to consider from a credit and underwriting standpoint.”(Updates with CEO, CFO comments starting in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-slow-expense-growth-pandemic-122501412.html?.tsrc=rss

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Just about every investor has heard the adage “buy the rumor, sell the news.” Many have probably traded accordingly. In the bond markets, it’s starting to look as if the strategy was to buy when the Federal Reserve revealed its plans to prop up companies’ debt, then pare back as the central bank prepares to take action.The corporate bond market reacted with nothing short of euphoria each time the Fed unveiled how it would go about backstopping debt from U.S. companies. The largest exchange-traded fund tracking the investment-grade market, known by its ticker LQD, surged 7.4% on March 23, the biggest gain in more than a decade. That was the day the Fed announced the terms in which it would wade into credit markets to an unprecedented degree. LQD popped an additional 4.7% on April 9, when the central bank expanded its program to include “fallen angels” and even junk-bond ETFs. The largest high-yield bond ETF (ticker: HYG) benefited the most, jumping by 6.6%, the most since January 2009.Something strange has happened since then: Neither HYG nor LQD have climbed back to their April 9 levels.Now, part of that can be explained by investors bidding up those ETFs to huge premiums relative to the underlying assets. But that can’t justify the moves of the past week, when prices were aligned with net asset values. While the S&P 500 Index has jumped 4.6% since April 21, LQD is down 0.1% and HYG is up just 0.6%. The same is true of the Bloomberg Barclays indexes tracking the investment-grade and high-yield debt markets. The fading rally also can’t be blamed on a supply-demand imbalance. In the two weeks from April 9 to April 22, investment-grade funds experienced about $8 billion of inflows and high-yield funds added $9.9 billion, according to Refinitiv Lipper data. Even with more companies flocking to the now-open primary market with new offerings, investors have met them with a larger pile of cash. Average yield levels and spreads have barely budged for two weeks.All of this suggests that the Fed simply announcing its corporate credit backstop was enough to swing open the market’s doors and get creditors and lenders back to the table. Or, to borrow words from a Bloomberg News headline this week, the central bank “is already bailing out levered companies.” But it raises questions about whether the facilities will meaningfully lift debt prices once they’re fully operational. In other words, it might be that the central bank’s thought counts just as much — if not more — than actually executing its plans.Indeed, markets are just now discovering some of the more cumbersome and confusing aspects of the Fed’s programs. Bloomberg News’s Erik Schatzker and Craig Torres reported on Tuesday that the stimulus bill to combat the coronavirus pandemic included wording that was “deliberately vague” and “may leave out hundreds of companies with far-flung operations, including Coca-Cola Co., General Electric Co. and Mastercard Inc. No one knows for sure.”Here’s a bit more:The situation is creating headaches for Fed officials at a time when the central bank is playing a critical role preventing the Covid-19 outbreak from crushing the economy, people familiar with the matter said. In practical terms, restricting what it can and can’t do means the Fed might not be to supply all the liquidity needed to prop up prices if there’s another meltdown in credit markets....Also hamstrung is BlackRock Inc., the investment firm retained to manage the corporate lending and bond-buying facilities. Fed officials and BlackRock executives are working out how to execute the program under the legislative constraints, the people said, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issues.Fed Chair Jerome Powell will have a chance to address some of these concerns at his press conference Wednesday after the central bank’s meeting. As of now, all that’s known is the credit facilities are supposed to “go live” in the next few weeks, per an April 17 speech from New York Fed Executive Vice President Daleep Singh.For now, here’s where markets stand: The average corporate bond yields 2.75%, or about 207 basis points more than benchmark Treasuries. On March 20, that yield was 4.58%, or 373 basis points more than Treasuries. Heading into this year, the average spread was less than half the current level, at 93 basis points. High-yield debt yields 774 basis points more than Treasuries, down from as high as 1,100 basis points last month but up from 315 basis points in January.The question for bond investors is whether spreads will further compress as the Fed starts buying. In theory, of course, the answer is yes — a large, price-insensitive buyer is stepping in with up to $750 billion of firepower. But U.S. companies are staring down a crisis that’s unprecedented in any number of ways, and they are just beginning to look ahead to an economic reopening that could be equally as perilous. At best, it will be a slow grind tighter, not hundreds of basis points in less than three weeks.Some money managers have already voiced their views. Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital’s Chief Investment Officer, this week called LQD “the most overvalued asset in the bond market.” The ETF reached as high as $132 on April 9, not far from its record level of $134.53 on March 6. It now stands at $129.20.With so many questions about the path forward, it’s understandable why investors took comfort in knowing the Fed will support the debt markets as companies, governments and individuals muddle their way through in the coming months. But they should be wary of blindly following the central bank. The chance to do so may have already passed, before the Fed bought a single corporate bond.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

And that's the conundrum facing V stock these days.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com The novel coronavirus' impact on the U.S. and global economy has been horrific, with the International Monetary Fund warning of the worst global downturn since the Great Depression. It calls it the &quot;Great Lockdown.&quot;President Donald Trump is eager to have states lift some restrictions as soon as possible. But health experts continue to caution that Americans should continue social distancing efforts so areas of the country that currently have reduced cases don't see a new flare-up.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAll this, of course, is difficult for payment processing companies that rely on a regular stream of credit card activity to churn a profit for investors.Visa is the dominant brand in the space, and despite the recent headwinds is still a quality stock for investors today. Here's a closer look at V stock. Taking a Glance at V StockVisa stock is down more than 11% so far in 2020, but that's an encouraging improvement from where we were just a month ago, when V was down more than 27%.It is outperforming both the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is down 17.6%, and competitor, Mastercard (NYSE:MA), which is down almost 14%.  * 7 Real Estate Stocks to Watch as the Long-Term Impact of the Virus Looms Two other competitors are faring much worse -- American Express (NYSE:AXP), is down 32.3% YTD, while Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) is down a whopping 61.1%.Earnings for V stock are expected on April 22. Analysts are expecting to see the beginnings of the economic slowdown impacting Visa's quarterly revenue and earnings-per-share growth. EPS is expected to be $1.36, versus $1.31 for the same quarter a year ago. Short-Term Prospects for VisaEarnings season began for major banks, and the early results are not good for V stock. Indications that banks are preparing for a huge increase in loan defaults, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) setting aside $8.3 billion in the first quarter for loan losses -- that's $6.8 billion more than last year's first quarter.March retail sales numbers also raise a red flag. Economists had predicted a horrific 8% drop due to the coronavirus pandemic, but even that pessimistic forecast wasn't dire enough -- the final number was an 8.7% drop, which is the biggest fall in retail sales in 28 years.So it won't be surprising at all if Visa takes a beating in the next couple of weeks. Stimulus checks from the federal government started going out this week, but that money will be used for food staples, rent and mortgages, rather than any discretionary spending.Don't panic, though, because I'm confident things will get better for V stock. Long-Term Prospects for VisaFor investors who are looking to take a position in V stock while it's at a discount, there's plenty to appreciate.It's fundamentally sound. Visa is an exceptionally strong company that is able to weather a downturn. With a market cap of $367 billion and its profit margin is an extraordinary 52.6% -- a much better margin than Mastercard, American Express or Discover.It's innovative. Visa doesn't rest on its laurels -- it looks to expand into new opportunities. You can use a Visa card now to buy marijuana, or you can use your Visa rewards program to buy bitcoin.&quot;There's still so much room to grow in consumer payments. You'll see clearly today that there're still many consumers to reach, and there are still enormous opportunity to move consumers to electronic and digital payments,&quot; Visa CEO Al Kelly said at the company's annual investor day event.Visa is aggressive with fintech. Earlier this year, Visa announced it was purchasing the fintech company Plaid for $5.3 billion. Plaid lets its users share financial information and connect their bank accounts with apps and services such as Acorns, Betterment, Chime, Transferwise and Venmo. As roughly 75% of global internet-connected consumers use a fintech service to transfer money, it's incredibly smart for V to get in on that business.Visa offers a consistent dividend. The yield is nothing to write home about -- 0.7% for an annual payout of $1.20 per share. But don't ignore the fact that V stock offers a decent payout ratio of 21.9% with its dividend, or that the payout increased for 11 consecutive years. The Bottom Line for V StockVisa is a dominant player in the payment processing space and an essential company for how people spend and transfer their money.While the company is facing a difficult second quarter and bank earnings may weigh it down further, V stock can be had for a discount and it remains a solid choice for investors today.Visa has an 'A' quantitative grade in my Portfolio Grader tool, and gets a 'B' rating overall. And because it's also a good dividend stock, it gets a 'B' grade in my Dividend Grader as well.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-04-17	2020-04-17 17:25:33	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Lyft Stock Won’t Be Making Investors Money Any Time Soon	One of the last things that anyone needs during a pandemic is a ride-sharing service, especially when travel is restricted and social distancing is the new buzzword. And that's just one of the problems facing Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) stock these days.Source: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com Worse, Lyft isn't even the leader in that space -- the distinction belongs to Uber (NYSE:UBER), which thus has a better opportunity to weather the novel coronavirus downturn.At best, Lyft stock looks like a highly speculative bet. Let's take a closer look.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Lyft Stock at a GlanceTwo months ago, Lyft was trading at better than $50 per share. Now you can have LYFT stock for almost half of that.  * 9 Asian Stocks to Buy for a Post-Coronavirus Recovery Lyft is down 37% so far this year, and that even takes into account a small rally that boosted LYFT in late March. But there is little momentum to push Lyft higher, and indeed, the headwinds are much more powerful.In its most recent earnings report, Lyft reported a net loss of $356 million, which was at least better than the $463 million that it lost in the third-quarter of 2019. Revenue grew by 52%, but that was slower growth than Lyft saw in the previous quarter -- another red flag.The earnings per share loss was -$1.19 on revenue of $1.02 billion. Both of those actually beat Wall Street's pessimistic estimates of -$1.39 per share and revenue of $984 million.For the full year, Lyft guided for revenue of $4.575 billion to $4.65 billion, while Wall Street was expecting revenue of $4.59 billion.Of course, that guidance was issued before the coronavirus shutdown. Competitor Uber says it has seen a 94% decrease in bookings since mid-February. Lyft, which is less diversified than Uber,  is likely seeing similar numbers. Headwinds Facing Lyft StockThis one is a pretty obvious one -- the coronavirus pandemic is being called the &quot;Great Lockdown&quot; and is expected to rival the Great Depression in its impact on the global economy.More than 5 million people in the U.S. filed for unemployment last week, making a total of 22 million filings in the last five weeks. That's a whopping 13.5% of the U.S. labor force.To put this is more perspective -- filings in the past five weeks are more than double the 8.6 million jobs lost in the Great Recession of 2008. And that decline played out over the course of two years, not five weeks.Ordinarily in an economic downturn, you could expect people to turn to Lyft to earn some extra money in the gig economy. But not during a pandemic, when the vast majority of the country is living under some form of stay-at-home orders.Ride-sharing competitor Uber is currently better positioned than Lyft because Uber at least has a food delivery function. It can still make money by having its drivers bring customers food from their favorite restaurants through the Uber Eats app.Lyft doesn't have such a feature and is just now starting to dip its toe into the space. In April, the company announced that it is starting a new on-demand delivery service in selected cities. That service will deliver groceries, meals, medical supplies and other essential needs to customers.Lyft says its drivers can deliver for healthcare organizations, businesses, nonprofits and even government agencies, with payment coming from partner organizations, Lyft and venture co-sponsor, Mastercard (NYSE:MA).About 120,000 drivers have signed up for the service, which would be available in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Phoenix, San Francisco, San Diego and Seattle. It would also be available in Austin, Texas; Orlando, Florida; and San Antonio.But the service, even if it rolls out nationwide, would be like putting a bandage on a leaking dam. Lyft is too late to the delivery game, with the space already carved up by Uber, DoorDash and GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB). The Bottom Line for Lyft StockFortunately for investors, Lyft should survive the coronavirus crisis. The company at one point had a valuation of $16 billion and that's been cut in half, but it still has nearly $3 billion of cash on hand and total debt of only $470 million.And because Lyft primarily works with contractors, it doesn't have a big payroll to handle with lots of idle drivers. Lyft is even encouraging its drivers to go to work for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the short-term as delivery drivers, grocery shoppers and warehouse workers.But for investors, it's not enough to just survive. People who hold Lyft stock want to make money, and there's no real window to do that any time soon.Lyft stock has a sorry D quantitative rating in my Portfolio Grader right now.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

It will return Monday, April 20.If you needed any more proof that the COVID-19 market environment can and will throw investors a curveball, Thursday wasn't an awful day for equities despite another batch of weekly jobless claims numbers that were, well, awful.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 gained 0.57%%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a gain of 0.12%  * The Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.66%  * In a movie investors have to be tired of, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was the Dow's worst performer today, slipping 7.59%.As noted above, jobless claims numbers continue to be alarmingly bad. Last week, 5.245 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits for the first time. However, that was better than the 5.5 million some economists expected and that interpretation of &quot;better&quot; likely supported stocks to some extent today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, the U.S. economy is in unchartered territory, as roughly 22 million workers have filed for unemployment in just four weeks. All of the job gains since the end of the Great Recession are now gone. Another support factor for stocks today was that claims in big states, such as California, Michigan and Pennsylvania, while still bad declined from the prior week.  * 9 Robust Stocks to Buy to Survive a Bear Market Still, jobs data is ugly and will likely remain so over the near-term, likely explaining why 18 of 30 Dow stocks were lower in late trading. Bungling BoeingUsually, Boeing's well-documented struggles are of its own doing, but today the stock tumbled because United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) outgoing CEO Oscar Munoz was rather chatty and none of what he had to say was pleasant.Munoz noted that while the company, a major Boeing customer, is getting federal assistance under the CARES Act, it won't be enough to cover fixed and operating costs. He added the carrier is going to scrap 90% of its flights next month and that layoffs are a possibility, a reversal from a previous stance. Late to the PartySometimes, it's better to be late than to never arrive at all and that may explain why Verizon (NYSE:VZ) gained more than 1% today on news that it's buying video conference service provider BlueJeans Network.Due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, video conferencing is all the rage these days as more Americans work from home. Terms of the deal weren't revealed, but investors apparently like the idea, as Verizon was one of the better Dow performers today. Intel Perks UpIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) was in the Dow winners circle today after chip contract maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) reported better-than-expected earnings. For those familiar with the concept of a &quot;bellwether stock,&quot; Taiwan Semi is one of the bellwethers in the chip space. Guilt by AssociationMastercard (NYSE:MA), not a Dow stock, was stung Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell downgrading the stock today, citing weak travel spending that could weigh on the stock into next year.That ominous summation isn't limited to Mastercard. It's highly relevant to Dow members American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Visa's (NYSE:V), which explains why those stocks followed peer Mastercard lower on Thursday. Walmart WinningWalmart (NYSE:WMT) continues winning as a coronavirus play, ascending to another 52-week high today while extending its gain over the past week to 8.55%. What's interesting about the strength in Walmart is that comes against the backdrop of weak retail sales and easing COVID-19 cases, but of which are risks to this name, but it appears the stock is rebuffing those concerns. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayToday is significant for another reason because at 6 p.m. EST, President Trump will reveal federal guidelines for reopening the economy. It's not unreasonable to expect that with this announcement coming today, the president will point to May 1 as the restart day.Even if it's May 15, things are about to get interesting, politically speaking, because a cadre of Democratic governors from coast to coast appear intent on delaying their states' reopenings.Assuming some states get back to business before others and those in the latter group continue struggling economically, governors can attempt to shift blame to the White House all they want, but that's their own risky gambit, one Trump will remind voters of on the campaign trail.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-04-16	2020-04-16 16:08:20	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook-Backed Libra Plans Multiple Single-Currency Coins	(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. and its partners said their Libra cryptocurrency project will now support multiple versions of the digital coins, the majority of which will be backed by individual fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, as part of changes made to appease skeptical regulators worldwide.The Libra Association, the governing body overseeing the proposed project, redesigned the currency and made other changes responding to financial regulators concerned the effort could undermine the power and control of central banks. The group said Thursday it plans to support multiple Libra stablecoins, with each working like a digital version of a country’s existing currency.The organization has also begun talks with Swiss regulators for a payments license, and hopes to register with FinCEN, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, as a “money services business,” according to Dante Disparte, head of policy for the Libra Association. “We’re working toward a late 2020 readiness timeline” to launch the Libra network, Disparte added.When Facebook unveiled Libra 10 months ago, it intended to create a single global currency that would be pegged to a basket that included fiat currencies, like the U.S. dollar and euro, and securities like treasuries. That plan faced criticism from politicians and regulators worried that Libra could usurp some power from central banks, who use money creation as a tool to influence and protect markets, or be used for black-market purposes, like money laundering.After months of discussions, the Libra Association has backpedaled on those initial plans, though it still hopes to create a version of the Libra currency made up of “a digital composite of some of the single-currency stablecoins,” the organization wrote in a white paper published Thursday. Bloomberg previously reported on the association’s plans to offer multiple versions of the Libra currency. Facebook has said it won’t launch Libra without regulatory approval, but it’s unclear whether the changes will appease critics and financial officials.“Which currency will be adopted and used will vary by use cases,” said Christian Catalini, head economist for Facebook’s Calibra division, which created the project. He suggested that when sending money across borders, the multicurrency Libra could be a better option, whereas the single-currency stablecoins would make more sense for everyday purchases in a consumer’s home country.The restructuring could help Libra with regulation. The original plan led some to characterize Libra as a security, a designation that brings much greater regulatory oversight. Some central banks also worried that a popular coin backed by a basket of currencies would undermine their ability to manage fluctuations of their home currency, a concern the Libra Association acknowledged in its white paper.The changes could also potentially clear the way for more companies to join the association as members, perhaps lowering the risk of backlash from regulators. Many of the original high-profile participants left the organization before it signed a charter, including Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. Disparte said that adding banks as partners on the project is a “massive priority.” The association will need banks, for example, to help manage the reserve funds for the Libra currency. “We’re not a banking institution and we don’t aim to be,” he said.Included in the association’s update was a change in plans for its Libra blockchain. Last year, the group said it planned to eventually let anybody participate in running its network -- not just members -- the way anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network. Now Libra is backpedaling to say that anyone who wants to verify transactions on the network will need to gain certain approvals. The exact approvals process is still being worked out.The Libra association, which was officially formed in October, is still taking shape, Disparte said. The group has added two new members since concluding its charter, including Shopify Inc., which provides e-commerce tools, and now has 22 in total. It also hopes to hire a chief executive officer by the end of the second quarter.Member companies have contributed financially to pay for the association’s operations, Disparte said, adding that Facebook, the largest member and the project’s founder, is providing less than 10% of this money. Still, that means it’s likely paying more than some of the association’s other 21 members. An association spokesperson declined to explain why.(Includes association’s plan to add banking partners in the eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-backed-libra-plans-multiple-160820544.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-16	2020-04-16 14:48:21	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	P/E Ratio Insights for Mastercard	In the current market session, Mastercard Inc. (NYSE: MA) is trading at $249.96, after a 2.8% drop. However, over the past month, the stock spiked by 10.05%, and in the past year, by 2.85%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 28.02%.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 9.69 in the credit services industry, Mastercard has a higher P/E ratio of 32.39. Shareholders might be inclined to think that Mastercard Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It's also possible that the stock is overvalued.P/E ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance. Depending on the earnings makeup of a company, investors may be unable to attain key insights from trailing earnings.See more from Benzinga  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

They calmly scooped up shares of their own companies at an insider buying rate we haven't seen in a decade.Here's some useful market insight: When investors and the media are super-negative and insiders are buying in droves, that's often a great time to purchase stocks for the medium-term, which is at least two or three years.Here's another bullish signal from insider trading: Many insiders are buying companies in the &quot;wrong&quot; places. They're decidedly going for stocks in energy, basic materials (such as chemicals) and consumer-facing businesses. These are all among the hardest-hit areas of the market, with more to lose in a prolonged recession.This all adds up to the boldest &quot;contrarian&quot; insider trading buy signal that I've ever seen in the 10 years I've tracked insider activity as a starting point for investment ideas in my stock letter Brush Up on Stocks.Here are seven blue-chip stocks that have experienced significant insider buying lately. Insider buying, like any other signal, isn't a guarantee of anything. So to improve our chances of success, we narrowed down a list of companies seeing heavy insider buying to make sure we're buying high-quality names. Thus, this list is made up of blue-chip companies with market values of at least $20 billion that boast enduring, powerful brands and/or some other barriers to entry.

2020-03-27	2020-03-27 18:08:03	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa Delays Fee Changes, Might Also Give Gas Stations Relief	(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc. is considering a reprieve for gas stations straining under an October deadline to upgrade their pumps, and, along with Mastercard Inc., delayed a set of fee changes that were to take effect next month.The moves are aimed at sending relief to merchants struggling to remain afloat as the coronavirus puts a virtual halt to global travel and governments order businesses to shut.“Now, more than ever, we’re putting all our power, capabilities, and technology to work to keep commerce flowing,” Seth Eisen, a spokesman for Mastercard, said in a statement. “To help our customers and partners manage through this unprecedented event, we are pausing updates to some systems while delivering the same level of security and service they receive every day.”Visa and Mastercard will delay until July the planned changes to interchange fees, which are paid by retailers each time a consumer swipes their card at checkout.“We are actively implementing and considering a number of ways we can proactively support our clients to ensure the stability, security, reliability and resiliency of the digital payments ecosystem,” said Will Stickney, a spokesman for Visa.The change was welcome news for retailers. The Merchant Advisory Group said the move would “provide needed relief to some of the hardest-hit businesses while ensuring electronic-payment processing continues to work in the seamless fashion as they do today.”Fuel PumpsVisa might also postpone a deadline for gas-station operators to upgrade their fuel pumps to accept chip cards, according to a person familiar with the matter.Fuel retailers currently have until Oct. 1 to upgrade their pumps. Those that don’t will have to start taking on responsibility for the costs related to fraud that happens at their facilities.Merchants have complained that the new machines are costly, and say it’s hard to find workers to install the pumps as more businesses shut because of the virus.“Nobody planned for the disruption of the pandemic delaying everything,” said Dan Rasmussen, a senior vice president at Hughes Network Systems, which helps retailers ready their systems to accept chip cards. Major oil companies including BP Plc, Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp. have been “applying quite a bit of pressure on the retailers to move and get the orders in and start progressing.”The world’s largest payment networks have seen their stocks battered as the pandemic severely curtails spending on the firms’ networks, prompting Mastercard to abandon its full-year revenue guidance this week.Read more about restaurants pushing to lower card feesVisa Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly on Thursday pledged his company wouldn’t initiate any layoffs due to the global pandemic in 2020. The company has previously warned that the slowdown in cardholders’ overseas spending would likely crimp its outlook for revenue growth.“There is enough sadness in the world and already too many families impacted by job losses,” Kelly said in a LinkedIn post. “I have no interest in contributing to that.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-delays-fee-changes-might-180803859.html?.tsrc=rss

While life will eventually go on and people will begin shopping once again, Visa (NYSE:V) stock may still have downside ahead.Source: Teerawit Chankowet / Shutterstock.com Don't get me wrong, I love Visa from a company standpoint, and have owned Visa for a very long time. In fact, it's one of the longest-held stocks in my long-term portfolio. I  was lucky enough to pare down that position at $200, and even though I felt silly as the stock continued even higher, that rally felt overdone.Given the latest pullback, I've had an opportunity to once more add to my stake. But I have reservations about building back a full position, even though V stock is 14.5% off its highs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Coronavirus and V StockThe coronavirus isn't the only reason I'm concerned about Visa, but it's the one I'll begin with. There seems to be two camps when it comes to the virus. One thinks the world is going to end and the other thinks it's nearly a hoax.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy After The Market's Historic Sell-Off Those are extreme examples, but that's kind of the point. We have some people stocking up on supplies and others that still won't wash their hands. But one thing that's hard to deny is the economic impact. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) slashing guidance, Delta (NYSE:DAL) reducing capacity and all sorts of events being cancelled are just a few examples.People pay for these services with credit cards. They're not necessarily all Visa cards, but they are cards. As we shift to a cashless society, there's certainly a secular trend for companies like Visa to ride. However, when people stop spending -- even temporarily -- it's a dagger for credit card companies.Management is already acknowledging the impact. On March 2nd, company management said it expects a 2.5% to 3.5% impact to second-quarter revenue. They did not provide a full-year update though, and plan to do so when the company reports earnings.It's hard to be optimistic with so many economic pauses taking place around the world, that a company like Visa won't feel the impact. Oil Prices Are Getting CreamedI expect the economy to be okay, despite the headlines from the virus, stock market and oil prices. At least, that's my glass-half-full approach at this point in time. If plunging oil prices will eventually lead to falling gas prices, and the economy stays relatively healthy, it will be a huge win for U.S. consumers.Maybe that will offset the negative impact Visa feels at the pump. You see, when the price of gas falls, the sum at the gas pump is lower, which hurts the top line for credit card companies. Now maybe consumers make up for that elsewhere -- like the mall -- or maybe they don't.Either way, lower gas prices are surprisingly a risk for V stock and its peers, even as consumers benefit. Peer PanicVisa stock is still well above its 52-week low, which was set one year ago down at $148.02. Obviously that figure will change as we lap the annual range, but it goes to show how well V stock has been holding up.Down 14.5% after Monday's notable market-wide bounce, it's outperforming peers like MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). MasterCard has fallen 19% from its highs, while Amex has dropped more than 25.5% and recently hit new 52-week lows.It's possible that V stock has bottomed, hitting $168.31 on March 9th. If that's the case, then great. Bulls need the stock to reclaim and maintain above its 200-day moving average, then work on getting back above the $190 to $192 area. If it hasn't bottomed, a decline similar to its peers could be in store. a 25% decline from the highs would put V stock down to $160, for reference.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comI could be totally wrong about Visa. With a small position in the name, I hope that I am. But I can't help but be cautious when I see companies cutting guidance, events being cancelled and oil prices falling. Visa will come out of this situation as strong as ever, but I believe the impact will be more than just the second quarter and that V stock could correct further as a result.Will it be enough to thrust it to 52-week lows? Maybe not, but I'm certainly cautious right now.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long AAPL and V.

2020-03-12	2020-03-12 20:41:41	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Dow Jones Today: First Comes The Bear Market, Then a Recession?	With the coronavirus death tally surpassing 1,000 in Italy -- the Eurozone's third-largest economy -- and little clarity on when the U.S. will get a handle on the situation, stocks continue sliding in dramatic fashion today, confirming the end of one of history's most glorified bull markets as of Wednesday.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 tumbled 9.51%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 9.99%  * The Nasdaq Composite gave up 9.43%  * Familiar offenders Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) were vying for the dubious honor of worst-performing Dow stock today, though International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) was in that ominous mix as well.There's an old saying in financial circles that goes something like &quot;history doesn't always repeat, but it often rhymes.&quot; Assuming that's true, and it often is, add history to the list of hurdles currently confounding stocks because history says that only twice over the past 93 years -- 1966 and 1987 -- was a 20% or more decline in the S&P 500 not followed by U.S. economic contraction a year later.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo there's hope tto cling to, because the recession indicator, like every other indicator, doesn't come with a 100% rate of repeat. However, hope maybe a dangerous tonic these days when acknowledging that equity markets are leading, not lagging indicators, meaning they're usually reliable gauges of economic conditions.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy After The Market's Historic Sell-Off And we're back to a familiar place: not one of the Dow's 30 member firms were higher in late trading. Worse yet, roughly 10 were saddled with or close to double-digit losses. Boeing Bad News ContinuesAt this point, anything even remotely resembling good news regarding Boeing would be shocking. Alas, more bad news it is. Earlier today, JPMorgan downgraded the beleaguered industrial stock to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;overweight&quot; while lowering its price target to $160 from $210.Problem with that price target is it could be violated to the downside while I'm writing this piece or as soon as Friday. At this writing, Boeing resides just over $160 and is on pace for its lowest closing handle since early 2017. Weird Disney SituationAny speculation that Disney (NYSE:DIS) would be an anti-coronavirus play due to its streaming exposure has long been out the window, but the stock was among the double-digit loser club today amid some interesting news.Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and California health officials recommended that business, groups and anyone else planning a gathering of 250 or more people scrap those events. However, that advisory doesn't pertain to theme parks, including Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif..That's all well and good, but DIS stock paints a picture of markets suspecting that no one wants to go to Disneyland and Disney World amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Even if they do, it's raining in Southern California and that should rightly keep some folks at home. Misplaced Rosy AssumptionsVisa (NYSE:V) was pounded today, though it wasn't in the double-digit loser club, after Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Donat said outlooks from Visa and rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are too optimistic given the coronavirus outbreak.&quot;We now expect COVID-19 to have a more negative impact,&quot; said Donat in a note to clients. &quot;We now think that the revised outlooks for both companies are overly optimistic…However, with the virus spreading to Europe and North America, we now expect impacts not just on cross-border activity but also on domestic spending activity&quot;Weakness in V and MA today could easily be one reason why American Express (NYSE:AXP) was one of the worst-performing Dow stocks on Thursday as well. Caterpillar Cranks LowerConfirming speculation that the global economy is under substantial duress, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) slumped 9% reported the weakest machine sales since late 2016.CAT stock is lower by about 40% year-to-date and the industrial machinery giant is off to its worst start to a year since 2009. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayArguably the biggest risk now facing stocks, beyond the obvious of lack of COVID-19 containment, is that monetary policy response to the situation isn't being embraced by investors. Today, the Federal Reserve said it plans to inject at least $1 trillion into the banking system as soon as next week and it's pledging to buy more bonds.However, today's market action suggests investors want more and after a recent 50-basis point interest rate cut was greeted with muted reaction, the Fed may have no choice but to buy more bonds in a bid to stave off a lengthy recession.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-03-11	2020-03-11 07:13:49	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Gates Foundation, Mastercard, Wellcome Commit $125M Funding To Speed Up Coronavirus Treatment	Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has teamed up with Mastercard Inc. (NYSE: MA) and the Wellcome Trust to launch a &quot;COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator,&quot; it announced Tuesday.What Happened The accelerator, launched with a $125 million seed funding, would be used to speed up the response to the novel coronavirus outbreak, including &quot;identifying, assessing, developing, and scaling-up&quot; treatments.The Gates Foundation and London-based non-profit organization Wellcome will contribute $50 million each to the fund with the Mastercard Impact Fund contributing the rest $25 million, according to the statement.The non-profit organization of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates had previously announced $100 million funding in the fight against the coronavirus spread in February.The accelerator is part of the previously announced fund, Gates Foundation said. It will focus on evaluating and speeding up the availability of both new and repurposed drugs and biologics that could be used to treat COVID-19.The Gates Foundation said that the new fund would continue beyond the COVID-19 outbreak, and similarly support the solutions for other viral pathogens as its long-term goal.&quot;Viruses like COVID-19 spread rapidly, but the development of vaccines and treatments to stop them moves slowly,&quot; the foundation's chief executive officer Mark Suzman said.&quot;If we want to make the world safe from outbreaks like COVID-19, particularly for those most vulnerable, then we need to find a way to make research and development move faster.&quot;Why It Matters The coronavirus continues to spread globally, with more than 119,000 confirmed cases worldwide, including 4,284 deaths. Analysts have expressed concerns over the ability of public health infrastructure, especially in less developed countries, to be able to bear the burden of mass spread.Several pharmaceutical companies have signaled progress in developing an antiviral for the COVID-19, but a treatment for the virus at a mass scale isn't expected to be available until at least next year.  Both Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: INO) and Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ: MRNA) are expecting to see clinical trials for their vaccines in April.Price Action Mirosoft shares closed 6.84% higher at $160.92 on Tuesday and traded 1.63% lower at $158.30 in the after-hours session.Photo Credit: Public domain photo via Wikimedia.See more from Benzinga  * Michigan Declares State Of Emergency As First Coronavirus Case Confirmed  * Massachusetts, Colorado Declare State Of Emergency Over Coronavirus Spread  * Tesla Searches For New Gigafactory Sites In US(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The company has seen &quot;no discernible impact&quot; on its Europe or Americas business through early March, according to Sloan's comments at a Wolfe Research conference Tuesday afternoon. Shares are up nearly 7% in afternoon trading. Sloan now expects a negative impact of $15 million from Asia, excluding Australia and New Zealand, but he said that Asia-Pacific represents 4% of company revenue and Global Payments anticipates that it will &quot;absorb the $15 million revenue headwind in the first quarter from Asia Pacific in our revenue guidance.&quot; Sloan doesn't project any impact on earnings per share. &quot;We view the reaffirmed guidance and limited exposure to the coronavirus thus far as a positive,&quot; Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Steven Kwok wrote in a note to clients.

2020-03-03	2020-03-03 13:13:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa lowers revenue outlook as coronavirus drives 'sharp slowdown of our cross-border business'	Visa Inc.  said late Monday that it expects the coronavirus outbreak to result in fiscal second-quarter revenue that is about 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points lower than the previously issued range of &quot;low double-digit net revenue growth in constant dollars&quot; that Visa gave with its latest earnings report in January. The company disclosed in a Monday filing that the coronavirus was having a &quot;significant impact&quot; on Asia-related travel that has caused a &quot;sharp slowdown of our cross-border business&quot; for both card-present and card-not-present travel spending. Visa said that cross-border e-commerce spending unrelated to travel hasn't seen a significant negative impact, expect in certain Asia markets. &quot;In markets where Visa processes the majority of our transactions, domestic spending growth, both credit and debit, remains largely stable with the exception of some impact in Hong Kong and Singapore,&quot; the company said in its filing. Visa joins Mastercard Inc.  and PayPal Holdings Inc. , both of which warned in recent weeks of negative coronavirus impacts. Visa shares are down 0.2% in premarket trading Tuesday, and they're off 4.2% over the past month as the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has slipped 6%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3259a9c7-409f-3cde-bacd-b5331a2203e6/visa-lowers-revenue-outlook.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-28	2020-02-28 18:11:58	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Coronavirus Hasn’t “Maxed Out” MA Stock Just Yet	Obviously, the coronavirus from China has devastated virtually all publicly traded companies. But for credit-card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA), the outbreak came at a truly awkward time. Just as the virus was lurching forward to becoming a pandemic, Mastercard announced a change at the top. Is the executive changeup enough to shift the narrative for MA stock?Source: Alexander Yakimov / Shutterstock.com In the near term, no. As I'll discuss in greater detail below, the coronavirus is spiraling out of control. One of the biggest takeaways is that international health officials failed the first battle: keeping the coronavirus contained in China. With the outbreak having rippled through 56 countries and one international conveyance -- the Diamond Princess cruise liner -- things are bad and will get worse.On a basic level then, the crisis -- a black swan event, really -- should negatively affect MA stock. Like other financial institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) or Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Mastercard is a bellwether stock. Essentially, these stocks are a real-time indicator of true consumer sentiment. Because of this, volatility in the share price doesn't bode well for the broader markets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBefore you get any ideas about playing the contrarian on MA stock, consider the hard facts. On February 25, Mastercard shares dropped 6.7% against the prior session. That places it among the worst single-day performances in Mastercard history (coming in at the 22nd worst day, to be exact).  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip Further, on February 27, MA stock dropped 17% over a five-day period. That's the fourth-worst five-day span in the equity's history. And with pessimistic news continuing to trickle in, we could realistically be staring down the barrel of a dubious new record.So, should you be worried about Mastercard? Only if you have substantial funds levered to the markets. Coronavirus Is a Potential Timebomb for MA StockI realize that there are still many analysts urging people to take the coronavirus into perspective. Honestly, I marvel at their boldness in light of growing evidence that this outbreak has no true modern parallel.Yes, when you chart the cumulative number of coronavirus cases on a logarithmic scale, it certainly appears that the outbreak is fading. But I believe that such charts are deceptive because they're levered mostly to China cases. However, in other parts of the world, the virus is just hitting its stride.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto On February 16, the daily growth rate of China cases measured 3%. By February 27, the rate had dropped to 0.42%. Hence, the slowing in overall coronavirus cases. However, during the same time period, the growth rate of cases outside China skyrocketed to 28.7% from a more manageable 12%.From another angle, non-China cases represented just under 1.1% on Feb. 16. Fast forward to Feb. 27, these cases now represent nearly 5.2%. In other words, after the coronavirus first strikes a country, we should expect a rapid, exponential deterioration.This might seem like fear-mongering, but I assure you there's no hyperbole. In Italy, one person sparked a domino effect that has so far infected 655 people and killed 17. From what I understand, Italian authorities have still not found &quot;patient zero,&quot; their nation's first carrier of the disease. The crisis erupted in a matter of days.Or consider South Korea. What was once a marginally impacted country now has over 2,000 cases. To put this into perspective, the figure is more than the combined totals for Japan and the Diamond Princess cruise liner.Thus, the risk isn't about overstating the impact of the coronavirus. Instead, I think one loses credibility if they don't take this outbreak seriously enough. And with such devastation across the globe, the big picture isn't conducive for MA stock. So When Should You Buy Into Mastercard?Over the long run, I believe shares of Mastercard will present a buying opportunity. However, I don't think that opportunity is now, as investors realize this outbreak is here to stay for awhile longer than most anticipated. To recap earlier points, I'm hesitant for these reasons:  * The five-day loss of 17% is incredibly worrying; the last time we saw such scale was only during the 2008 financial meltdown. Keep in mind that Mastercard's all-time record for a five-day loss is 19.5%, set on Jan. 20, 2009. These numbers do not inspire confidence  * The rate of coronavirus transmission is escalating across the globe at an uncomfortably quick pace. With an implied (though simplistic) fatality rate of over 3%, the virus has the potential to kill millions if it spreads as fast as the common flu.  * We've already witnessed three crises -- the Diamond Princess, South Korea and Italy -- balloon from one case to hundreds (or even thousands) in a matter of days, so it's fair to assume that circumstances will worsen before they get better.Here's my play for investors deadset on MA stock: first and foremost, protect yourself and your family. Next, wait out the markets for a few weeks. I'm almost certain the discount today isn't the floor for Mastercard.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The company reaffirmed its outlook for adjusted earnings of 76 cents to 78 cents a share.“PayPal’s business trends remain strong; however, international cross-border e-commerce activity has been negatively impacted by COVID-19,” the company said in a statement Thursday. PayPal said it expects the “negative impact from COVID-19” to be about a one percentage-point reduction to revenue growth for the first quarter.PayPal shares were little changed in morning trading in New York on Thursday. The stock has dropped about 10% in the past week. Companies have begun lowering forecasts as the deadly virus spreads from China to Europe, the Middle East and the U.S. Federal health officials warned earlier this week that the illness will almost certainly spread in the U.S. and that people should prepare for significant disruptions in daily life, including school closings, cancellations of sporting events, concerts and business meetings.On Wednesday Microsoft Corp. reduced its quarterly outlook, following Apple Inc. and HP, because of supply-chain disruptions related to the virus. Mastercard Inc. also lowered its forecast for quarterly revenue growth as the virus curbs international travel and takes a bite out of e-commerce.Anxious investors have driven five consecutive days of stock market losses in the U.S., erasing the benchmark S&P 500 index’s gains for the year.(Updates with shares in fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Molly Schuetz, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-cuts-first-quarter-revenue-145903357.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-24	2020-02-24 23:45:44	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard Cuts Revenue Forecast as Coronavirus Hits Travel	(Bloomberg) -- Mastercard Inc. lowered its three-week-old forecast for quarterly revenue growth as the spreading coronavirus curbs international travel and even takes a bite out of e-commerce, a business executives had hoped would be immune.The credit-card network said it’s knocking 2 to 3 percentage points off the prediction it made on an earnings conference call Jan. 29. That translates to growth of 9% to 10% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions, it said Monday. Shares of Mastercard and Visa Inc. dropped in after-hours trading.“Cross-border travel, and to a lesser extent cross-border e-commerce growth, is being impacted,” Mastercard said in a statement. “There are many unknowns as to the duration and severity of the situation and we are closely monitoring it.”The short-lived forecast underscores how quickly the virus is altering consumer behavior as it moves beyond China. Mastercard executives had previously taken comfort in the fact that much of the firm’s business into and out of China is e-commerce, which could potentially continue amid measures to contain the disease.“It provides some level of a hedge,” Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra had told analysts on Jan. 29. But even back then, Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga quickly cautioned that the firm would “take a look at those numbers once again” if the crisis worsened and affected more parts of the globe.On Monday, United Airlines Holdings Inc. withdrew its 2020 profit forecast, also citing the virus.Mastercard’s shares fell 4.4% during regular trading Monday after a spike in infections in countries including South Korea and Italy triggered a global selloff. The stock then dropped an additional 1.1% after hours at 6:30 p.m. in New York. Visa fell 1.7%.If the impact of the virus is limited to the first quarter, annual net revenue growth will probably be at the low end of the low-teens range, Mastercard said on Monday, noting that it plans to give further updates on its next earnings call.Visa CEO Al Kelly told investors at his company’s investor day Feb. 11 that it was “too early to tell” what impact the virus might have on results.“But if planes are not flying in and out of China, if hotels are not being filled -- which they’re not at the moment -- and if the supply chains are being impacted -- which I suspect they are -- there is going to be some impact,” Kelly said.(Updates with stock moves, background on forecast and Visa from second paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Jenny Surane in New York at jsurane4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Further approval will also be needed after the preparations are over, it said in a statement.China is opening up its financial markets this year to allow foreign firms to set up fully owned operations to run insurance businesses, asset management and investment banking. Back in June 2015, it eased rules to allow foreign bank-card clearing providers to obtain licenses by setting up units or acquiring a local company, ending a monopoly by state-run China UnionPay Co.Read more on how payments firms are gaining access to the Chinese marketAs part of the trade deal, Chinese regulators said they would take no longer than 90 days to consider applications from providers of electronic-payments services such as Mastercard, Visa Inc. and American Express Co. Mastercard set up its majority-owned joint venture nearly a year ago.Mastercard and Visa have long complained that their delayed entrance into China means they’ll be pitting themselves against large domestic players in a market that has seen mobile payments explode in recent years. Mobile transactions topped 190 trillion yuan ($27 trillion) in China in 2018, making it the world’s largest such market, according to iResearch.China had 8.2 billion bank cards in circulation at the end of September, with 90% of them debit cards.American Express Co. also cleared a key hurdle in its bid to accessing China after the central bank last month accepted its application to start a bank card clearing business. A decision to accept the application signals that it’s moving closer to final approval.(Updates throughout with context)To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Lucille Liu in Beijing at xliu621@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Candice Zachariahs at czachariahs2@bloomberg.net, Jonas BergmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-wins-approval-enter-china-092226115.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-02-11	2020-02-11 09:30:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	China's central bank approves Mastercard joint venture for clearing business	China's central bank on Tuesday said it had approved an application from Mastercard's joint venture to establish a bank card clearing business in China, a major step in the US company's decades-long march to enter the yuan payment and clearing market.Netsunion was established in 2017 and all third-party payment services involving bank accounts must go through its platforms, cutting direct clearing between banks and service providers such as Alipay and Wechat Pay, and giving Beijing access to data on all mobile transactions.Mastercard said in a statement that the company will &quot;be able to apply to the People's Bank of China for formal approval to begin domestic bank card clearing activity&quot; within a year.The approval by China was granted three weeks after Beijing and Washington signed their phase one trade deal, in which China promised it would further open its domestic financial market to firms from the United States.The central bank said in a statement that the approval reflects China's commitment of &quot;opening up the financial sector&quot;, but it did not mention the partial trade deal.&quot;For the next step in the opening up [of the financial system], the People's Bank of China will deal with bank card applicants in an open, just, and fair manner while improving supervision and maintaining financial stability,&quot; the PBOC statement said.Beijing has long insisted on state control of key financial infrastructure, including the clearing and online payment market, despite Washington's insistence on wider access to the Chinese market.Mastercard set up a representative office in China as early as 1988, when bank cards barely existed in the country. But it has struggled ever since to access users of bank cards.China UnionPay has emerged as a home-grown alternative to Mastercard and Visa. In addition to its near monopoly in the Chinese market, UnionPay is rapidly expanding around the world and now has a presence in 177 countries with more than 100 million cards issued overseas.The World Trade Organisation in 2012 sided with the US that China had unfairly discriminated against American bank card firms and must open its market. US trade officials say China's slow response to the ruling is a prime example of Beijing's unwillingness to keep to promises and has used it as justification for an enforcement mechanism in the phase one deal.The Mastercard Netsunion Information Technology joint venture comes after the US company's first partnership with a local firm failed to crack the domestic market.Visa International, another US bank card giant, is still waiting for government approval of its Chinese operations. This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

2020-02-07	2020-02-07 19:45:41	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	For Square, 25% Upside Is Achievable in a Cashless Future	While Square (NYSE:SQ) has ushered in a revolution of cashless payments, investors aren't giving it the credit it deserves. Sure, SQ stock's 2020 performance is nothing short of eye-opening, attracting a near-25% gain year-to-date. But shares still sit more than 20% below their highs from October 2018.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com I expect the rally to continue once more investors recognize its opportunity. When that happens, Square will return to $100-plus for good.Square's opportunity in payments simply is too large for SQ to keep lagging other stocks in its sector. With new markets only adding to the company's potential, Square should have not just years, but decades, of growth ahead.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven though SQ stock isn't cheap, that kind of growth simply isn't priced in. The Opportunity in PaymentsSquare's simple dongle revolutionized payments by turning any smartphone into a credit card swipe. The company, of course, has come a long way since then.Square has expanded into ever-improved point of sale systems that improve the experience for both the customer and the retailer. Its software offerings go well beyond payments to payroll, accounting and appointment scheduling.  * 7 'A'-Rated Stocks Under $5 to Buy Now Everything a small business might need, Square now offers. And the company doesn't just serve small businesses anymore. Sellers with over $500,000 in annual revenue now drive over one-quarter of the company's total payment volume.Again, the world is going to become cashless. I personally use cash maybe once a month, if that -- and I know I'm not alone. Square is a big part of the disruption in how American consumers pay for goods and services -- and will benefit from that disruption going forward.More and more small businesses will drive their payments through Square's point-of-sale (POS) systems. Growth in online sales, too, will add to payment volume -- and Square revenue. And the company has barely cracked the international market: overseas revenue was barely 5% of the company's total in the first nine months of 2019.To top it off, Square Cash is seeing increasing adoption. That product seems to be outperforming PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo. Square still isn't getting much revenue from Square Cash -- but with billions of dollars in transfers annually, it will. Additional Growth DriversOf course, Square has two key growth drivers beyond payments and Square Cash. The company has been forward-thinking in cryptocurrency, becoming one of the first payment companies to process bitcoin transactions. That's now a big business for Square: bitcoin revenue nearly tripled in the first three quarters of 2019, and totaled nearly $340 million.That makes SQ stock an intriguing play on Bitcoin. And as I've written on this site, I believe the price of Bitcoin will soar, potentially to as high as $100,000. The coming &quot;halvening&quot; should be a huge upside catalyst for the price. Square, more so than any publicly traded payments company, should profit.Square stock offers exposure to another significant trend: cannabidiol, more commonly referred to as CBD. The company launched its CBD offering last year, providing an all-in-one solution for sellers targeting that potentially enormous market.Admittedly, CBD sales have been somewhat disappointing of late, largely due to unclear guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But CBD will be a large and fast-growing market. Square should be at the forefront of that growth. Why SQ Stock Should Catch UpSquare simply has multiple opportunities to drive growth for years to come. Yet, again, that's done little for SQ stock. It's lagged for nearly 18 months now -- while other payment stocks have soared.Both Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) trade near all-time highs. Each stock has gained more than 40% over the past twelve months. PYPL stock is tracking new highs. Small business play Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has been perhaps the market's best stock in recent years.Even with its YTD run, however, SQ stock is well below its past highs. Admittedly, the stock doesn't look cheap. But a stock with this kind of opportunity simply shouldn't be cheap. Meanwhile, upfront expenses to market to new customers and develop new offerings for existing customers are pressuring near-term earnings.Once investors better understand the opportunity Square has, and look to the long-term earnings potential, SQ stock should rally. Considering the optimism toward the sector, there's no reason why SQ, too, can't reach all-time highs. That suggests another 25% upside from here -- and a stock price in the triple digits for good.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-01-31	2020-01-31 14:21:42	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Earnings Look Good Enough for PayPal Stock	PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) released its earnings on Wednesday afternoon -- and investors don't seem impressed by the results, as PayPal stock is little changed since then.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The response is somewhat logical. PayPal's Q4 numbers did beat analysts' average estimates, but not by much; investors likely were looking for more fireworks. The company's outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2020, at least based on the headline numbers, appear somewhat soft. One-time factors played a role, but the Q4 results don't seem like a massive beat that has materially changed the company's outlook.But that's fine because its outlook didn't need to change. PayPal remains one of the better growth stories in the market, and PayPal stock has one of the more attractive valuations among growth names. Its Q4 earnings and 2020 guidance were more than enough to keep the company's outlook intact. In the wake of the results,   PYPL stock is still intriguing for medium-term and long-term investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Headline ResultsThe lukewarm reaction to PayPal's earnings does make some sense because its Q4 results and 2020 guidance were essentially in-line with expectations. Its revenue increased 18% year-over-year in Q4, excluding currency fluctuations, as its  transaction payment volume jumped 22%, excluding currency fluctuations.Its bottom-line performance was even better: as its management noted, the 2.04 percentage point  YoY increase in its operating margin was its biggest such  expansion since PayPal split from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in 2015.  * How to Insure Your Wealth Before the Coronavirus Strikes Again But the growth was mostly expected: its revenue increase was within 0.4 percentage points of the average analyst estimate. A 3 cent beat relative to average earnings per share expectations is nothing new for PayPal, and it's not terribly surprising in an era in which tech companies almost always beat mean bottom-line estimates.Post-earnings headlines indicate that the company's  guidance gave investors some pause. At first glance, PayPal's outlook does appear to be disappointing. Its Q1 revenue and earnings guidance came in below analysts' average estimate. Full-year EPS guidance, excluding some items, of $3.39-$3.46 fell shy of the $3.49 mean estimate ahead of the release.The company's outlook is better than those headline numbers suggest, however. And its guidance more than enough to keep the company's attractive long-term outlook intact. Understanding PayPal's 2020 GuidanceIt appears that the difference between analysts' expectations and PayPal's numbers come down to acquisitions.  PayPal noted that  acquisitions will reduce its  2020 EPS by 8 cents to 10 cents.PayPal also changed its criteria for adjusted earnings; in 2020, the company will exclude the impact of gains and losses on its investments from its adjusted earnings. In 2019, gains from its investments boosted its EPS by 14 cents. But investments will have no impact on its reported adjusted earnings this year.So PayPal's bottom-line growth is much stronger than its headline numbers suggest. Its 2020 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.39-$3.46, against the $3.10 it reported in 2019, suggests a roughly 9%-11% YoY increase. But excluding the effect of acquisitions and 2019 investment gains, PYPL actually expects its EPS to jump 18%-20% this year.The extent to which Street estimates incorporate the company's acquisitions or potential gains or losses on its investments is unclear. At minimum, PayPal's guidance isn't 100% comparable to analysts' estimates. The impact of acquisitions alone accounts for the difference between PayPal's guidance and analysts' average estimates. That, in turn, suggests that PayPal's earnings growth remains nicely on track. The Case for PayPal StockGiven the fact that PayPal's guidance actually looks attractive, PayPal stock looks appealing. The shares trade at about 34 times the midpoint of the company's 2020's EPS guidance. That's a reasonably high multiple,  but not when the company's profits are growing at an 18%-plus clip, particularly in this market.Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is trading at a higher multiple to its expected 2020 EPS and its growth rate is lower. Visa's (NYSE:V) price-earnings ratio is nearly  30&#92;. Square (NYSE:SQ) does have more growth potential, but its valuation is much higher than that of PayPal stock.On a relative basis, then, being long PYPL stock makes sense at these levels, particularly with the shares trading sideways since June.The shares' valuation alone makes them attractive. A P/E ratio of 33 isn't cheap, but PayPal reiterated that it expects to generate 20% annual EPS growth for some time to come. That growth is more than enough to allow the company to grow into its current valuation -- and beyond.Moreover, the company has additional  opportunities in China and other foreign countries, and  its Venmo business can continue to grow. Its loss of revenue from eBay is a concern, but since eBay accounted for only 14% of its total sales, the impact is more than manageable. PayPal should be able to grow despite that development.PayPal's strong outlook is what makes PYPL attractive -- and its outlook wasn't changed by the Q4 report.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2020-01-31	2020-01-31 14:16:20	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Square Stock is a Fintech Winner in the Fast-changing Payments Space	When it comes to fintech stocks, payment processing company Square (NYSE: SQ) has been a disappointment as of late. While the S&P 500 index rose 22% over the last 12 months, SQ stock rose only 6.5% in comparison.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com And that lags far behind other stocks in the fintech/payments arena:  * Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), up 190.4%.  * Mastercard (NYSE: MA), up 57%.  * Visa (NYSE: V), up 48.9%.  * PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), up 14.9%.Happily, Square is off to a great start in 2020, bouncing 19% higher on the strength of a couple key analyst upgrades.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe company's next earnings report isn't until late February, so there is plenty of time for sentiment to build before the payment processing company posts it updated outlook.On average, analysts are expecting earnings per share of 21 cents for the quarter, which would be up from 14 cents a year ago. For 2020, analysts are expecting earnings of 95 cents per share, up from an expected 2019 full-year EPS of 78 cents. Why SQ Stock is a GemThe secret of Square is the brilliant way it mixes tried-and-true habits with 21st century technology. Today's customers are already conditioned to carry their credit or debit cards everywhere and many people prefer the convenience of plastic to cash.  * 7 Biometrics Stocks That Will Help Shape the Next Decade Square capitalizes on those spending habits. The company's small, plastic dongles fit in cell phones and tablets, turning them into instant payment processing systems.And because Square accounts can be activated in just minutes, instant credit and debit card payments can be accepted by a whole new world of vendors or with a side hustle -- cookie-selling Girl Scouts, food truck operators, dog walkers and babysitters can all get money in a snap.That convenience provides a great foundation for growth -- and Square is taking advantage.Louis Stevens of L.A. Stevens Investments is a fan:&quot;Square's negative narratives and present valuation belie the company's fantastic underlying financials. The company has been growing their revenues at upward of 40% year-over-year for the last five years, and despite calls for competition destroying their business, gross margins have been improving. For a company that allegedly operates in an ultra-competitive space, their 40% gross margins are sure curious.&quot;Square's present sales growth rate of 40+% year-over-year and 40% gross margins, along with stable, growing free cash flow, are being vastly undervalued relative to the company's peers.&quot; Looking at the Bear CaseWait … what was that about &quot;negative narratives?&quot;No doubt, you can find something bad to say about any stock on the market. A large part of investing, after all, involves people betting on stocks or against stocks, so Square stock bears are always looking for a reason to preach caution.In Square's case, you have CEO Jack Dorsey's plan to live -- for at least six month -- in Africa, a continent that he says will &quot;define the future.&quot; And while getting in on the ground floor of any developing market is exciting, skeptics such as Jeff Sonnefeld of Yale University calls it &quot;reckless.&quot; Others wonder who will be handling day-to-day operations at Square while Dorsey is on the other side of the world.Experts such as Mott Capital Management also note that Square has a history of outperforming earnings, but sets a low bar on guidance that has historically depressed the stock.&quot;Additionally, analysts have been trimming their earnings estimates for the company in 2020 and 2021. Since the beginning of 2019, analysts' earnings estimates have declined by 13% and 25%, respectively. That has brought forecasts for 2020 down to just 96 cents per share and $1.34 per share in 2021.&quot;It's a fair point.

2020-01-29	2020-01-29 17:05:28	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard’s Fintech Bet Pays Off With Higher Card Spending	(Bloomberg) -- Mastercard Inc.’s new initiative to team up with more startups on credit cards is beginning to pay off.The company has been initiating card programs for fintechs including Brex Inc., Revolut Technologies Inc. and TransferWise Inc., and has unveiled programs designed to make it easier for startups to join Mastercard’s network. That helped boost customers’ spending on the firm’s cards to $1.28 trillion in the quarter, up 11% from a year earlier and in line with analysts’ estimates.“The solution that Mastercard brings is more holistic than just saying, ‘We’ll switch the transaction for you,’” Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra said in a telephone interview Wednesday. “We say, ‘All right, fintech ABC, what are your objectives? What are you trying to achieve? You’re trying to go cross border or you’re trying to target travelers? Here, let us help you with data analytics and fraud tools.’”Mastercard also notched several major renewals in recent months, extending its deals with Citigroup Inc. and Capital One Financial Corp. As a result, the firm has been setting aside more money to entice banks and retailers to route spending over its network. Rebates and incentives totaled $2.31 billion in the last three months of the year, up 17% from a year earlier and more than analysts expected.The company’s adjusted net revenue is likely to climb by a percentage in the “low teens” this year, while operating expenses will increase by a percentage at the “high end of high single digits,” according to a presentation Wednesday. That’s in line with analysts’ expectations.Mastercard shares rose 0.4% to $321.38 at 11:53 a.m. in New York. The firm’s shares have climbed 61% in the past year, more than the 51% gain for the 71-company S&P 500 Information Technology Index.Cardholders’ overseas spending increased 15% in the first three weeks of the year, Mehra said on a conference call, slightly slower growth than the 16% reported for the fourth quarter. The company is keeping a close eye on how the spread of the new coronavirus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan may impact consumer spending around the world.(Updates with CFO interview beginning in third paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Jenny Surane in New York at jsurane4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

2020-01-27	2020-01-27 14:00:36	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	A Healthy Consumer Means More Retail Disruption	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The most recent retail sales data provides a glimpse into the mind of the U.S. consumer.The latest monthly retail sales report from the U.S. Census Bureau recorded December sales (excluding gasoline, automobiles and restaurants) of $384.6 billion. Compared with the prior year’s $ 360.5 billion, that’s a solid year-over-year gain of 6.7%. Sales in November 2019 were $330.2 billion for a 1.1% gain over 2018’s $325.9 billion. Average these two-monthly totals and you get a 4.1% year over year gain for the holiday-shopping period.Those are strong numbers. Delving deeper reveals several interesting data points:&#92;-- consumer sentiment has fully recovered from the lows after the financial crisis and is back to levels that prevailed in mid-2000s;&#92;-- sentiment is still below the frothy dot-com peak of the late 1990s, suggesting that consumers are confident about the future but not in a reckless or unsustainable way;&#92;-- consumer debt relative to disposable income remains at the lowest level in at least four decades, indicating that there's room for them to spend more:These three data points suggest that the next few quarters of gross domestic product growth, retail sales and durable goods orders are likely to be robust.In the typical election year, these economic positives tend to benefit the White House incumbent. I will let others debate whether this is a typical election year.Two other interesting issues worth mentioning: Online sales measured by point-of-sale credit-card transactions from MasterCard’s SpendingPulse showed that e-commerce in 2019 reached all-time highs. E-commerce now accounts for 14% of U.S. retail sales and likely will continue to claim a growing piece of the pie. Worldwide, online sales have nearly tripled during the past five years from $1.3 trillion in 2014 to more than $3.5 trillion in 2019, according to Statista. Projections are for this to more than double during the next five years.One surprise from the MasterCard data is that online shopping is accelerating, rising 18.8% last year compared with 2018’s 18.4%. There are few signs online retail is slowing. If anything, the generation that grew up online doesn't think of e-commerce as anything special; it's simply retail.One other observation: Perhaps the most intriguing online retail outlet is Instagram’s Checkout. It was named 2019’s Technology of the Year by Mobile Marketer. Fashion site Glossy describes Instagram as the next big sales channel “for direct-to-consumer companies and traditional retailers alike.”More than just promoting a brand or product, Instagram is facilitating the sale of products directly to consumers. The company takes its slice of the transaction. Combine this with the lethally accurate algorithms deployed by parent company Facebook Inc. and you can imagine the sort of sales growth that might lie ahead.To give you an idea of the size of this marketplace, Instagram has more than 1 billion accounts active each month worldwide (Facebook has 2.45 billion active users). Most of them have some form of payment system, including credit cards, Venmo, PayPal or Apple Pay.So far, Instagram Checkout has been rolled out slowly since the platform introduced it in March. It has been testing product tags in posts since 2016. Again according to Glossy, tags came to “Instagram Stories” about two years later. The fashion site, quoting Instagram, reports that 130 million people tap a product tag to shop or see a price every month. Instagram is native to mobile, which is where the new generation of consumers spend most of their connected time. Although Instagram hasn't made a big splash in online retailing yet, the potential is there.To be sure, there are some inklings of problems with counterfeit goods. This has been an issue that has haunted both Amazon.com Inc. and eBay Inc. If Instagram wants to become a serious player in retail, it needs to nip this in the bud.Disruption doesn't sleep. Don’t be surprised if the incumbent stars of e-commerce -- the leading members of the last generation of disruptive technologies — become the new victims of creative destruction.The relative health of the American consumer makes the disruption all the more likely — and sooner rather than later.To contact the author of this story: Barry Ritholtz at britholtz3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Barry Ritholtz is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-01-27	2020-01-27 11:00:40	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Socially Conscious ETFs Have Some Baffling Holes	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Exchange-traded funds that cater to environmental, social and governance principles are being pitched as a way for investors to sleep with peace of mind, but they better be prepared to wake up with something less than dreamy returns.Consider the iShares MSCI USA ESG Select Social Index Fund (SUSA), one of the oldest and largest ESG ETFs on the market. SUSA, which tracks the 100 stocks with the highest ESG ratings, has trailed the S&P 500 Index by 37 percentage points during the past 10 years.(1) (I honed in on SUSA because it has a long-term track record. Most ESG ETFs are very new.) The reason it lagged taps into one of the most important yet underreported aspects of ESG funds: surprising exclusions. While some of the stocks excluded from SUSA are obvious, such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp., some are less obvious, such as Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc., Ross Stores Inc. and Mastercard Inc. — all of which are up more than 1,000% during the past 10 years. Not having stocks like these is why SUSA couldn’t keep up with the overall market. Not to pile on here, but SUSA’s underperformance also came with a higher standard deviation, or level of volatility.This potential for underperfomance is why I think investors should take what I call “The Amazon Test” before buying an ESG ETF. It has two parts. The first is to simply ask whether you are willing to miss out on the next Amazon to “clean up” your portfolio. Or even better, if you want to do the leg work, compare the ESG ETF’s holdings to the appropriate broad index and comb through the differences. You may be surprised by what is included in the ETF. (In SUSA’s case, it does hold Facebook Inc. and Nike Inc., which many may find questionable.) I can guarantee investors will probably be a bit baffled.Of course it’s possible that the next Amazon is already in your ESG ETF and that the fund outperforms the market and everyone’s happy. SUSA could very well beat the market during the next 10 years. But investors need to be ready in case it doesn’t.I was curious how people would respond to this question, so I ran an informal Twitter poll and found that only a fifth of people were both interested in ESG and satisfied with missing the next Amazon. That means more than half of ESG-interested investors did not want to miss out on an Amazon, which tends to be excluded from ESG funds because of working conditions that put it on a worker-rights group’s “Dirty Dozen” list of the most dangerous employers in the U.S. Of course, not only highfliers are excluded from many ESG ETFs; so are some of the country’s most revered companies, which many people probably want to own. The best example is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which is included in fewer ESG ETFs than Exxon and is practically excluded from all of them. It’s the second-lowest-ranked company by Sustainalytics(2) among the S&P 100 Index. Essentially, investors can have ESG or Buffett, but not both. So why is Buffett, one of the greatest investors and philanthropists the world has ever seen, not in these funds? One big reason is Berkshire’s board is only 57% independent, well below the 86% average. Buffett has signaled no intention of changing the company’s business practices. He implied the independent board is a poor metric, saying many such boards he has been on are independent on paper only, with many directors just looking for a payday and typically following the CEO’s lead. Buffett has also said he doesn’t want to burden subsidiary companies, one of which operates coal-fired plants, with unnecessary rules and costs.“We’re not going to spend the time of the people at Berkshire Hathaway Energy responding to questionnaires or trying to score better with somebody that is working on that. It’s just, we trust our managers and I think the performance is at least decent and we keep expenses and needless reporting down to a minimum at Berkshire.”Some have pushed back, saying that “surprising exclusions” are nothing new and exist in other areas such as smart-beta and theme ETFs. This is true, but there is one crucial difference: Those ETFs aren’t generally seeking to replace an investor’s entire equity portion of the portfolio. Because if the goal is to “sleep at night,” then what’s the point of putting a small allocation into an ESG ETF while still investing in other funds, like the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, which hold those “bad” companies you don’t want?(3)For those who are interested in ESG and don’t mind missing out on the next Amazon, the next part of my test is to ask whether they are willing to curb their consumption of the goods and services provided by those excluded companies. For example, are you going to continue to shop at Amazon, drive an SUV or take airplanes 10 times a year? If so, then what’s the point of not owning those stocks? You are just going to rob yourself of profits you helped create. I did an informal poll on this, too, and found only a fifth of those who were willing to miss out on Amazon were also willing to not shop there. Now, I’m not saying you need to live in the woods and eat bugs to be pure enough to be an ESG investor, but you should probably be willing to make some inconvenient choices as a consumer — because, let’s be honest, that’s where investors can truly make a company pay attention. Otherwise, a lot of this is demand trying to demonize supply to soothe its guilt and feel good inside. At the end of my little screening system here we are left with 5% of the investing world that I’d argue has the stomach and commitment to be messing around with ESG ETFs.(5) The rest either just don’t want ESG or are slacktivists — people who want to feel as if they are doing something but are unwilling to make any inconvenient sacrifices such as lagging the market or curbing parts of their lifestyles. These investors should probably just stick with owning the broad market. And while 5% may seem like a small amount, it would actually be a pretty solid base of investors for these ETFs. To convert that into dollars, 5% of ETF assets would equate to $200 billion, a respectable category. Currently, ESG ETFs have only about one-tenth of that amount. And yet there are about 100 products on the market. That’s $200 million per ETF, which is five to 10 times below the average of many other popular areas. Supply has so far outpaced the hype and demand in a way that’s never been seen in the ETF market.And it doesn’t look as if product proliferation will be slowing anytime soon. BlackRock’s Larry Fink recently announced a doubling of the company’s ESG ETF lineup, which means due diligence will be that much more cumbersome. And while this may come off as a bit of a downer to all the excitement around ESG, that’s not my intention. I’m not anti-ESG at all, but I am anti-nasty surprise.  I just want to help make sure investors wake up with peace of mind, too.(1) SUSA has also lagged since inception in 2005 by 33% and by 4% over the past 5 years, though it is outperforming by 1% over the past year. And to show I'm not cherry-picking, the other veteran ESG ETF, the iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (DSI), has lagged the market by 30 percentage points over the past 10 years.(2) An equal-weighted basket of the 20 stocks in the S&P 100 with the lowest Sustainalytics Ranking outperformed the S&P 500 Index by 41% over the past seven years. Sustainalytics is an ESG research and ratings platform whose scores are used on the Bloomberg Terminal.(3) Now, if investors are seeking ESG ETFs because they think there is some premium to capture that can add alpha to their portfolios and they are only allocating a little, then there is less need for this test (although you can never go wrong with looking under the hood of a fund). But largely, ESG ETFs are being pitched and talked about as a “sleep at night” replacement, or a way to support companies that align with investors’ values.(4) Add in the fact that most people don’t know what ESG even stands for, let alone how the scoring systems (which all vary by the way) work, and you get a situation where the product proliferation and hype has far outpaced the education needed to use them.To contact the author of this story: Eric Balchunas at ebalchunas@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Eric Balchunas is an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence focused on exchange-traded funds.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinionSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/socially-conscious-etfs-baffling-holes-110040056.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-27	2020-01-27 07:00:36	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	The Alphabet Soup of Responsible Investing Needs a Good Stir	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Investors continue to pour funds into passive investment products that aim to replicate the performance of benchmark indexes. They’re also increasingly keen that their money gets used to influence corporations to stop damaging the planet and improve social inclusiveness. Unfortunately, many of the products designed to achieve both objectives currently fall short on the goal of responsible investing.The shift in emphasizing environmental, social and governance issues puts pressure on the index providers to come up with benchmarks that more accurately reflect the concerns investors are attempting to express by allocating capital to ESG investment products. Currently, though, even dedicated ESG indexes have shortcomings that many investors are probably unaware of.The U.S. Vegan Climate exchange-traded fund, for example, tracks a $124 billion index created by Beyond Investing that excludes companies engaged in a laundry list of potentially harmful activities, including animal exploitation, human rights abuses and fossil fuels extraction. While the $14 million ETF’s top five holdings — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Facebook Inc., Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. — may all meet those criteria, they’re hardly the first names that spring to mind when thinking about the words vegan or climate. And there are many other examples.BlackRock Inc.’s announcement this month that it plans to prioritize sustainability in its investment decisions highlights the issue confronting index trackers. With two-thirds of its $7.4 trillion of assets managed passively, the world’s biggest asset manager acknowledged that the bulk of its cash isn’t available to pursue those goals. Harnessing that firepower will become increasingly important if the passive industry is to meet the ESG aspirations of its growing customer base.It’s even likely to radically change the industry, and sooner than people realize. To that point, Hiro Mizuno, the chief investment officer of Japan’s $1.6 trillion Global Pension Investment Fund, says the days are over when it’s enough for passive fund managers to compete simply on providing the lowest tracking errors at the lowest cost. Now they have to add value too. “The main battlefield among our passive managers is going to be in the stewardship area.” he told the Financial Times last month. BlackRock is far from alone in shifting to a more moral investing stance. A survey of 300 institutional investors, financial advisers and fund managers that use ETFs published on Monday by Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. showed that almost three-quarters of respondents expect to increase the amount allocated to ESG investments in the coming year.European participants in the BBH survey ranked ESG-themed products as the ETF category they would most like to see more supply of, while Chinese investors ranked the sector as their second most desired area of expansion, along with more funds designed to track core indexes.Money is flooding into the sector. ESG-designated assets were the fastest-growing category of ETFs listed on Deutsche Boerse AG’s Xetra market last year, with investments more than tripling to more than 23 billion euros ($25 billion). Globally, ESG ETFs have enjoyed net inflows for 52 consecutive weeks, taking in $30 billion in the past year and garnering almost $3.4 billion in the week ended Jan. 20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg LP, which competes in selling index data to investors.There are two main routes whereby ETF providers can meet the implicit demands of clients allocating money to passively managed ESG products. The first is to use their collective muscle to prompt index providers to increase the granularity of the benchmarks used to shape asset allocations. Improving the discrimination of ESG indexes would go a long way to ensuring investors aren’t being hoodwinked into products that aren’t as green or socially savvy as they first appear.The second is trickier. Excluding companies deemed to be damaging the environment or being socially irresponsibly isn’t enough to move the needle. Engaging with the boards of those firms and using the clout of a shareholding to force them to change their ways is much more effective.But that costs money, and the success of the ETF model has been founded in large part on its ability to charge ultra-low fees. If BlackRock and its peers are serious about taking their social responsibilities more seriously, investors will have to pay for the privilege — and the sellers of index trackers will need to be honest about the increased cost of that kind of activism. Let’s hope the buyers of the products decide it’s a price worth paying to do good.To contact the author of this story: Mark Gilbert at magilbert@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Mark Gilbert is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering asset management.

2020-01-21	2020-01-21 21:01:14	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Vodafone Abandons Facebook-Led Libra Cryptocurrency Project	(Bloomberg) -- Telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc left the Libra Association, becoming the latest company to exit the Facebook-led group trying to create a new global cryptocurrency.The Libra Association, which was finalized last October, once expected to have as many as 28 total members when the project was announced in June. It is now down to 20 following earlier departures from Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and others that had committed to the project but then left before the group signed an official charter.“Vodafone is no longer a member of the Libra Association,” Dante Disparte, head of policy and communication for the association, said in a statement. “Although the makeup of the Association members may change over time, the design of Libra’s governance and technology ensures the Libra payment system will remain resilient. The Association is continuing the work to achieve a safe, transparent, and consumer-friendly implementation of the Libra payment system.”The idea for Libra -- a global, digital currency intended to make cross-border money transfers as easy as sending a text message -- has faced opposition at every turn. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, first proposed the idea last June, along with a number of high-profile partners. Many of them are no longer involved, and Facebook has pledged to appease all U.S. regulators before launching the currency. It’s unclear how long that might take.Coindesk earlier reported news of Vodafone’s departure from the group.In a statement, U.K.-based Vodafone said it plans to focus on its own digital payments efforts instead. Vodafone partly owns Safaricom Plc, which operates the M-Pesa mobile-payments app in Kenya, where more people keep their money on their phones rather than in banks. The text message-based app is used by about 35 million people globally to spend, borrow and send money to friends and family.“We will continue to monitor the development of the Libra Association and do not rule out the possibility of future co-operation,” Vodafone spokesman Steve Shepperson-Smith said.&#92;--With assistance from Jenny Surane and Scott Moritz.To contact the reporter on this story: Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Robin AjelloFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vodafone-abandons-facebook-led-libra-210114413.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-21	2020-01-21 16:00:01	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Jack Ma’s Booming Loan Business Threatens Visa, AmEx in China	(Bloomberg) -- As Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and American Express Co. prepare to enter China for the first time, one of their biggest competitive threats will come from a company that doesn’t issue credit cards.Jack Ma’s Ant Financial, already the biggest player in China’s $27 trillion payments market, is leveraging its ubiquitous Alipay mobile app to mount a rapid expansion into consumer lending.Instead of issuing cards, Ant allows customers to borrow with a few taps on their smartphones. The loans are wildly popular among China’s army of mobile-savvy shoppers, who often lack formal credit histories but generate enough financial data via Alipay for Ant to make informed decisions on whether they’ll default. The company’s outstanding consumer loans may swell to nearly 2 trillion yuan ($290 billion) by 2021, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts, more than triple the level two years ago.“The consumer loans business has been growing at breakneck speed, but there are so many untapped users,” Huang Hao, president of Ant’s digital finance operations, said in a phone interview outlining the company’s strategy.Ant’s push into China’s 10 trillion yuan market for short-term consumer loans will make it an even more formidable challenger to U.S. card companies, which are counting on the world’s second-largest economy as a source of long-term growth.Many Chinese consumers and businesses are ditching credit cards as Ant and its main competitor Tencent Holdings Ltd. make app-based spending, borrowing and investing increasingly user-friendly. In a Nielsen survey of more than 3,000 Chinese people born after 1990, nearly 61% said they use online consumer credit while only 45.5% had a credit card.“For credit card companies coming to China, the biggest challenge is how to attract people,” said Zennon Kapron, managing director of Singapore-based consulting firm Kapronasia. “A lot of Chinese millennials are digital first, used to using Alipay as their first platform for payments, loans and wealth management.”The card giants appear to be moving forward with their China plans despite the headwinds. AmEx’s application to start a bank card clearing business has been accepted by the country’s central bank, while Mastercard has called China a “vital” market and Visa has said it’s working closely with regulators for a license.As part of its phase-one trade agreement with the U.S., China said it won’t take longer than 90 days to consider applications from providers of electronic-payments services. Regulators are opening the industry to foreign competition amid an unprecedented push to give international firms access to the country’s financial sector.Read more: Visa, Mastercard, AmEx Win Easier Access to China MarketIn response to questions from Bloomberg on the threat posed by Ant, Visa said it sees significant potential to support the growth and evolution of digital payments in China and is approaching the market with a long-term focus. Mastercard said it would continue to work with regulators to advance its application and is committed for the long haul. AmEx declined to comment.Ant, an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. that’s widely expected to pursue an initial public offering in coming years, started its consumer-credit business in 2015. Its loans tend to be small: half the users of Ant’s Huabei (translation: “just spend”) service borrow less than $290 and usually pay it back within months.The Hangzhou-based company, which declined to disclose the value of its outstanding loans, keeps delinquencies in check by tapping into a trove of data amassed by Alipay and Alibaba.Many customers have been using the payments and e-commerce platforms for years -- handing over details from ID cards to addresses and spending habits. Once Ant extends a loan, it can track how the money is spent via Alipay. The result is a bad-debt ratio stands at about 1%, below the 1.24% national average for credit cards.Read more: China’s Gen Z, With Little Income, Gets Hooked on Easy CreditAnt keeps some of the loans on its own balance sheet, charging interest rates that range from about 5% to 18%, according to Huang. But most are passed on for a fee to banks and other financial institutions.“We’re set to continue to work with more banks and finance companies,” Huang said. “We are, at the end of the day, a platform.”The risk for Visa, Mastercard and AmEx is that a swathe of Chinese consumers and businesses will view credit cards as obsolete. About 60% of borrowers on Ant’s Huabei platform don’t have one, and many smaller merchants don’t accept cards because they find it’s cheaper and easier to use Alipay or Tencent’s WePay. The former, with more than 900 million users, is Alibaba’s preferred payments provider.“The competitive landscape is full of local players,” said Hang Qian, a partner at Oliver Wyman, a consultancy. “The key challenges are how to promote small merchants to accept credit cards and how to get e-wallet users to switch.”&#92;--With assistance from Alfred Liu.To contact the reporter on this story: Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael Patterson at mpatterson10@bloomberg.net, Jodi SchneiderFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-booming-loan-business-160001550.html?.tsrc=rss

The rationale is clear: In a world where billions of credit and debit cards have already been issued, the Visa and Mastercard duopoly need to prepare for a time when consumers move beyond pieces of plastic (and metal) to pay for things.  Last summer, the card giants jockeyed for Nets, a Danish company that handles things like bank-to-bank payments; Mastercard ultimately acquired the company for $3.2 billion.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a6fcd8cd-e5bf-3677-9d80-be16c527064e/the-seeds-of-visa%E2%80%99s-%245.3.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-15	2020-01-15 21:37:09	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa, Mastercard, AmEx Win Easier Access to China Market	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. The biggest U.S. card companies just moved a step closer to gaining access to China’s $27 trillion payments market.China said it won’t take longer than 90 days to consider applications from providers of electronic-payments services such as Mastercard, Visa and American Express Co., according the text of a landmark trade agreement with the U.S. It should be an especially welcome reprieve for Mastercard and its partner NetsUnion Clearing Corp., which set up a venture in March that is still awaiting approval from the People’s Bank of China to begin operations.“China is a vital market for us,” Seth Eisen, a spokesman for Mastercard, said Wednesday in an emailed statement. “We continue to make every effort to secure the requisite license to be able to operate in China domestically. This deal is a step forward in that process.”The move shows progress in the U.S. payment networks’ battle for access to mainland China, which has been a point of contention in the trade dispute. Officials from the world’s two largest economies finalized a bevy of deals before signing off on the first phase of a sweeping trade agreement, which they have sought to cast as a major breakthrough in relations.Mastercard Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga and Visa CEO Al Kelly were in attendance at Wednesday’s festivities at the White House for the trade deal announcement. In a statement, Visa said it sees potential to help further develop digital payments in China through the 2022 Olympics in Beijing and that it’s approaching entry into the country “with a long-term focus.”“Visa is working closely with the Chinese government, including the People’s Bank of China, throughout the application process for a bank card clearing institution license,” the company said in the statement, welcoming the signing of the trade agreement.China in June 2015 allowed foreign bank-card clearing providers to obtain licenses by setting up units or acquiring a local company, ending a monopoly by state-run China UnionPay Co. But progress has since been slow for Visa and Mastercard, the world’s largest payment networks. American Express cleared a key hurdle in early January when regulators accepted its application to start a bank-card clearing business with a Chinese partner.“We’re pleased with the progress we’re making to become the first foreign network to receive a clearing and settlement license to operate in mainland China,” Leah Gerstner, a spokeswoman for AmEx, said in a statement. “We will continue to work through the regulatory approval process through our joint venture in China.”As part of Wednesday’s agreement, the U.S. also pledged not to discriminate against China UnionPay, or CUP, or other Chinese electronic payment services.Mastercard and Visa have long complained that their delayed entrance into China means they’ll be pitting themselves against large domestic players in a market that’s seen mobile payments explode in recent years. Mobile transactions topped 190 trillion yuan ($27 trillion) in China in 2018, making it the world’s largest such market, according to iResearch. Ant Financial’s Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat Pay are the dominant mobile payments firms.They won’t be starting from nothing. Mastercard and Visa have long worked with Chinese banks to slap their brands on cards to facilitate transactions that consumers make outside China. But Wednesday’s announcement means the networks will now have a chance to compete for those cardholders’ domestic spending as well.China had 8.2 billion bank cards in circulation at the end of September, with 90% of them debit cards.(Updates with Visa comment in sixth paragraph, AmEx comment in eighth.)&#92;--With assistance from Jenny Surane and David Scheer.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Lucille Liu in Beijing at xliu621@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Candice Zachariahs at czachariahs2@bloomberg.net, ;Alan Goldstein at agoldstein5@bloomberg.net, Jonas Bergman, Dan ReichlFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-mastercard-amex-win-easier-184533529.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-14	2020-01-14 00:54:43	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa to Buy Plaid for $5.3 Billion in Bid to Reach Startups	(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc. grew into one of the world’s most valuable financial companies by serving as the pipes that help connect banks and merchants.Now, it’s making a major bet on doing the same for data between banks and financial startups.Visa agreed to pay $5.3 billion for Plaid, a fintech firm that connects popular apps like Venmo to customers’ data in the established banking system. The deal caps a meteoric rise for Plaid and aims to keep fueling Visa’s own ascent, which has seen its stock triple in the past five years. The sale price is double Plaid’s $2.65 billion valuation in a 2018 funding round.Plaid’s developer tools help power a range of popular financial apps -- such as Venmo, Coinbase Inc. and Acorns Grow Inc. -- by channeling the banking data they need for their apps and websites. Founded in 2012, the firm now has more than 200 million accounts linked on its platform, according to an investor presentation. That access underscores the demand from consumers to send their data to services that can move funds between accounts or into cryptocurrencies, give advice on personal finances or reimburse a friend after brunch.About a quarter of people with a U.S. bank account have used Plaid to connect to the roughly 11,000 financial institutions it works with, the companies said. At times, that’s put Plaid at the center of tensions between fintech disruptors and banks, which have expressed concerns about security and sometimes locked the outside parties out.Data Access“We don’t see changing Plaid’s model, we see helping them accelerate their growth,” Visa Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly said on a conference call about the way Plaid earns its fees.But the way data is shared probably will change, Visa President Ryan McInerney said in an interview. Visa will work with banking partners including JPMorgan Chase & Co. to ensure fintechs are collecting consumers’ data “appropriately,” he said. “We have deep relationships with most financial institutions and we intend to evolve” Plaid’s data practices, he said. As a benefit, fintechs may get more reliable connectivity.Plaid has attracted investments from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and venture capitalist Mary Meeker. Visa and Mastercard Inc. also are investors in the company, Plaid said last year in a blog post. Visa said it expects the takeover to close in the next three to six months with the acquisition adding 80 to 100 basis points to revenue growth in fiscal 2021.Longer-term, the deal will let Visa play a greater role in the financial industry’s tech-driven evolution, Kelly told analysts on a call. “We see this giving us options and growth potentials at least for the next decade,” he said.In 2018, Plaid had talks with Jack Dorsey’s Square Inc. about an acquisition that would have valued Plaid at about $1 billion. In early 2019, the firm announced that it was buying one of its competitors, Quovo, in a deal valued at about $200 million.Both Visa and Mastercard have been seeking to move beyond card payments in recent years to extend their rapid revenue growth. Mastercard bought a payments platform owned by Nets for $3.2 billion last year, using its biggest-ever acquisition to move further into so-called account-to-account payments.Plaid has struck data-sharing agreements with major banks including JPMorgan and Wells Fargo & Co. over the past few years, seeking to head off battles over whether consumers should give up their bank username and password to share data with financial applications.Visa’s move follows a year of frenzied consolidation in the fintech industry, as old-guard companies increasingly seek to compete with fast-growing startups. In November, PayPal Holdings Inc. snapped up online coupon company Honey Science Corp. for $4 billion. Also last year, Charles Schwab acquired of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for $26 billion, and Fiserv Inc., Fidelity National Information Services Inc. and Global Payments Inc. did a series of major deals in payment processing.Plaid’s takeover by Visa -- seen by some fintech disruptors as part of the more traditional banking industry -- will be watched closely by Silicon Valley for any signs that more consolidation is coming.

Under the agreement, customers using UnionPay’s Quickpass or WeChat Pay -- the de facto payment service on Tencent’s ubiquitous messaging platform of the same name -- will scan the same QR code from merchants, Caixin reported.Alipay, which is part-owned by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., isn’t in similar integration talks, Caixin added. Once China’s dominant online payments provider thanks to its prominence on Alibaba’s online malls, Alipay has in recent years come under attack from Tencent’s rival offering, which is available to a billion-plus WeChat users.China’s central bank has pushed for system integration in mobile payments, both domestically and overseas. The EMVCo consortium, which includes UnionPay, Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. as its members, created a QR Payment Mark to promote global payments unification in 2018.Read more: Alipay, Tencent Beware: China’s Digital Yuan Is Closing In(Updates with Tencent’s and UnionPay’s comments in the second paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Zheping Huang and Jun Luo.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Evelyn Yu in Shanghai at yyu263@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Candice Zachariahs at czachariahs2@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tencent-teams-state-backed-unionpay-052628786.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-07	2020-01-07 21:00:28	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	U.S. Gas Stations Rush to Adopt Chip Cards After Failed Bid to Delay Deadline	(Bloomberg) -- Gas stations around the U.S. are rushing to upgrade fuel pumps to accept credit and debit cards with chips after Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. rejected a request to delay a looming deadline to complete the work.Beginning in October, station operators that haven’t modernized their pumps will face liability for any card fraud that happens at their businesses. The industry is “massively under-prepared,” said Joshua Smith, chief executive officer of Gas Pos, which sells point-of-sale systems.“There’s not enough technicians to do the installments,” Smith said. “There’s not enough inventory. Even if there were enough contractors, there’s not enough dispensers available.”Most retailers began to upgrade payment systems in 2015 -- the first of a series of deadlines set by Visa and Mastercard as the U.S. worked to catch up with nations in Europe and Asia that had long adopted the more-secure chip cards. For fuel retailers, the deadline was ultimately pushed back five years as the industry faced costs of more than $3.9 billion to do the work.In a 2019 survey by Conexxus, a non-profit that represents convenience stores, almost 70% of respondents who own a convenience store said they haven’t upgraded any outside pumps to the new so-called EMV technology.Few companies manufacture the required pumps. Those that do -- such as Dover Corp. or Fortive Corp.’s Gilbarco Veeder-Root -- have said they’re expecting an increase in sales ahead of the deadline. Once the hardware is installed, fuel companies must have the pump software certified.Fuel retailers that don’t upgrade could face costs of as much as $201,000 per store over the next seven years, according to data compiled by Conexxus. The group expects the fuel industry to suffer $451 million of card fraud in 2020 alone.“There’s going to be quite a surprise come October,” Laura Townsend, senior vice president of the Merchant Advisory Group, said in an interview. “Folks that have been trying to transition to EMV will be unable to because of things outside their control. But they will bear a significant increase in losses either come October or shortly thereafter because we know fraudsters will find the weakest link.”In the Conexxus survey, more than half of participants cited a lack of available software for not having chip technology fully deployed, while about 15% pointed to a shortage of hardware. The convenience-store industry blames Visa and Mastercard for not consulting them when setting deadlines.“The payment standard-setting process needs to be more open,” said Anna Ready Blom, director of government relations for NACS, a trade association for the convenience-store industry. “Retailers and technology companies should have been part of the planning and decision-making on chip cards from the start. If they had been, rather than Visa and Mastercard making all the decisions without understanding them fully, we wouldn’t be in this mess.”Visa has previously highlighted its discussions with merchants when it announced its decision to extend the deadline for gas station operators in 2016.Visa and Mastercard aren’t willing to give gas stations more time. The networks recently rejected a plea for a delay from the Merchant Advisory Group, which helps retailers navigate payment-systems issues.“We believe extending chip technology to fuel pumps is an important step to take to protect businesses and consumers who want to pay securely as well as conveniently,” Visa said in a statement. Mastercard said it’s seeing good adoption of EMV technology and a reduction in fraud.Visa and Mastercard began calling for a migration to chips years ago to head off counterfeit-card fraud. The underlying technology -- called EMV for founders Europay, Mastercard and Visa -- generates new codes for each transaction, while the information on magnetic stripes is permanent and can be copied and stored by hackers.More than 3.7 million merchants -- or 80% of U.S. storefronts -- currently accept chip cards. Since 2015, the amount of money merchants lost to counterfeit fraud has declined by 62%, according to Visa.As gas stations start to make the switch, they’re also facing an increased threat from hackers looking to take advantage of one of the last industries that remains vulnerable to counterfeit-card fraud.“As long as the magnetic stripe readers are in place, fuel dispenser merchants are becoming an increasingly attractive target for advanced threat actors,” Visa said in a security alert issued in November. It recommended these merchants deploy chip acceptance along with other security measures such as encryption and educating employees about phishing attacks.(Updates with Visa’s comments in 11th paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Jenny Surane in New York at jsurane4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

I see this as a perfectly reasonable position, as millennials seem willing to give Square's Cash App a chance in a sphere once entirely dominated by the likes of Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA).Source: Shutterstock However, I believe there's more to the story.Millennials and other demographic segments are becoming more aware of cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin (BTC) in particular. So, unlike the stodgy, payment-processing companies that have hesitated to embrace Bitcoin as a viable currency, Square is preparing for a blockchain-powered world right now. With that said, a position in Square stock could be a serious moneymaker if this gambit succeeds.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Love Bitcoin? Then You Should Like Square Stock TooWhen I'm on Internet forums, I sometimes get the feeling that investors divide into two mutually exclusive camps; Those who invest in stocks, and those who buy or &quot;HODL&quot; (hold on for dear life) cryptocurrency. The dividing line isn't necessarily generational, but I've observed that younger investors seem more willing to give crypto a chance.There's something to be said for the safety of investing in long-standing Dow Jones components like Visa and Mastercard. However, now that millennials are America's biggest generation population-wise, investors need to understand that point-of-sale payment processing has changed; and so has the way people perceive money itself.  * 9 Boring Stocks to Buy You Should Never Let Go Of The U.S. dollar has lost much of its value over the years. With that, Bitcoin has become an attractive alternative currency to open-minded consumers. In this regard, Square got a big head start compared to its old-school rivals. As early as November of 2017, the company's Cash App allowed its users to buy and sell Bitcoin.Not everyone wants to open up a Coinbase or Binance account. Therefore, I feel that early Bitcoin integration was a savvy move on Square's part. The numbers bear this out, as Square's third quarter 2019 Bitcoin sales totaled an impressive $148 million. This represents a 20% increase in volume quarter-over-quarter, as well as a massive 245% year-over-year increase. A Job Ad Provides CluesAs a financial reporter, sometimes I gather information from interesting and unexpected sources. In this instance, I discovered a job advertisement on LinkedIn that teases a number of potentially new Bitcoin-friendly Cash App features. If these pan out, Square could end up being miles ahead of Visa and Mastercard in the crypto-integration department.Along with a six-figure salary range and a daunting list of job requirements that would disqualify 99.99% of the population, the employment ad signals Square's eagerness to add Bitcoin functionality to the Cash App in 2020:&quot;The Cash App continues to push the boundaries in finance and Bitcoin sits at the very forefront of these efforts. Cash App's large and ever-expanding network of customers uniquely positions us to add utility to BTC and to bring Bitcoin to the masses in a user-friendly way.&quot;Square investors already sensed the company's crypto-friendly vision. But, it's still nice to hear it stated so forcefully -- and with a tone of commitment that I haven't heard from Visa or Mastercard. However, it's the next part of the job ad that indicated the Cash App's potential upcoming perks:&quot;[The chosen job candidate] will own the Crypto Investing product and be entirely responsible for growing its adoption in whatever ways you see fit, which could include tried and true growth tactics, new functionality (e.g. limit orders, auto-invest), or building entirely new features like BTC gifting (P2P).&quot;Whether these Cash App features are actually built out in 2020 is immaterial. Square stock investors, if they're also Bitcoin devotees, should be excited at the prospect of peer-to-peer (P2P) BTC gifting and auto-invest functionality.Call me a visionary or a nut, but I can easily imagine a time in the near future when payment processors will have to integrate these types of Bitcoin-friendly features. The fact that Square wants to move in this direction at this early stage is, to me, highly encouraging. The Takeaway on Square StockMaybe you like Bitcoin and maybe you don't; I can see the merit of both sides of the argument. Overall though, if you're willing to keep an open mind concerning Bitcoin's potential to transform the way we use money, then you might consider &quot;HODLing&quot; some BTC; and while you're at it, some Square stock too.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-12	2019-12-12 19:25:27	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	3 Big Breakout Stocks to Buy	Breakout trades are a well I have returned to time and again in recent weeks. But, hey, if it ain't broke …Today we're looking at three more stocks to buy that boast compelling setups ahead of the weekend. The appeal of the ever-popular breakout pattern is simple. There are four groups of market participants: two are buyers and two are sellers. The former group consists of new bulls going long and old bears exiting shorts (buying to cover). The latter group involves new bears going short and old bulls exiting longs.When a stock breaks major resistance, both buying camps are present while the selling groups are absent. Here's what I mean: New buyers enter, and old short sellers exit to minimize damage. At the same time, new short sellers steer clear because the breakout is a powerful bullish signal. And old buyers stay the course not wanting to cut their gains short in the face of such strength.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade Let's take a closer look at three breakout stocks to buy. Shopify (SHOP)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) will end 2019 as one of the biggest gainers on the Street. It's up 165% and could tack on additional profits over the final three weeks. It spent much of the fourth quarter carving out a correction, but after Thanksgiving, buyers returned in a big way.The upside pop saw huge volume confirming institutions are backing the boom. Since then, we've seen a classic six-day high base pattern that has allowed SHOP stock to digest gains and set the stage for further upside.You can either enter bull trades in anticipation of the next breakout or wait for a rise above $381 to confirm. Bull call spreads offer a low-cost path to profits on this expensive stock.The Trade: Buy the February $380/$400 bull call spread for around $8. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) isn't a stranger to bullish patterns. Its history is littered with profit-giving pullbacks and Benjamin-filled breakouts. Its year-to-date gains aren't as jaw-dropping as SHOP, but it's also a much, much bigger company. The 50% rise could tack on a few more percentage points in the final few weeks.The past month has seen a mini cup-and-handle formation that triggered this morning. Bull trades are worth a shot, and with the low implied volatility, bull call spreads make sense.The Trade: Buy the February $155/$160 bull call spread for around $2.09 Mastercard (MA)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Our final selection calls the financial sector home. Credit card stocks have enjoyed a profitable year, and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is one of the best. Its path has closely tracked that of MSFT with a 54% year-to-date gain.MA stock's 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages are all pointing higher in support of the trend. But resistance has cropped up over the past month near its 52-week high at $293. We've seen multiple attempts to rise above it, but none have succeeded. I suspect, however, that resistance's days are numbered, and an upside breakout is looming.As mentioned with SHOP, you can either deploy bullish plays now in anticipation of an upside resolution or wait for confirmation.The Trade: Buy the April $295/$305 bull call spread for around $4.60.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-22	2019-11-22 09:15:04	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	This Is How Businesses Can Adapt to Rising Global Risks, Leaders Say	(Bloomberg) -- Explore what’s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast. Subscribe via Apple Podcast, Spotify or Pocket Cast.How businesses can adapt to the new world of heightened political risks and cutting-edge technologies were key themes of discussion on the second day of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Beijing.“The biggest risk in 2020 is the relationship between the major trading powers and economies of the world,” Gary Cohn, former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. president and former director of the Trump administration’s National Economic Council, said on the forum’s sidelines.If the world continues to fracture rather than working together, the global economy will suffer, said Cohn. “We need each other to grow.”In a nod to the tensions over the race to dominate 5G technology, Li Zixue, chairman and executive director of ZTE Corp., said tensions over national security will be inevitable as it is rolled out. But he also sought to downplay the differences.“The 5G network will certainly give rise to more complex and more severe security issues,” he said. “Personally, I believe these problems will be solved.”Still, Diana Choyleva, chief economist at London-based Enodo Economics, reckons there’s only a 5% chance of the two superpowers agreeing on technology standards.On Europe, former U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Phillip Hammond said the worst outcome for his country’s December election would be a “a very small Tory majority government” where Prime Minister Boris Johnson would be “captive” to hard-liners. If that’s not bad enough, he also warned that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s policies would be an “economic disaster.”Here’s a selection of remarks from some of those present:DecouplingAs a carry-over from the forum’s first day, participants worried about a world where the U.S. and China build separate systems for trade and technology.“Oh my God, it is so radical an idea to decouple,” Scott Kennedy, an expert on the U.S.-China economic relationship at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said on Bloomberg Television.The bar for “crazy” has moved from deterrence, anti-dumping and countervailing duties, to sanctions, and “now we are talking, ‘let’s rip these two economies apart,”’ which is “nuts,” Kennedy said.Also pleading for more engagement between the two economies, and globally, was Susan Shirk, research professor and chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California San Diego and a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state.“I believe that China is overreaching and America is overreacting and it creates a really dangerous dynamic,” Shirk said on Bloomberg Television. She recalled former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s remarks from the forum’s first day, and called for more “clear thinking in the U.S.”Deal or No DealWhile corporate and political leaders mulled the way forward over the long-term, they also discussed how business must go on, divorced from the daily trade-war headlines.Firms are “having to constantly adapt, and they can’t wait for political resolution” on Brexit or U.S.-China trade battles, said HSBC Holdings Plc interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn.Michael Froman, Mastercard Inc. vice chairman and former U.S. trade representative, called the phase-one deal “largely a purchase deal,” and “the easy piece.” He echoed others at the forum in saying the real issue is how do the two countries accommodate each other when they are following different rules.Froman warned that if China continues to part ways from U.S.-style industrial policy, “it will not be surprising to see opposition in the U.S. and Europe and elsewhere given the distorted effect on international trade. The question is: How do we move to a common set of rules?”Tech WarsBeyond tariffs, analysts and business leaders mulled how to ensure that potential bifurcation in technology doesn’t hamper innovation.Ian Bremmer, founder and president of Eurasia Group, told Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin that while some U.S.-China decoupling already is underway, there are still questions over which countries will choose sides around a “virtual Berlin wall,” and “how high the wall is.”“The level of trust has all but gone away” and while “the United States will continue to innovate on its own, and of course China will innovate on its own,” so many big global initiatives require collaboration, said Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo and founding partner of AME Cloud Ventures.“What we need is a strategy for tech engagement in China, and it’s time to have that conversation,” said Samm Sacks, a fellow on cybersecurity policy and China digital economy at the Washington-based New America Foundation.We’ll end this on something of an optimistic note.“Artificial intelligence is not the thing you see in the movies,” said Eric Schmidt, Google’s former chief executive officer and currently a top technical adviser to the Pentagon. “It’s going to revolutionize health care. That’s going to be better done by computers, advising the doctor: the doctor will make the decision.”The New Economy Forum is being organized by Bloomberg Media Group, a division of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.&#92;--With assistance from Kristine Servando.To contact the reporters on this story: Michelle Jamrisko in Singapore at mjamrisko@bloomberg.net;Enda Curran in hong kong at ecurran8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Malcolm Scott at mscott23@bloomberg.net, Adrian KennedyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/businesses-adapt-rising-global-risks-091504160.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-14	2019-11-14 19:38:48	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	3 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks That Deutsche Bank Loves	When the dentist advises you to brush your teeth, what do you do? You brush your teeth. And when the car mechanic urges you to pump your tires, you’re going to listen to his advice and pump them, right?Well, investing is not much different: when you need some guidance, you heed the expert’s advice.Deutsche Bank is Germany’s largest bank, and one of the world’s largest by total assets. It staffs some of the best analysts on the Street and it currently ranks as number 7 in TipRanks Top Performing Research Firms chart.With this in mind, we decided to take a look at some of the German giant’s recent stock recommendations. Let’s jump right in.Mastercard (MA)Payment processing giant Mastercard has a huge market cap of $281 billion and has swiped its way into the public’s conscience via its ubiquitous presence in our everyday life.Even so, it is not one to rest on its laurels, and has many income streams. The company is developing its ACH (Automated Clearing House) infrastructure, winning new market share (it is in the process of adding Santander in the UK, BNP Paribas, and BMW portfolio, amongst others) and working with fintech disruptors such as Revolut, N26, and Monzo.5-star Deutsche analyst Bryan Keane thinks the multinational firm has an “operating model that delivers,” noting, “MA is dedicated to expanding its card business while also layering on incremental network growth over the mid to long-term through new opportunities such as ACH/real-time payments, B2B, cross-border account-to-account and new applications like bill pay.”The Bill Pay Exchange is set to launch in the US in 4Q19 and represents a big investment for Mastercard. The service will allow consumers to pay bills without having to remember multiple passwords, set up accounts with different billers, and log into multiple websites. Mastercard believes it can become a key player in the bill presentment and payer market.Keane added, “Overall, we believe MA can continue to grow solid low-double-digits top-line (propelling into mid-teens growth) and deliver operating leverage even while investing in future network expansion initiatives, which should drive EPS growth above the high-teens, in our view.”To this end, Keane reiterated a Buy rating on MA, with a price target of $320, which provides potential upside of 15% from its current price of $277. (To watch Keane’s track record, click here)All in all, over the last three months, MA stock has received a whopping 18 Buy ratings. As a result, the stock has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus rating. These analysts believe (on average) that the financial services giant has big upside potential of over 13% from the current share price. This would take MA from $278.34 all the way to $316.13. (See Mastercard stock analysis on TipRanks)Take-Two (TTWO)Popular video game holding company, Take-Two, might have a problem. However, its problem is one most companies would like to have: how do you follow a bonanza success with another?Its most successful game, Grand Theft Auto V, (made by Rockstar Games, one of the holding company’s publishing labels), has sold more than 115 million copies worldwide. Its sequel, Grand Theft Auto VI, is not expected until late 2020 at the earliest. With the incredible success of GTA V, it remains to be seen whether the new release can match it. Nevertheless, there’s enough action kicking off in the meantime to keep investors happy.Take Two recently posted a strong F2Q20 report. Net revenue grew 74% to $857.8 million, EPS gained 186% to reach $0.63, and the company raised its operating outlook for fiscal year 2020.Deutsche’s Clay Griffin thinks the game designer is in good shape, noting, “While investors wait, GTA V/Online remains extremely healthy (and sets the stage for an earnings step function in GTA VI), the NBA2K franchise continues to move higher, and we have a high level of confidence in the long term net bookings contribution of Red Dead Online… While it may not have the predictability of its larger peers, pound-for-pound we see TTWO's portfolio of IP and creative excellence as differentiated. We think it is in the middle stages of a major content cycle that should crescendo into a Grand Theft Auto VI launch in F'22.”Griffin rates the stock as a Buy, with the price target of $145 implying over 20% upside. (To watch Griffin’s track record, click here)All in all, there is a fair amount of positivity surrounding TTWO right now. TipRanks deems the stock as Strong Buy, which is based on 13 &quot;buy&quot; and 4 &quot;hold&quot; ratings. The average price target is $135.81, which indicates an upside of about 11% from its current price of $121.78. (See Take Two’s stock analysis on TipRanks)Dropbox (DBX)Although Dropbox might have started as a simple consumer-based storage solution, it has gone through a transformation process over the years, and now describes itself as “the world’s first smart workplace.&quot;The company recently launched Dropbox Spaces, a set of tools which includes new features developed through its machine intelligence platform, DBXi. In addition, the company added several new collaboration features across Dropbox surfaces. Alongside the new features though, the company also increased the price of its Dropbox Plus service.The company’s recently posted 3Q19 report was the first to examine the impact of the price increase on average revenue per user (ARPU) and net adds/churn. The print left a solid impression on 5-star Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead, who noted, “Dropbox delivered solid/clean results, marked by a modest top-line beat (20% c/c growth relative to 19%-20% guide) made up of ARPU growth of 4% (5%-6% ex-FX) and net adds of 400k (compared with guidance of 300k, implying no material uptick in churn).” The analyst continued, &quot;The debate may now turn to whether the 4Q19/1Q20 guide for net adds of just 200k is evidence of delayed churn or merely conservative guidance. We continue to believe that the outlook for high-teens/20% growth and margin expansion warrants 2020 multiples higher than the current levels of 4x revs and 24x FCF.&quot;As a result, Keirstead reiterated his Buy rating on DBX stock along with a $28 price target, suggesting room for almost 50% upside. (To watch Keirstead’s track record, click here)The Street is with Keirstead on this one, as Dropbox currently has a consensus of 7 Buys and 1 Hold, making it a Strong Buy. With an average stock-price forecast of $30.71, analysts are predicting a handsome upside potential of over 60% for the stock.

2019-11-12	2019-11-12 01:38:02	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Tencent Should Be Split Up	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China’s most ubiquitous company is hiding one of its most valuable assets. That needs to change.Tencent Holdings Ltd., best known for the WeChat messenger that almost everyone in the country uses, has a growing fintech business. But it’s getting overshadowed by the games and social media divisions. By spinning it off into a new company, with a move to a separate listing, management could unlock as much as $230 billion in value. That would make the entity China’s fourth-largest listed company and the world’s sixth-biggest financial services firm.Such a move could help Tencent retake some of the limelight that it’s about to share with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. once that company lists in Hong Kong. Alibaba’s fintech unit, Ant Financial Services Group, already functions as a separate business with the e-commerce giant holding a 33% stake. At Tencent, fintech and business services accounted for 26% of revenue last quarter. The Shenzhen-based company is due to report third-quarter earnings late Wednesday.I estimate that revenue from Tencent’s fintech business grew in excess of 70% last year.(1)  The vast majority of that was payments. Yet Tencent also offers other products such as wealth management and has a 30% stake in WeBank, China’s first online-only bank, which was founded five years ago. Data on its fintech profits are hard to ascertain, yet information disclosed by Alibaba shows that Ant Financial was unprofitable last year, so Tencent could be in a similar boat. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. The two rivals are startups in the classic sense, using fast revenue growth driven by marketing and incentives to gain ground fast. A major reason why both have lost money in recent years is due to low take rates, the commissions received from processing payments, because they’ve offered discounts to consumers and merchants. A turnaround could be near, Sanford C Bernstein senior analyst David Dai wrote in a recent series on China’s fintech sector. He estimates that a maturing market will ease cut-throat competition and allow both companies to take a greater share of the money that sloshes through their payments platforms.As a result, Tencent’s payment business (TenPay) alone could be worth $137 billion, compared to $127 billion for Ant’s AliPay, the Bernstein team figures. HSBC Holdings Plc uses two methodologies(2) to come up with an estimated value of around $128 billion. Throw in the other products, and Bernstein calculates a base-case valuation for Tencent’s fintech unit of $160 billion, going as high as $230 billion. This indicates that 40% to 58% of Tencent’s current market cap is locked up in this hitherto hidden division. Bernstein has a base case of $210 billion for Ant, reaching as high as $320 billion.Payments spinoffs have proven to be lucrative in the past. EBay Inc. proved it with PayPal Holdings Inc. in 2015, with the latter posting a 177% normalized return since then, outpacing the 145% rise in the S&P Data Processing sub-index which includes Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. PayPal also trounced both eBay (35%) and the S&P 500 (49%). Square Inc., another payments provider, has been one of the hottest stocks of the past decade, returning more than 590% since its initial public offering in 2015.A more recent example comes from India, where Walmart Inc. is reported to be spinning off payments business PhonePe from local e-commerce company Flipkart Group, which it acquired last year. That transaction could turn a $20.8 billion startup into two unicorns with a combined value of more than $30 billion. Tencent doesn’t need to rush to list this fintech unit. Appetite for mega IPOs is likely to be satiated by Alibaba’s Hong Kong listing and that of Saudi Aramco over the next few months. And there’s a long runway of big startups ready for their moment in the sun. By merely making it a separate entity, management can signal intent and allow investors to start re-rating Tencent’s stock accordingly.An offering may not even be necessary, since Tencent is already sitting on more cash than it needs. Instead, the company could distribute shares in Tencent Fintech to existing shareholders, and then directly list the stock. That’s similar to the approach advocated by activist investor Dan Loeb for a Sony Corp. split.Tencent is sitting on a bright light in this fintech unit. Time to let it shine.(Updates to include reference to third-quarter earnings schedule in third paragraph.)(1) The &quot;others&quot; category includes fintech, cloud, film & TV. Tencent noted that fintech is the major component and gave a figure for cloudbut not content.(2) HSBC Approach 1: valuation per user. Approach 2: Using Tencent operating margins applied to its payments business, then comparing to peers.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2019-11-08	2019-11-08 18:11:36	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Strong Q3 Numbers Confirm That Square Stock Will Rebound	It's been a rough past 12 months for shares of payments processor Square (NYSE:SQ), as slowing growth trends coupled with competition and valuation concerns have caused SQ stock to plunge from an all-time high price tag of $100 back in late September 2018, to a $50 price tag in late September 2019.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com But, SQ stock is starting to show signs of life again. In early November 2019, the company reported third-quarter numbers that were much better than expected, and broadly eased slowing growth and competition concerns. Square stock popped about 5% to three-month highs in response to the strong print.Is this post-earnings pop in SQ stock the start of a bigger rebound? Or is it just a head-fake in a stock that's doomed to head lower?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI think it's the former. The strong third-quarter earnings report added further evidence to the notion that this company can simultaneously sustain strong revenue growth at scale, while rapidly improving its margin profile. This combination paves the path for Square to generate robust profit growth over the next few years. Some of that profit growth is priced into SQ stock today. Some isn't. The part that isn't is what will drive SQ stock higher from here.The investment implication? Buy into the Square stock rebound. This stock is heading for $70 soon. Square Earnings Add Credibility to Bull ThesisIn the big picture, Square's third-quarter earnings report was yet another piece of evidence providing support for the bull thesis underpinning Square stock.What is that bull thesis? Thanks to secular growth trends supporting broader adoption of non-cash payments globally, Square is well positioned to deliver sustained strong revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Stock Up On It may sound like a mouthful. But, when you break it down, it's simple. Consumers everywhere are pivoting to non-cash payments because paying with a card or a phone is so much easier than paying with cash. Businesses globally have to keep up with this pivot. Square builds solutions which allow them to do that. At first, Square simply offered businesses point-of-sale hardware solutions so that they could accept all sorts of non-cash payments. Now, Square has since built out an ecosystem of software offerings complementing the core non-cash payment process, and all of these services feature high gross margins, so scale should ultimately drive big revenues and big profits here.At this point, the numbers tell the story. Gross payment volume through Square's ecosystem rose 25% year-over-year in Q3, following 25% growth last quarter. Adjusted revenue growth was yet again in the 40%-and-up territory. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded more than 500 basis points year-over-year to record highs, continuing what has been a multi-year stretch of margin improvements. The guide calls for all this to continue next quarter.Square is leveraging product innovation and secular growth tailwinds to sustain big revenue growth at scale and drive margins significantly higher. This trend has been alive for several years now. The more quarters Square turns in like this one, the more likely it appears that this trend will remain alive for the next several years, too. Square Stock Is UndervaluedGiven increased support for the notion that Square will remain a big revenue and profit growth company for a lot longer, SQ stock appears undervalued under $65.The numbers are simple. Global retail sales are projected to grow at a 4%-5% annualized pace over the next few years. In 2019, Square projects to own about 0.42% of the global retail sales pie, up from 0.35% in 2018, 0.28% in 2017 and 0.23% in 2016. Thus, thanks mostly to secular tailwinds underpinning non-cash payment adoption, Square has been able to consistently grow share in the global retail market.This dynamic will continue. Assuming Square continues to expand share at a cadence of 5 to 7 basis points each year, and further assuming that Square's services ecosystem continues to expand and become more valuable in a non-cash dominated world, then Square should easily remain a 20%-plus revenue growth company for the next several years.Profit margins should continue to improve. All of Square's businesses operate at high gross margins. Operating expense growth will be big to support big growth. But, it won't be 20%-plus big. As such, steady 20%-plus revenue growth on top of sub-20% expense growth should drive healthy margin expansion.This combination of 20%-plus revenue growth and steady margin expansion should drive somewhere around 30%-plus profit growth. By my numbers, Square will hit $4 in earnings per share by fiscal 2025. Mature payments companies, like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), trade around 30-times forward earnings. Applying that industry-average multiple to $4 in 2025 EPS, you arrive at a 2024 price target for SQ stock of $120.Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 price target for SQ stock of $75. That's notably higher than where shares trade hands today. Bottom Line on SQ StockSquare stock has been beaten and bruised over the past year, mostly thanks to slowing growth trends giving credence to the idea that competition is killing the Square growth narrative.But, in the third quarter, growth trends stabilized sequentially. This sequential stabilization in growth erodes the bear thesis which has dominated SQ stock over the past year. Instead, it adds credibility to the idea that Square will sustain large revenue growth at scale for a lot longer.With respect to SQ stock, the impacts of this are obvious. If this growth stabilization persists -- and it should -- the past year's selloff in SQ stock, could turn into a rally over the next year.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long SQ.

2019-11-08	2019-11-08 11:00:27	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	It’s Finally Time to Take a Pause on Visa Stock	Visa (NYSE:V) stock has exhibited a behavior not seen in a long time, it has stayed in place. The payments processor has consistently moved higher for the last few years as consumers across the world increasingly moved to card-based transactions. However, the lack of movement leaves V stock investors wondering what to do.Source: Shutterstock Market trends have left it seemingly immune from secular downturns. Still, it has also stopped responding positively. Considering the stock's history, as long as V stock remains in its current position, traders should probably do the same. Payment Trends, Dominance at Home Drive VisaVisa stock has performed well over the last few years. The company benefits as society increasingly turns from cash in favor of electronic payments. Within the U.S., most of those are made on Visa cards as the firm gains market share over processors such as Mastercard (NYSE:MA), American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVisa processed 53.1% of U.S. card transactions in 2018. Despite the competition, this percentage has continued to grow. Moreover, it operates on all six continents and lags only China UnionPay in worldwide transactions.  * 7 Buy-Rated Stocks With Dividend Yields Over 9% At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.4, few consider this a cheap stock. However, with the record of profit growth it continues to accumulate, I find it hard to argue with the valuation. Over the previous five years, earnings grew by an average of 21.47% per year. Profit growth will slow somewhat in the future but remain robust. Wall Street forecasts earnings increases of 14.3% this year and 16.4% in the next.Clearly, Visa remains a strong stock. While I do not think cash will completely disappear, more people will conduct more transactions via card. Moreover, with numerous countries in the world mostly using physical cash, Visa has the potential to maintain double-digit growth for years to come. V Stock Has Become Range-BoundThe near-term problem for V stock is its lack of traction. On July 19, I urged investors not to buy Visa stock as valuations fully reflected growth potential. Other investors seem to see what I saw. Since that day, the V stock price is just under $180 per share, representing almost no change from mid-July levels.Hence, the question for investors is what will move V stock? Will it fall over a market downturn, or will a comparatively cheap valuation finally motivate buyers?Despite the ten-plus-year length of the economic expansion, it shows no signs of recession. This is significant because it takes turmoil in the market to take V stock into correction territory. It fell briefly into a bear market in the fall 2018 stock selloff. However, before that, it had not seen a significant selloff since 2010. This makes me wonder if this plateau is the closest thing we will see to a correction.For now, valuation looks like a more likely catalyst. When I warned investors to not buy in July, the forward P/E ratio stood above 29. With that forward multiple now at 24.4, the plateau has improved the buy case for V stock. Still, its 52-week high stands at $187.05 per share. That is only around 4% lower than the current price.If it can move to the $190 per share level and stay there, V stock will likely keep moving higher. However, if we experience a downturn in the market, investors may have a chance to buy in at a lower price. For now, all investors can do is wait. The Bottom Line on Visa StockSince V stock shows little movement, investors should probably do the same. Due in large part to e-commerce, traders across the world have turned more often to using credit cards. This plays in Visa's favor as a slight majority of U.S. card transactions take place on Visa's payment network. This will also continue to make V stock a long-term winner.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond However, with a slightly elevated P/E ratio, Visa stock currently prices in its present and future growth. With V stock staying in place, traders have no clue as to the direction of Visa in the short term. The lack of movement effectively lowers the P/E ratio due to profit growth.Moreover, V stock has no recent history of falling significantly without a market downturn.Until Visa can break out of its current trading range, traders have little reason to buy.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-11-06	2019-11-06 18:11:05	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	3 ‘Strong Buy’ Payment Stocks from Oppenheimer’s Top Analyst	The corps of Wall Street stock analysts numbers in the thousands, but at the top stand a select few, those analysts with the experience and savvy to pull together the facts and discern the probable path of the markets. You can find these top analysts, the best of the best, at TipRanks Top 25 Analysts, a list of the Street’s top performing stock watchers.Among these top analysts, there is a standout. Glenn Greene, ranked 3 overall, is also the top analyst from Oppenheimer, the New York City-based investment bank. The big Wall Street firms are also rated at TipRanks, and Oppenheimer holds the 4 spot among the Top Research firms. This combination of a top individual rating with a top institutional rating gives extra weight to Greene’s stock ratings.In the last two weeks, Greene has applied his expertise to the major players in the payment processing sector. Let's take a closer look:Mastercard (MA)We’ll start with Mastercard, by market cap, at $271.4 billion, the second largest credit card company in the world. Strictly speaking, MA is not truly a credit card company; it’s a payment processor. The actual cards are issued by banks or other financial institutions, and branded with Mastercard’s logo. Mastercard, the parent company, collects royalties on the logo and branding use, as well as buyer and seller transaction fees every time such a card is swiped.It’s a solid and profitable business model, as evidenced by Mastercard’s appreciation since the market bottomed last December. MA shares are up 42.6% year-to-date, far outperforming the broader markets. For comparison, the S&P 500 gain this year is 22.7%. In its Q3 earnings, reported late last month, MA showed an EPS of $2.15 against a forecast of $2.01, and reported a 14% yearly increase in gross dollar volume of transactions, to $1.7 trillion.Greene noted, “Mastercard delivered strong 3Q19 results with ~16% CC revenue growth and EPS of $2.15... MA modestly increased core FY19 guidance, which now anticipates the high end of low-teens CC revenue growth... We update our estimates to reflect strong quarterly results and now estimate ~18% EPS growth in FY19, which anticipates continued solid broad-based volume momentum.” Greene’s $312 price target on MA suggests an upside potential of 16% to the stock.Greene is not the only analyst giving MA some love. The shares have a unanimous analyst consensus of Strong Buy, based on 18 recent buy ratings. The average price target of $316 represents a 17% upside from the share price of $269. (See Mastercard stock analysis on TipRanks)Visa, Inc. (V)Visa is Mastercard’s bigger twin. Like MA, Visa no longer issues cards itself – it uses the same model of collecting royalties for branding, plus transactions fees on card use. And like Mastercard, Visa finds the model profitable. In its fiscal Q4, reported last month, Visa showed a 13% yearly gain in revenue, to $5.43 billion for the quarter, and an impressive 21% yearly gain in non-GAAP EPS, to $1.21. Quarterly net income, at $3.03 billion, was also up, gaining 6.3% from the $2.85 billion reported last year. Payment volume – the standard metric of total Visa card use – was up 9% from the year-ago quarter.Visa’s strong growth in all metrics reflects both the increasing use of digital payments and continued high consumer confidence and spending in the US. The first factor is likely to continue supporting Visa into the indefinite future; the second is fickle, but likely to continue for the next 6 to 12 months. Even if consumer confidence declines, Visa, with over $20 billion in total revenues in the last fiscal year, and more than $10 billion in net income, has the resources to hold fast.Those resources were Greene’s mind when he titled his recent note on Visa, “V Finishes Year on Solid Note; Provides Encouraging Outlook.” In the note, Greene pointed out that the company gave an optimistic outlook for FY2020, guiding on low-double-digit credit card revenue growth. He wrote in his bottom line, “We are highly attracted to Visa's powerful brand, vast global acceptance network and strong business model. We believe the company is well positioned to benefit from the long-term secular shift from paper currency to plastic, consumer spending growth and increased globalization.” Greene’s $202 price target on V indicates his confidence in 14% growth.Overall, V stock gets another unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. No less than 8 analysts have up-checked this stock in recent weeks. Shares sell for $178, and the average price target of $206 suggests an upside potential of 16%. (See Visa stock analysis on TipRanks)PayPal (PYPL)With PayPal, we move away from traditional card companies into the truly digital world. This company led the way in online digital payments, and in the four years since it spun off of eBay as an independent entity, it has grown to $15.5 billion in annual revenue and more than $2 billion in net income. Looking at other metrics of success, PayPal has over 286 million active users across 202 separate markets worldwide. Customers can hold, send, or receive funds in 25 different currencies.Like its more traditional peers, PayPal reported earnings in late October. The company showed a 195 gain in revenue, hitting $4.38 billion for the quarter, and a 25% gain in total payment volume – one of the company’s key metrics – to $178.67 billion. Both revenues and total payment volume beat the pre-earnings forecasts. PayPal’s net income for the quarter was $462 million, or 39 cents per share. The EPS was up 8% from one year ago.Green acknowledged both PayPal’s current strong quarter and its recent headwinds in the opening of his recent note on the stock: “After a disappointing 2Q, PayPal delivered strong 3Q results as revenue grew 19%.” In his bottom line, he wrote, “PayPal has an attractive business model characterized by transaction-related fees, relatively low capital requirements, and strong free cash flow generation... We think PYPL is particularly well positioned to benefit as retail activity continues to migrate from brick-and-mortar stores toward online and mobile venues.” Greene gave PYPL a $125 price target, implying an upside of 24%.Green is certainly not the first analyst with an optimistic outlook for the online payment giant, as TipRanks analytics showcasing PayPal stock as a Strong Buy. With an average stock-price forecast of $127.22, analysts are predicting an upside of nearly 26%. In total, the stock has received 17 'buy' ratings vs. just 4 'hold' ratings in the past three months.

Online sales are expected to account for 14.6% of total retail sales. This year, there are only 26 shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas day, six days fewer than last year. &quot;A shorter holiday season puts more importance on each shopping day of the season, making the role of the internet important in helping deliver consumers the omnichannel shopping experience they want,&quot; said Steve Sadove, senior advisor for Mastercard, in a statement. Other forecasts from groups like AlixPartners and the National Retail Federation are also bullish, though they cite the impact of uncertainty from issues like the trade war. The Amplify Online Retail ETF  has gained 7.3% over the past year. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF  is down 8.5%. The S&P 500 index  is up 13.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has rallied 8.7% for the period.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3224c0fa-3160-3866-8ddf-db4abce5ef06/mastercard-spendingpulse.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-28	2019-10-28 19:52:41	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Earnings: 3 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks to Watch Tuesday	It’s that time of year again – Earnings season! The third quarter is well behind us, and companies are preparing to release their quarterly earnings reports. Earnings season is always a critical time for investors, as companies are publishing actual results. So far, investors have used estimates and indirect data to make allocation decisions; now they get to see the real numbers.We’ve opened up TipRanks’ Earnings Calendar, a great tool for tracking companies’ earnings reports and results. Using the calendar, we’re looking at three ‘Strong Buy’ stocks set to report earnings this week, to see what about them makes the Street optimistic.Mondelez International (MDLZ)This is a holding company, created in 2012 when Kraft Foods spun off its North American grocery segments. Today, Mondelez is the parent company of numerous well-known snack brands, including Nabisco, Oreo, and Ritz, along with chocolates like Toblerone and Cadbury, and chewing gum names Trident, Dentyne, and Chiclets. Mondelez sees over $25.9 billion in annual revenue, and realizes over $2.9 billion in annual net income.Mondelez’ second-quarter report is historically the company’s ‘slow time;’ that is, Q2 shows the company’s lowest earnings during the year. In Q2 2019, MDLZ matched the EPS estimates, at 57 cents per share, and slipped slightly on revenues. The $6.06 billion reported was 0.8% down year-over-year, mostly attributed to poor currency exchange rates.Looking ahead, the company guided toward a net revenue growth of 3%, higher than the previous 2.5% estimate. Management expects currency exchange rates to put an 11-cent headwind on earnings, but the EPS forecast shows possible 3% to 5% growth. Free cash flow is expected to reach $2.8 billion for Q3.5-star RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi is bullish on MDLZ, setting a $66 price target and indicating a possible 25% upside to the stock as he initiates coverage of this company with an Outperform rating. (To watch Modi's track record, click here)Supporting his thesis, Modi writes, “Over the past year, MDLZ has made material operational changes and capability upgrades that we believe will set it up to deliver revenue growth towards the upper end of the large-cap staples sector average. We see MDLZ LT targets as achievable with upside potential. For FY'20 we are modeling organic growth of 3.5% (LT algo +3%) and EPS growth of 7%.”Wall Street loves this stock, earning a stellar analyst consensus rating, as TipRanks analytics demonstrate MDLZ as a Strong Buy. Out of 12 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 9 are bullish on Mondelez stock, while 3 remain sidelined. With a return potential of nearly 16%, the stock's consensus target price stands at $60.58. (See Mondelez stock analysis on TipRanks)FMC Corp. (FMC)This chemical company is one of the most diversified manufacturers in the US. It originated as an insecticide producer, and its core product remains agricultural chemicals. At various times, however, FMC has produced vehicles for the Defense Department, and was the prime manufacturer of the M113 armored fighting vehicle. Today, FMC is best known for pesticides and fungicides, and realizes upwards of $4.7 billion in annual revenue, with over $500 million in net income.FMC beat the estimates in Q2, showing an 11% year-over-year gain in EPS, with $1.66 per share. Revenues gained 4% and came in at $1.206 billion against a forecast of $1.2 billion. As with MDLZ, FMC saw a headwind from the currency exchange rates, but not as severe. Higher pricing helped to negate the currency factor.Management guided toward Q3 revenue of $960 million to $990 million, with FY2019 numbers remaining at $4.5 to $4.6 billion. The Q3 earnings are expected at 75 to 85 cents per share, while the full-year earnings forecast was increased to the $5.68 to $5.88 range.Michael Sison, 5-star analyst with Wells Fargo, is encouraged by FMC’s strong performance and positive guidance. He initiated coverage on the company with a robust $100 price target and a bullish stance. Sison’s price target implies an upside of 19%. (To watch Sison's track record, click here)The analyst noted, “The combination of expanding its current portfolio of products to niche specialty crops as well as to more geographies and a good pipeline of new actives should support … organic sales growth annually which is seen distinctly thus far in 2019.”TipRanks shows a large amount of bulls liking the odds on this chemical king. Out of 13 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 10 are bullish on FMC stock, while 3 are playing it safe on the sidelines. However, is the stock overvalued or undervalued based on these analysts' expectations? Consider that the 12-month average price target of $98.67 suggests a nearly 17% upside potential from where the stock is currently trading. (See FMC stock analysis on TipRanks)Mastercard (MA)We think of Mastercard as a credit card company, but it’s really a payment processor, for cards issued with the company’s familiar brand. Mastercard draws its income mainly from processing fees charged to the merchants, but also to transaction fees charged to the customers and from royalties paid by card issuers for use of the famous logo.The variety of income streams helped MA to weather the market downturn in 2H18, and after slipping from Q3 2018 to Q4 2018, the company has shown steadily improving earnings through 2019. In the company’s last report, for Q3 2019 released in July, strong consumer spending helped to boost the bottom line.That bottom line beat the forecast estimates. Mastercard saw an 8.6% gain in gross dollar volume – a measure of the dollar value of all processed transactions – to $1.6 trillion for Q2, on a 21% yearly gain in total transactions processed. Net income was $2.05 billion, while the revenue of $4.11 billion beat the forecast of $4.08 billion. Adjusted EPS, at $1.89 per share, was 3% higher than the $1.83 expectation. All in all, it was a strong quarter and the consensus for Q3 is more of the same. EPS is expected to come in at $2.01 per share on Tuesday.5-star analyst Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research has recently lifted his price target by 20% to $300 and reiterated his Buy rating on MA stock. (To watch Peller's track record, click here)Peller noted, “Following MA’s 2Q release, we believe the high-end of low-double-digit revenue guidance for the year could look more like low-teens growth by year end as FX headwinds abate and the company continues to surpass expectations with strong organic constant currency growth… That said, we also believe these trends should continue to underscore the long-term opportunity and maintain our OP rating.”MA, like the other stocks in this list, has a Strong Buy consensus rating – but in this case, the consensus is unanimous. In the last three months, this stock has seen 17 buy ratings. The average price target of $317.31 indicates about 15% upside from the current share price of $274.95.

2019-10-28	2019-10-28 14:00:24	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Thank These Five Stocks as S&P 500 Reaches New Record	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If someone woke from a coma and saw that the S&P 500 Index was up 21% for the year and reaching a new record high on Monday, the immediate reaction would most likely be that everything is great. But that’s far from true.The list of reasons stocks should be down is much longer than the one for why they should be up. The economy has slowed, and a majority of chief financial officers anticipate a recession within a year. Earnings have stopped growing, and estimates are being cut. Stock valuations are high. The U.S.-China trade war has not been resolved. Congress has started an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve is easing monetary policy, but that’s only because the outlook has deteriorated.So why are equities roaring ahead? The answer comes down to a handful of stocks: Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Visa Inc., MasterCard Inc. and Oracle Corp. Those five companies account for half of the S&P 500 tech sector, which has surged 30.2% for the year. Exclude that sector and the S&P 500 would be up only about 14%, according to DataTrek Research. That’s still good but nothing special when compared with the returns in the rest of the world, with the MSCI All-Country World Index excluding the U.S. having gained 12%.Therein lies the hidden risk embedded in the market, which is that any missteps by any of these highfliers could spell doom for equities more broadly. It also underscores just how lacking in breadth this latest leg up has been. For one, the percentage of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange closing above their 200-day moving averages has dropped to 53% from 59% in mid-September.Not only that, but the spread between the share of S&P 500 members closing at 52-week highs and the share at 52-week lows has been in a general downtrend since June.To be sure, it’s not unusual that a handful of stocks have led the broader market higher. Before this year, it was the FAANG group of stocks: Facebook Inc., Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and a few others. A few years ago, AQR Capital Management’s co-founder and chief investment officer, Clifford Asness, published a paper examining the impact of individual stocks on the S&P 500 from 1994 to 2014. What he found was that while the S&P 500 rose 9.3% a year, the top 10 stocks accounted for 4.1 percentage points of that gain on average.Then there’s the awkward fact that smaller stocks that make up the vast majority of the market are down about 11% from their records reached in August 2018 based on the S&P Small Cap 600 and Russell 2000 indexes.This stock market has delivered plenty of surprises, and betting against it has been a losing proposition. In January, when the S&P 500 was trading at about 2,600, the median estimate of about 25 Wall Street strategist surveyed by Bloomberg was for it to end the year at 2,913. It surpassed that level in April and ended Friday at 3,203. But those same strategists are more cautious, predicting the benchmark to drop to 3,000 by the end of the year.Of course, they could raise their forecasts, but that would be awkward given the trend in profits and the slowing economy. Third-quarter earnings are tracking at a 3% decline from a year earlier, and forecasts for the fourth quarter have been cut to a gain of 1.2% from the 5.4% increase that was forecast at the end of July, according to Cantor Fitzgerald. The S&P 500’s price-to-earnings ratio, at just shy of 20 times, is the highest since last October, just as the benchmark was beginning a tumble that led to a 14% drop in the final three months of the year.All that suggests investors need to look beyond the headlines about yet another record.To contact the author of this story: Robert Burgess at bburgess@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Robert Burgess is an editor for Bloomberg Opinion.

2019-10-25	2019-10-25 15:36:09	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	3 Top Stock Picks From the Street’s Best Analysts	TipRanks does the legwork of analyzing the analyst. The platform uses natural language algorithms to sort through the stock reports of over 5,500 Wall Street analysts, determining who made the best calls, and which recommendation brought in the best returns. The result is a comprehensive database of stock analysts, rated and ranked by success and return. When you see 5 stars next to a TipRanks analyst, you know who to trust.Today, we’ve pulled reports from three of the top analysts in the TipRanks database. These Wall Street wizards have success rates in excess of 70%, and average returns above 20%. We’ll look at a recent recommendation from each of them, to see what makes a stock compelling to the experts.Mastercard (MA)Oppenheimer’s Glenn Greene is currently ranked 1 in the TipRanks database. He earned his five stars with an 84% success rate on his stock calls. Greene’s average return of 21.3%, indicating that the stocks in his coverage universe are profitable as well as bullish.Greene has recently issued a report on Mastercard, the credit card company. The top analyst had attended the company's Investor Day, and came away with a bullish outlook, giving the stock a Buy rating and a $312 price target (15% upside from current levels).Mastercard isn’t really a credit card company. Rather, it’s a payment processor, for cards issued with the company brand. Mastercard’s business model is built on a range of income streams – royalties from card issuers using the brand, fees from the card issuers for using the company’s payment processing, and transaction fees from card users for the privilege of having a credit card. Like most multi-stream incomes, the model is resilient in bad economic times and highly profitable in good times. A look at the stock’s recent performance bears this out.Markets swooned in Q4 of 2018, and the S&P 500 slipped 14%. MA shares showed a steeper loss, of 21%. But where the S&P has since made an impressive 22% rebound, MA has gained an even more impressive 50% since bottoming out. Mastercard’s most recent report, for Q2, showed a 12% revenue gain, to $4.11 billion, and an adjusted EPS of $1.89 per share, well ahead of the $1.83 expected.All of that forms the background to Glenn Greene’s meeting with company management. In Greene’s words, “MA maintains a sizeable global market opportunity and continues to emphasize its broad B2B opportunity (particularly around accounts payable), Services business and real-time ACH capabilities. Encouragingly, MA's intra-quarter volumes through August remained directionally stable with both July and 2Q19 levels. We remain quite encouraged by MA’s strategic direction and that its long-term growth trajectory remains intact.”Wall Street’s analysts have been nothing but bullish on MA over the past three months. Out of 16 analysts, all 16 are bullish on the stock. With a return potential of 17%, the stock's consensus target price stands at $317.31. (See Mastercard stock analysis on TipRanks)Smartsheet (SMAR)Holding the 3 spot in TipRanks is Canaccord analyst Richard Davis. Davis’ specialty are the tech stocks; he particularly likes the Software-as-a-Service sector. Davis boasts an excellent 79% success rate on his stock reviews, but his real strength as an analyst is in his return. An investor following Davis’ advice over the past year would have seen an impressive 42.5% return on cash invested.Smartsheet is one of the companies that Davis likes. It’s a SaaS company, marketing a cloud-based workspace management and collaboration system. Companies use Smartsheet’s products to share and a manage work projects, assign and track progress, and manage calendars. The interface is designed to make tracking simple and intuitive. Most importantly, for customers, Smartsheet’s product is meant to interface with other popular cloud systems, such as Microsoft Office, Google Apps, Salesforce.com, or Dropbox.Filling a necessary niche, and allowing integration with competitor’s products, has brought Smartsheet success. While the company’s earnings, like those of many recent tech companies, are underwater, revenues are rising steadily and the earnings consistently beat expectations. In the Q2 report, released this past September, the company showed an EPS loss of 8 cents, against the 16 cents expected. Revenues were solid, and at $64.6 million beat the $63.5 million forecast. In the last year, SMAR has beaten earnings and revenue forecasts four times out of four.In his comments on SMAR, Davis displays both his acumen for finding the right stock, and his strategic sense for long-term investing. He writes, “We believe software has become much more secular than cyclical in terms of growth and Smartsheet is one of the best positioned and executing firms that we follow. The stock’s valuation is cheaper, but obviously not cheap on any traditional metric. However, we strongly believe this firm has a long-tail growth opportunity, so investors should own at least a starter position in SMAR and hope for a pullback to fill out their position.” His $45 price target suggests a 14% upside to SMAR shares.Overall, this stock’s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 8 Buys and 1 Hold set in the past three months. SMAR’s $50 average price target is slightly higher than Davis’, and indicates room for a potential 27% upside. (See Smartsheet stock analysis on TipRanks)ON Semiconductor (ON)Jefferies' Mark Lipacis is one of ON's biggest bulls, and he is also one of the top-rated analysts who cover the stock.Lipacis holds the 7 slot out of the 5,500 analysts rated at TipRanks. His 75% success rate and 28% average return indicate a solid performance over time. The stocks he studies are oriented heavily towards hi-tech hardware; his recent ratings have included most of the big semiconductor companies.ON is one of the world’s top semiconductor companies, counting by sales, with $5.88 billion in revenue for FY 2018. Net income that year was $630 million. The products behind the earnings are a normal array of computer chips. ON Semi’s chips are used to power logic systems, signal management systems, and custom devices in the automotive, communications, and industrial sectors. The company is based in Arizona, but has offices and facilities across North America, Europe, and East Asia.The generally poor 2H18 market performance hit ON particularly hard, and the company’s earnings are still depressed. Revenues in Q2 2019 missed the forecast, with the $1.35 billion reported being 2.3% below expectations. EPS, at 42 cents, was positive, meeting the analysts’ consensus. Guidance for Q3 is also below consensus, a common tactic for managing expectations.Lipacis, in his notes on ON shares, pointed out, “ON noted inventory days in channel declining, a meaningful QQ pick up in disti resales and signs of recovery in industrial and automotive Greater China demand. We believe our margin expansion thesis will play out.”Expanding on this, Lipacis added, “ON believes the demand has stabilized at a lower level of revenue... Automotive and Industrial end markets saw a positive pick up in the Greater China region... Based on conversations with customers, ON expects QQ growth in 3Q19 communications (5G deployment and new smartphone models with higher content)…” In other words, Lipacis believes that the hard times are behind ON, revenue and demand have found a new equilibrium, and that 5G conversion will boost sales and profits going forward.Lipacis has a price target of $27.00 on this stock, suggesting an eye-opening 43% upside. In this, he is far more bullish than most; ON has an average price target of $23.46, indicating about 24% upside from the $19 share price. The stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 12 Buys, versus just 1 Hold and 1 Sell.

2019-10-25	2019-10-25 13:52:07	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Analysts Call Visa Results Better Than Feared, Like PayPal’s	(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Visa Inc. rose 0.8% in early Friday trading after the company reported earnings and issued forecasts that topped expectations. Analysts used the same phrase -- “better than feared” -- to describe Visa’s results as they’d used to characterize a report by fellow payments company PayPal Holdings Inc. on Thursday.Visa stock rose the most since Feb. 1 on Thursday to close 2.8% higher, while PayPal closed up 8.6% at the highest since Sept. 23. Visa and Mastercard Inc. have outperformed so far this year, with Visa rallying 34% and Mastercard gaining 43%. That compares with a 26% gain for PayPal, and a 20% rise in the S&P 500.Here’s a sample of the latest commentary:Morgan Stanley, James FaucetteVisa makes “compounding earnings growth look easy,” Faucette wrote in a note, as it delivered “another quarter of strong double digitrevenue/earnings growth, with 2020 guidance implying more of the same.”Faucette said that investors are “likely to be positively surprised by slightly better cross border and international growth.” He’s “encouraged by progress in longer-term opportunities.” Maintained overweight rating, lifted price target to $207 as valuation was rolled forward to 2021.MoffettNathanson, Lisa Ellis“Visa’s results were about as in line as they could be, which for Visa means really good,” Ellis wrote. She flagged fiscal 2019 revenue growth of 11% and earnings per share growth of 18%, along with forecasts pointing to “more of the same” in 2020.She added that Visa’s “core volume metrics were in-line, if still a bit sluggish.” And most of the call was spent, as usual, she said, on “strategic topics, with a particular focus on Visa’s new offerings.” Rates Visa buy, with a target price of $210.Bernstein, Harshita Rawat“We remain bullish and view Visa (and Mastercard) as a ‘clean’ secular growth story in payments,” Rawat wrote. “Despite investor concerns, macro appears largely stable, and Visa (and Mastercard’s) earnings are somewhat resilient even in a downturn,” while there’s probably upside from compounding earnings-per-share growth.In the quarter, results were largely in line with expectations when adjusted for non-operational items, including accounting, taxes and interest expense, Rawat said. Revenue was also in line when adjusted for accounting, as “modest weakness” in services and other revenue was offset by lower incentives, stronger international transactions, and data processing revenue.Visa’s 2020 forecast was “modestly ahead of buy-side expectations,” she added, noting that the outlook was a key investor focus going into the results as “many investors were cautious on macro and lapping of a strong pricing year.” Rates outperform, price target $200.Jefferies, Trevor WilliamsVisa’s earning-per-share beat was driven by “top-line upside and a lower tax rate,” Williams wrote. Initial 2020 guidance was in-line with Jefferies expectations, and may have been “better than some feared.”“We continue to like the near-term set-up with a 10%-plus discount to Mastercard despite EPS growth converging, full pricing impact in the first half of 2020, FX headwinds easing, and believe Visa Direct can drive upside,” he saidg(Updates share trading in first and second paragraphs.)To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven FrommFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-joins-paypal-better-feared-121912696.html?.tsrc=rss

On the stand for more than six hours Wednesday, he got a lashing on every other controversy facing the social media giant, too.The 35-year-old chief executive officer arrived on Capitol Hill prepared to defend the company’s plans for Libra, describing the advantages of a global digital coin that would help open up financial systems to the poor and underbanked around the world. From the start of his testimony to the House Financial Services Committee, however, lawmakers made it clear that beyond the questions they had over the new currency, they are skeptical that Facebook should be trusted with the tremendous power it has amassed over 2.7 billion global users.https://t.co/K2g4PUIriZ— Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) October 23, 2019 During the CEO’s lengthy appearance, many of Washington’s grievances about Facebook were laid bare. There were heated questions about Facebook’s refusal to fact-check political ads; accusations of rampant child exploitation on the platform; Facebook’s move to encryption and the impact that would have on the ability to obscure criminals; the company’s continued problems with election interference heading into the 2020 presidential election; what it’s doing to prevent “deepfakes,” or manipulated videos; and critiques of its poor record on workforce diversity.“I think you can appreciate using a person’s past behavior to determine their future behavior,” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a first-term Democrat from New York. “In order for us to make decisions about Libra, we have to dig into Facebook’s past behavior in respect to democracy.” She then dove into a line of questioning about what Zuckerberg knew and when regarding the Cambridge Analytica data-privacy scandal that erupted in 2018.Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters set the tone early on in a tweet she sent just as the hearing got underway.“Facebook has allowed election interference, released private data, violated civil rights laws, among other offenses & now they’re trying to launch a BigTechTakover by creating this mysterious ZuckBuck?”Waters, a California Democrat, said Facebook should stop work on its cryptocurrency project until the company addresses a series of unrelated “deficiencies” in its social-media business.Zuckerberg vowed to try to address lawmakers’ concerns but also said he hoped to “address the risk of not innovating. I don’t know if Libra is going to work, but I believe in trying new things.”He also conceded that it has been “a challenging few years for Facebook.” The company has acknowledged the unauthorized use of private user information by U.K. research firm Cambridge Analytica, shut down several state-backed disinformation campaigns, been targeted with multiple antitrust investigations and been hammered for taking money to publish false political advertising.Facebook has gone to great lengths to try to rehabilitate its image. For years, Zuckerberg had described his social network’s purpose as “connecting the world,” but that mission ended up as a grow-at-all-costs strategy that created blind spots on how the platform could be used in harmful ways, such as live-streaming terrorist shootings and attacks. Zuckerberg last testified to congress in April 2018, answering 10 hours of questions about how Facebook allowed app developers to collect data on users, and how the platform was used by Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.The company spent a record $4.8 million on lobbying in the third quarter, according to federal disclosures filed Monday, up 70% from the same period a year earlier. Since October 2018, Facebook has hired 12 external lobbying firms to supplement the 11 lobbyists it counts among its own employees, according to the company’s filings. Facebook brought on many of the outside firms to support the launch of Libra.Waters has been one of the loudest critics in Congress of Facebook’s effort to create the Libra digital token. When the social-media giant first announced its plans in June, she almost immediately demanded that the company halt development. Government officials and central bankers in Europe have also raised concerns about how the project would protect users’ privacy and prevent criminals from using it to launder money.Facebook sent David Marcus, the executive who leads the company’s blockchain team and has so far served as the de-facto leader for Libra, to address the same committee in July. He too spent much of his time defending his employer for its previous missteps, and trying to convince Congress that people will be able to use Libra without ever having to use Facebook.Zuckerberg reiterated Wednesday that he has no intention of launching the cryptocurrency without approval from U.S. regulators. That was a point of contention and confusion before the Libra Association was officially formed this month.Though he has made the promise before, Zuckerberg took it a step further on Wednesday, saying that Facebook could even be forced to leave the Libra Association entirely if the group decides to move forward with the currency without approval from U.S. regulators. It’s an unlikely scenario, but Zuckerberg’s suggestion that Facebook could abandon a project it started is meant to appease lawmakers who have pushed back aggressively. Zuckerberg said he wants the project to meet or even exceed U.S. government standards.At the same time, Zuckerberg made the case that if the U.S. doesn’t lead in innovation, specifically in areas like cryptocurrency, then China will leap ahead.“We can’t sit here and assume that because America is today the leader that it will always get to be the leader if we don’t innovate,” he said.But members of Congress poked holes in Zuckerberg’s argument that Libra would improve America’s dominance in finance around the world. If that were the case, why would Libra need a home base in Switzerland, with a global roster of members and need to be backed by multiple currencies beyond the U.S. dollar? How would the currency actually work, and would it allow transactions that were anonymous or non-refundable?Zuckerberg didn’t have many answers. The Libra product is still just an idea, and its launch will require agreements by association members on how it will function and fit within global regulatory frameworks. He said he didn’t know whether other Libra members were planning to contribute money to back the currency, and that the idea of anonymous transactions is still “an open question.”Facebook originally had 27 partners that planned to join it in the Libra Association, which is supposed to share in the governance of the cryptocurrency. Recently about a fourth of those original members dropped out, including PayPal Holdings Inc., Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican, said the departure of those members was a disturbing sign. Zuckerberg said some of Libra’s early partners abandoned the project probably because it was risky and because of the intense regulatory scrutiny. Facebook has made an effort to make clear that the social network won’t be solely responsible for managing Libra.Several lawmakers questioned Facebook’s motives for basing the Libra Association in Switzerland instead of in the U.S. A big part of other crypto companies’ decision to set up in the country is the flexible tax treatment they can get. There has also been much clearer regulatory guidance from the Swiss compared to U.S. regulators like the IRS or SEC. And Zuckerberg said he views the financial infrastructure in the U.S. as outdated.Zuckerberg, who has a personal interest in cryptocurrencies, came prepared with lofty arguments about Libra’s purpose: It could help reduce income inequality by giving people -- including 14 million in the U.S. without access to bank accounts -- an easier, faster and cheaper way to send money around the world. At the same time, it would secure America’s international financial leadership, since Libra would be backed mostly by the U.S. dollar, especially if the cryptocurrency is allowed to launch prior to similar planned efforts in China.But lawmakers pushed Facebook to clearly outline the business reasons for the project -- beyond the pitch meant to appeal to regulators. Facebook envisions Libra being incorporated into the company’s various messaging apps including WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. The company believes that the currency could help benefit its existing advertising business, or create opportunity for new revenue streams. Zuckerberg said in the hearing that Libra will eventually help boost Facebook’s ad prices, but he later said Libra is more than a business plan and that he’s “certainly not doing this because I am trying to make more money.”At the hearing’s end, there was still no consensus on what lawmakers would need to be comfortable with the project. It’s still unclear what agencies or bodies will regulate Libra and when it will actually launch.Patrick McHenry, the ranking Republican on the committee, said he’s not sure lawmakers learned anything new.“We don’t have a deeper understanding of how Libra would work.”Zuckerberg will have another attempt to clarify when he responds to potentially hundreds of pages of written questions from the legislators.&#92;--With assistance from Joe Light.To contact the reporters on this story: Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.net;Sarah Frier in San Francisco at sfrier1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zuckerberg-tries-convince-skeptical-congress-154735554.html?.tsrc=rss

They're not going to simply hand that power over. And they've set out to bury Libra.And as you'll see, they're not going after only Facebook. They're also targeting Libra's corporate backers.Libra originally had the backing of 28 companies…They make up something called the Libra Association.It's the governing body that oversees Libra. And it includes music streaming company Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) … ride-hail firms Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT)… and telecommunications giant Vodafone Group (NASDAQ:VOD).But on Friday… just two days before the inaugural meeting of the association in Geneva, Switzerland… six major backers pulled the plug.Payments firms Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Stripe, and Mercado Pago… along with eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and the company behind online reservations site Booking.com… cut their ties.This follows PayPal's decision to pull out earlier last week.These firms were reacting to a threat from two U.S. senators…On October 8, two U.S. senators - Sherrod Brown from Ohio and Brian Schatz from Hawaii - sent a letter to Visa, Mastercard, and Stripe.They warned these companies that they were concerned about Libra. And they said that membership in the Libra Association would lead to increased regulatory scrutiny.As our tech expert, Jeff Brown, told readers of our free Bleeding Edge tech investing e-letter, &quot;If that isn't a veiled threat, I don't know what is.&quot;These senators want to kill Libra…As world-famous crypto expert Teeka Tiwari has been telling his readers, the feds see Libra as a threat to the U.S. dollar… and Washington's stranglehold on the global monetary system.Here's what he wrote recently…Facebook has 2.7 billion users. If it launched today, mass adoption of Libra would be immediate. It would become the world's most widely used currency almost overnight.Imagine if Facebook negotiates with its advertisers to give Libra users 5% to 10% discounts on all their products and services. How would governments or central banks compete? They couldn't… which is why they want to stop Facebook.And make no mistake, Libra is drawing fire from both sides of the aisle. Teeka again…In a rare instance of bipartisan unity, liberal U.S. congresswoman Maxine Waters and President Trump have both condemned Libra.Waters demanded that Zuckerberg appear before Congress. She also claimed that Libra would allow Facebook to &quot;wield immense power that could disrupt&quot; governments and central banks.And President Trump has condemned Libra on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). He said Libra would &quot;have little standing or dependability.&quot;U.S. lawmakers are taking the threat from Libra so seriously they've proposed a bill to ban Big Tech firms from issuing their own digital currencies.And don't forget the leader in the race to be the Democratic nominee for president, Elizabeth Warren. She promises to break Libra up using antitrust laws if she's elected.And if Legacy Research cofounder Bill Bonner is right, Warren is a lock to be the next president of the United States.Of course, it's hard to feel sorry for Facebook…As we've been warning you, Facebook is a core component of the Deep State's surveillance apparatus. That became clear after National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013.On the surface, Facebook is a social media company. But it's really a for-profit mass surveillance company. It's the last entity on Earth you should let snoop around your finances.So, even if Libra becomes an alternative to the dollar, the euro, or the yen, we wouldn't touch it with a barge pole.Here's digital currency pioneer Marco Wutzer, who heads up our Disruptive Profits advisory…You have to grasp one thing: Facebook and its corporate partners have zero interest in giving you more freedom. They don't care about creating a better financial system or a better financial life for you.Libra will only suck up even more of your private personal data and further rob you of your financial privacy. Facebook is a giant corporation. All it cares about is profit. And that profit is based on how much of your data it can vacuum up. That's the bottom line.Libra may be convenient to use. But as Marco says, it's a net negative when it comes to financial freedom.What does this all mean for bitcoin?We'll leave the last word on that with Teeka…Facebook and bitcoin aren't necessarily aligned. But it's in Facebook's best interest to lobby for a more accommodating crypto regulatory environment. In other words, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.I expect Facebook to use its massive resources to influence global regulatory regimes. If it succeeds, it'll be good for crypto. And even if regulators do kill Libra, it won't really change anything.Governments still don't like crypto. Big whoop. We've been dealing with that for almost four years now - while adoption of digital assets continues to grow at a record pace.It's why Teeka believes bitcoin will zoom past $20,000 and break out to new all-time highs in the next eight months.

2019-10-15	2019-10-15 23:18:41	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook's Marcus Vows to 'Move Forward' With Libra, Add Members	(Bloomberg) -- The Facebook Inc. executive responsible for the embattled Libra cryptocurrency said he doesn’t fault companies that pulled out of the project, adding that he’s optimistic more organizations will sign on despite intense opposition from politicians who seem to fear financial innovation.“I totally respect the fact that those businesses and those leaders have a responsibility to their shareholders, employees and stakeholders,” Facebook’s David Marcus said in a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg Television. “We are going to move forward. We are going to add more members.”Facebook suffered a setback in recent days when a quarter of the membership of Libra’s governing body, the Libra Association, defected from the effort amid pushback from regulators and lawmakers. Among those who stepped away are some of the association’s most high-profile names, including Visa Inc., Stripe Inc. and Mastercard Inc.Visa, Stripe and Mastercard received letters earlier this month from Democratic U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown and Brian Schatz that urged the companies to “carefully consider” how they would manage potential risks associated with Libra before proceeding with the project. Asked if he thought the letter constituted a threat from the senators to the companies, Marcus responded, &quot;I don’t know, what did it sound like to you?&quot; He added that such correspondence can have a chilling effect.“For these types of letters to be circulated for a thing that is an idea -- a project -- and telling people you should not explore innovation,” that is a concern, Marcus said. “The core of our financial system has not evolved much. Consumers all around the world are paying the price for it,” he added.Facebook announced its Libra plans in June, saying the digital token would give consumers a low-cost way to make payments and transfer money across the globe. Regulators and lawmakers have expressed concerns that the coin would be used to bypass money-laundering rules and might undermine central banks’ control over monetary policy.The Libra Association, which held its first meeting in Geneva this week, has said it has more than enough willing companies waiting in the wings to join the project. There are 1,500 organizations who have expressed interest in signing on, the association said, though so far only 180 of them meet the organization’s criteria.Even if new backers do sign on, Libra is still a long way from reality. Facebook executives and the Libra Association have said they won’t launch the currency until regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere have been appeased.Industry-watchers will soon get a fresh look at lawmakers’ sentiment toward Libra. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is slated to testify before the House Financial Services Committee next week.To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.net;Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebooks-marcus-vows-move-forward-231841138.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-15	2019-10-15 18:57:18	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Distractions Ahead of Q3 Makes PayPal Stock Risky	Since it was spun off from online marketplace eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in July 2015, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has consistently delivered the goods. This year has been no different, with PayPal stock gaining nearly 24% since this January's opening price.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Over the years, I've generally taken a bullish stance on PYPL stock. As a digital-payments processor, PayPal has the distinct advantage of being indefinitely relevant. In recent years, we have witnessed the rise and surging interest in alternative payment vehicles, such as cryptocurrencies. More likely than not, this trend will continue to progress.In addition, this underlining thesis behind PayPal stock aligns naturally with current behavioral trends. According to a Pew Research Center report, &quot;Roughly three-in-ten U.S. adults (29%) say they make no purchases using cash during a typical week, up slightly from 24% in 2015.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInterestingly, Pew noted that as income levels rise, so does eschewing cash for digital payments. Logically, this makes perfect sense. Those with higher income tend to have higher education levels, and therefore have access to new technologies. Given that saving time is more of a concern than saving money for more affluent individuals, they're more willing to advantage digital payment solutions. Naturally, this benefits PYPL stock.  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now Not surprisingly, millennials love anything to do with digitalization. Since they represent the largest workforce in the U.S., the compass for PayPal stock is appropriately calibrated.However, what is surprising is that older generations are also embracing the conveniences of digitalization. When I look at PYPL stock from a wide angle, the increasing adoption of alternative payments is what keeps me bullish.That said, the third-quarter PayPal earnings report is around the corner, and that's not necessarily great news. Management Must Control the Narrative of the PayPal Earnings ReportOn paper, the upcoming PayPal earnings report - scheduled for release after the close on Oct. 23 - should result in a per-share profitability beat. Going back to Q1 2016, the company at worst has met expectations for earnings per share.This time around, covering analysts expect EPS to come in at 67 cents. This is firmly near the upper end of the estimate spectrum, which ranges from 52 cents to 71 cents. In the year-ago quarter, PYPL delivered an EPS of 58 cents. A 15.5% earnings lift year-over-year is well within reason relative to prior performances.On the revenue front, consensus forecast pegs sales at $4.4 billion. As with earnings, analysts are incredibly optimistic for growth, with revenue estimates ranging from $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion.But does all this mean that PayPal stock is an easy buy? Unfortunately, recent news items make the narrative severely complicated.In a much-publicized fallout, PayPal dropped out of Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Libra cryptocurrency project. Later, eBay, Stripe, Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), and Mercado Pago followed suit.Also, in late September, PayPal announced Chinese government approval to buy a controlling stake in Gopay Information Technology. This groundbreaking event marks the first time a foreign entity has entered China's payment services market.But most critically, PayPal lost $228 million in Q3 because of its investment in Uber (NYSE:UBER), which has been nothing short of volatile.Optically, these news items give the impression that PayPal is biting off more than it can chew. Plus, with its Uber losses, PYPL confirms that some of their bets probably won't pan out for some time. Therefore, the PayPal earnings report in Q3 will be about more than the numbers; investors will look to management to re-instill confidence in a suddenly shaky organization. It's Time to Play the Tactical Game with PayPal StockDespite my belief in the longer-term picture for PYPL stock, I've got to look at reality. For the immediate time frame, the markets are bearish on shares. In this situation, the last thing I want to do is fight the tape.Technically, PayPal stock has dropped below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (DMAs), barometers for nearer-term and longer-term sentiment, respectively. I also believe it's an important clue that the price action has stumbled at the 50 DMA in the past two months. Upside resistance is strong, which implies a future downward trajectory.But even if PayPal stock absorbs a rough outing following Q3, I won't take that as a net negative. Instead, it provides a &quot;time capsule&quot; opportunity for those who wanted to jump aboard but didn't for whatever reason. Although the nearer-term picture is troublesome, the forward outlook is among the brightest in the tech space.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

This is hardly surprising, given growing awareness of Libra’s potential adverse consequences.  If it offers anonymity to its users, Libra will become a platform for tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist finance.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ec952357-6669-3e3a-a86c-201198edd9cb/facebook%E2%80%99s-libra-unravels%2C.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-10-15	2019-10-15 14:27:38	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Libra Association Board Members Have Ties to Facebook	(Bloomberg) -- The Libra Association, which oversees a controversial cryptocurrency, was officially formed on Tuesday, and its five board members have one thing in common: close relationships with Facebook Inc. and its executives.When Facebook first announced Libra, the company was quick to point out that it wouldn’t be alone in managing such an ambitious endeavor. Instead, it hoped to be one out of as many as 100 companies controlling the new digital coin. But as regulatory pressures have mounted and early partners have been leaving the project in droves, Facebook finds itself resorting to close allies to fill the Libra leadership team.David Marcus, who heads the Facebook team that proposed Libra in the first place, is on the board. Marcus is also an investor in Xapo Inc., whose Chief Executive Officer Wences Casares is on Libra’s board as well.Joining them is Katie Haun, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, which was an early investor in Facebook. Another early Facebook backer, Digital Sky Technologies, is part-owned by Naspers, which has majority ownership of the parent company of PayU, the home of another Libra board member, Patrick Ellis.The fifth board member, Matthew Davie of micro-lending service Kiva, also has ties to Facebook. One of Kiva’s board members is John Muller, associate general counsel at Facebook who, like Marcus, hails from PayPal Holdings Inc.“Silicon Valley boards nearly always have these kinds of interconnections,” Aaron Brown, an investor and a writer for Bloomberg Opinion, wrote in an email. “Even someone without formal ties to Facebook will have informal and indirect ones. So no one qualified to be on the board is likely to be fully independent of Facebook. But I don’t see the board as being essentially an independent check on Facebook. I see it as a group of qualified and interested people.”The board members and the Libra Association didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.“Yes, David is a very small investor in Xapo like dozens of other people from Silicon Valley. Yes, Wences and David are both in payments and fintech in Silicon Valley and because of that they have known each other for a few years now,” a spokesperson for Xapo said. “Neither David being a small investor in Xapo nor David and Wences having known each other for a few years compromises Wences’ independence in Libra’s board.”The Libra Association board was formed after high-profile exits by a number of companies, including Mastercard Inc., Visa Inc. and PayPal. The exodus followed scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators who have expressed concern about Facebook’s poor track record in protecting user privacy.Facebook has described Libra as a community effort. But the original group of about 28 partners has dwindled to 21 organizations that signed on as members on Tuesday. Facebook’s challenge will be to convince more companies that there is value for them in a project that has the social-media giant firmly in the driving seat, whether it intended that to be the case or not.(Corrects number of original partners in final paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Olga Kharif in Portland at okharif@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/libra-association-board-members-ties-000053869.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-15	2019-10-15 04:00:28	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	The Upside to Facebook’s Libra Disaster	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s just as well that big companies that process and facilitate payments have quit Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project, fearing a regulatory backlash. If Facebook really wants to bring financial services to the “unbanked,” it should try doing it on a smaller scale than these companies’ presence promised. And even then, the probability of failure will be high.It’s clear why PayPal Holdings Inc., Stripe Inc., eBay Inc., MasterCard Inc. and Visa Inc. have decided not to join the Libra Association, which Facebook has been organizing to run the proposed digital currency. They took seriously the recent warning of Senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Sherrod Brown of Ohio that because of their membership, they could “expect a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all payment activities.” The concern is that a cryptocurrency used in conjunction with encrypted messaging could potentially be used in illegal transactions, and anyone involved in creating such an opportunity would be suspect.U.S. regulators are perfectly capable of scuppering major cryptocurrency projects. On Oct. 11, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced it had stopped Telegram Group Inc. from distributing digital tokens, so-called Grams, to the investors who contributed $1.7 billion to the creation of the cryptocurrency last year. These include major U.S. venture capital firms such as Benchmark, Sequoia and Lightspeed. The same could easily happen to Libra.That’s the problem with starting so big. Telegram’s token offering was the biggest ever recorded. Facebook made a big announcement on Libra and presented a list of partners that read like a Who’s Who of the payments industry. They envisaged global launches for their cryptocurrencies. Of course regulators and politicians were alarmed.To avoid this kind of outcome, Facebook — whose stated goal with Libra is to offer affordable payment services and loans to people currently priced out of the financial services market — could have tried the strategy that got results for one of its remaining partners, Vodafone Group Plc. Vodafone launched M-Pesa, Kenya’s storied “mobile money,” in 2007, and one of the project’s major assets was the Kenyan central bank’s consent to the launch without any formal regulation. Vodafone’s local cellular operator, Safaricom Plc, quickly built up a network of stores where people without bank accounts could pay in and receive cash, and old-fashioned mobile phones began to double as wallets for transfers and purchases. The lack of regulatory intervention and the large physical network, fed by relatively generous commissions, made sure that by 2019, M-Pesa claimed 37 million active customers in seven African countries. But attempts to transplant the service to many other markets have failed. Vodafone has closed M-Pesa in India (in part because of regulatory obstacles), South Africa (low customer interest), Romania and Albania (apparently it was unprofitable). Vodafone discovered there was no cookie-cutter solution. In different countries, lenders, retailers and mobile operators offered competing services, and regulatory scrutiny varied. To find countries in which to launch such an electronic money service, one would need to go down the list of nations with large populations of the unbanked. The top 20, according to the World Bank, includes big ones, such as China, India, Indonesia and Brazil.But in most of these countries, people are already using some form of digital money in lieu of dealing with traditional financial institutions. That’s why the list of 20 countries with the smallest percentage of people who have recently made or received digital payments looks completely different.In other words, it’s not easy to find a country where a lot of people have neither a bank account nor access to other kinds of financial services. And then there’s a chance that the cash-using population of a specific country wants to stay that way. One possible reason M-Pesa didn’t quite work in Albania and Romania is that these countries have large informal economies. With up to a third of gross domestic product “in the shadow,” traceable electronic transactions are unattractive compared with cash. These difficulties of finding good target markets, and ones with friendly regulators to boot, should explain Facebook’s desire to launch at scale, to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. But the risk with this approach is that the idea of offering cheap financial services to the unbanked begins to look like a smokescreen for building a huge unregulated bank in the developed world — just what regulators in Europe and the U.S. fear the most.Instead of pushing ahead with the remaining partners and risking the same kind of trouble as Telegram, Facebook should go back to the drawing board and start thinking of smaller projects tailor-made to specific countries’ requirements. Expansion would be slow, and there would be failures and miscalculations along the way, but regulators in each market might be easier to persuade that the project’s goals aren’t nefarious. To contact the author of this story: Leonid Bershidsky at lbershidsky@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tobin Harshaw at tharshaw@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Leonid Bershidsky is Bloomberg Opinion's Europe columnist.

2019-10-14	2019-10-14 16:41:51	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Libra Loses a Quarter of Its Members as Booking Holdings Exits	(Bloomberg) -- The Libra Association hasn’t officially launched but has already lost a quarter of its membership, as Booking Holdings Inc., an online travel company that operates websites including Kayak.com and Priceline.com, joined Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and four other companies in leaving the controversial cryptocurrency project spearheaded by Facebook Inc.With the departure of Norwalk, Connecticut-based Booking, the Libra Association now has 21 founding members remaining of the original 28 companies that signed on to the association in June. PayPal Holdings Inc., Stripe Inc., MercadoLibre Inc. and EBay Inc. in the past two weeks have also said they would abandon the project.The remaining members of the Libra Association, a nonprofit that would manage the cryptocurrency, planned to meet Monday in Geneva, Switzerland to finalize its governing charter and initial membership.Libra came under intense scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators as soon as Facebook announced the project. Regulators warned that the cryptocurrency, originally set to launch next year, could be used by criminals if not properly monitored, while lawmakers pilloried Facebook’s track record at hearings in July with Libra co-founder David Marcus.Officials in some countries, including Germany and France, announced that they would ban Libra, saying that the currency could be a threat to monetary policy, among other concerns.Visa, Mastercard and Stripe left the project shortly after receiving a letter from Democratic senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, warning that they could face increased scrutiny if they stayed on board.Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Libra-member Coinbase Inc., on Sunday said the pressure felt “un-American.” “Why the need for the intimidation tactics? This would be called anti-competitive/monopolistic behavior if any private company did it,” Armstrong wrote on Twitter.In the face of the departures, Libra has said more than 1,500 companies have expressed interest in joining the association and that the currency wouldn’t launch until it satisfied regulators’ concerns.Developers have continued to advance the open-source code that would underlie Libra. However, Visa, Mastercard and PayPal could have provided critical experience in navigating U.S. financial regulators’ concerns, making their departures particularly painful. Booking Holdings, which has a market capitalization of more than $84 billion, was among the only remaining large, publicly held companies left in the project.Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg plans to testify next week at the House Financial Services Committee on Libra, among other topics.Representatives for the Libra Association didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&#92;--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.To contact the reporters on this story: Joe Light in Washington at jlight8@bloomberg.net;Olivia Carville in New York at ocarville1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/booking-holdings-latest-pull-libra-150445616.html?.tsrc=rss

This, the letter said, created challenges including financial stability, consumer and investor protection, data privacy, money laundering, terrorist financing, fair competition, cyber security and tax evasion.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3a429c1e-dd88-3944-b1c2-0f640a73bd00/global-regulators-put.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-10-11	2019-10-11 23:25:19	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook's Libra Loses Mastercard, Visa in Cascade of Exits	(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.’s effort to create a cryptocurrency was dealt a blow on Friday after several key partners, including Mastercard Inc., Visa Inc., EBay Inc., Stripe Inc. and Mercado Pago, abandoned the project. The defections followed fierce criticism from global regulators and lawmakers, and have prompted some industry-watchers to question whether the Libra program can survive.The news comes days before the Libra Association, the group that will oversee the digital currency, prepares to convene its members and ask them to sign a charter agreement. The meeting is slated to take place on Monday in Geneva. A Libra Association spokeswoman said on Friday that the gathering will proceed as planned, and that it would announce the first list of official partners once a formal charter is signed.In a statement, the spokeswoman said the group was &quot;focused on moving forward and continuing to build a strong association&quot; as it worked to create &quot;a safe, transparent, and consumer-friendly implementation of a global payment system that breaks down financial barriers for billions of people.&quot;When Facebook launched plans for Libra in June, a critical part of its pitch was that major players in the payments and tech industry were supporting it. The cryptocurrency would be run out of Geneva by the organizations that comprised the Libra Association, not solely by Facebook. But now that that alliance appears to be eroding, the project’s future is uncertain.&quot;I don’t think Facebook can do this by itself,&quot; said Michael Pachter, an analyst for Wedbush Securities told Bloomberg TV. &quot;Short of a big bank stepping in like JPMorgan, I don’t think this could ever happen.&quot;In a tweet on Friday, David Marcus, the Facebook executive spearheading the effort, said that the exit of six partners would not derail the effort. &quot;I would caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you’re on to something when this much pressure builds up.&quot;Whether or not Libra implodes, the exits highlight the extreme challenges that lie ahead for the project, which if successful could have a sweeping impact on the global financial system. &quot;It may very well fail completely,&quot; said Lisa Ellis, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. Even if it survives, progress will take much longer and &quot;it’s likely to fall into some level of obscurity,&quot; she added.Facebook has faced fierce backlash since the company announced plans for Libra. Politicians and regulators around the world have called on Facebook to halt its progress, and some have suggested Libra could be used for illegal money laundering or trafficking schemes.Despite the scrutiny from public officials and the exodus of partners, Facebook remains committed to Libra, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Some people inside the company think the defections are partly driven by established payments providers worrying about a new entrant encroaching on their turf, the person said.In the months since its announcement, Facebook has frequently found itself in the spotlight over the cryptocurrency. Marcus went to Washington in July to testify before Congress about Facebook’s plans. Later this month, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear before the House Financial Services Committee to answer even more questions about Libra.Earlier this week, two U.S. senators cautioned Visa, Mastercard and Stripe to reconsider their involvement in the project. Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Brian Schatz of Hawaii said that Libra poses a risk to not only the financial system, but the payments companies’ broader business. &quot;We urge you to carefully consider how your companies will manage these risks before proceeding,&quot; they said a letter to the companies.Mastercard said in a statement that it will &quot;remain focused on our strategy and our own significant efforts to enable financial inclusion around the world,&quot; adding, &quot;We believe there are potential benefits in such initiatives and will continue to monitor the Libra effort.&quot; Visa said the company would also continue to evaluate whether to join in Libra in the future, and that the company’s &quot;ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association’s ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations.&quot;In a statement on Friday, EBay expressed its support for the project, but said it would focus on rolling out its own payments products. “We highly respect the vision of the Libra Association; however, eBay has made the decision to not move forward as a founding member,” an EBay spokesman wrote in the emailed statement. “At this time, we are focused on rolling out eBay’s managed payments experience for our customers.&quot;Payments giant Stripe, one of the most high-profile startups to sign onto the project, signaled it remained open to working on it in the future. “Stripe is supportive of projects that aim to make online commerce more accessible for people around the world. Libra has this potential,” said a company spokesperson. “We will follow its progress closely and remain open to working with the Libra Association at a later stage.”The Libra Association is composed of about two dozen organizations, including Facebook. A Lyft Inc. spokeswoman confirmed on Friday that the ride-hailing company remains a member. Other companies that have not signaled plans to leave include Uber Technologies Inc., Spotify Technology S.A., Coinbase Inc. and telecom providers Iliad SA and Vodafone Group Plc. PayPal Holdings Inc. dropped out last week.

High-growth stocks that also are high on quality are another matter.Seemingly every other week, a so-called unicorn files for an initial public offering. And yet more often than not, the stocks of these red-hot companies quickly disappoint investors. There's no point in betting on companies with high growth prospects if they don't have the quality to churn out such returns year after year.When it comes to looking for high-quality companies, a good place to start is with return on equity. ROE measures how adept a company is at squeezing a return out of its net assets. It's often used as a shorthand for quality. Although ROE differs from industry to industry, a rule of thumb is that ROE should come to at least 15%.Quality stocks can't be found by applying just a single measure, however. Balance sheets, fundamental performance and cash flow are critical too. As such, we scoured the Russell 1000 Growth Index of large- and midsize companies to find stocks with returns on equity of at least 15%. Additionally, these companies had to have positive free cash flow (FCF), healthy balance sheets and long-term growth rates of at least 20%.Lastly, they had to have an average analyst score of less than 2.0 from S&P; Global Market Intelligence. Any score below 2.0 equals a Buy recommendation on the part of Wall Street, and the lower the score, the better.Here, then, are the 10 best-rated high-quality, high-growth stocks to buy.

But that is no longer true. In fact, this year SQ stock is only up 10% while Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NASDAQ:MA) are up more than three times as much.Source: Shutterstock This year SQ stock hit heavy resistance at $83 per share and has failed at every potential breakout there. Although SQ is also lagging the S&P 500 by 40%, the opportunity from here is that there is more upside potential than downside risk.Finding bottoms in stocks is tricky. But identifying support zones that could act as a baseline for rallies is a lot easier. Square stock has fallen into such zones. Being around $50 per share has been pivotal to SQ for the last five years. So the bulls in it are on solid footing, which usually makes the case for more upside. There are no weak hands left to hold the stock after a long time of selling pressure.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Super Boring Stocks to Buy With Super Safe Returns Fundamentally, and even after this big correction, SQ stock is still not cheap. It still loses money and it sells at eight times sales. From that perspective it could have a lot more froth to shed. The bullish thesis for SQ has to include the assumption of strong growth. Otherwise it won't deserve its valuation premium and it would have to reprice lower. SQ Stock Has a Good Base for a BounceTechnically the short-term SQ charts show clear lines to trade. Short term, SQ has an opportunity just above $63 per share. This could invite momentum buyers to target $68. But from there, SQ might get a few more optimistic buyers to try and fill the giant gap from the last earnings report. It won't be easy, but if the overall markets rally for any reason then SQ will likely have a realistic chance to do it. But as with any good trade, there needs to be proper stops. In this case, SQ needs to sustain the high-low trend to retain the upside momentum.As with many investments, the whole globe is migrating all financial transaction to digital. The fin-tech sector stocks will have strong demand on their products and services for years to come. SQ, V, and MA will be amidst the winners. Their management teams have so far executed well on plans so I expect them to continue.The bitcoin craze is evidence that the world is ready for electronic financial transactions. Almost everyone I know uses one form of fintech or another. There is definitely room for all major entrants to prosper in it. SQ stock will be higher in the future if the stock markets in general don't crash.This brings up the important points of geopolitical risks that currently plague the headlines. The world seems like it's a mess. But the company P&L's don't indicate an imminent collapse. Politicians will eventually figure things out, but in the meantime they will put investors through a whirlwind of headlines. That's their job so they can justify their existence to their constituents.

2019-10-09	2019-10-09 18:58:03	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Senators Caution Mastercard, Visa, Stripe on Libra Membership	(Bloomberg) -- Two Senate Democrats are urging three payment processing companies to reconsider their involvement with the Libra cryptocurrency project envisioned by Facebook Inc. and a coalition of other groups.Libra poses risks not only to global financial systems, but also to the companies’ broader payments business, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said in letter on Tuesday to Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and Stripe Inc.In the letter, the lawmakers cited news reports on the difficulty some of Libra Association members have faced in obtaining details on the organization’s management and risks.The association is composed of a group of 27 members including Facebook and the payments companies, as well as a swath of tech companies like Uber Technologies Inc., telecom providers Iliad SA and Vodafone Group Plc, and cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase, Inc.PayPal, Inc., one of the original members, confirmed it had left the organization on Oct. 4.In a statement, Brown, the senior Democrat on the Banking Committee, and Schatz, a panel member, said they pointed out in the letter that “Congress, financial regulators, and potential Libra Association member companies have struggled to get sufficient details from Facebook about risks that Libra may pose, including facilitating criminal and terrorist financing, destabilizing the global financial system, interfering with monetary policy, or exposing consumers to risks currently limited to accredited investors.”“We urge you to carefully consider how your companies will manage these risks before proceeding, given that Facebook has not yet demonstrated to Congress, financial regulators — and perhaps not even to your companies — that it is taking these risks seriously,” they said in the letter.“Facebook,” the senators added, “is currently struggling to tackle massive issues, such as privacy violations, disinformation, election interference, discrimination, and fraud, and it has not demonstrated an ability to bring those failures under control.”“You should be concerned,” Brown and Schatz said, “that any weaknesses in Facebook’s risk management systems will become weaknesses in your systems that you may not be able to effectively mitigate.”Spokesmen for Mastercard, Visa and Stripe declined to comment. Facebook referred a request for comment to the Libra Association.“The Libra Association maintains its commitment to not launch until questions and concerns by regulators are addressed,” Libra Association spokesman Dante Disparte said in a statement. “This is enshrined in our long launch runway, which has helped inform regulators, policy makers and other stakeholders around the world about our commitment to responsible financial innovation and strong oversight.”Disparte said more than 1,500 organizations have reached out to the association about joining.In July, both Republican and Democratic senators had pointed questions for Facebook at a Banking Committee hearing over its digital currency plans. That session reflected the skepticism across Washington and underscoring the challenges the company faces in getting Libra off the ground.(Adds comment from Libra Association in third from last paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Kurt Wagner, Julie Verhage and Jenny Surane.To contact the reporters on this story: Lydia Beyoud in Washington at lbeyoud2@bloomberg.net;Joe Light in Washington at jlight8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Seth Stern at sstern22@bloomberg.net, Sara FordenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senators-caution-mastercard-visa-stripe-021640985.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-08	2019-10-08 17:43:02	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	PayPal’s Exit From Libra May Trigger Fresh Hearings, Cowen Says	(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc.’s decision to pull out of the Libra Association may lead to more congressional hearings from critics seeking to press the payments company for more details on why it walked away, according to Cowen.A push for hearings may intensify further if Libra -- Facebook Inc.’s effort to develop a digital currency -- were to lose other members, analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote. Not only has Facebook failed to win Washington’s “buy in,” it’s also lost support and the “messaging war,” he said. And Seiberg warned that other backers may join PayPal in retreating rather than “risk getting pulled into the policy fights over privacy and private currencies.”PayPal pared losses of as much as 2% as Facebook declined as much as much as 1.1%. Meanwhile other Libra backers -- Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. -- both fell more than 1.7% before paring some of the drop. Financials declined across the board, along with the broader market, as analysts fretted about banks’ prospects and trade tensions flared.On Monday, Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette described PayPal’s decision as wise. “While we believe it made sense for PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard to initially participate in Libra to defend their flanks and maintain optionality, the amount of political attention Libra has received has made the opportunity less attractive,” Faucette wrote.Cowen’s Seiberg has consistently doubted Facebook’s ability to secure the necessary regulatory approvals as the social media company is “framing Libra as an independent entity that will control the transaction data of users.” Big partners exiting may mean it will be “harder to convince policymakers that Libra is independent of Facebook.” He expects Facebook will stay in the spotlight and will face mounting scrutiny as the 2020 election approaches.Separately, Height Capital Markets in a note said that “one withdrawal does not doom Libra, but if there is a cascade of departures the Libra project may collapse before it can launch.” The firm also saw regulators’ focus on financial stability as “overstated,” as Libra won’t be issuing any country’s currency or debt, but will convert a given currency into Libra currency, and Libra will be “backed by a basket of short term debt instruments issued by sovereign nations.”Earlier, Loop Capital analyst Alan Gould wrote that Libra “will likely take much longer than initially anticipated” and more government regulation and fines could be on the way.&#92;--With assistance from Cristin Flanagan.To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Will DaleyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-exit-libra-may-trigger-174302582.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-02	2019-10-02 14:14:20	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook Libra Payments Partners Waver on Cryptocurrency	(Bloomberg) -- Four payments companies that have joined Facebook Inc. as founding members of the Libra Association are wavering over whether to officially sign on to the cryptocurrency project, according to people familiar with the matter.Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., PayPal Holdings Inc. and Stripe Inc. are undecided about formally signing onto Libra’s organizing charter because they’re concerned about maintaining positive relationships with regulators who have reservations about the project, the people said.Executives at the payments companies believe Facebook oversold the extent to which regulators were comfortable with the project and are concerned about the perception the social network hasn’t behaved responsibly in other areas -- such as how it has handled user data and privacy, the people said.The Libra Association is asking the 28 founding members to reaffirm their commitment to the cryptocurrency project later this month, according to three people familiar with the matter. Before Libra was unveiled, the companies signed nonbinding letters of intent to explore joining the association.David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the Libra effort, tweeted Wednesday that the “[first] wave of Libra Association members will be formalized in the weeks to come.” Marcus said he was unaware of any current Libra partners who might abstain from officially joining the organization, but building a new global currency is “hard and requires courage.”“I can tell you that we’re very calmly, and confidently working through the legitimate concerns that Libra has raised by bringing conversations about the value of digital currencies to the forefront,“ he added.Companies that officially join the charter won’t be obligated to immediately contribute an initial $10 million required to invest in the project, according to two of the people. The option to delay the payment reflects the association’s strategy to move the Libra project forward in baby steps, the people said. That would give members more time to work out how their participation might affect the rest of their companies’ operations and regulatory obligations, they said.The signing of the charter could take place as soon as Oct. 14, three people said, and will likely happen in Switzerland, where the nonprofit organization charged with managing the Libra digital currency reserve and global payments network would be headquartered.“Nothing has changed with our involvement with Libra since we came on to participate,” said a Stripe spokesman. “We agreed to work on the charter with these other participants. We continue to work on the charter. We’re still actively involved.” He declined to comment specifically on whether Stripe has hesitations about signing the charter.Spokesmen for Facebook, Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and the Libra Association declined to comment.The move to get Libra members to formally sign on is the latest indication that Facebook and its partners are pushing forward with the controversial plan, even after it came under fire from policy makers around the world.Facebook has said repeatedly that the Libra Association will be responsible for making decisions about the currency, so its formal creation could mean that regulators start to get better answers than Facebook has offered so far.Some European finance ministers have threatened to ban Libra in their respective countries and the European Union’s antitrust chief says she’s taken the unusual step of scrutinizing Libra because of the risk it could lead to the creation of a new, entirely separate economy.Meanwhile, development of the technology to underpin Libra is moving faster than internal deadlines, Diogo Monica, co-founder of Anchorage, a technology company that safeguards cryptocurrencies, said in a phone interview. Five association members including Anchorage and Facebook’s digital wallet subsidiary Calibra are already running a test network of nodes, and sending transactions -- not done with real money for now -- to each other, he said.Libra has started addressing regulators’ concerns by making tweaks to its technology and policies, such as its anti-money-laundering policies, Monica added. Hundreds of organizations are on a waiting list hoping to join the association, Monica said, but no additional members have been admitted yet, he said.Opponents of the plan say Libra, which would be backed by a pool of traditional currencies, could undercut countries’ monetary policies or be used for nefarious purposes. U.S. lawmakers this summer grilled Marcus, questioning whether Facebook could be trusted to expand into financial services. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg last month told senators that the currency wouldn’t launch anywhere in the world without U.S. regulators’ blessing.Facebook announced the project in June to make international payments as simple as texting. It draws on big names in the payments, technology, telecom and blockchain industries, including EBay Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., blockchain startups Coinbase Inc. and Xapo Inc., and Vodafone Group Plc, as well as venture capital companies and non-profit organizations.Why Everybody (Almost) Hates Facebook’s Digital Coin: QuickTakeEven as Facebook has publicly drawn fire, the Libra organization’s members have worked in the background to hash out details of a chartering document to formally establish the non-profit so that the group’s work to stand up the payments system can move forward.The work has proven contentious due to continued uncertainty about the regulatory implications of the project, according to two of the people.“Since June the Association has met with numerous regulators and policy makers,” said Dante Disparte, a spokesman for the Libra Association, in an email. “Additionally the group of founding members have held regular meetings to discuss appropriate regulatory requirements for operating a payment system, as well as conforming to anti-money laundering, combating the financing of terrorism, privacy and other standards.”(Updates with comment from the Libra Association in the last paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Olga Kharif and Kurt Wagner.To contact the reporters on this story: Lydia Beyoud in Arlington at lbeyoud2@bloomberg.net;Joe Light in Washington at jlight8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Mark Niquette, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-libra-payments-partners-waver-215256577.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-23	2019-09-23 13:45:30	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	3 Payment Stocks Riding on Rising Consumer Spending	The consumer spending report, released at the end of August by the Commerce Department, showed solid numbers, with a gain of 0.6% in July on top of the confirmed 0.3% gain in June. The growth was reassuring, as consumer spending makes up two-thirds of US economic activity, and consumption has been the driver of overall economic growth. As long as people are going out and making purchases, the economic picture will remain positive.Solid consumer spending, and its economic impact, benefits some sectors more than others. Payment processors, the middlemen between consumers and merchants, stand to make particularly strong gains in an environment of steady spending growth. And they are. We dove into the TipRanks database and found several payment processor stocks that have shown consistent long-term gains in line with increasing consumer spending. Mastercard, Inc.The world’s second-largest credit card processor, by market cap, Mastercard (MA – Get Report) is having a good year. The stock is up 276% over the past five years, 43% year-to-date, and the company regularly beats the forecasts on its reported quarterly earnings. In the short term, the three-month share price gain of 2.6% is more modest but still shows growth.The company’s growth is riding on fee income, generated by consumer purchases. Mastercard does not actually issue the credit cards that bear its logo; rather, it collects royalties and fees on the card issuance and use. The company collects on the other end, too, charging merchants for processing payments. It’s a robust business model, and Mastercard’s revenues have gained an average of 17% per quarter over the last two years.Wall Street’s analysts are bullish on MA. 4-star analyst Lisa Elis, of MoffettNathanson, is impressed by the company’s plans to tap into the B2B and bill payment markets, which she estimates as $125 billion and $4 trillion annually. She says, “New Payment flows are, in our view, the single largest source of potential upside to Mastercard’s earnings outlook and stock performance over the long term (3-5+-years)—upside that is not captured in current consensus.” Her price target on MA, $320, suggests 18% for that upside.JPMorgan’s Tien Tsin Huang gives MA a $322 target, writing, “We like the durability and momentum in the business and continue to recommend MA as a core holding. We remain confident MA can achieve reiterated high-teens EPS guidance through the FY19-21 cycle.” His target also implies an upside of 18%.Mastercard has a unanimous analyst consensus, with 19 buy ratings assigned in the last three months. Shares in MA sell for $271, and the $317 average price target suggests an upside of 16%. Fidelity National Information ServicesSome companies process payments directly; Fidelity National (FIS – Get Report) inhabits a slightly different niche, providing software, services, and tech outsourcing for 20,000 clients in the global retail and banking sectors.Like Mastercard, Fidelity National has benefited from the strength of its customer base and business model. The company consistently meets or beats its quarterly earnings expectations, and the stock has gained 151% over the past five years. It is up 28% year-to-date, and the three-month gain of 7.3% shows that its momentum is continuing. From an investor’s perspective, the steady gains are supplemented by a 1.06% dividend yield, paying out $1.40 per share annually.This past spring, FIS acquired Worldpay, a leader in digital payment processing and a major provider of the software technology that makes credit card transactions possible. FIS CEO Gary Norcross said of the acquisition, “Scale matters in our rapidly changing industry. As a combined organization, we will bring the most modern solutions targeted at the highest growth markets.”More recently, FIS has been attracting plenty of positive attention from Wall Street analysts. On September 5, KeyBanc’s Josh Beck upgraded his stance on the stock from neutral to buy, writing, “eCom and B2B initiatives could upscale growth and drive a positive re-rating. We see the company as strategically positioned for sustainable merchant share gains, B2B monetization, and accretive capital allocation…” Beck’s $175 price target suggests an upside of 32% for this stock.Kunaal Malde, of Atlantic Equities, also gives FIS a $175 price target. He notes that the company is a preferred name among US payments, and that the stock is “positive on accelerating growth profile.”FIS holds a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 17 ratings that include 15 buys and 2 holds. The average price target of $153 implies an upside of 16% from the current share price of $131. Fiserv, Inc.Fiserv (FISV – Get Report) has been a player in global financial services since 1984. The company provides technology solutions for banks, credit unions, securities brokers, and retailers, and reports $5.9 billion in annual revenues.Since the end of August, FISV has received two upgrades from top analysts. On August 25, Ashwin Shirvaikar, from Citigroup, noted the company’s recent acquisition of First Data and said, “The stock of the combined company offers a good idea in a volatile market.” He moved his rating from neutral to buy, and also raised his price target by 56%, to $124. His new price target suggests a 19% upside to the stock.Shares in FISV have risen along with the company’s income and profile. The last five years saw a 225% appreciation, and the year-to-date gain is an impressive 41%. FISV is up 14% in the last three months, a clear sign of continuing success.Josh Beck, quoted above on FIS, is also bullish on FISV. He upgraded his stance to buy earlier this month, writing, “…a unique combination of technology assets could stitch together new commerce experiences. Further, the company is equipped to effectively bundle, reduce costs, and innovate with improving capital flexibility.” Beck $120 price target indicates confidence in a 15% upside.FISV’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 13 buys and 2 holds given in the last three months. The stock has an average price target of $116, which implies an 11% upside from the share price of $103.Visit TipRanks’ Analysts’ Top Stocks page, and find out what other stocks the Street’s top analysts are looking at.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-payment-stocks-riding-rising-134530883.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-18	2019-09-18 13:07:09	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Goldman Sachs: 4 Conviction Buy Stocks To Snap Up Now	Goldman Sachs has a special rating for stocks which it holds in particularly high regard. This is called a ‘Conviction Buy’ rating. The firm’s prized list of Conviction Buy stocks reveals the stock picks that the investment bank's research team expects to outperform. That’s particularly useful for investors looking for fresh investing inspiration in the face of current market volatility. Here we take a closer look at four stocks that have made it to the firm’s list of top stock ideas. Does the rest of the Street have an equally bullish outlook on these names? Interestingly, all of the stocks covered have received only buy ratings from the Street in the last three months. So no hold or sell ratings here. Let’s take a closer look at what’s keeping analysts on-side now…  Comcast Corporation Shares in this cable giant are up 37% year-to-date, and analysts believe further growth lies ahead. Ten analysts have published recent buy ratings on Comcast (CMCSA – Get Report), with Goldman Sachs’ Brett Feldman going so far as to double-upgrade CMCSA all the way from Hold to Conviction Buy. Thanks to &quot;healthy fundamentals across its key businesses”, Feldman foresees &quot;strong growth&quot; over the next three years with annual earnings growth of 11%, free cash flow per share of 12% and dividends of 15%. At the same time, five-star Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan has just upgraded Comcast from Hold to Buy. Like Feldman, he has a $54 price target, which translates into upside potential of 16%. So what’s the reason behind his bullish transition on the stock? The analyst referred to a triple whammy of broadband strength, underestimated ad revenue, and secular cable improvements. “Fundamentals are healthy in the near-term, and we think 2020 is setting up to be a strong year.” Horan stated. “Cable margins should continue to expand as revenue mix shifts to higher margin broadband (estimated 70% adj. EBITDA margins) vs. video (estimated 20% margins).” Voya Financial IncBased in New York, Voya Financial (VOYA – Get Report) is a retirement, investment and insurance company serving over 13 million customers. On September 12, Goldman Sachs’ Alex Scott upgraded VOYA from Buy to Conviction Buy, citing three key reasons: 1) the possibility of a takeover; 2) potential upside to capital return from life redundant reserve refinancing; and 3) exposure to low interest rates more fully reflected in the valuation. Indeed, the analyst’s Street-high price target of $85 indicates substantial upside potential from current levels of 56%. Note that shares have already surged 35% year-to-date. Meanwhile Morgan Stanley’s Nigel Dally has just met up with Voya management. He left the meetings reassured of his bullish outlook on the company, reiterating his buy rating and $63 price target. The analyst stated &quot;We continue to highlight Voya as one of the most compelling investment opportunities in the life and annuity industry following time on the road through Europe with management. Despite the somewhat disappointing second quarter earnings and lower earnings run-rate, we feel the future prospects for attractive growth and ROE expansion are stronger than what is reflected in the current stock price.&quot; Mastercard IncAll eighteen analysts covering Mastercard (MA – Get Report) rate the stock a buy right now. But Goldman Sachs has gone one step further. The firm’s James Schneider has now kept a Conviction Buy rating on Mastercard for over a year. He upgraded the stock to best idea status on September 17 2018, writing at the time that Mastercard is catalyzing the next growth horizon in business-to-business (B2B) payments. &quot;We believe the B2B market represents the next growth horizon for the payments industry and think Mastercard is the best positioned given its multifaceted product approach,&quot; Schneider said in a research note. In fact, Goldman Sachs has calculated that B2B payments will represent a whopping $950 billion annualized opportunity for payment stocks. More recently, Schneider reiterated his MA buy rating after management reaffirmed its 2019 guidance. Following the recent earnings call, the analyst told investors that he is optimistic the stock will continue to soar. Shares are already up 46% year-to-date- while the average analyst price target indicates a further 15% upside lies ahead.  Bio-Rad Laboratories According to the Street, Bio-Rad (BIO – Get Report) offers attractive exposure to Life Science Tools at a reasonable valuation. With annual sales of $2.2 billion, BIO is among the top five life science companies in the world. And now Goldman Sachs analyst Patrick Donnelly has upgraded Bio-Rad to the Conviction Buy list, citing improving execution and undervalued fundamentals. Looking forward, Donnelly is confident BIO can outperform second half guidance due to strong organic growth, easing comps, margin expansion initiatives, limited maco headwinds and capital deployment. He maintained a $400 price target- indicating 20% upside potential from current levels.In the last three months, only one other analyst has published a rating on BIO stock. That analyst is Barclays’ Jack Meehan. His buy rating comes with a $380 price target- up from $350 previously. “We continue to believe that Bio-Rad has substantial long-term opportunity ahead, and believe there is good visibility into high-teens EPS growth” comments Meehan. He made the call after Bio-Rad delivered solid 2Q19 results, with a notable EPS beat and strong operational discipline. Year-to-date, the stock has rallied 45%.

2019-09-17	2019-09-17 17:17:56	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa’s Investment Shows Plaid Could Replace Libra in Fintech Space	Visa (NYSE:V), seeking entrance into the center of 21st century banking, has joined MasterCard (NYSE:MA) in taking a stake in fintech startup Plaid. Plaid writes application program interfaces that act as the infrastructure beneath bank accounts. This lets it power customer-facing fintech specialists like PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo, Robinhood, Chime and Betterment.Source: Shutterstock Enabling new banking services could make Plaid a sort of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the fintech age -- an operating system for computerized banking.Plaid has attracted $310 million in financing. Its most recent funding round valued it at $2.7 billion. Other backers include Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and American Express (NYSE:AXP).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut it's Visa and MasterCard, which have a joint value of almost $700 billion, that are the real get. They have global scale, brand names and good reputations for security and reliability. Battling AlibabaPlaid is ranked as the eighth largest fintech startup. The list is led by credit card issuer Stripe and includes SoFi, a lender whose name will grace the new Los Angeles football stadium. Fintech companies raised a total of nearly $40 billion last year.Fintech startups are trying to get around the high costs of working with the present banking system. Visa and Mastercard are part of that. But Visa and Mastercard are also trying to get around those costs, seeing the growth of chat-based Chinese payment systems from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent Holding (OTCMKTS:TCEHY).  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip There was an assumption that Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Libra -- a cheaper payment system riding on FB's data network -- might be the first to escape the high costs. Both Visa and MasterCard were part of Libra's 28-member founding group announced in June. But there are increasing doubts that financial regulators will allow Libra to launch, as many fear Facebook's size. These regulators seem to have no such fears regarding the payment processors. The Fintech StackThe investment in Plaid, which already serves cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase, brings Visa and MasterCard closer to the new financial world's operating system.Fintech is building a new financial payments stack. Right now, most of the value in the stack is in the loans it creates or the investments it enables. But as the software stack evolves, history shows that it's the company at the bottom of that stack that gains the most power, as Microsoft did starting in the early 1990s.Plaid CEO Zach Perret said his goal is to create a digitized financial system. Visa executive Bill Sheedy said his strategic goal is more important than the financial investment.That strategic goal increasingly looks like a bank. Verifying users and account balances is key to enabling loans, payments and investment -- essentially all the functions of banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Visa stock's market cap exceeded that of JPMorgan just in the last year. Many Plaid customers compete directly with banks like JPMorgan. The Bottom Line for Visa Stock and PlaidWhile Visa's payment network has proven to have enormous financial power, it still faces challenges. It can charge merchants up to 3% of a transaction's cost to process through its network. The money is soaked up by processors and banks that are part of the Visa stock network.These payment networks won't work in developing nations. The cost is too high for small merchants to bear. Instead of staying with cash, many are moving to cheaper fintech alternatives that can run through customers' mobile phones.Whether these merchants will stay with Chinese and Indian payment systems, or seek Western alternatives to access Western wallets, remains an open question. The Plaid investment shows just how desperate Visa and Mastercard are to answer that question in the affirmative.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

Despite having a 28-company consortium behind it and Facebook's efforts to reassure governments that its mobile money complies with regulations, resistance to FB's involvement seems to be hardening.Source: justplay1412 / Shutterstock.com Facebook has created a $533 billion market cap in 15 years, compared to the $378 billion JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) created in 150 years. FB built its market cap on a network of cloud data centers and free consumer services.A joint statement from French and German regulators seems unequivocal. &quot;We believe that no private entity can claim monetary power, which is inherent to the sovereignty of Nations,&quot; representatives from the two nations wrote. European governments say they want a stable cryptocurrency, but only a cryptocurrency that they control.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Is Facebook's Libra a Threat to Banking?The Libra Association consists of 28 founding members, including Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Those three companies alone have a market cap of over $800 billion. Visa, like Facebook, is worth more than JPMorgan Chase. Payments, traditionally the job of banks, already circulate through dedicated payment networks.In theory, Libra is just a cheaper way of processing transactions. Libra coins would be tied to existing currencies and processed like credit card transactions. But transaction details wouldn't enter the world of &quot;real money,&quot; so merchant fees would be eliminated.  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip The problem is that Calibra, a unit of Facebook, would handle the wallets. This seems to be behind government rejection of Libra. Regulators fear that the popularity of Facebook services, which already reach nearly two billion people, would allow it to create its own banking system. U.S. regulators also fear that Libra could be used by terrorists or as a money laundering instrument.Banks, strictly regulated by governments, are not part of the Libra group or process. JPMorgan Chase has its own coin, dubbed JPM Coin, and customer trials are underway. Big traders are getting the benefits of stable coins. Small merchants and consumers are not.Government resistance is spooking some Libra backers, who are thinking of walking away. Facebook, meanwhile, is tired of being the only company sticking its neck out. The Payment World TurnsMeanwhile, the payment world continues to turn.Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent Holding (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) already have cost-effective, chat-based payment systems. India's Unified Payments Interface is increasingly popular. Indian mobile wallets, some backed by Alibaba, are accepted by African merchants. European banks are working with these African payment networks rather than rejecting them.Other cryptocurrencies are jumping into the payments space, claiming to be Libra's competitors. None are likely to gain traction, because they lack market penetration. But they could serve as guinea pigs for banks that want to operate cryptocurrency. One, or several, might then be acquired by banks or other payment processors and slowly scaled to compete. The Bottom Line on FB Stock and LibraTransaction processing systems have a First World problem. Their costs are only acceptable in the First World.Many nations can't afford the fees that Visa and Mastercard charge through local banks. Facebook promised such a mechanism to avoid high fees. Facebook has a global, scaled, cloud-based data network on which low-cost transaction processing services could ride. This would in theory allow Visa and MasterCard to compete with the Chinese and Indian payment groups.But Facebook's leadership of Libra frightens governments. Nations see Facebook as a threat to government sovereignty in a way that Visa and Mastercard are not.Before Libra can get going, Facebook may have to take a back seat in its own invention.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-09-17	2019-09-17 11:45:11	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Is SQ Stock Ready to Bounce Back?	Square (NYSE:SQ), the San Francisco based payment processor, had been on a roll. Since its initial IPO in November 2015 with the SQ stock price at $58, investors who got in early rode the price up to over $101 in September 2018. Since then, however, it has been an all-downhill roller coaster.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Square stock recently closed back down to the IPO price of $58, and may yet again test its all-time low of $49. The underlying technology for Square stock by all accounts is undoubtedly sound. The market may be cool on SQ stock, but customers like the service.Square has steady increased top-line revenues every year. In fact, from the pre-IPO days of the creation of Square by Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) founder Jack Dorsey back in 2011, revenues have increased more than 15-fold. However, Square stock has yet to generate positive net income.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now As the hard-pressed investors of Uber (NASDAQ:UBER) stock know all too well, dazzling technology and great top-line revenue growth are all swell. But if there is no positive net income in sight and losses keep growing by staggering amounts, there is no reason to hold the stock.Despite robust sales growth, just within days after reporting disappointing second-quarter earnings announced on Aug. 1st, Square stock dropped around 40%. Similarly, the shares of Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) - comparative payment processors - have also been struggling in the market.When it comes to the tech sector nowadays, investors are getting tired of talk and want to see some beef on the bones in terms of bottom line earnings. Or they vote with their feet.With the massive sell-off in SQ stock, will the bears finally back off?Here are two reasons why Square is now becoming a great value play in the FinTech sector. Free Stock Trades Will Drive New Revenues, Enhance SQ ValuationAccording to a recent report in Bloomberg, Square is in the initial stages of testing a new feature allowing users of its Cash App service to buy and sell listed U.S. equities for free. A free stock trading functionality would put Square into direct competition with Robinhood, an online broker launched as a smartphone app in 2014.  Backed by the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, Robinhood is valued at approximately $7.6 billion.Many skeptics will wonder what the point is about spending heavily to launch and maintain a free service. As many analysts of the online brokerage wars know all too well, free stock trades are akin to a bar offering free salty peanuts to customers. After eating the free peanuts, those customers soon pony up the cash to buy expensive drinks. The trading of stocks may be free, but everything else comes at a price.Robinhood, for example, will charge a premium for offering investors telephone advice, foreign stock transactions, interest on uninvested cash holdings, as well as interest on margin loans. Robinhood will also sell to a captive market other high margin financial products such as credit cards, insurance and auto loans. Similarly, for Square, offering users free stock trades will attract more users and drive more volume and thus revenues to their payment processing services.Offering free stock trades will not be the first free service for Square. In their recent earnings statement, Square noted that they offer their existing Cash App clients peer-to-peer cash transfer service for free as a marketing tool to drive new business. SQ Is Best in Class Infrastructure - And Getting BetterMobile payments processing is still a nascent industry just at the beginning of growth. According to the consulting firm McKinsey, the global payments industry is a $1.9-trillion business. Much like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Twitter in the early years, Square admittedly is less concerned with profitability and far more concerned with building their engineering platform to compete and win in the market against the giants of the financial services industry.According to the most recent earnings release for the second quarter of 2019, product development expenses for Square stock were $174 million in the second quarter of 2019, up 52% year-over-year. This increase was driven primarily by costs related to engineering, data science, and technical design.In short, Square is spending heavily on technology to out-build and beat the competition for the future of the industry. Bottom Line on SQ StockThere is certainly no shortage of deep-pocketed competitors in the payment processing business. In fact, recent months have seen Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) announce major new investments in their payment solutions offering.Yet, Square stock has been showing a decent support level at the $50 to $52 range. Square stock represents a proven and solid value play in what is usually a risky and overvalued FinTech sector.At the time of writing, Theodore Kim, CFA,  holds no position in any of the stocks mentioned above.

2019-09-12	2019-09-12 15:13:39	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	3 Fallen Angel Stocks to Buy Before They Fly Again	For the last few days the stock markets have been healthy. Sentiment has taken a turn to positive and it's like nothing bad is ever going to happen again. Just yesterday the indices rallied through incredible levels especially in small cap stocks. So there's no doubt that there are stocks to buy here.Today we discuss three high-profile stocks to buy: Visa (NYSE:V), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These are fallen angels stocks because they have recently corrected off of their highs just when they looked like their rallies would never end.  * 10 Battered Tech Stocks to Buy Now The time frames differ among them, but the concept remains the same. They were headed to the moon, then they tripped. So now the opportunity is to pick the right level to buy these stocks. All three management teams are impeccable and they rarely falter on their own. So the bullish thesis for all three AMZN, MSFT and V assumes that markets in general are not going to crash any time soon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Microsoft (MSFT)It's hard to call MSFT stock a fallen angel stock because it's still up 34% year-to-date  and it's only 5% off of the highs. Nevertheless, it has had a tough time in the last trading week, and what makes it interesting is that it did this while the equity markets were rallying hard.Normally, this raises an alarm and causes me to look into weaknesses which would bring sustained selling. But that's not the case here. This is a proven company who is merely having a normal price action give-and-take inside a very healthy ascending trend.Fundamentally MSFT is not cheap since it sells at 29 trailing price-to-earnings ratio and 8 times sales. But this is a company that deserves the benefit of the doubt so it is possible that they deliver strong growth to justify the higher valuations.This is all to say that Microsoft stock is not cheap but it still is a good one to own for the long term. So these dips are normal and should not cause a panic out of the stock.Technically, the zone around $130 per share is pivotal for MSFT stock. This was resistance in April, then a break out in June, and then a successful test for support in early August when markets fell in fear of the 10% additional tariffs tweet. So clearly the bulls earned the right to use it that support.Knowing this, makes it possible for the buy-programs to prevail over the bears in the battle over MSFT for as long as the equity markets are healthy. If I own shares, I don't panic out of them on these dips. Moreover, if I want to own some for the future then this is as good a time as any to start a position there.Alternatively I can use options to sell puts or spreads below said support to generate income without needing rallies. For this, it is important to note that if stocks correct this year from geopolitical risk, then Microsoft stock is vulnerable to a 12% correction. Visa (V)V stock is in a similar situation to that of Microsoft. It's a proven winner that was seemingly rallying to the moon without interruption. But then in the last few days, it fell 6% while the general markets are up big.Here too, the drop is not a reflection on Visa itself but rather part of normal price action. For the longest time credit card stocks with a presence in the fintech space like Visa and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) have been darlings because the investment dollars allotted to bet on financials shied away from buying money-center banks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Instead they piled into fintech.However the recent rally in yields caused a frenzied wave of buying the traditional banks and money has to come from the same bucket. So there is a rotation out of winners like V stock into laggards. The opportunity here is that rotations are usually temporary. Meaning the dip in Visa stock should be a buying opportunity.Just like Microsoft, Visa is not cheap. It sells at 35 trailing P/E and 18 times its sales. But this alone is not cause for alarm because that's how it's always been. So unless the bears have developed sudden incredible fortitude, I bet that the selling will abate soon.Technically, Visa stock should have support around $172 per share. Moreover there is bigger support from pivotal zones at $165 per share. So if I owned shares I don't panic yet. If seeking a long entry with room to spare, I like to sell puts into support zones on bad days to generate income as long as I can gauge the risk.  * 10 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Despite the Headlines Visa stock is 7% off its highs, so if I sell a put in V stock at $160 per share I would own it after a 15% correction. This is a risk I can tolerate and I bet would be a fruitful one. I should know that there is short-term risk looming. if Visa falls below $183.75, it could invite sellers to $168 per share. Amazon (AMZN)I cannot write about potential upside of fallen angels stocks without including the biggest momentum story of all time. AMZN stock is one that has been in the news for decades. It draws critics and fans in droves and is subject to many a heated debate.After the May correction, Amazon stock made a nice recovery but it gave almost all of it back. And it now sits 10% lower than the July highs. The size of the moves in Amazon stock should never surprise investors. This is the mother of all momentum stocks and when it moves, it does it fast and long. So it is best to wait for confirmation of breakouts in either direction before trading it.Short term, Amazon stock rallies if above $1,853 per share,  and could even recover what they lost since July. There will be resistance points along the way so it won't be easy. Conversely, if it falls below recent support near $1,740 then they could extend the correction down to $1,600 per share.In essence, the battle is between completing an ABC technical move lower or establishing a base for a rebound rally to breakout from the necklines above. Meanwhile, the AMZN stock is ping-ponging inside a tight range and I should chase the break out of either sides. I personally favor the upside potential for as long as the markets in general are healthy.For those thinking of turning this into an investment, Amazon is a safe bet in the long run in spite of its high valuation. It sells at 75 trailing P/E but only 3.4 x sales. So as long as they are delivering growth, a high P/E is a prerequisite. You have to spend a lot in order to grow a lot.We still have the same geopolitical risks we had when we first started this correction. So we are one headline away from rekindled panics. This is all to say that traders shouldn't take giant positions all at once with great conviction because we have are still hostage to headlines. The best homework can be obliterated short-term by silly headlines. So I don't risk what I cannot afford to lose.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-09-11	2019-09-11 11:45:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard partners with R3 to develop blockchain enabled cross-border payments offering	Mastercard Inc.  said Wednesday it was partnering with blockchain software provider R3 to develop a new blockchain-enabled cross-border payments solution. The move comes after Mastercard acquired Transfast earlier this year to strengthen its business-to-business and cross-border network system. Mastercard and R3 said their payments solution will initially focus on connecting global faster payments infrastructures, schemes and banks supported by a clearing and settlement network operated by Mastercard. &quot;Developing a new and better cross-border B2B payments solution by improving worldwide connectivity in the account-to-account space is central to Mastercard's ambition,&quot; said Peter Klein, executive vice president of new payment platforms at Mastercard. The stock rose 0.5% in premarket trading, after pulling back 6.8% over the past three sessions from the Sept. 5 record close of $292.08. Year to date, Mastercard's stock has soared 44% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 15%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/fe6bcd7c-6462-38f4-9801-d5a0384012b7/mastercard-partners-with-r3.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-10	2019-09-10 09:16:30	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook Dating Yet Another Positive Catalyst for FB Stock	Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) hit a home run when the company announced its dating feature in the U.S. markets. Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) will no longer enjoy the absence of competition in the online dating market. Facebook has a huge user base and now has the chance to leverage Instagram alongside Facebook and the Facebook Dating app.Facebook will help its billions of users find a match based on common interests in events, groups, and hobbies. It will even integrate Instagram so that users may include such posts on their Facebook dating profile. The &quot;Secret Crush&quot; lists allow users to add both their Instagram followers and their friends. By the end of the year, users may add Instagram Stories. Dating Faces Safety ConcernsAfter the data leak, users might express skepticism over Facebook Dating safety. But users must opt in to this new feature. The Dating profile is also separate from a user's main profile. The fundamental difference between Facebook and this Dating feature is that users may choose to get matches with friends, friends of friends, and people not in the friend circle.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors recognized the threat Facebook has on the online dating market. Last week, Match stock fell ~5% to $81.47. The chart watchers saw a &quot;double top&quot; at around $90 on the charts. Government Scrutiny IntensifiesOn Sept. 6, New York State Attorney General Letitia James said she would lead an investigation against Facebook for antitrust issues. &quot;Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers,&quot; she said. &quot;I am proud to be leading a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general in investigating whether Facebook has stifled competition and put users at risk.&quot;  * 7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy The bad news for investors is that Facebook may have to settle without admitting guilt. The government gets paid but the end-users ultimately pay for the damages.Recall that on July 24 Facebook agreed to a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. It will pay a record $5 billion fine over its privacy policies. This amount represents 9% of its 2018 revenue. Still, the company generated revenue of $16.9 billion in the second quarter alone. Much of its revenue is from advertising. So long as add spend from U.S. and Canada grows, Facebook can afford to settle with the government. EU Investigates FacebookMeanwhile, EU antitrust regulators are scrutinizing Facebook's planned Libra currency launch. The EU is worried that the cryptocurrency may shut out rivals and restrict competition through the use of information and consumer data. Sadly, Facebook did not even launch the currency, so the investigation may prove premature. Besides, there are many other well-established payment systems. Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) all offer some form of electronic payment options.The EU's pre-emptive strike against Facebook is unwise. It may deter the social networking giant from entering the market. This would pave the way for a China-based firm to come in instead. Conversely, the U.S. banks and credit card companies may get a head start if the EU delays' Facebook's entry in the cryptocurrency market.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market  Valuation Here and NowInvestors who forecast a ~20% CAGR in a 5-year DCF growth exit model will arrive at a fair value of $196-$273 for Facebook stock. At a 9.5% discount rate, the implied fair value is $228. Its intrinsic value based on future cash flow is even more bullish. Per Simplywall.St, FB stock is more than 20% discounted from its future cash flow and has plenty of upside for shareholders ahead.On Wall Street, Facebook stock has a $234 target average among 36 analysts tracked by TipRanks.Facebook continues to attract healthy advertising spending. It faces no immediate competition from other social networking sites, either. Investors will do well holding or accumulating FB stock at current levels.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-06	2019-09-06 11:46:41	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Plans Push Into Crypto Underwriting	(Bloomberg) -- Michael Novogratz is a step closer toward his vision of making Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. the Goldman Sachs of cryptocurrencies.The former macro manager’s self-styled merchant bank noted its approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to underwrite registered public offerings of securities in a filing last week. The New York-based firm is also looking at shepherding security token offerings -- effectively, digitized IPOs.“It’s a really young industry, and we are a pretty young business,” Novogratz said in a phone interview. “We are sober and patient about how fast it will grow, and we are well capitalized. This feels like a perfect addition.”Galaxy already invests in start-ups and coins, and helps companies secure funding for everything from early- to later-stage rounds. Galaxy managed $390 million in assets as of July 31.Novogratz, 54, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner who spent more than a decade at the New York-based bank. He later became a principal at Fortress Investment Group LLC and managed the Fortress Macro Fund before it was liquidated in 2015. He launched Galaxy in January 2018 during the height of the crypto bubble.The company’s advisory business is headed by Ian Taylor, who worked at Goldman Sachs for 18 years before joining Galaxy in December. The Australia native is now leading a team of eight -- up from three employees in December -- with backgrounds in investment banking, consulting and structured finance.Business could take several years to ramp up, but there are plenty of hopeful signs that IPO demand could be coming: A number of crypto exchanges like Coinbase Inc. have raised money at valuations in the billions, and companies like mining hardware giant Bitmain Technologies Ltd. are already planning IPOs. Many major exchanges, mining and chip businesses are generating real revenue and profits.“The business that we are building on the advisory side is a long-term, relationship-based business,” Taylor said. “In time that will pay dividends as financing and strategic advisory opportunities arise.”Galaxy is already working on finding financing for a Bitcoin mining data center to be located in the U.S., for example, Taylor said.Mergers-and-acquisitions advising could be poised to take off as well. Traditional companies like card network Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. have joined the Libra Association, a Facebook Inc.-led effort to issue a new digital coin for payments -- and such companies may look to acquire crypto businesses at some point as well. Due to political and regulatory scrutiny, Novogratz pegs Libra’s chances of launching next year at 50%.“Ultimately, we want to be a big part of the crypto ecosystem, and if they are there we want to be a big part of that,” Novogratz said, adding that he is also investing in and advising alternative platforms that would allow for Libra-like coins.Eventually, Galaxy also wants to issue tokens that could connect to or represent ownership of many valuable objects and revenue streams, Novogratz said.“The key here is regulators have been a little slower than we want them to be, but I think they are heading in the right direction,” Novogratz said. “There are a lot of interesting projects, but nothing has happened yet on the ’tokenization of everything’ front.”While some traditional investment banks could join the fray by that time, Novogratz hopes to enjoy a first-mover advantage -- and an advantage of someone focused on crypto from day one.“The traditional banks don’t have the DNA that they really need to understand the crypto community yet,” Novogratz said. “Our edge over time is that we are going to see more projects and get an understanding of what works and what doesn’t.”&#92;--With assistance from Ben Bain.To contact the reporter on this story: Olga Kharif in Portland at okharif@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Dave Liedtka, Brendan WalshFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novogratz-galaxy-digital-plans-push-114641931.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-05	2019-09-05 11:10:53	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Goldman Sachs Says These 3 “Strong Buy” Stocks Are Primed For Growth	When investors are looking for fresh investment ideas, recent recommendations from Wall Street analysts can underscore compelling investment opportunities. This is where Goldman Sachs and comes in. The firm just issued recommendations on 3 stocks, highlighting each based on its strong long-term growth prospects. Each of these stocks also boasts substantial support from the Street with a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus, based on TipRanks' Stock Screener. This consensus is generated from the last three months’ worth of ratings from all other analysts.    Let’s take a closer look at the firm’s picks.  MasterCard Inc. (MA)Goldman Sachs’ James Schneider believes MasterCard is on track to see even more growth on top of the 48% year-to-date gain it has already achieved. Despite the fact that its $284 billion market cap falls below Visa’s (V) $401 billion, Schneider argues that MA has a lot going for it. With the company reporting on July 30 that gross dollar volume, the dollar value of transactions processed, gained 8% in its second quarter, MA appears to be well-positioned in terms of both its new and old electronic payment technologies. The cashless payments company stands to benefit from the shift towards digitized money. In July, MA announced that it’s partnering with Evolve Bank & Trust to create a frictionless payment system where employers can pay gig workers with an interest-free loan for service in almost real-time. Not to mention it also finalized its acquisition of Transfast that same month, giving MA the ability to disperse payments across bank accounts, mobile wallets and cards through a single API, and agreed to buy payments platform Nets for €2.85 billion on August 6 to add capacity for growth in the European market.  “We are driving growth in our core products with key wins around the globe, and our recent acquisitions, such as Transfast, and new partnerships, like P27 in the Nordics, will help us address our customers’ evolving payments needs, particularly in the areas of real-time account-to-account and cross-border payments,” CEO Ajay Banga stated. All of these factors played into Schneider’s recommendation. As a result, the five-star analyst reiterated his Buy rating on September 3. The rest of the Street is on the same page. With 15 Buy ratings vs 1 Hold received in the last three months, the consensus among analysts is that MA is a ‘Strong Buy’. Its $310 average price target suggests 11% upside potential.  Wayfair Inc. (W)The online furniture retailer is another Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry’s pick as most poised to outperform its peers. The five-star analyst describes the company as being “a leader in the online movement of household goods as it used its technology and scale to build a destination for furniture and home goods shopping over the past 16 years”. While Wayfair reported on August 1 that its Q2 net loss widened from the year-ago quarter, it should be noted that its active user base for its direct retail business now totals 17.8 million, more than 39% higher than it was a year ago. It also doesn’t hurt that orders delivered increased 42% year-over-year and the average order value was slightly higher than in the year-ago period.Management points out that part of the loss was due to its heavy investment in expanding its reach internationally. While Terry notes that the $300 billion U.S. home category is underpenetrated as it only makes up about 13% of sales online because of higher price points, risk of damage and potentially expensive delivery, he argues that the company is already on the right track thanks to its merchandising, breadth and depth of supply. Based on all of the above factors, the analyst initiated coverage with a Buy rating and set a $145 price target. This price target demonstrates Terry’s confidence that shares can surge 23% in the next twelve months. Wall Street remains firmly bullish on Wayfair. The stock boasts a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $159 average price target, suggesting 34% upside potential.  Myovant Sciences (MYOV)Myovant is a biotech company that develops treatments for conditions affecting women and prostate cancer, with clinical programs for uterine fibroids (noncancerous growths of the uterus), prostate cancer and endometriosis. Endometriosis affects about one in ten women in their reproductive years, or approximately 176 million women globally, and is known for causing debilitating pain particularly during menstruation as well as infertility. The company is hoping to give women a more effective treatment option with its drug, Relugolix. MYOV just completed patient recruitment for SPIRIT 2, the first of two Phase III replicate trials evaluating Relugolix combination therapy in patients with pain caused by endometriosis. If the drug is approved, it will be the second gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist on the market for endometriosis.Adding to the good news, the company announced on July 23 that its second Phase III trial of once-daily Relugolix combination therapy demonstrated positive results when used to treat uterine fibroids. The drug was generally well-tolerated and successful in reducing pain, with these results enabling MYOV to submit a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA by the end of this year.While there was some concern regarding Relugolix's placebo-adjusted response rate, Goldman Sachs’ Paul Choi tells investors that an overreaction over data has provided a solid entry-point. He adds, “The market has excessively discounted Myovant's prospects as our key opinion leader checks indicate no concerns about the response rate data and enthusiasm for another treatment option for endometriosis and uterine fibroid.” As a result, the analyst initiated coverage with a Buy and set a $20 price target on August 28. While noting that biotech stocks carry risk based on the fact that one negative catalyst such as poor study results can cause shares to sink, Choi thinks MYOV has the potential to gain 144% over the next twelve months.With 3 Buy ratings and no Holds or Sells being assigned in the last three months, MYOV has a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus. Its average price target of $23 indicates 181% upside potential.

2019-09-04	2019-09-04 14:11:59	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	3 Reasons to Trust Square Stock Even in a Recession	I've been a fan of Square (NYSE:SQ) and its disruptive force in the small business community for quite some time. For me, the long-term narrative for SQ stock has never changed. This is all about providing lesser-known outfits with the tools and resources to compete with the alpha dogs. While disruption often gets a bad rap, with Square, it's mostly positive.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com That said, where I don't get the warm and fuzzies is the market performance of Square stock. On a year-to-date basis, shares have slipped to a return of only 11%. While that's still respectable considering the geopolitical circumstances, SQ was up over 51% YTD as recently as late July.Unfortunately, the markets thought dimly of SQ stock following the payment-processing specialist's second-quarter earnings report. Although Square beat on both the top and bottom line, its per-share profitability guidance for Q3 was notably sub-par. Rather than an earnings per share of 22 cents that analysts forecasted, Square only sees a range between 18 cents to 20 cents.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now Naturally, investors got spooked and punished Square stock. While the volatility is understandable, the magnitude isn't. Yes, there are many headwinds impacting the company's core business. However, the skeptics are not giving an opportunity to let Square's positives shine.Here are three reasons why I think it's premature to give up on SQ stock, even with a possible recession: SQ Evens Things Up for Small BusinessesOn the surface, the present environment seems incredibly negative for SQ stock. Square first jumped to prominence with its square-shaped payment processor. Neatly attaching to a smartphone, it allowed proprietors to deliver the same conveniences to their customers as they would find in a larger company.But in a recession, small businesses are often hit the hardest. It's not difficult to understand why. With limited resources relative to bigger organizations, they typically don't have the capital strength to ride out economic turmoil indefinitely. Therefore, it's also seemingly reasonable that many investors gave up on Square stock.At the same time, small businesses are much nimbler than their larger counterparts. Furthermore, this is a practical advantage that could, in some cases, see the little guy disrupt the top dog.For instance, during a recession, the overall consumer market obviously declines. Thus, some companies may adapt a different approach to sway whatever customers are available. Making this strategy and tactic change, though, is difficult for larger organizations. But small businesses can react quicker, and with Square's comprehensive application ecosystem, they're that much more effective. Modern Amenities Underline Square StockPrior to Square's disruption in the payments-processing industry, small business owners had very few options. They could elect to ink deals with major credit card companies like Mastercard (NYSE:MA) or Visa (NYSE:V), or they could go cash only if they didn't want to pay onerous fees.However, with Square's payment processor, along with recent initiatives like Square Card and their Cash app, the company provides comprehensive modern amenities at reasonable rates. They also open up the door to companies who don't want or cannot get access to traditional financial tools. Particularly, I'm thinking about cannabis-based businesses, which Square quietly but tacitly supports.Sure, it's a risky play. But it offers tremendous opportunities for Square stock, especially as legal momentum builds.But the beauty of platforms like the Cash app is its modularity. For instance, if you want immediate payment transfers to your bank account, Cash provides that for a 1.5% fee. Otherwise, normal transfers (taking one business day) are free. Plus, having all Square transactions under its ecosystem is incredibly beneficial for small businesses, saving time and costs. Logically, this adds to the fundamental value propositions for SQ stock.Finally, I think it's a smart move that Square CEO Jack Dorsey supports cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. Increasingly, the Cash app has tacked on more crypto-related functions. Over time, it will become a fully-fledged crypto resource.How do I know this? No matter what you personally think about cryptos, most millennials love them. And since they're the &quot;it&quot; generation right now, their voice matters the most. International Narrative Supports SQ StockPut aside the investment narrative for SQ stock. When you simply consider its impact in the business community, Square has made profound changes. If you've shopped at independent retail companies, you've almost certainly engaged their products or services.Square wants to spread out. Rather than keeping the intuitive interface and disruptive nature domestic, management is betting that other countries will want to join.As such, I think the company has massive international opportunities, with the biggest in Japan. Even today, Japan has a cash culture that is oddly anachronistic and perhaps ironic. But Square is trying to turn this market, evangelizing the benefits of both the company and the fintech industry.If they succeed, Square stock will enjoy a long-term catalyst. In the meantime, Japan and other international channels offer revenue potential that may help shield SQ from a recession.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 15:04:59	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Square (SQ) Stock Has Upside Potential From Here	Square (NYSE:SQ) stock had many more fans on Wall Street just a few months ago.But for months, SQ stock has been in a negative trend -- down 40% from the October highs. Nevertheless, SQ stock remains up 10% for the year, which is in line with the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) and just four points below the S&P 500.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com The bigger problem for SQ is that it is also lagging its competitors. MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is up 45%, Visa (NYSE:V) up 35%, while PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) are each up 25%. Clearly Square stock has some work to do, but therein lies the opportunity.They say that stocks don't ring bells on tops or bottoms. This is more true in the case of Square stock since it always carries momentum. Meaning when it moves, it does it fast in either direction. This makes it scary to catch it when it's a proverbial falling knife.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFundamentally, the prospects for SQ have not changed. The company is still set in an exciting area of business. The financial technology stocks like this have a long-term rising demand curve. The whole world is in a trend to migrate all financial transactions to digital. This movement gained steam from the popularity of Bitcoin and its blockchain technology.Since we know that the SQ products and services will remain in demand for years, it's safe to assume that Square stock should also do well. Only management flubs or a market-wide crashes could changed that in the short to mid term. SQ Stock Has Upside OpportunitySquare stock still has technical opportunities and pitfalls to help guide the timing down here. If SQ falls below $60.50 per share it could trigger a bearish pattern worth another $6 decrease from there. While this is not a forecast it's a realistic scenario that is just below current levels. If that happens then it would make the argument much stronger to go long SQ.Conversely, if the bulls can break above $67 per share they could launch a rally to fill the gap to $69 but also the bigger one all the way to $78. Clearly there are several resistance levels along the way starting at $65. Each of them are milestones for the bulls.So far, SQ has been shy about taking advantage of breakout setups. It had at least two great positions this year but they both failed in a big way. The earnings reactions in March and August were perfect setups for a major breakout but alas for the bulls the investors reacted negatively to what management delivered.So the concern here for SQ stock is stabilization first then worry about rallies. Buying the dip of it has worked better than trying to time a spike. So at the first sign of the S&P stabilizing, SQ would make for a good bounce trade off the lows and exit at the breakout line until this pattern breaks.Fundamentally, SQ stock is not cheap as it still loses money and sells at 8 times sales. Since it is a growth stock, Wall Street allows it a lot of slack on the profitability line. So this for now is okay as long as management doesn't disappoint on sales forecasts.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income In short, fintech stocks are going to thrive for years to come so this bodes well for SQ stock. So in spite of the geopolitical distractions here, demand for SQ services will persist.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-08-26	2019-08-26 11:23:36	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Will Facebook Libra Survive Regulatory Scrutiny?	Just two months ago, with a great deal of hype and fanfare, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg unveiled his company’s latest project: the Libra Association, a blockchain cryptocurrency initiative backed by a variety of well-heeled corporations – including Facebook (FB), private venture capital firms, and major players in payment processing, such as Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), and PayPal (PYPL) – and linked to a basket of traditional fiat currencies as a hedge against the extreme volatility of the “pure” cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Facebook being involved, the controversy did not take long to erupt.The main concerns, at first, centered around user privacy issues. Facebook has a notoriously poor reputation in this area, and went to great lengths to address possible concerns. The new Libra crypto coin will be administered by the Libra Association, not by Facebook directly. The Association is grouping of Libra’s backers, each of which gets an equal voice in overseeing the currency. The Libra Association members each put the same $10 million investment into the common pot backing the currency, so no one member can claim a larger share than the others. On paper, it’s appears to be a good system. The Governments Get into the GameIt didn’t take long for government watchdogs to start sniffing around Libra project. As early as June 18, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire spoke against Libra, saying “Libra must not become a sovereign currency.” In the EU Parliament, a German member agreed, and added that Facebook and other private companies cannot be allowed “to operate in a regulatory nirvana when introducing virtual currencies. A month later, the US House of Representatives had David Marcus, Facebook’s head of cyrpotcurrency, before the Financial Services Committee. During the testimony, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) said, “The creation of a new currency is a core government function and should be left to democratically accountable institutions, that are accountable to the American people.” She added that if Facebook does go through with the Libra launch next year, it should start with a small pilot program under SEC and Federal Reserve supervision.Now the European Commission is starting to investigate Libra. In a circular sent out to the 28 members of the Libra Association last week, the antitrust regulators said, “The Commission is in particular concerned about the possible competition restrictions that may result from the Association, especially with regard to information that will be exchanged and the use of consumer data.” The questionnaire requests follow-up within two to three weeks.The new regulatory interest from the EU may have spooked some members of the Libra Association; anonymous reports are circulating that at least three of Libra’s original backers have discussed leaving the group. The reports add that the nervous investors are expressing concern over the effect that regulatory probes into Libra will have on their core businesses. A Careful LaunchFor its part, Facebook – and its partners – are approaching the Libra project with caution. David Marcus has already said that the new crypto coin will undergo “the most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight in financial tech history.” Libra won’t launch until the middle of next year, and while a charter is not yet public, Marcus’ statement makes clear that Libra’s rules are being drawn up in the sure knowledge that they will face close regulatory scrutiny.That’s the background, and the current state of Facebook’s Libra project. So far, indications are that the blockchain project is going ahead; the regulatory interest has the backers cautious, but none have yet dropped out. So, let’s take a closer look at some of those backers, and their stock performance.  Facebook, Inc. (FB)The main issue with Facebook, as it has been for a long time, is user privacy. The company’s reputation in this area is justly poor. From the Cambridge Analytica scandal to the exposure of users’ private photos, 2018 was the year of data breaches for the social media giant. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg publicly admitted Facebook’s failings in privacy protection. Just two weeks later, added insult to irony, the company disclosed that up to 600 million user passwords, across its apps, had been stored in plaintext. This past spring, Facebook was hit by the Federal Trade Commission with a record-setting $5 billion fine in response to the privacy problems.Starting in July of last year, the predictable happened and Facebook’s stock started losing heavily. It bottomed out on December 24 and has since regained its losses, and then some. In the past month, FB shares have slipped 13%. With all of that, the company remains popular with top analysts.SunTrust’s 5-star analyst Youssef Squali, in an August 20 note, agreed that FB has upbeat prospects. Noting that the company has a long way to go on privacy protection – he wrote, “We note that the data is not deleted and remains on FB’s servers for a length of time that’s unclear to us. This means the data could still be used to report back to an advertiser if a user has purchased a product after viewing the ad, which appears to fall somewhat short of the original pledge by CEO Zuckerberg of empowering users to flush their history whenever they want…” – Squali still set a price target of $236, suggesting an upside of 32%.Overall, Facebook has a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 33 buy ratings and 3 holds given in the past three months. FB shares are trading for $177, and the $234 average price target indicates a 32% upside. Mastercard, Inc. (MA)Mastercard is an original member of the Libra Association, and in addition to the membership fee, it brings its payment processing network and long experience in the financial industry. In all of the recent regulatory dust-up around Libra, Mastercard’s only official statement was not to comment on the matter. Fortunately for customers, Mastercard has a far better reputation than Facebook when it comes to data protection.As an investment, MA has offered excellent returns for a long time. The stock is up 44% year-to-date, more than triple the S&P 500’s gain. The stock’s dividend is reliable, and while only yielding 0.49%, the stock’s high trading value makes the annual payout $1.32 per share.Underscoring MA’s inherent value to investors, Nomura analyst Bill Carache said after the company’s recent quarterly report, “Another solid quarter, fueled by better than expected volume growth, new partnership signings, and progress across its growth initiatives. We believe the company can continue to generate mid-teens compound annual earnings growth.” In line with this, he set a Buy rating on the stock and raised his price target by 15%, to $324. His new PT suggests a 19% upside.Mastercard also holds a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus. The stock has received 14 buy ratings a single hold in the last 90 days. Shares are selling for $271, so the $309 average price target implies 13% upside potential. Visa, Inc. (V)The larger of the two major credit card issuers and payment processers, Visa is very similar to Mastercard as an investment. The company is solid, having shown steady returns over an extended timeframe. It offers a low-yield dividend of 0.57%, but the share price boosts the dividend payment to a full $1 annualized. Visa’s fiscal Q3 results beat the forecasts last month, and suggest that the company will just keep chugging along with steady low- to mid-teens growth rates. Like Mastercard, Visa has not commented on the regulatory agencies’ interest in Libra.Nomura’s Bill Careche is as upbeat on Visa as he was on Mastercard. He says Visa is “…uniquely positioned to sustain mid-teens annual earnings growth against an uncertain macro backdrop.” Careche’s $204 target on V implies an upside of 16%.Visa’s analyst consensus rating is another Strong Buy, this one based on 18 buys and 1 hold. With shares selling at $175, and an average price target of $201, the stock has an upside potential of 15%. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL)The last stock we are looking at here is the leader in the online payment processing space. PayPal has been operating independently since 2015, and has shown consistent stock gains since then. Shares are up 26% year-to-date, despite a slip at the end of July.PayPal’s involvement in Libra makes eminent sense. The company’s proven expertise in payment processing and online finance are highly relevant to the Libra Association, and unlike Facebook, PayPal has not been plagued by data privacy issues. And like Mastercard and Visa, PayPal is a high-quality investment-grade stock.Kenneth Hill, from Rosenblatt Securities, would agree. He initiated coverage with a Buy rating and said, “Look past the recent tumble in PayPal Holdings stock, and the longer-term outlook for the firm looks as healthy as ever.” PayPal’s Strong Buy consensus rating is a measure of that long-term health. The stock has 18 buys and 2 holds given in the past three months, and a share price of $106. The average price target of $130 suggests a robust upside of 22%.Visit TipRanks’ Trending Stocks page to find out what investments are hot with Wall Street’s top analysts.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-libra-survive-regulatory-scrutiny-112336204.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-21	2019-08-21 21:34:13	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Stakeholder Capitalism Will Fail If It’s Just Talk	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For 47 years, the Business Roundtable has lobbied on behalf of corporate America. Much of that time, it maintained a fiction(1) -- that the sole purpose of a corporation was to maximize profits on behalf of shareholders. This philosophy has been under assault for several years now, and this week the Business Roundtable announced it wants to put it to rest.In a widely circulated memo, the 200-member organization reversed itself, writing that &quot;shareholder primacy” is no longer the sole purpose of a corporation. Instead, corporations must include a commitment to “all stakeholders,” which includes customers, employees, suppliers and local communities.Some kudos are in order for JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, and chairman of the Business Roundtable, for driving these changes. He has been discussing the need for a more inclusive form of capitalism, both in public speeches and in his letters to shareholders, for some time.But turning this aircraft carrier around won’t be easy, in large part because of the group's own history. Indeed, the Roundtable has spent most of the past four decades advocating against the interests of those exact stakeholders. To cite some of the more notable examples:&#92;-- It fought the rise of labor unions and pro-union legislation;&#92;-- Helped to defeat antitrust bills;&#92;-- Prevented the formation of the Consumer Protection Agency;&#92;-- Opposed corporate governance changes to make boards of directors and CEOs more accountable to stockholders;&#92;-- Fought proper accounting of stock options given as compensation to executives and insiders;&#92;-- Opposed increases in the national minimum wage (it now favors increases);&#92;-- Lobbied to prevent restrictions on executive compensation;&#92;-- Fought legislation that would create cleaner energy and address climate change;&#92;-- Pushed for corporate income-tax cuts;&#92;-- Supported anti-consumer Supreme Court decisions, including the fiction that corporations are legal people, and that campaign donations equal speech.   The Roundtable might respond that this is all in the past. Let’s hope so. But the organization has an even greater challenge: Scan the list of 181 signatories to the recent memo and it's a Who’s Who of corporate behavior that has burdened and disadvantaged the very stakeholders they will now champion.Consider a few of the signatories:&#92;-- Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.:  Two of the most valuable companies in the world are famously effective at using various tax dodges to avoid paying their fair share. I can recall when the Internal Revenue Service went after maneuvers that serve no valid business purpose other than tax avoidance. Consider that what isn't paid in tax by those who avoid them must be made up for by those who do -- mostly average Americans who also happen to be customers of these companies.The share of federal tax revenue paid by corporations has dropped by two-thirds in the past seven decades -- from 32% in 1952 to 10% in 2013; and corporate income tax as a share of gross domestic product has fallen from about 6% in 1946 to about 1.5% today.&#92;-- Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and American Express Co.: Show good faith -- working with card-issuing banks as needed -- by simplifying the incomprehensible small print in the cardholder agreement and spell out in clear language the terms and penalties for late payment. Second, do the same for mandatory arbitration clauses that take away the right of customers to seek redress in public courts.&#92;-- Ameriprise Financial Inc., Morgan Stanley and Principal Financial Group Inc: The brokers and insurers on the list have been zealous opponents of the fiduciary rule. Instead, they prefer a less stringent rule that allows them to sell products that are better for them than for their customers. Until those firms -- and Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan are in this group -- embrace a higher duty of care, their gestures toward stakeholders are hollow. Oh, and they should drop the requirement that customers agree to mandatory arbitration clauses as one of the conditions for opening a brokerage account.&#92;-- Coca Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc.: For years these companies have been helping the American public achieve record levels of diabetes and obesity by selling health-damaging sugary drinks. They should acknowledge and warn customers of the consequences of consuming too much of their products, and accept the same kinds of taxes and health warnings now affixed to cigarettes.&#92;-- Deere & Co.: The maker of farm machinery has led the fight against customers, insisting that they not make repairs to the equipment they own, and denying them access to parts and instructions. Repairs can only be made by Deere service technicians in what has come to be known as a “repair monopoly.” Apple, by the way, does the same thing.&#92;-- Walmart Inc. and McDonald's Corp.: Both were steadfast opponents of increases in minimum wages for years. Although both now offer higher minimum pay, it was only after a tightening labor market forced them to increase wages. But this wasn't a case of corporate altruism -- their stores were messy and employees were sullen, and pay increases were part of plans to keep ill-treated customers from defecting. (McDonald's is not a signatory to the Roundtable memo).For the Roundtable commitment to be meaningful, the signatories are going to have to alter their behavior in ways large and small, and maybe even in ways that aren't always optimal for maximizing short-term profits. Still, we should be encouraged. But the proof will be in the follow through and the actual actions of the Roundtable members.(Corrects to clarify section on credit-card companies to indicate the role of banks in setting terms for customers.   )(1) In “The Shareholder Value Myth,” Lynn Stout explained how the entire theory is based on a misreading of a 1919 court case -- Dodge vs. Ford – at the time, both privately held, non-public companies.To contact the author of this story: Barry Ritholtz at britholtz3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Barry Ritholtz is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2019-08-21	2019-08-21 10:46:39	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook Finally Meets a Regulator With Bite	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In France, they call it taking mustard after dinner. In Germany, they talk about a child having already fallen in the well. In England, they speak of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.They all are good ways of describing how regulators have tended to deal with the world’s biggest tech firms. But when it comes to Facebook Inc.'s digital coin, Europe's antitrust watchdog seems to be intent on breaking with this previous inaction.Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that the European Commission is scrutinizing the two-month-old Libra project and the group backing it amid concern the currency will be detrimental to competition. This is a good sign the regulator will do something about it.That’s welcome because antitrust authorities have, over the years, repeatedly failed to prevent the sort of practices which have cemented the dominance of Silicon Valley firms in their target markets. Regulators then struggle to rebalance the market after the fact.Some past decisions look misguided in hindsight. The most obvious are Google’s $3.2 billion acquisition of DoubleClick in 2008, which cemented the search giant’s control over digital ads, and Facebook’s purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp – deals that made it the preeminent social network.Facebook’s plan should give regulators plenty of reasons for concern. The organization administering the digital currency, the Libra Association, comprises 28 members so far, but the extent of Facebook’s leading role warrants closer examination.QuicktakeWhy Everybody (Almost) Hates Facebook’s Digital CoinThe motivation for many of the members seems at this stage to be a fear of missing out. After all, Facebook’s 2.4 billion monthly active users give it unparalleled scale. But that could also be construed as the Menlo Park, California-based firm abusing a dominant position: Members of the association might feel they can’t risk being left out, so have little choice but to take part.The group includes most of the world’s biggest payments companies: Mastercard Inc., Visa Inc., Paypal Holdings Inc., Stripe Inc. and Vodafone Group Plc, whose M-Pesa mobile money transfer service is dominant in parts of Africa.That means it could be seen as a horizontal agreement, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Aitor Ortiz. Those kind of arrangements may be acceptable in certain cases if they benefit the end user, but are normally anti-competitive if they consolidate the influence of a discrete group at the expense of consumers or rivals.Facebook has said that it won’t push ahead with Libra until it has secured all the necessary regulatory approvals. The European Commission’s message seems to be: Don’t push your luck. If the group fails to pay heed, it risks fines and punishments further down the line. That will make it harder to sign up new partners who are unwilling to expose themselves to such regulatory hazards.One has to wonder whether the growing regulatory scrutiny the currency is attracting will make the project worth the effort for Facebook. For sure, the social networking giant needs to find a way to diversify its revenue away from advertising. But I’m unconvinced that Libra does that.If anything, it will become another pillar of the advertising business by supplying valuable data on purchasing intent: every time you make a purchase using Facebook’s digital wallet, you give the company a better understanding of what you’re buying and why.All this highlights the contradiction at the heart of Libra: if it is truly independent, what’s in it for Facebook? Regulators are right to press for an answer.To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Edward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2019-08-20	2019-08-20 16:41:51	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook's Libra Currency Gets European Union Antitrust Scrutiny	(Bloomberg) -- European Union antitrust regulators are already probing Facebook Inc.’s two-month-old Libra digital currency project, according to a document seen by Bloomberg.The European Commission is &quot;currently investigating potential anti-competitive behavior&quot; related to the Libra Association amid concerns the proposed payment system would unfairly shut out rivals, the EU authority said in a questionnaire sent out earlier this month.Officials said they’re concerned about how Libra may create &quot;possible competition restrictions&quot; on the information that will be exchanged and the use of consumer data, according to the document, which is a standard part of an early-stage EU inquiry to gather information.The investigation into founder Mark Zuckerberg’s ambitions to take on traditional cash adds to another preliminary EU investigation into how Facebook may unfairly use its power to squeeze rival apps. The Brussels-based commission, Europe’s most feared regulator, has already targeted Google and Apple Inc.Facebook and the commission both declined to comment on the investigation. The Menlo Park, California-based company has previously promised to appease all regulators before launching the cryptocurrency, a process that could take some time.Global CurrencyLed by a social network with more users than the combined population of China and the U.S., Libra represents a potential challenge that the guardians of money have never faced: a global currency they neither control nor manage.The EU questionnaire said regulators are also examining the possible integration of Libra-backed applications into Facebook services such as WhatsApp and Messenger. It said their investigation focuses on the governance structure and membership of the Libra Association.Facebook has previously promised to appease all regulators before launching the cryptocurrency, a process that could take some time.Visa Inc. declined to comment while the Libra Association representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Mastercard Inc. had no immediate comment.Aside from the antitrust division, other EU regulators are &quot;monitoring market developments in the area of crypto assets and payment services, including Libra and its development,&quot; a spokesman for the commission’s financial services department said.Data-protection supervisors are also worried about how Libra will share information. They said earlier this month that Facebook had the potential to combine &quot;vast reserves of personal information with financial information and cryptocurrency, amplifying privacy concerns about the network’s design and data-sharing arrangements.&quot;&#92;--With assistance from Alexander Weber, Alastair Marsh and James Hertling.To contact the reporters on this story: Lydia Beyoud in Arlington at lbeyoud2@bloomberg.net;Aoife White in Brussels at awhite62@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anthony Aarons at aaarons@bloomberg.net, Peter Chapman, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebooks-libra-currency-gets-european-164151628.html?.tsrc=rss

Even amid the trade hostilities with the U.S., Chinese imports also fell less than expected in July.Sure, that was just one data report out of China and there is a very real possibility that the U.S. and its rival will butt heads again on trade, but for today, news that the Chinese economy remains firm was enough to lift riskier assets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates Buoyed by a resurgence in tariff-sensitive technology stocks, the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.24% while the S&P 500, where technology is also the largest sector, jumped 1.88%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished higher by 1.43%.Let's have a look at some interesting takeaways from the Dow today. Be Careful With This Dow SurpriseI've frequently mentioned industrial machinery maker Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) in this space and with good reason. Caterpillar is highly tariff-sensitive and is lower by nearly 5% this year, making it one of the worst-performing names in the Dow.Somehow, shares of Caterpillar added 1.03% Thursday even after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;buy&quot; while lower its price target on the shares to $130 from $156.Goldman &quot;believes rising inventories of trucks and construction machines will lead to production cuts in 2020. That will hurt next year's earnings for these companies. And higher inventories is another sign the global industrial economy is slowing down,&quot; reports Barron's.Analyst upgrades and downgrades are not gospel, but as it pertains to Caterpillar, it's hard to endorse the stock with trade tensions running high and the aforementioned factors cited by Goldman very much in play. Rebound Starting?Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is another name that has been getting some run here in recent days. Long story short, I've pointed out that the stock usually falls after earnings reports and that happened yesterday, but there is no shortage of support for Disney shares.The stock surged 2.29% today after Credit Suisse upgraded the ESPN owner to &quot;outperform&quot; while boosting its price target on the shares to $150 from $130, implying some decent upside from Disney's Thursday close around $137. Careful With the HeadlinesOn light news, Visa (NYSE:V) jumped 2.61%, good for one of the Dow's better performances today. I always try to be careful here when it comes to politics, the all views are welcomed policy remains in effect, so I'll just give to you straight about Visa: In an interview with CNBC, CEO Alfred Kelly said Visa will not ban customers from buying firearms with Visa-branded credit and debit cards.However, I doubt those comments sparked the stock today as fellow Dow component American Express (NYSE:AXP) and rival MasterCard (NYSE:MA) both gained on the day, too. Bottom Line on the Dow: Recession RiskNot to be the bearer of bad news, but economists are forecasting a rising risk of recession. That percentage is up to 35% from 31% last month, according to Bloomberg. Those same prognosticators are also saying U.S. GDP growth will average 2.3% this year, down from the prior estimate of 2.5%.Still, they're saying the recession probably won't start until 2021. For investors looking for some silver lining, the U.S. consumer remains healthy and it's hard to envision a recession against that backrdop. Plus, not to be trite, but economists are often wrong.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-06	2019-08-06 15:56:24	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	3 Fintech Stocks to Buy After Monday’s Plunge	After a day of complete debacle on Wall Street where the S&P 500 fell over 3% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell over 5%, it's hard to conceive that anyone would want to look at any stocks from the long side. But this is what we're doing today because there are quality stocks that got caught up in the headline trading. Specifically, fintech stocks like Visa (NYSE:V) MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Square (NYSE:SQ) were unfairly punished.Source: Shutterstock The banking sector as represented by the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) fell -3% on Monday. In comparison, V stock fell 5%, MA stock fell about the same, and SQ stock almost 7%.These are proven winners that have business models that will survive the current headlines from the U.S. versus China economic war. So the selling was overdone.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe business of fintech stocks relies heavily on transactions being electronic. To that, this is an ongoing migration from paper to electronic. It is global and happening at an exponential rate. There are no signs of it reversing, so the transaction demand from these three companies will only increase for years to come.Barriers-to-entry are high so there are only a handful of competitors so MA, V and SQ stocks are the ones to bet on.In general, when the stock market falls the best practice is to sit back and do homework. The goal is to find stocks that have retraced the last rally and are now falling into support.Visa, MasterCard and Square stocks all fulfill this requirement and then some. Valuations in these growth stocks almost don't matter, but even here, there's some good news for the bulls.It is impossible to pin an actual bottom, especially because we continue to be in headlines trading mode. Investors are selling stocks indiscriminately and in panic after tweets from the White House or a press releases from the Chinese state media. So this is when homework falls hostage to headlines. But long term, the fundamentals will prevail.  * 7 Biotech ETFs That Should Remain Healthy While all three fintech stocks look good for a bounce trade, this doesn't eliminate the fact that they could still see lower lows in the next few days. The general stock market is still having a crisis of sentiment which usually punishes the good and the bad stocks alike. Visa (V)Source: Shutterstock Including the Monday drop, V stock fell a total of 10% from the recent highs. This constitute a full correction by Wall Street standards. Nevertheless this doesn't mean that it's a bottom. Year-to-date, Visa stock is still up 35% so there is plenty of fresh winnings to give back if the bears press the issue.However, I do like the technicals here which suggest that V has fallen into short-term support levels. These are more so zones than hard lines in the sand. Visa broke out to new highs from $165 in June and this dip merely revisits the neckline. Often, the bulls need to test the footing from which they broke out before they set higher highs.Albeit, this retest materialized too fast and too deep for this to be a clear bottom but it's worth a shot. Nevertheless, I think that in the long run, buying V stock at these levels should reward investors.   MasterCard (MA)Source: Shutterstock MA stock is in a similar boat as Visa. They trade in lockstep. And after setting highs recently, MasterCard stock also fell almost 5% on Monday. Valuations for both of these stocks are similar as they both trade near a 40 trailing price-to-earnings ratio.This is not cheap in absolute terms since it's about double that of Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). But this has always been the case. These are growth stocks that are proven winners and I doubt that a few bad headline trading days will change that fact.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now MA stock also has fallen into its support band centered around $245 per share. This too is more of a zone than a hard line in the sand. And since they don't ring bells at bottoms it is impossible to take full positions in either of these two and be confident of short-term wins. But for the long term, I bet that owning MA at these levels will be profitable -- especially for patient investors. Square (SQ)Source: Shutterstock SQ stock is lagging our other two fintech stocks year-to-date. This last earnings report caused a bit of enthusiasm going into it. But sadly for the bulls the trade was to sell-the-news after buying the rumor.The SQ $83 per share remains a tough failure level to watch for the next big trigger long. But now it has fallen into support. Square stock has almost priced out the entire June rally so the bears have had their way with it. This brings price back into a pivot level. Those tend to be supportive because the bull and bears would want to fight it out hard again. This creates congestion and an opportunity for the SQ stock bulls to buy it and restart a rally.Fundamentally, SQ stock is the most expensive of the three fintech stocks from a P/E perspective since it still loses money. But it sells at nine times sales and that's half V or MA. Regardless, SQ is still the new kid on the block so it's supposed to spend more to grow into its valuation.Of the three fintech stocks, I consider going long V or MA a conviction buy trade versus SQ more of a speculative one.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-08-06	2019-08-06 10:13:39	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	3 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks To Catch On Tariff Dip	It’s not pretty. The markets are a sea of red right now. Sparking the selloff was a particularly ‘nasty’ turn in the ongoing trade war. For the first time in a decade, the Chinese government devalued the yuan to fall below its 7-to-1 ratio with the US dollar. President Trump described Monday’s devaluation as a &quot;major violation.” At the same time China announced its companies have paused purchases of US agricultural goods. In response the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its worst day of the year on Monday, closing down 767 points. Meanwhile the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is now staring at its longest losing streak since November 2016. And the S&P 500 has not fared much better- it’s currently down 5% following President Trump’s tariff tweet last week. &quot;Trade talks are continuing, and during the talks the U.S. will start, on September 1st, putting a small additional tariff of 10% on the remaining 300 billion dollars of products coming from China into our country,&quot; Trump tweeted on August 1- bringing a sharp end to the brief ceasefire between the two countries. However even in these troubled times, there are still stocks that are worth buying on the dip. Indeed, until now stocks have rallied strongly for much of 2019- and so now is an opportunity to find top names at more attractive prices. Let’s not forget that the Dow has still gained over 10% this year, while the S&P is up 13.5%. Here we searched for stocks with a notably bullish outlook from the Street, and strong growth prospects ahead. As you will see all three of these stocks show a firm ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus right now based on the last three months of analyst ratings. Let’s take a closer look now:  Alibaba (BABA)Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba may not be the first stock you think of buying when tariff tensions flare up. However now is actually the best time to buy. That’s the message from investment firm Jefferies- which has just initiated coverage of BABA with a buy rating. According to the firm's Thomas Chong, the trade war means market expectations on the Chinese internet sector have now sufficiently reset to make stocks like Alibaba and Tencent (TCEHY) look compelling. Indeed, Alibaba plunged 4.55% on August 5, and is now trading down 13% in the last five days.“Strong cash cow marketplace model with huge potential In FY20, we estimate Alibaba revenue to grow 35% YoY to RMB510bn, within which its core marketplace grows 26% YoY to RMB262bn (51% of total revenue). Backed by data insights and high return on investment marketing tools, we expect paid clicks growth to be driven by improving conversion rate supported by an increasing number of paying merchants” explained the firm.But it’s not just Jefferies taking a resolutely bullish approach to BABA right now. In the last three months, the stock has received 17 back-to-back buy ratings from the Street. That’s with an average price target of $220- which from current levels indicates sizable upside potential of over 40%. Mastercard (MA)Now is a great opportunity to snap up a classic stock holding like Mastercard. Even though the stock still shows year-to-date gains of 36%, in the last five days prices have pulled back 9%. And on August 5, MA dropped 4.66%- making it one of the worst-affected mega cap stocks.That’s despite the company reporting stellar results just one week ago. MA delivered another solid quarter, fueled by better-than-expected volume growth, expense management, new partnership signings, and progress across its growth initiatives. “Overall, the quarter's results reaffirm our thesis that MA can continue to generate mid-teens compound annual earnings growth, and we expect shares to continue to outperform” wrote Nomura’s Bill Carcache post-report. As a result, the analyst hiked his price target from $282 all the way to $324 (26% upside potential). Like with BABA, analysts are almost unanimously bullish on the stock’s outlook. Indeed in the last three months we are looking at 11 buy ratings vs just one hold rating. Meanwhile, with the recent losses now factored in, the average price target of $310 translates into considerable upside potential of 21%.  Twilio (TWLO)Cloud communications platform Twilio is currently trading down 12% in the last five days. In just the last day the stock has sold off an eyebrow-raising 7%. Nonetheless, on a year-to-date basis we are still looking at impressive gains of 39%. The company has just dealt investors another beat and raise quarter. Core Twilio revenues continued to shine (+56% y/y) and former SendGrid revenue improved (+28% y/y). Twilio snapped up leading email API platform SendGrid back in February in a transaction valued at approximately $3 billion. “We remain highly bullish in our outlook for TWLO as the recent addition of SendGrid immediately expands a portfolio for TWLO's strong sales channels” cheered top Rosenblatt Securities analyst Ryan Koontz. On August 1 he ramped FY20 revenue estimates (by +1.1%), and reiterated his TWLO buy with a $167 price target. From current levels that suggests shares can surge a further 34%. “We hold high conviction that core TWLO sales will continue to outperform however we believe the company's new Flex call center solution is likely take another year to build revenue momentum and the required complex ecosystem” the analyst told investors.

2019-07-26	2019-07-26 13:01:38	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa Stock Is Expensive, But It May Climb Higher	Visa (NYSE: V) stock is on a tear. Visa stock is up over 37% year-to-date. After the company recently beat average earnings expectations, investors continue to show high confidence in Visa's future prospects.But after this fantastic run, is Visa stock still a buy?At its current valuation levels, V stock price is elevated. But given macro factors that will be good for Visa's business over the long-term, V stock price could climb further.Is Visa stock still a buy? Should investors avoid V stock while the shares remain richly valued? Read on to learn the verdict on Visa stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Shutterstock  Strong Earnings Report Supports V StockOn July 23, Visa released its earnings for the quarter that ended on June 30. The company continues to post solid growth numbers. For the quarter, its sales came in at $5.8 billion, an 11% year-over-year increase. Adjusted earnings per share climbed 14% YoY. The growth of global card payments continues to fuel increases in its revenues.  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now For fiscal year 2019, Visa anticipates revenue growth in the low double-digit percentage levels. But what are Visa's long-term growth strategies? Is it willing to look outside the box to sustain its growth? Based on recent developments, it appears Visa can continue to grow by providing new services. Cross-Border Payments Could be Key to Long-Term GrowthVisa dominates the card payments industry, with the largest global market share outside of China. But to sustain above-average growth,  Visa needs to look to new frontiers. One area of opportunity is cross-border payments.With the launch of Visa B2B Connect, the company now offers a seamless alternative to legacy bilateral networks. Traditionally, cross-border transactions required multiple hand-offs before the funds were fully transferred. But this costly, time consuming process is not compatible with today's global business environment. B2B connect uses blockchain technology to improve transparency and reduce complexity. That streamlines the whole cross-border payment process.Along with Visa's legacy competitors, many upstarts are getting into the cross-border payments space. But unlike competitors such as Ripple's Ripplenet, Visa's B2B Connect does not use cryptocurrency for transactions. Given the high volatility of cryptocurrency, financials institutions likely prefer the stability of B2B Connect. Visa's competitor, MasterCard (NYSE: MA), could also enter this space. But so far, MasterCard has focused on specific niches within B2B global payments.After the rollout of B2B Connect, does Visa have additional opportunities that can become positive catalysts for  Visa stock? Or is all the growth from the initiative already reflected in V stock price? After analyzing the valuation metrics of V stock, I believe that Visa's valuation is in-line with  its peers. Valuation: Visa Stock Richly Valued, But In Line With PeersConfident in the company's strong franchise and high operating margins, investors continue to bid up the V stock price. Similar to its peers, Visa stock trades at a premium valuation. The company's shares have a forward price-earnings ratio of 34.1. The company currently trades at an enterprise value to EBITDA ratio (EV/EBITDA) of 28.Here are the current earnings multiple valuations for Visa stock's peers:MasterCard: 36.7 times forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 31.3PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL): 55.4 times forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 48.6V stock trades at a slight discount to MasterCard stock. PayPal trades at a premium to both companies. That is understandable, given investors' high confidence in PayPal's ability to disrupt the market. Even so, the earnings multiple of V stock seems excessive.While the company continues to generate above-average revenue growth and high margins, paying a high premium for Visa stock may expose investors to material losses if its outlook deteriorates. The Bottom Line: Visa Stock Is Overvalued, But the Shares Could Continue to ClimbDespite Visa stock's rich valuation, investors continue to bid up the V stock price. Global card payments continue to grow, aided by the boom in e-commerce, as well as growth in emerging markets.Visa and MasterCard have solid franchises that give them significant moats. But with a variety of legacy competitors, along with fintech upstarts, gaining traction in the space, this advantage may be threatened over the long-term.However, Visa appears equipped to handle the challenges. With its strong brand equity and infrastructure, the company has leveraged its reputation to enter new areas of growth, such as B2B Connect. As a result, Visa could deliver above-average growth over the long-term.While in the short-term Visa stock's valuation appears excessive, it may not be smart to bet against V stock. From its past performance, it's clear that investors believe the company has a wonderful business and trades at a fair price. As the company's growth continues,Visa stock will likely appreciate, with its valuation staying level. While macro factors may lead to a valuation correction down the road, I do not expect  V stock price to drop significantly.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-25	2019-07-25 13:34:15	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	4 Reasons for Investors to Take Profits on Visa Stock … For Now	Visa (NYSE:V) beat expectations on Tuesday, expectations that were relatively high to begin with. The transactions processor reported revenue of $5.8 billion for the June quarter versus analyst projections of $5.7 billion. Earnings of $1.37 per share topped the consensus forecast of $1.33 per share of Visa stock.Source: Shutterstock Revenue was up 11% year-over-year, and income grew at roughly the same pace.Yet, there's a reason shares didn't budge in response to the good news, however, even if current and would-be shareholders don't consciously realize it. As reliable as the payment middleman has been, there are too many headwinds blowing at this time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio Four stand out among them, even if none are particularly noticeable liabilities. Strong Dollar HurtsWhile it's true for chief rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) as well, and by and large, Visa has steered investors past the reality. Nevertheless, the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to year-ago levels is weighing on results. Last quarter's per-share earnings, for instance, would have been up 18% on a constant-dollar basis. As Visa increasingly looks to overseas markets for growth, the adverse impact of a strong greenback -- measured as nominal results compared to constant-dollar results -- will grow.  Click to EnlargeThe prospect of lower interest rates could help soften the blow, which admittedly hasn't become a stumbling block, yet. Neither is it a new dynamic.  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio Still, should the Fed be mistiming its plans to drag interest rates lower and ultimately set the stage for an unexpected and unintended inflation/dollar surge, Visa's nominal results are increasingly vulnerable. Overvalued at Current V Stock PriceWall Street traditionalists are fond of saying, &quot;you have to pay for quality&quot; and Visa has unarguably delivered quality results. The premium that newcomers would have to pay for that quality right now, however, is significant.As of the latest look, Visa stock is priced at 37 times its trailing per-share earnings, and nearly 29 times its projected profits.Those aren't entirely outrageous figures. They're at the upper, extreme end of the valuation range V stock has been able to sustain since 2017 though, leaving shares open to at least a modest rethinking of what Visa stock is worth. Shares are Technically OverboughtOne has to take a big step back and look at the weekly chart to realize it, but with this month's gains, the rally that's been underway since late last year has bumped into a resistance line that extends back to early 2017. Visa stock has been able to push through overbought conditions before, but hasn't proven it can push this deep into overbought territory.  Click to Enlarge Payments are Becoming a CommodityFinally, although hardly a ticking time bomb, the former underpinnings of the payment business are shifting in a way that actually doesn't favor Visa.In its infancy, digital payments middlemen like PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) were a boon for card companies like Visa and Mastercard, which were given business they might not have otherwise garnered. The advent of Square (NYSE:SQ) only expanded the use of cards rather than cash, in that it catered to small and micro-sized businesses that had previously been unable to accept card payments of any type.Technology is now being leveraged in ways that effectively circumvent the likes of Visa and Mastercard altogether. So-called peer-to-peer (P2P) payments leave traditional credit card companies entirely out of the loop.Visa has pushed back against this trend where it could apply its best leverage, introducing a business-to-business (B2B) tool that has been given a reasonably warm reception.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund Like it has on most other fronts though, the internet is democratizing payments, establishing ways to drive costs to make and receive payments to an absolute bare minimum. Looking Ahead for Visa StockThe first three concerns are more immediate; the fourth is a longer-term issue. All are working against the company and Visa stock investors, however.Still, perspective is needed. The near-term headwinds are purely transitional or situational ones that have nothing to do with Visa's performance; there's nothing the company can do to address them. As for the commoditization undertow, it will become a bigger issue, though it's a paradigm shift that will take years to fully play out. Visa will be fine in the meantime.For traders wondering when and where Visa stock may be a name to step back into, however, the $156 area would be a line in the sand to note. V stock found a floor there several times during the second quarter, and the forward-looking P/E would be a more palatable (though still premium-priced) 25x at that level.Anything less than $156 could be considered a bargain.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-24	2019-07-24 17:05:46	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Square Stock is Overvalued But Could Go Higher	Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has seen a nice boost in the past two months. Trading around $60 in early June, shares in the payment processing disruptor have soared to nearly $80 a share.Source: Shutterstock With expansion into other services, and analysts increasingly bullish on Square stock, is it time to buy?Compared to peers, SQ appears overvalued. With high expectations of growth, Square needs to deliver in order to justify its current valuation. Does Square have upside in the short term?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season Read on to see whether SQ stock is a buy today. Analysts Increasingly Bullish on SQ StockThe analyst community has become increasingly bullish on Square stock. Earlier this month, Raymond James's John Davis upgraded the stock from &quot;Underperform&quot; to &quot;Market Perform.&quot; Davis initially was bearish on the company's valuation relative to growth expectations. He believes the company could see a boost in shares if second quarter earnings beat their guidance.Argus analyst Stephen Biggar is also bullish on Square's prospects. Initiating coverage earlier this month, Biggar gave the company a &quot;Buy&quot; rating, with a price target of $94 a share. Believing the company is positioned to capitalize on the migrations of payments to mobile applications, he is highly confident the company will meet sales growth expectations.But with sales slowing down, are the analysts on point? Let's take a look at Square's first quarter earnings release, and whether results will meet guidance for the second quarter. Square's Past and Future EarningsThe company had a strong first quarter, with revenue up 43% year-over-year (YoY). However, YoY revenue growth is slowing down. In the fourth quarter of 2018, YoY sales growth was 51%. With this slight slowdown, investors may be concerned that the SQ growth story is fading out.But the company has multiple avenues to expand their presence in the business services space. Thanks to the acquisition of Weebly, Square has launched Square Online Store. This platform gives Square the opportunity to seize market share from e-commerce dynamo Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).The launch of Square Invoices is another area of growth potential. By providing payments processing, online store software, and an invoicing application, Square is now a one-stop shop for the back-end needs of small businesses.SQ's Cash App also has potential to disrupt much of PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo peer-to-peer payments business. PayPal is ahead in terms of monetizing Venmo. Venmo and competitor Zelle also have stronger projected usage going into 2022. To keep Cash App from turning into an &quot;also-ran,&quot; Square has its work cut out for them.Square announces second quarter earnings in early August. Based on guidance provided in the first quarter press release, SQ estimates YoY sales growth of 43% for the second quarter. For the full year, the company also projects revenue growth of 43% in 2019 from 2018. This is an improvement over prior guidance, which projected 41% revenue growth for the year.It is clear that Square's growth is slowing down, but the business continues to compound at a rapid clip. With high growth expectations, is the company's current valuation (high premium to peers) justified? Square Stock Pricey Compared to PeersCompared to its peers, Square stock is expensive. SQ trades at a Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio (EV/EBITDA) of 1,270. Here are the EV/EBITDA ratios for Square's competitors:PayPal: EV/EBITDA of 48Mastercard (NYSE:MA): EV/EBITDA of 31Visa (NYSE:V): EV/EBITDA of 27.8Using the EV/EBITDA metric may not be relevant in determining the company's current valuation. Square is still in growth mode, and is years away from posting high operating margins. With substantial sales growth over the coming years, once the company becomes a cash generator, SQ stock's valuation should begin to trade in line with PayPal. The question is whether this current potential upside is already reflected in the current market value of Square stock ($33.6 billion market capitalization). Bottom Line: SQ Overvalued, But Could Go HigherSquare stock's valuation is due to high investor expectations. The company's payments processing business, sometimes referred to as &quot;payments as a service&quot; (PaaS) is a game changer in processing payments for small businesses. With their expansion into back-end business services (online store and invoicing software) and peer-to-peer payments, the company is becoming a stronger competitor to PayPal and Shopify.At the current trading price (around $80 a share), SQ stock could tread water from now until the next earnings call. Failure to meet high expectations could impact the stock, causing a dip (as seen after the first quarter earnings release).Investors looking for an opportunity may find a better entry point a few weeks down the road. Long-term, Square's successful disruption of the payments space could make the stock a strong performer.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-19	2019-07-19 17:03:29	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	The Bill for Visa Stock Is Too High Ahead of Earnings	The investing public should get an idea about the performance of the payments industry as the earnings report on Visa (NYSE:V) comes out. The world's largest payments processor will report its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 23rd after the bell. However, expectations will probably run as high as Visa stock.Source: Shutterstock As of last year, Visa controlled about 61.5% of the payment network market in the United States. Consequently, the stock has moved steadily throughout the year. However, given the valuation, the market appears to have fully priced in the market share and earnings growth of V stock. Earnings and Revenue Continue to RiseFor the quarter ending on June 30th, analysts predict Visa earnings of $1.32 per share. Should this hold, that will represent a 10% increase from the same quarter last year, when profits came in at $1.20 per share. Wall Street also projects revenues of $5.7 billion, 8.8% more than the $5.24 billion the company brought in during the third quarter of 2018.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Visa stock has remained in a fortuitous position for some time. The demand for Visa's services continues to increase profits at double-digit rates as society becomes increasingly cashless. Visa Stock Is ExpensiveThose who hoped to buy on a dip have seen few opportunities. Visa stock fell along with the market, falling to a low of $121.60 per share on December 24th. Since then, it has moved steadily higher, climbing almost 50% since the Christmas Eve bottom. The current price of just over $180 per share comes very close to the all-time high on V stock.Unfortunately for new investors, the current price of Visa stock reflects this growth potential. The forward price-to-earnings ratio now exceeds 29. Wall Street believes that earnings will grow by 16.5% this year and 15.6% in 2020. Consequently, one can understand why V stock is not cheap.Visa stock appears expensive in more ways than one. Many at InvestorPlace seem to agree. Dana Blankenhorn says, &quot;it's time to take profits.&quot; Luke Lango calls it a &quot;long-term winner,&quot; but says it is &quot;not worthy of paying $180 per share.&quot; Even V stock bull Tom Taulli admitted valuations and pressure to reduce fees could undermine the case for Visa.These double-digit growth rates have existed for some time. This has helped the company fund ten straight years of dividend increases. However, the payout now stands at $1 per year. This takes the yield to only around to only 0.55%. That does not compare well to the average dividend return for the S&P 500, which currently stands at just under 1.9%.In fairness, investors seem to get what they pay for in this industry. Mastercard (NYSE:MA) trades at a forward P/E ratio of 31, a bit above Visa's multiple. However, analysts believe MA will post higher profit growth numbers than Visa.Some investors might prefer paying about 14 times forward earnings for American Express (NYSE:AXP). However, AXP stock barely exceeds 10% on profit growth. One can say the same about Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS). DFS stock trades at 8.7x forward earnings. However, Wall Street believes profit growth will fall below 10% after this year. Should I Buy Visa Stock Before Earnings?Despite the success of the company, investors should probably avoid Visa stock going into earnings. Without question, Visa runs the largest payment network. Moreover, thanks to the growing popularity of e-commerce and cashless payment options, its massive size has not precluded double-digit profit growth.However, at more than 29 times forward earnings, the current Visa stock price fully reflects both its value and growth. It will also account for the fact that the company will more than likely beat earnings.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) For those determined to invest in this industry, I would choose Visa stock, but not right now. I would urge investors to wait for a correction or a bear market for the S&P 500.

2019-07-19	2019-07-19 14:21:12	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook Stock Looks Poised to Face Tough Regulatory Headwinds	It's rare to find bipartisanship in today's polarized environment in Washington DC. But there is one issue that seems to unite the factions: the distrust of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and that's not good news for Facebook stock.Source: Shutterstock That's ironic. Keep in mind that FB continues to be quite popular with its users.  The company has also been aggressive when it comes to hiring and providing juicy salaries. In the first quarter, its headcount grew by 36% on a year-over-year basis to 37,773.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) But such things don't really matter much. Over the years, FB has been careless with users' data and privacy. And this has impacted views on FB within DC. After all, the company recently agreed to a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission regarding its privacy practices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet this week's testimony regarding FB's planned launch of the Libra cryptocurrency -- which has the backing of Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) -- is perhaps the most interesting evidence of the distrust towards FB from Washington.Here's what Democrat Congressman,Brad Sherman had to say: &quot;The most innovative thing that happened this century is when Osama bin Laden came up with the innovative idea of flying two airplanes into towers. That's the most consequential innovation, although this may do more to endanger America than even that.&quot;Yikes! Oh, and he referred to CEO Mark Zuckerberg as &quot;Zuckbucks.&quot;In the meantime, there was criticism from the other side of the aisle. For example, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Trump have expressed concerns about Libra. FB Stock and LibraDavid Marcus, who heads up the Libra project for FB, tried his best to handle the questions. He was actually fairly reasonable and understanding.  Keep in mind that Marcus said that the cryptocurrency would not be a vehicle for trading or for banking services. He added that it would also have a great deal of  transparency, helping to reduce its use in illicit activities.According to InvestorPlace.com columnist Dana Blankenhorn: &quot;The difference is that, while banks today have to police compliance at the teller's window, so to speak, Libra will make its blockchain available to police. Facebook will control neither the network, the currency, nor the reserve backing it. Its Calibra subsidiary will just be running digital wallets.&quot;Marcus also mentioned that FB would not move forward with Libra until regulators are satisfied with it.  In other words, he did demonstrate some finesse.It's difficult to predict what may ultimately happen to Libra. But given the pushback in Congress, I think the future of Libra does look dicey. Interestingly enough, the value of bitcoin has plunged recently, going from $13,000 to $9,800. The decline  indicates that investors are skeptical about Libra's future. The Bottom Line on Facebook StockThe success or failure of Libra probably does not mean a lot to FB and FB stock.  Rather, the hearings point to the ominous fact that FB does face serious political headwinds.FB's current problems with Washington look similar to those of  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) back in the 1990s, when the company came under pressure from antitrust regulators. In fact, the parallels are eerie. Both Bill Gates and Zuckerberg started their technology companies while at Harvard and subsequently cashed in on huge opportunities. Essentially, they ruthlessly created extremely powerful platforms and ecosystems which would be nearly impossible to destroy.MSFT  become an easy target. There were many companies that wanted to take it down to even the tech  playing field. As a result, MSFT had to focus more and more time and resources on battling regulators. This ultimately led to the company losing its momentum and dominance, until the past couple years.I could easily envision FB suffering a similar fate. The company has become a convenient punching bag - and for good reason.I'm not  implying that things will suddenly come undone for FB. For the most part, the company appears to be running on all cylinders. But in the years to come, it would not be surprising to see FB face more problems, making it tougher to be bullish about the long-term outlook of FB stock.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-07-17	2019-07-17 02:54:25	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa Invests in Go-Jek to Push Digital Payments in Southeast Asia	(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc. has become the latest investor in ride-hailing giant Go-Jek as the two companies push digital payments across Southeast Asia.The world’s biggest payments network has invested an undisclosed amount in Go-Jek as part of the Indonesian company’s ongoing series F fundraising round, the two companies said Wednesday. The move follows Go-Jek’s announcement this month it had secured funding from Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank Plc, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsubishi UFJ Lease & Finance Co. The terms of that deal were also not disclosed.Go-Jek, which debuted its app for hailing motorbike taxis in Jakarta in 2015, is expanding beyond Indonesia to cater to consumers across Southeast Asia, building an all-purpose consumer app similar to Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat in China. It’s valued at $10 billion according to CB Insights, and hosts more than 20 on-demand services on its platform from food delivery to digital payments.The two companies have “a shared goal to bring formal financial services to the unbanked and underserved, including micro, small and medium businesses,” Visa Regional President Asia Pacific Chris Clark said in a statement. “We will explore ways to leverage the power of Go-Jek and Visa’s networks to expand financial access in Southeast Asia.”Visa and Mastercard Inc. have teamed up with mobile startups in Southeast Asia in recent years, where the vast majority of transactions are still cash-based and the pace of adoption of digital payments is slow. Mastercard has partnered with Go-Jek rival Grab, while Visa has announced a partnership with gaming accessories maker Razer Inc.To contact the reporter on this story: Yoolim Lee in Singapore at yoolim@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-invests-jek-push-digital-025425849.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-16	2019-07-16 14:10:28	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard and Visa Following Parallel Paths to Success	Few industries drip money as copiously as the credit card industry. Card issuers make money on both ends of every transaction – from fees and interest charges to the customer, as well as to the merchant. It’s a business model that has propelled both Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) to the top of the financial world, as leaders in the electronic transaction and payment processing segment.The two companies have other factors in common. Both report earnings this month, Visa on July 23 and Mastercard one week later, and both are expected to show notable gains. Last month, both companies were announced as founding members of Facebook’s (FB) Libra Association, indicating their joint interest in staying on top of developments in online transaction, and an indication of their corporate view toward P2P services and cryptocurrency.There is another commonality: both stocks have attracted attention from the same top analysts in the TipRanks database. Five-star analysts Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank and Moshe Katri of Wedbush published notes on both companies, and raised their price targets based on their common upbeat outlook for the stocks. Let’s see what they had to say. Mastercard, Inc. (MA)Start with Mastercard. While the logo is ubiquitous on charge cards worldwide, Mastercard does not actually issue them itself. In this, it shares another similarity with Visa. Both companies permit their branding on cards issued by banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions, and then process the payments and transactions between card holders at point of purchase and the merchant.Katri was first to weigh in on Mastercard, writing on June 13, “expect results to benefit from strong secular growth tailwinds, as well as from accelerated, ongoing monetization efforts. MasterCard generates roughly 15% of revenues from non-transaction processing, services, and expect the mix to expand further as some of the new growth areas gain scale/traction.” In short, Katri expects that emerging non-card, online payment systems will form an increasing portion Mastercard’s business as the company adapts to the changing conditions of the app-based online world. In line with his expectation of the company’s success, Katri raised his price target on MA by 10% to $287, indicative of a modest 2.73% upside to the stock.Bryan Keane published his note on the charge card companies earlier this month, taking especial note of both companies’ participation in Libra. Of Mastercard, he believes that, while new transaction models will continue build, the company has “a long runway to benefit from the secular growth of card-based transactions.” Like Katri, he raised his target on MA, setting it at $330. His target indicates greater confidence in Mastercard, with an 18% upside.MA Earnings HistoryMastercard will report Q2 earnings on July 30. The company is expected to show an EPS of $1.82, a strong gain of 9.6% from the year-ago quarter’s $1.66. MA has beaten the earnings forecast for the last 10 quarters.Overall, Mastercard has a strong buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 20 buys and 1 hold given in the past three months. Shares sell for $279, so the current average price target of $281 suggests a surprisingly modest 0.7% upside. As analysts Katri and Keane indicate, however, that price target may be too low.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see the full list of MA Analyst Ratings Visa, Inc. (V) Visa shares the branded card payment processor market space with Mastercard. It’s the larger of the two companies, with a market of $394 billion, compared to MA’s $285. Visa has the higher upside at the moment, too, but like Mastercard, it’s average price target may be too low.Turning to the details, in a July 2 note Moshe Katri focused on Visa’s participation in Libra. He notes that each member will be required to fund the new crypt to at least $10 million, but that that sum is small change for a company Visa’s size. He took closer note of the regulatory aspects and growth impact that Libra membership may offer Visa: “Regulatory bodies will be looking at Libra across multiple angles, including data privacy and security and the impact of a new currency on the global financial system. Visa is expected to benefit from a new secular growth tailwind as it gains market share in electronic payments through its involvement with Libra.” Katri added that market watchers may be overestimating how much disruption Libra will cause in the online transaction segment.With intrusive regulation and a possible flop for Libra, Katri did not change his price target on V, keeping it $187 for a 3.56% upside.Keane, on the other hand, sees greater potential benefits for Visa, both from the secular trends and participation in emerging trends like crypto. He says, “The expanding market share opportunity into new account-to-account payment flows and non-interchange-based revenue models are being underappreciated.” With this in mind, he sets a $225 price target on the stock, a 27% increase over his previous target and suggesting a 24% upside to the stock.When Visa is expected to report $1.33 EPS on July 23, in its Q1 2020 earnings call. The expectation is 10.8% higher than the year-ago quarter, and like MA, continues a trend of increasing earnings.V Earnings HistoryVisa is another strong buy, having received 13 buy ratings and 1 hold in the last three months. The stocks $185 price target suggests an upside of 2.6% to the current share price of $180. While Katri believes this is about right for the stock, Keane’s target would suggest greater room on the upside.&gt;&gt;Click Here for the full list of V Analyst RatingsVisit TipRanks’ Earnings Calendar to see which companies will be reporting in coming days.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-visa-following-parallel-paths-141028791.html?.tsrc=rss

It covers purchases from individuals (or businesses) so the bank can debit the account for the money. Any balance on the card draws interest that the bank and MA cut.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe merchant pays MA a fee for being the middleman and the banks pay MA for guaranteeing the payment until the money clears. Any balance on the card gets charged interest that the bank and the processor split.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip It's a win-win for all concerned, with the end goal that it makes it easier to spend money and access credit for the consumer. It also increases revenue for the merchants, banks and MA.And since 1966 - first known as Interbank - MA has been a major player in the industry, nationally and internationally. MA Stock Adapting to Expanding Cashless EconomyBut now we're in the midst of the digitization of money. A cashless world. Some stores are even experimenting with cashless stores.Remember that financial institutions have been doing things pretty much the same way for decades. Banks still make money by making loans. But now, there are neo-banks, business development corporations, and many other companies that are getting in on banks' core profit machines.So, banks have been adapting to the new world and going digital. And that's pretty complicated.MasterCard has always been a leader in the payment processing business. And now that things are becoming digital, it's all moving MA stock's way.For example, just this week, MA announced a partnership with Evolve Bank & Trust to help make it faster for workers in the gig economy to get paid. Creating a friction-less payment system where employers can pay workers with an interest-free loan for service nearly in real time would be a huge step forward for gig economy workers.And if you're worried about bitcoin or the blockchain overtaking MA, don't. Mastercard can process tens of thousands of transactions in seconds, whereas blockchain takes much longer because of its structure. It will be a valuable tool in payment processing platforms, but not on the transaction end.This is the reason MA stock continues its success. In the past three years, MA stock is up 193%. Year to date, it's up 50% and we've just reached the halfway mark.My Portfolio Grader gives MA stock a B at this point, mainly because the economy is giving off mixed signals here and lower interest rates may slow its pace of growth. But it will certainly continue to grow well into the future.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

Marketwatch, for instance, still counts 39 analysts on the Visa stock beat.  Click to Enlarge Source: Shutterstock Of that number 30 have it rated a buy, and only one has it as low as an underweight on valuation. This despite Visa being up 31% in the first half of 2019.It's extraordinary faith for a company that now has a market cap of $406 billion on $20.6 billion in 2018 revenue. Expectations are for earnings of $1.33 per share when it reports July 23, with a &quot;whisper number&quot; of $1.37 per share, on revenue of $5.7 billion.  The price to earnings ratio for the last four quarters is over 37.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmong transaction processors, high valuations aren't unusual, but this is extreme.

Square (NASDAQ:SQ) is worth $34 billion on 2018 revenue of $3.3 billion.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy  The Bull Case for Visa StockWhat the bulls see is the end of cash and its replacement by Visa's payment system. They also see a company with a net margin of  50%. Last year $10.3 billion of its $19.9 billion of revenue hit the net income line.Bulls say Visa continues to innovate with Visa B2B Connect, a business payment system enabling seamless payment connections between international banks.They like its purchase of privately-held Verifi, for an undisclosed price, as a way to help merchants reduce chargebacks.They love a pilot program that will let merchants offer installment payments directly from their cash registers. They're even cheering the $75 million purchase of Rambus' token and smart-ticketing business, even though that business cost Rambus itself $105 million two years ago.Quite simply, analysts believe Visa stock is unstoppable. Because its bank payment network is used by so many third-party processors, innovations that fail outside it can succeed inside it. When Visa tells other processors to jump, they still drop what they're doing to ask, &quot;How high?&quot; Visa Stock Has Real RisksThe risks with Visa are those of the global economy.This means the risks are rising. The global economy is now growing at just 2.6% per year, and the World Bank says risks are firmly on the downside. China's growth has slumped to an annual rate of 6.2% and the trade war continues to bite.Even if electronic payments are taking an ever-bigger piece of that pie, processors like Visa remain under threat on pricing and costs. India's Unified Payments Interface offers lower costs in order to reduce the use of cash there. Chinese systems like Alipay from Alibaba Group Holding (NASDAQ:BABA) cost less, too.  Nationalism is also increasing. India won't let processors take customer data outside the country.Visa is trying to get ahead of low-cost systems by joining Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Libra Association, but it still has enormous technology debt. Visa runs an incredibly costly network of charge agreements among banks, merchants and customers that has developed over decades and costs money to maintain. The Bottom Line on Visa StockVisa is the premier player in the global payments space, but does that make it a great investment at its current price?Square costs just 10 times revenue, and it's growing much faster. True, Square is only marginally profitable, while Visa is a profit-making machine, still growing at 10% per year. Visa looks safer.If you got into Visa as an income investor five years ago, when it was paying a dividend of nearly $2 per share on an investment of $63, your current yield is just 1.5%. It might be time to take some profits and invest them for a higher yield. Even younger investors might start looking for a good exit point. A profit is only paper until the cash is in your hand.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-15	2019-07-15 15:56:37	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook's Crypto Plan Unites Trump and Democrats in Disdain	(Bloomberg) -- It’s long seemed that nothing could unite President Donald Trump and Democrats on Capitol Hill. Then Facebook Inc. decided to create a cryptocurrency.Washington’s bipartisan distrust of the social-networking giant will be on display this week as it defends the digital-money proposal in two congressional hearings. In a sign that the testimony is likely to be an ordeal for Facebook, Trump took to Twitter on Thursday to bash the effort.The presidential lashing was just the latest setback for Facebook, which rolled out its plan for a token called Libra in June –- a move that many policy makers called hubristic and ill-timed, considering the political turmoil that continues to swirl around the company. Last week, Facebook agreed to pay about $5 billion in a record privacy settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.Facebook’s traditional pre-hearing courtesy visits to discuss Libra in the House and Senate aren’t going well, according to interviews with lawmakers and congressional staff. While the company has taken pains to describe its initiative in utopian and futuristic terms, lawmakers have been more interested in data security, the company’s awesome market power and why it decided to base the operation outside the U.S.Facebook’s Libra Crypto Coin: 5 Things We Know, and 5 We Don’t“Look at their arrogance, look at their role in the 2016 presidential campaign, look at the fact that they’ve rarely shown any contrition on much of anything,’’ Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the Banking Committee’s top Democrat, said in an interview. “There’s going to be a group of us that’s going to demand some real information.’’Complaints about Libra haven’t just come from politicians. Trump-appointed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers last week he has “serious concerns’’ about the token and cast doubt on Facebook’s timeline for launching it by next year. He also warned that the U.S. regulatory system may not be equipped to handle the enormous digital payment system envisioned by Facebook, which has more than 2 billion users.Democrats, including Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters of California, have already demanded that the company put its plans on hold while Congress investigates. Republicans, though less vocal, also haven’t been supportive.Power to DominateThe controversy around the project, however unwanted by Facebook, nevertheless highlights the company’s power to dominate policy debates and, to some extent, set the agenda in Washington. Until Facebook jumped in a few weeks ago, cryptocurrency was more of a fringe issue that attracted an unusual crowd of libertarians, speculators and blockchain geeks. Many in Congress were uninterested.The stakes are high for both Facebook and the broader digital coin industry as David Marcus, a top executive at the company, prepares to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.In his prepared remarks, released by the Senate panel Monday, Marcus acknowledged the extensive criticism and pledged to work closely with regulators and governments across the globe. He also addressed one of Washington’s top concerns, saying Libra isn’t intended to compete with national currencies or interfere with central banks on monetary policy. “We know we need to take the time to get this right,” Marcus said in the testimony. “And I want to be clear: Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.”Existing LawsMarcus, whose preparation has included a mock hearing, also told the senators that while Facebook has spearheaded the Libra project, it’s not acting alone. The company has said that it envisions a governing body that would include at least 100 organizations. There are currently 28 listed as founders for the Libra Association, although none has paid the $10 million entrance fee.Libra, he added, will help consumers across the world transfer money much more efficiently and cheaply. And, Marcus warned that if “we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different.” Though he didn’t offer specifics, the People’s Bank of China has already said it’s developing a digital currency.Facebook has been making similar arguments in briefings with lawmakers and congressional aides, according to interviews. The major companies that have partnered with Facebook on the project, including Mastercard Inc., Visa Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., have been mostly silent about Libra and largely absent from the lobbying effort.Few details on Libra have been disclosed beyond a 12-page white paper issued in June, which said Libra will be built on a new blockchain infrastructure accessible from anywhere in the world. Facebook and its partners have set up a non-profit organization in Switzerland to oversee the payment network. The token will be backed by a reserve of bank deposits and short-term government securities.Trump, in his tweets last week, said he’s “not a fan” of digital coins in general because of their potential use in criminal activity. As for Libra, Trump wrote that it “will have little standing or dependability.” He added that if Facebook really wanted to get into finance it should become a bank -- and be regulated like one.Though the price of Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies has gained on the surge in mainstream interest in the concept, a number of competing digital coin companies are distancing themselves from Facebook. Some industry groups are also conducting briefings for congressional staff, pointing out that Facebook’s plan is light on details and not necessarily representative of all tokens.Libra is more of a “company-issued asset” rather than than a true cyptocurrency like Bitcoin, said Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito, who’s been involved in some of the meetings on Capitol Hill. A key complaint among purists has been that Libra isn’t decentralized. “There is no company that issues Bitcoin,” Brito added.$5 Billion SettlementBlockchain Association Director Kristin Smith, whose group represents several large crypto companies, said she’s generally not opposed to Facebook’s entrance into the market. She acknowledged, however, that there’s a lot of potential risk.“It’s mixed,” she said. “We certainly don’t want the whole industry to become associated with some of the issues that Facebook has had as a company in the past.’’Along with complaints that it allowed Russia to hijack its platform to support Trump’s election campaign, the company has also drawn fire for numerous consumer privacy breaches. The $5 billion FTC settlement, which still needs final approval from the U.S. Department of Justice, resolves an investigation stemming from Facebook’s involvement with Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica.Need to ClarifySmith attended a news conference at the Capitol last week with four moderate Democratic and Republican members of the House who are strongly supportive of the financial technology industry. They, too, weren’t leaping to endorse the Libra project.Representative Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat who sits on the financial services panel, said at the event that he hopes the focus on Facebook’s proposal will prompt lawmakers to consider legislation that clarifies the regulatory landscape. Some of the laws governing digital currency, he noted, go back to the 1930s.“We have to have the conversation,’’ he said. “I don’t want to lose the jobs and innovation elsewhere.’’Gottheimer plans to strike a similar theme at the Facebook hearing this week, but it’s not clear how many other members of the House panel will be interested in the finer details of Libra or digital payments.Some lawmakers predicted that the hearing may quickly devolve into a series of anti-Facebook rants, on issues like fake news in the 2016 campaign, data protection, the company’s market dominance and the FTC settlement. Those topics are often easier to understand for some members of Congress who are decidedly not techies.In what may be a harbinger, Financial Services Committee member David Scott, a Georgia Democrat, mistakenly referred to the digital token Libra as Libor, an interbank lending rate, while questioning the Powell last week. The Fed chief didn’t bother to correct him.(Updates with Marcus testimony beginning in 10th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Lydia Beyoud, Austin Weinstein and Julie Verhage.To contact the reporters on this story: Robert Schmidt in Washington at rschmidt5@bloomberg.net;Ben Bain in Washington at bbain2@bloomberg.net;Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net, Gregory MottFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebooks-crypto-plan-unites-trump-155637961.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-12	2019-07-12 21:17:20	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	10 Stocks Driving the Market to All-Time Highs (And Why)	Seven months ago, global financial markets were in disarray. Rates were rushing higher as the Federal Reserve was tightening monetary policy against the backdrop of record-high corporate debt levels and slowing economic expansion. Trade tensions were running high. The yield curve had inverted. Recession fears were everywhere. Stocks were in free fall. The S&P 500 dropped 20% in a matter of months, and dipped below 2,350.Today, everything has changed.The Fed has considered going into rate-cut mode. Economic expansion globally has stabilized. Trade tensions have cooled. The all-important 10-2 spread on the yield curve remains positive. Recession fears have disappeared. Stocks are in rally mode. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up almost 21%, and for the first time ever in early July, the index peaked above 3,000.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat's a long and impressive journey from the 2,350 low on Christmas Eve 2018. It's worth taking a closer look at to understand just exactly what is going to happen to stocks going forward.One way to take a closer look: examine the stocks driving this big market rally, and see if they have sufficient firepower to keep the rally alive for the next several months. * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond With that in mind, let's take a look at 10 $100 billion-plus market cap stocks which are all up more than 35% year-to-date, and see where these red hot large cap stocks are going next. Hot Stocks Driving The Market Higher: Facebook (FB)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $575 BillionYTD Gain: 49.8%How It Got Here: Social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shook off data privacy concerns in 2019, and it reported continued robust user and digital ad revenue growth. At the same time, margins are starting to stabilize as big initial investments in data security are phasing out. Facebook is also pivoting into commerce, and in so doing, unlocking an entirely new revenue stream which could potentially become as big as the digital ad revenue stream. Net net, the growth narrative here has improved dramatically in 2019, and in response, FB stock has rallied around 50% year-to-date.Where It's Going Next: Facebook stock will stay in rally mode for the foreseeable future. The valuation remains reasonable at 22 times forward earnings for what is projected as 20%-plus revenue growth over the next several years. Further, the commerce growth catalyst has yet to even materialize, and won't until 2020. Ahead of that catalyst -- which is arguably the biggest catalyst for this stock ever -- investors will continue to bid up FB stock to much more aggressive valuation levels. Mastercard (MA)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $280 BillionYTD Gain: 49.2%How It Got Here: Payments processing giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has surged 49% higher so far in 2019 thanks to a more favorable economic backdrop powering continued strong volume, revenue and profit growth. Specifically, as rates have gone down and U.S. consumer confidence has rebounded, consumer spending has picked up. As that has happened, Mastercard's volume and revenue growth rates have likewise rebounded. At the same time, management has exercised disciplined cost control, margins have expanded and profit growth has remained robust. This has powered MA stock to new highs. * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown Where It's Going Next: MA stock should head higher from here into the end of 2019. That's mostly because the consumer economic backdrop (low rates, low unemployment, big wage gains, etc) lends itself to continued robust volume, revenue, and profit growth at Mastercard. But gains going forward should also be more muted, thanks to what has become a stretched valuation. It sits at 36.5 times forward earnings, versus a five-year average forward multiple of 26.3. Thus, while MA stock will stay in rally mode, future gains will be muted relative to historical gains. PayPal (PYPL)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $141 BillionYTD Gain: 42%How It Got Here: Alongside Mastercard, peer payments processor PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has also risen more than 40% in 2019 on the back of favorable economic fundamentals and growth trends. Broadly speaking, low rates and a strong labor market have supported strong consumer spending over the past several quarters. A bunch of that spend is being directed into the online channel thanks to the secular shift towards e-commerce. Of that online consumer spending pie, a healthy portion is being processed through PayPal. The platform's volume, account and revenue growth rates have consequently remained robust. Profit growth has similarly remained robust, and that sustained growth has pushed PYPL stock to new highs in 2019.Where It's Going Next: Much like MA stock, PYPL stock should head higher into the end of 2019, but at a more muted pace. Growth trends here should remain favorable thanks to the supportive consumer economic backdrop. But, valuation is also extended, at 40-times forward earnings, versus a five-year average forward multiple of 29. Thus, valuation and growth will be in a tug-of-war over the next several months, and that ultimately means that PYPL stock will grind higher at a tepid pace. Netflix (NFLX)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $164 BillionYTD Gain: 47%How It Got Here: Another large-cap winner in 2019 has been streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). NFLX stock is up more than 40% year-to-date on the back of three things. One, the over-the-top (OTT) streaming growth narrative has remained vigorous in 2019. Consumers globally continue to pivot into the OTT channel. Two, Netflix has continued to develop quality original content with high perceived value. That strong original content portfolio has enabled Netflix to continue to win over the lion's share of global OTT subs. And three, the economics continue to grow more favorable as more subscribers join the platform. NFLX stock margins are marching higher, powering doubly robust profit growth. * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019 Where It's Going Next: The three tailwinds which have driven big gains in NFLX stock year-to-date, should persist into the back half of the year. That should keep NFLX stock on a winning trajectory. The global OTT sub market will continue to grow. Netflix will maintain its market leadership position thanks to its original content portfolio. And margins will stay on an uptrend as scale drives positive operating leverage. Valuation will become more of an issue in the back half of the year, but the growth potential for NFLX stock is so big long-term that, with rates depressed, it should continue to run higher for the foreseeable future regardless of near-term valuation friction. Lockheed Martin (LMT)Market Cap: $104 BillionYTD Gain: 41%How It Got Here: For shares of global aerospace and defense giant Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), 2019 has been year of steady and consistent gains. LMT stock has benefited from cooling U.S.-China trade tensions, stabilizing global growth trends, continued robust government defense spending, a few sizable contract wins, strong quarterly numbers, a healthy full-year 2019 guide and a plunge in fixed-income yields. That last has made the 2.3% yield on LMT stock that much more attractive.Where It's Going Next: LMT stock should be able to head higher in the back half of 2019, mostly because all of those aforementioned tailwinds will remain in play. But the magnitude of the gains will be substantially lower than what the stock experienced in the first half. That's mostly because the yield and forward earnings multiple are now back to historically normal levels, so further upside through multiple expansion is unlikely. Starbucks (SBUX)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $108 BillionYTD Gain: 41%How It Got Here: Global coffee retail giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has rallied to all-time highs in 2019 for three big reasons. First, the China growth narrative has gained momentum as China's economy has shown signs of stabilizing in 2019. Second, the U.S. growth narrative is rebounding thanks to improving traffic trends. Third, margins have remained relatively stable on improving top-line trends. Put together, those three factors have sparked a 41% year-to-date rally in SBUX stock. * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half Where It's Going Next: It's tough to see SBUX stock rallying much further from here. Growth trends still aren't great. Traffic trends have been largely negative for several quarters, and remain negative today, implying that indie coffee shop competition is continuing to pressure Starbucks. Further, margins aren't moving higher. They are just flat. Thus, you have a slowing-top-line-growth company with flattish margins. That's not a great growth profile. But, at an above-average 29-times forward multiple, SBUX stock is priced for great growth. This discrepancy could ultimately short-circuit the big 2019 rally in SBUX stock. Citigroup (C)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $166 BillionYTD Gain: 39%How It Got Here: Although a flat yield curve and low rates typically aren't good things for bank stocks, shares of major U.S. bank Citigroup (NYSE:C) have nonetheless rallied in a big way (up 39% year-to-date) due to a flurry of other tailwinds. Namely, consumer confidence and spending have both remained healthy in the U.S. Citigroup's numbers have consequently remained healthy. C stock also passed the most recent stress test, and in response, hiked its dividend, which now seems especially attractive next to a depressed 10-Year Treasury yield.Where It's Going Next: It's tough to see Citigroup stock rallying much further into the end of 2019. The valuation is at historically normal levels, while growth trends going forward should be below-normal given low interest rates and a flattish yield curve. A rate cut will help the yield curve situation, some, but not enough to give C stock more firepower. As such, it looks like the best of the Citi rally may be over. Visa (V)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $392 BillionYTD Gain: 37%How It Got Here: The third payments stock on this list is Visa (NYSE:V). Much like the other two payment stocks, Visa finds itself up big year-to-date because of favorable market conditions and growth trends. Low rates and continued strong consumer economic conditions have led to sustained strong consumer spending. At the same time, the pivot to non-cash transactions has gained momentum, so most of this consumer spending is happening through card transactions. The king of card transactions? Visa. As such, Visa's numbers in the first half of 2019 have been really good from a volume growth and margin expansion perspective. Those really good numbers have propelled Visa stock higher. * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 Where It's Going Next: At the risk of sounding like a broken record, Visa stock's go-forward growth prospects are nearly identical to those of the other two payments stocks on this list. That is to say, the stock will stay on an uptrend into the end of the year because the underlying growth trends will remain favorable. But, the slope of that uptrend will flatten out because Visa stock is already priced for greatness -- 29 times forward earnings, versus a five-year average forward multiple of 25). Microsoft (MSFT)Source: Shutterstock Market Cap: $1.06 TrillionYTD Gain: 38%How It Got Here: Technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has surged 38% higher in 2019 -- and shot to a market cap above $1 trillion -- because the company's core cloud businesses have bounced back in a big way. Ever since Satya Nadella took over the reins in 2014, Microsoft's growth narrative has been all about developing and scaling cloud solutions. Those cloud solutions have been on a secular uptrend ever since. So has MSFT stock. But cloud growth rates dropped in late 2018 as macroeconomic uncertainty weighed on global cloud capex, and depressed Microsoft cloud demand. That uncertainty didn't last very long. By early 2019, as trade tensions cooled and global economic trends stabilized, cloud capex accelerated higher. So did Microsoft's cloud businesses. That growth re-acceleration has driven MSFT stock substantially higher year-to-date.Where It's Going Next: MSFT stock will stay on a healthy medium-to-long-term uptrend so long as the company's cloud businesses continue to grow at robust rate. For the foreseeable future, this is exactly how things should play out. Robust cloud spend is supported by multiple tailwinds, ranging from the fact the data is only becoming more valuable and more abundant, to the fact that global economic conditions are improving. Low rates will also help support what has become a stretched valuation in MSFT stock. As such, Microsoft's cloud businesses project to remain healthy in the back half of 2019. Thus, MSFT stock projects to keep moving higher. Adobe (ADBE)Market Cap: $150 BillionYTD Gain: 38%How It Got Here: Cloud giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has soared 38% higher in 2019 as strong numbers have reaffirmed the company's secular growth narrative, against the backdrop of a low rate environment which has supported a richer valuation for ADBE stock. On the first point, Adobe is a visual cloud giant positioned for huge growth as: 1) consumers and enterprises continue to adopt cloud solutions, and 2) consumer and enterprise interactions continue to become more centered around visuals than ever before. Adobe's first half 2019 numbers were very good, and supported the notion that this secular growth narrative remains on track. On the second point, a plunge in the 10-year yield from 2.8% to 2% in 2019 has helped support substantial multiple expansion for ADBE stock from 28 times, to 40 times forward earnings. * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond Where It's Going Next: ADBE stock should continue to move higher in the back half of 2019 so long as two things remain true. First, Adobe needs to keep reporting strong quarterly numbers which reaffirm the secular bull thesis. That should happen, given healthy economic conditions and strong tailwinds supporting visual cloud solution adoption. Second, rates need to remain low to support ADBE's now bigger-than-normal valuation. This, too, should happen, since the Fed appears poised to cut rates, and such cuts should keep rates depressed for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long FB, PYPL, NFLX, and ADBE.

2019-07-09	2019-07-09 12:24:20	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	3 Pros and 3 Cons of Visa Stock	It's been a decade since Visa (NYSE:V) stock went public. When the IPO of Visa stock took place, things were certainly looking bleak, as the financial crisis was deepening. Consider that the offering came a week after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) acquired Bear Stearns for a measly $2 per share (the deal also required a mega loan from the Federal Reserve).Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrDespite all that, investors still bought  $17.9 billion of V stock. On its first day of trading, V stock price rose by an impressive 28%.Anyone who bought Visa stock during its IPO and held onto it would have benefited from hefty gains. For the past ten years, the average annual return of V stock was 28.28%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 While all this is great, what can we expect in the years ahead? Is V stock still a good buy? To find out, let's take a look at three pros and cons of Visa stock: Visa Stock Pro: Dominant PlatformVisa operates the world's largest payment network, with 3.3 million cards in use across the globe. The company processes an enormous 188.1 billion transactions per year.The result is that Visa has been able to benefit from powerful network effects. That means that the more consumers become part of the system, the more attractive it is for merchants to participate in it. As a result, it is extremely difficult for other companies to effectively compete with Visa. Besides Visa, only Mastercard (NYSE:MA), American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) have credit-card networks in the U.S. Visa Stock Pro: InnovationVisa continues to invest heavily in R&D. For example, the company has built Visa Direct, which enables payments to be sent to credit cards.Then there is the company's tokens. which are used for digital payments. This technology has been shown to greatly reduce fraud, but is also quite convenient.M&A and venture-capital investments have been critical for bolstering Visa's innovation. Note that Visa has taken equity positions in companies like Square (NYSE:SQ), Klarna, Payworks, Stripe and SolarisBank. Visa Stock Pro: Strong FinancialsAs shown by the company's, second-quarter results, released in April,  Visa's growth remains fairly steady. Its revenues increased  8% to $5.5 billion, as there was strength across all its main businessesVisa's margins remain juicy, at over 54%. In Q2, its net income came in at $3 billion, up 14% year-over-year.And its balance sheet is solid. It has about $15 billion of cash. Visa Stock Con: Regulatory RiskA key part of Visa's business model is interchange fees. But for many merchants, those fees have become a costly burden. So they have lobbied in multiple countries, including the U.S., to  convince regulators to reduce the fees. If they succeed, Visa's bottom line would definitely be adversely impacted. According to the company's 10-K:&quot;When we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive. This may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems, such as our competitors' closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. We believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees, or reducing certain benefits to consumers, which make our products less appealing to consumers. Some acquirers may elect to charge higher merchant discount rates regardless of the Visa interchange reimbursement rate, causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternate payments systems or forms of payment.&quot; Visa Stock Con: CompetitionVisa faces intense competition from alternate payment providers, such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) Alipay and China's WeChat. All of those competitors have the benefit of massive digital platforms.Then there is Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which is creating a cryptocurrency that uses blockchain technology. Called Libra, FB's cryptocurrency is expected to hit the market next year, with a focus on  consumers who don't use banks. If it catches on,Visa stock price could be negatively impacted, since FB has the benefit of its 2+ billion user base. Visa Stock Con: ValuationGiven Visa's competitive advantages, Visa stock does deserve to trade at a premium. But then again, the valuation of V stock has become steep. Note that the forward price-earnings ratio of V stock is about 28  and that Visa stock does not pay a dividend. To put that into perspective, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) has a PE ratio of 21 and FB is at roughly the same level. Those companies are also growing much more quickly than Visa.As for Wall Street analysts, they remain bullish on V stock, but their enthusiasm is tempered. Based on analysts' average target price on V, Visa stock price is expected to climb about 13%. The Verdict on VisaVisa certainly has some major risk factors. Perhaps the most important one is its competition. As we've seen in various industries, startups can unleash disruption quickly.But so far, Visa has done a good job of innovating. Moreover, the overall credit-card market is likely to  grow in a non-cyclical manner. Keep in mind that, worldwide, consumers still use  cash and checks to pay for about $17 trillion of goods and services. Consequently, there's still a great deal of room for credit-card usage to increase. There are also big opportunities for Visa in business-to-business transactions and peer-to-peer payments.Given all of Visa's positive attributes - including its strong financials, robust platform and powerful technologies - the pros of V stock outweigh its cons.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-07-08	2019-07-08 09:40:21	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Telegram Cryptocurrency Offered at Triple ICO Price	(Bloomberg) -- Even before Gram is released to the public, Telegram Messenger’s cryptocurrency may have appreciated by 200% from last year, when it began one of history’s biggest ever initial coin offerings. Just ask one of the early investors.South Korea’s Gram Asia offered to sell rights to the Grams it holds at $4 apiece in a sale beginning July 10, according to Japanese crypto-exchange Liquid. This compares with $1.33 paid by private investors in the second ICO round in March 2018. The price will be lowered to $3.50 per Gram if buyers hold a specific amount of Liquid’s cryptocurrency QASH, the exchange said in emailed statement Wednesday.The fund-raising is a landmark in the crypto world not only because of its size. Telegram’s encrypted-messaging app boasts over 200 million users. The enterprise, founded by self-exiled Russian Pavel Durov, raised $1.7 billion from qualified investors last year to fund developing the Telegram Open Network blockchain, which will use the cryptocurrency Gram.Telegram has targeted a start date by the end of the third quarter 2019, before Facebook Inc.’s Libra token debuts. A company representative declined to comment.Durov aims to enable transaction speeds faster than the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains and may seek to compete with Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., according to company documents. Grams are planned to be used to pay for different services on TON blockchain, including user applications, decentralized data storage and bypassing censorship.The sale on Liquid comes at a whippy time in the markets. The 30-day volatility for the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index is 109%, the highest level since January. That compares with 5.7% for the euro-dollar, the most traded currency pair.(Corrects details of purchase mechanism in the second paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Ilya Khrennikov in Moscow at ikhrennikov@bloomberg.net;Stepan Kravchenko in Moscow at skravchenko@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rebecca Penty at rpenty@bloomberg.net, Todd White, Brendan WalshFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/telegram-cryptocurrency-offered-sale-triple-121605100.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-05	2019-07-05 15:46:28	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Does Facebook’s Libra Currency Change the Outlook of Visa Stock?	At first glance, the fact that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is developing a cryptocurrency for its 1.5 billion users has got to cause a little unease among the owners of Visa (NYSE:V) stock. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor that matter, any companies that are involved with transferring money should have a few concerns. That includes Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL).   * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 However, in this article, I'm got to look at the ramifications of FB's cryptocurrency, both good and bad, for Visa stockholders.  Why Visa Should Be Worried About LibraWhen I first read the news about Libra, my immediate thought was that companies like Visa would lose market share as individuals and corporations around the world switch to Libra to carry out transactions. But, as I read more about Libra and what it is and isn't, I realized that Visa shouldn't fear the cryptocurrency; instead, it should fear the regulators who are going to shine a big light on its systems as a result of FB's move to create a global currency for the unbanked. &quot;It is not a stretch to imagine that widespread take-up and usage of Libra could result in the coin being able to become a free-floating currency,&quot; Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette stated recently. &quot;That may turn it into a 'supranational currency beyond the control of governments and central banks,' which means there's probably going to (be) an up-swell of vocal opposition from regulators, central bankers, and lawmakers globally,' he added. So, if Visa chooses to compete with Libra, what will happen if U.S. lawmakers get a sense that the company is standing in the way of lower transaction processing costs? Or, alternatively, if it cooperates  with the cryptocurrency, will governments take out some of their frustration with FB's cryptocurrency on Visa?  The members of the Libra Association, which includes FB, Visa, and 26 other companies, have each agreed, on a non-binding basis, to commit $10 million to the association. However, because so many details about Libra have yet to be worked out, including those surrounding security and privacy, it's unlikely that the funds will be forthcoming anytime soon.     The Libra Association says it will launch in 2020. Somehow, I doubt it will be able to meet its goal.  Why Visa Has No Reason for AlarmKeep your friends close and your enemies closer. Visa is one of the founding members of the Libra Association. It's got a seat at the table. If it doesn't like where the association is headed, it can always leave or vocally complain about what's happening. I have to believe that all the payments companies are going into this with their eyes wide open. The Verge's Elizabeth Lopatto recently wrote an interesting piece about Libra that everyone should read. It goes into detail about what Libra is and isn't. It's an excellent piece. She makes the point that a company like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) could develop its own cryptocurrency. Furthermore, Lopatto and University of Virginia Assistant Professor of Media Studies Lana Swartz  noted that FB isn't trusted by most consumers. &quot;People don't trust Facebook. They do trust Starbucks. Trust is a huge part of how money works,&quot; Swartz, told me. Starbucks has a greater geographical reach in terms of branches than any bank in the world, she says. &quot;Moreover, SBUX has a heavily used payment app and some of the most sophisticated fintech in the world,&quot; The Verge's Lopatto wrote in an article published on June 26. &quot;So maybe that's the answer: Starbucks launches StarBucks, its own branded cryptocurrency, and it just massacres Libra because we like and trust Starbucks, and we don't like or trust Facebook,&quot; she stated.She's absolutely right. Starbucks is in a much better position with consumers than FB ever will be. I, for one, would like to see SBUX do something to help the unbanked. Whatever happens, I'm sure Visa's got a plan to cope with competition from SBUX and/or FB.  The Bottom Line  Whether you own Visa, Mastercard, or Paypal, I think you've got an excellent investment and should continue to hold onto the shares for the long haul.

2019-07-01	2019-07-01 18:07:20	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa, PayPal May Bear a ‘Heavy Burden’ With Facebook Crypto Plan	(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. may have boosted the single, greatest risk they face -- that of tougher regulation -- by becoming early backers for Facebook Inc.’s new digital money, called Libra.That’s according to Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette, who wrote that the three companies face a potentially “heavy burden” as already-fierce regulatory scrutiny is likely to keep growing.“It is not a stretch to imagine that widespread take-up and usage of Libra could result in the coin being able to become a free-floating currency,” Faucette said. That may turn it into a “supranational currency beyond the control of governments and central banks,” which means there’s probably going to an “up-swell of vocal opposition from regulators, central bankers, and lawmakers globally.”Mastercard and Visa face greater regulatory and political risk than technology risk, he said. As the cost of transactions fall, it will be hard to dislodge them as industry leaders -- unless there’s political or regulatory opposition. &quot;But such pushback is real,&quot; Faucette said.However, he’s still bullish on the companies, along with PayPal, as Libra isn’t yet “far enough along to dent our enthusiasm.” He also takes solace from some companies’ openness to leaving the Libra group “if opposition and process seem too daunting.”House and Senate hearings on Facebook’s digital coin, scheduled for mid-July, are “significant” for the company, and for Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe and other firms, Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg wrote in a note.“These hearings are critical for Facebook,” he said. “There is only one chance to frame the debate. It has to set a tone at these two hearings for how Libra will benefit consumers while protecting their privacy.”That’s a hard task, as the hearings will likely be hostile and most lawmakers are likely to be skeptical. “Even lawmakers who generally support crypto are likely to see little political upside in supporting Facebook’s entry into the space,” Seiberg said.To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Will DaleyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-paypal-may-bear-heavy-180720680.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-23	2019-06-23 18:00:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Banks Stay on Sidelines for Facebook Coin After Apple Pay Struggle	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. banks might be happy to stay away from Facebook Inc.’s push into cryptocurrencies. For now.The Libra Association, the governing body for the coin, is in talks with lenders around the world to join its ranks. Banks are mostly keeping their distance after seeing tepid consumer reaction to digital wallets such as Apple Pay and regulatory scrutiny of digital currencies.“If Facebook is able to create mass adoption on this platform, then banks will want in,” David Donovan, who leads the global financial-services consulting practice at Publicis Sapient, said in a phone interview. “There’s a business decision they have to make. Facebook is saying the market is not being served well.”Banks were absent when Facebook announced Libra last week, saying that more than two dozen other companies, including payment networks Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., joined the project. The social-media giant said Libra will be backed by fiat currencies to provide payment services to the 1.7 billion people worldwide without easy access to banking.Facebook and its 2.4 billion active users are hard for the largest U.S. banks to ignore -- and Citigroup Inc.’s Michael Corbat has said his firm would consider joining Libra if asked. But it’s not the first time a technology giant promised sweeping changes to the payments world.Apple Inc. introduced Apple Pay in 2014 to much fanfare. Banks spent millions promoting the service and created card rewards tied to customer use of the product. In a sign of how eager they were, banks even gave Apple a cut of the coveted interchange fees they earn from each swipe of a card.But five years in, Apple Pay has struggled to take off. Large retailers including Walmart Inc. have been hesitant to accept the technology. And while consumers spent roughly $3 trillion using digital wallets in 2018, almost two-thirds of that spending occurred in China where apps like Alipay and WeChat Pay dominate commerce, according to a report from Juniper Research.“Advanced payment methods haven’t really taken hold unless they’re mandated,” Tim Spenny, a senior vice president at market researcher Magid who has consulted for Facebook and Visa, said in an interview. For him, the question is: “What is the use case or what is the pain point that would cause people to say ‘Hey, I’m going to put money into a cryptocurrency to start paying for things.’”After years spent trying to promote Apple Pay, U.S. banks turned their attention to tap-to-pay cards, which use the same technology while keeping the familiar card product. It’s a recipe that’s worked for JPMorgan Chase & Co. customers.“There’s a big segment that never used mobile wallets, but the moment they got their contactless cards, they’re starting to tap right away,” Abeer Bhatia, president of card marketing, pricing and innovation for the bank, said in an interview last month. “When they have the choice to use either, they’re overwhelmingly using tap-to-pay.”Banks have been conducting their own experiments with cryptocurrencies, such as JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, which is meant to speed up corporate payments. The largest U.S. lenders have also promoted a new real-time payments service spearheaded by The Clearing House.Regulatory ResponseThere have been cases where startups were assessed for compliance lapses. And Libra’s debut drew attention from regulators, as members of the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee promised hearings on the digital coin and its governance.John Smith, who used to lead the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, said tech companies and the banks they work with “will be held accountable” if they violate the law.“There’s a view within the fintechs that, ‘We couldn’t possibly do the rules that big banks do because we’re trying to be quick,’” Smith, co-head of Morrison & Foerster’s national security law practice, said Friday at a conference. “There’s going to be a rude awakening.”&#92;--With assistance from Lananh Nguyen, Michelle F.

2019-06-21	2019-06-21 16:52:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Bitcoin price punches above $10,000 on CME, marking highest trade intraday in more than a year	Bitcoin prices rose solidly Friday, with futures on CME Group Inc.  trading at a level above $10,000 for the first time since in about 15 months, according to FactSet data. Bitcoin futures for June delivery  were up $375, or 3.9%, at $10,000 and had hit a peak at $10,060, which would represent the highest level for a most-active contract since March 8, 2018. On top of that, contracts months further in the future are also trading substantially higher, with the September contract  trading at $10,145, after hitting a intraday peak at $10,200. Overall, bitcoin futures  are up 174% so far this year as activity around cryptos and blockchain, the digital-ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, has grown, with cryptos drawing greater interest from large institutions and not just digital-asset enthusiasts as was the case nearly two years ago during bitcoin's last surge back to near $20,000 in December of 2017 before prices cratered to a low at around $3.194 about seven months ago. Facebook Inc. , earlier this week announced that it is rolling out a crypto-oriented global digital payment known as Libra coin, which is backed by a consortium of companies, including payment processors Mastercard Inc. , PayPal Inc.  and many others. Bitcoin's gain have outstripped those for equities and most other traditional assets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average  up nearly 15% so far in 2019, the S&P 500 index  boasting a gain of nearly 18% in the year to date and the Nasdaq Composite Index  returning 21% thus far this year. Bitcoin began trading on CME's exchange back in December of 2017, not long after Cboe Global Markets Inc.  rolled out the first bitcoin futures contract on Dec. 10, 2017. However, Cboe announced that it was abandoning its bitcoin futures efforts back in March.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b396ac3c-abba-346e-bd68-9d46728893df/bitcoin-price-punches-above.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-21	2019-06-21 14:17:04	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Square Stock Is Breaking Out and Running to $84	It's been the prevailing wisdom that bank stocks can't rally, and so I've avoided betting on their upside. But there is an interesting sliver of the sector: fintech. These are the transactor companies and I personally favor Square (NASDAQ:SQ) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). The former, SQ stock, has been my go-to upside bet for months and it's been an easy trade.Source: Via SquareThis year, SQ stock has been out of favor on Wall Street. Suddenly, it lagged all the other major fintech competitors. Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are at or near all-time highs while Square stock has been languishing miles away from its own.  * 5 Boring Stocks to Buy This Summer Nevertheless, I remain positive on the company because the bull thesis has not changed. The world is still looking to migrate their transactions online, and SQ is part of the elite group of companies that will make that happen.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRecently Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced its indirect entry into the arena with their introduction of LIBRA. This further legitimizes all electronic financial transactors. So today's point is I should stay long Square stock regardless of the short-term dips for as long as the economic variables remains the same. Why To Go Long SQ StockThe macroeconomic conditions remain strong. This is in spite of the recent rhetoric that it's deteriorating. In the end, I suspect that it's not as bad as most fear.So, I am comfortable in my assumption that this environment is likely to persist for months if not years. And within it, SQ stock is still a buy right here. Luckily I have already written about buying the May dip. I sold bull put spreads and bought calls.The spreads yielded maximum gains already expiring today in my favor. My calls are already up 64% so I am letting them run. I may sell some covered calls against them to further leverage my asset. Because I sold the put spread means that I am understating my profit because my basis cost is null. It's basically a free trade from here.I am not sharing to brag but rather to offer perspective. Today's bullish SQ stock note stands alone. It still has more upside potential than downside risk this year. Currently, Square stock is in a tough zone which has been pivotal so it will offer resistance. Onus is on the bulls to plow through, and it may take a few tries.My first target for SQ is near $84 per share. But that would only bring it back to within 15% of the all-time high. This means I may be understating my target for the stock -- so the reward is pretty darn big even after the 25% bounce from $60 per share.This is not the same as saying SQ stock cheap because it's definitely not. Visa, MasterCard and PYPL are much cheaper from the traditional sense but SQ still needs time to grow into its valuation. So comparing them purely on value is wrong.Rallies rarely unfold in one straight line so there will be rough areas. I expect resistance around $76 per share. Clearly $84 will also be a challenge but if the bulls can break through it then they could finish the primary 2019 objective of $95 per share. Trading SQ StockNow that we've looked at what's above current price we also need to watch for potential pitfalls below.Depending on risk tolerance I would probably set my first stop at $71 per share. If that's lost then it could invite sellers down to $68 then $64 per share. While this is not my forecast, it is a realistic scenario that exist below especially if the geopolitical headlines cause a market wide panic sell in the next few weeks.If for any reason equities collapse I bet that SQ would find footing around $60 per share. This has been a big pivot level for 15 months. These tend to be sticky because both bulls and bears have battle histories at them.  * The 7 Best Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 The bottom line is that Square stock had been in the penalty box for whatever reason but seems to have gotten out. It is now free to resume its prior trajectory because its products and service will be in high demand for years to come. I can even ignore the short-term dip because they are part of normal price action.

2019-06-20	2019-06-20 14:07:12	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Libra Opens New Purpose and Risks to Facebook Stock	Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is getting into the cryptocoin business with a new currency dubbed Libra, which it says will be backed by a market basket of currencies, not just pegged to the dollar. Thus far, the announcement has proven positive for some FB stock investors, while others are far more cautious. With that said, here's a look at what we can expect from FB's Libra.Source: Shutterstock In a white paper the company said its plan is to build a blockchain that can let unbanked people around the world afford banking transactions. It announced a host of banking industry allies will support it, including Visa (NYSE:V), Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Facebook is hoping for $1 billion of investment for Libra, but so far only $10 million has gone into it.Facebook stock had been shooting up since the start of June on rumors of the move, a gain of almost 16% since June 3, adding $75 billion to its market cap. Speculators sold the announcement, sending the Facebook stock price down 1% in overnight trading. FB was due to open at about $186.50 on June 19, a market cap of $538 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Why Libra?Credit card processors risk being bypassed in the developing world by blockchain and other technologies that let people trade and access banking services at low cost.  * 7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for a Noisy Market India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), for instance, handled 250 million transactions last June after the government there removed high-denomination bills from circulation. Indian transactions of under 1,000 Rupee, worth about $14.30, can now be done using UPI for the equivalent of .14 cents. Standard Visa rates are about 3 cents per transaction, and a 2.5% &quot;discount&quot; to merchants for settlement risks.People with worthless currencies in places like Zimbabwe and Venezuela have turned to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The smallest unit of bitcoin, called a Satoshi, which is 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin, is now worth about 3 Zimbabwe cents. But the cost of the bitcoin blockchain makes it difficult for the ordinary citizen to use it.The Libra dream is of a stable coin running on a low-cost, global blockchain, allowing those who can't afford banking services to access them and, eventually, replace weaker currencies. The hope is that buyers and sellers will be able to move Libra money with simple Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp messages as early as 2021. Libra CriticsThe idea of a banking system that's only regulated as a blockchain and bypasses governments has its critics. Economist Nouriel Roubini says there's nothing blockchain about Libra, calling the whole thing a pipedream.Fans of existing crypto coins aren't thrilled by Libra either. Facebook insists its Calibra wallet, which will hold the Libra currency, won't share data with its ad platform. But analysts hyping the play still see power in combining financial data with Facebook's user data.Libra includes a new transaction language called Move, a protocol called Byzantine Fault Tolerance meant to make permission-less transactions safe, and a new Libra blockchain database. The Libra Association itself is defined as a non-profit, but the payment companies, internet merchants, venture capitalists, communication companies and blockchain enthusiasts involved all hope to make billions by using Libra to conduct business outside the current banking system. The Bottom Line for FB StockTrading on Libra today is trading on hype and hope.Facebook's value remains rooted in its free ad-supported services, which continue to churn out $15 billion of revenue each quarter, one-sixth of which becomes net income.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever Facebook's value is also based on its cloud network, with four data centers, three more on the way and more cloud capacity in Singapore.FB remains the smallest and, because of its business model, the most controversial and least stable of the Cloud Czars. (The others are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google.) Its goal in getting into financial services is to diversify its asset base and create a truly global footprint of data centers.It's all highly speculative. But it's also highly innovative. If that's what you're looking for in a cloud investment, look for an entry point in Facebook stock.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

The hearing titled &quot;Examining Facebook's Proposed Digital Currency and Data Privacy Considerations,&quot; comes after a number of Congressional lawmakers a day ago demanded that Facebook , which is leading the digital-payments venture, delay its attempt to roll out the cryptocurrency by the second half of 2020 as planned, while legislators review possible risks to consumers. House Financial Services Committee head Maxine Waters on Tuesday said Facebook &quot;is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.&quot; The social-media outfit is wrestling with privacy concerns following its Cambridge Analytica scandal. On Tuesday, Facebook said: &quot;We look forward to responding to lawmakers' questions as this process moves forward.&quot; Facebook has been meeting with regulators about its cryptocurrency plans, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported that Facebook officials have met with Securities and Exchange Commission as its prepares to kick off Libra Coin with more than two dozen partners, including payment company PayPal Inc. [sL PYPL], ride-hailing apps Uber Technologies Inc.  and Lyft Inc. , as well as credit card company Mastercard Inc.  among many others. Many view this crypto as a powerful way for Facebook to tap into its 2.5 billion monthly active users. Libra coin won't be owned by Facebook and will be governed by a consortium of qualified global partners, with the intention of creating an independent payment system that has the benefits of the immutable ledger technology behind cryptos but none of the price vagaries of bitcoin  because the digital asset will be pegged to a basket of fiat currencies like the dollar  and euro , for example. Facebook's shares finished 0.5% lower on Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index  and the Nasdaq Composite Index  all finished in the session in positive territory.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/92baf44f-1d7a-3053-898e-9f2dced6cc22/senate-banking-committee-sets.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-19	2019-06-19 17:52:40	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Wall Street Sees Big Promise in Facebook Coin, With a Lot of Ifs	(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.’s bid to create a new cryptocurrency has the potential to some day disrupt the global money system, analysts say. That’s if the new stablecoin, called Libra, can gain enough traction. In the meantime, they say, the plan probably means little for existing payments companies, like Mastercard Inc., Visa Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. -- which are all partners with Facebook.Shares of Mastercard, Visa and PayPal were mixed in mid-day Wednesday trading, ahead of the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. Facebook was down as much as 2.1%.Here’s a sample of the latest commentary about the new cryptocurrency:Cowen, George Mihalos, Jaret Seiberg“If successful – if – it could be very disruptive to the legacy interchange model developed by the networks and banks,” Cowen analysts wrote in a note. Libra may also be “price-eroding to processors,” and serve as a “shot across the bow to money remittance firms.”Their expectations aren’t all bad for existing financial firms. Libra offers potential to bring “new money” into the digital payments ecosystem, they said, which would add to the value stored in digital wallets, like PayPal’s. That may lead to greater account adoption and transaction growth, though costs will probably come under pressure, as “Libra will in many ways be akin to using cash.”They also warned that politics pose a risk to Facebook, with Congress likely to hold hearings in the next few months. “Washington has the power to end Libra and any other cryptocurrency,” they said, by denying access to the banking system, making converting the currency to cash impossible. Congress may also adopt legislation that imposes onerous anti-money laundering and public audit requirements.MoffettNathanson, Lisa EllisThe announcement may be “most important for the cryptocurrency world,” and less so for payments companies, Ellis wrote in a note after discussing the plan with Visa, Mastercard and PayPal. “The cryptocurrency ecosystem may finally have a crypto-based system that – in design, at least – meets the major criteria required to make it functional for payments.”Libra has passed Visa, Mastercard and PayPal’s litmus tests, she said. They “see enough potential in the system to have raised their hands to participate – the first significant endorsement of the viability of cryptocurrencies from the incumbent payment ecosystem.”Citi, Ronit GhoseLibra “could be a big thing,” as the “support of Facebook and other internationally active partners will provide at minimum, a lot of public exposure to stablecoins and specifically to the Libra project.”Citi questions how regulators will respond to Libra.“For instance, Japan and Singapore consider coins pegged to a legal fiat as e-money,” while China, India and Indonesia ban dealing in virtual currencies, and Libra might fall under the SEC’s purview in the U.S. “The creation of ‘private money,’ even if fiat-linked, will raise a lot of political and regulatory debate.”Morgan Stanley, Brian Nowak, Betsy Graseck, James FaucetteMorgan Stanley analysts see little threat Libra will disrupt current global payment networks, noting Visa and Mastercard have “significant scale advantage, mature fraud detection capabilities and low cost structure.”They ask whether facilitating cross-border payments -- the only thing that’s not already present in today’s real-time banking system -- will be enough to differentiate Libra from other services, including Zelle and PayPal’s Venmo. They note that JPMorgan’s Interbank Information Network (IIN) is a blockchain that currently offers anti-money laundering and know-your-client (AML/KYC) services, with 259 banks and payments as a use case.KBW, Sanjay SakhraniThe initiative isn’t an immediate threat to payments companies, Sakhrani wrote in a note. “While the use case appears compelling for the underserved, adoption at a much broader scale will be required for Libra to emerge as a viable alternative to existing payment ecosystems.”Libra seems different than other cryptocurrencies, as it solves at least some issues, including volatility in value. Also, sponsorship from a large platform like Facebook may “help with the problem of adoption, although we believe that barriers to scale are likely still high, particularly in regions where a well-functioning payments ecosystem exists.”Wolfe Research, Darrin PellerThe most likely medium-term impact may be on “P2P, cross-border remittance, and the global underbanked,” Peller wrote in a note. He doesn’t see a near-term use case for Libra disrupting the payment system in “financially developed markets outside of remittance.”He sees opportunities for PayPal to fund Libra wallets/transactions and assist merchant acceptance, but adds that there are “long-term questions on potential pressure around e-commerce fees if Libra gains ubiquity.”To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven Fromm, Janet FreundFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-sees-big-promise-175240998.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-18	2019-06-18 15:36:39	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook’s Cryptocurrency Project: Who’s In and Who’s Out	(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. made a renewed push into payments on Tuesday, announcing plans for a cryptocurrency called Libra.Read More: Facebook Wants Its Cryptocurrency to One Day Rival the GreenbackIt will be governed by the Libra Association, a group of companies that will have an equal say in how the cryptocurrency is managed. Almost 30 firms have joined and Facebook hopes another 70 or more will enter the fold in the future.Read Facebook’s Project Libra white paper hereWho’s In:Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., the world’s largest payments networks, as well as PayPal Holdings Inc. are on board. For Visa and Mastercard, it’s a chance to offer the world of cryptocurrencies the same services they provide in card payments. All three companies know the challenges of building a network and can offer expertise in encouraging consumers to use the instrument and cajoling merchants into accepting it.Companies such as Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc., and Spotify Technology SA keep millions of credit cards on file, and they risk losing customers when people get a new card or number. E-commerce firms also pay higher “card not present” rates when processing payments, so anything that can reduce these expenses is welcome.“Libra has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional financial networks and new digital currency technology, while reducing the costs for everyone,” said Peter Hazlehurst, head of payments at Uber.International companies, including e-commerce firm MercadoLibre Inc. and telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc, signed onto Libra, too. Blockchain technology and stablecoins are potential solutions for the messy world of cross-border payments, which suffers from delays and high costs.Who’s Out:Large banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., already have their own payments businesses that reap billions of dollars in fees. With regulators still deciding how to treat cryptocurrencies, banks and investment firms are treading cautiously.So far, no large brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Target Corp. and Walmart Inc., are taking part. The industry is always interested in lowering the cost of accepting payments, but traditional merchants have historically been hesitant to accept cryptocurrencies due to volatility and lack of consumer adoption.The largest U.S. technology companies, Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc., are noticeably absent. Many of these firms have their own digital payments businesses and some are experimenting with blockchain technology. Apple has poured scorn on Facebook for repeated privacy missteps and other big tech firms are trying to avoid being associated with the social-media giant.“This is very early -- 27 organizations right now, 100 by the time we launch,” David Marcus, head of the Facebook blockchain team that’s spearheading the project, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “And by that time, I definitely expect to see banks in there, I definitely expect to see other large technology companies and I definitely expect to see more diversity of organizations in terms of geographical distribution.”Square Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey is a cryptocurrency fan, but even his firm isn’t part of Libra at launch. Square’s cryptocurrency team made its first hire last week and it’s Cash App is a popular way for consumers to buy and sell Bitcoin.Here’s the full list of founding members and partners:Andreessen Horowitz Anchorage Bison Trails Booking Holdings Inc.Breakthrough Initiatives Facebook’s CalibraCoinbase Inc.EBay Inc.

2019-06-18	2019-06-18 15:13:47	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa, Mastercard, PayPal Join Facebook to Form Crypto Effort	(Bloomberg) -- If Facebook Inc.’s new digital currency goes according to plan, it could one day compete with payment giants Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. But for now, all three are set to work with the social-media company on the venture.The currency, called Libra, will launch as soon as next year. It’s what’s known as a stablecoin, one that can avoid massive fluctuations in value so it can be used for everyday transactions. Industry experts and insiders say the payments companies want a seat at the table to help shape the new currency.Read Facebook’s Project Libra white paper here“It’s not unusual for the incumbents -- Visa, Mastercard, PayPal -- to partner with a disruptor,” Harshita Rawat, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in an interview. “They would at least want to participate in how this product is being developed.”New payment methods such as Apple Pay and other mobile wallets are often slow to take off, so any competition is likely to be years away. Still, the earlier payments companies come to the project, the more time they have to ensure their businesses don’t suffer.None of these companies has been shy about pursuing collaboration or other strategic opportunities. PayPal alone has spent billions of dollars buying or investing in potential partnerships as well as competitors. While PayPal hasn’t ventured into cryptocurrencies before, it was a proponent of the blockchain technology that will be used to build Libra.Visa and Mastercard are always looking to embed themselves in emerging payment forms. Both have developed partnerships with cryptocurrency and blockchain firms. They’ve said that Libra can help more people gain access to financial products.“We think cryptocurrencies can address use cases that are not really well served today,” such as areas where cash-based payments remain prominent, said Jorn Lambert, executive vice president of digital solutions at Mastercard. “As such we think it will be incremental to what we do and not a replacement of it.”The payment companies are part of the Libra Association, giving them a say in how the cryptocurrency is managed. There’s currently no time commitment, so members can leave at any time. Once the group’s charter is finalized, there will be a minimum time commitment, according to some members of the group who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.“My sense is that they will try their best to partner and engage with Facebook,” Rawat said. “If Facebook takes the angle that they want to disintermediate card payments, then I think they may not want to participate.”Facebook shares rose 1.4% to $191.61 as of 11:12 a.m. in New York after announcing the cryptocurrency venture.(Updates with shares in final paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.net;Jenny Surane in New York at jsurane4@bloomberg.net;Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Dan Reichl, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-mastercard-paypal-join-facebook-120000995.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-18	2019-06-18 13:28:06	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Tuesday’s Vital Data: Facebook, Tesla and Micron Technology	U.S. stock futures are trading higher this morning, ending the standoff that has kept most broad market indexes locked in a narrow range for the past week. The gains come amid optimism that the Fed's two-day meeting kicking off today will end with action supporting higher equity prices.Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.53% and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.59%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 1.03%.In the options pits, the summer doldrums took their toll yesterday with overall volume falling well below average levels. Specifically, only 14.3 million calls and 12.5 million puts changed hands on the session. The distance between put and call volume narrowed, however, when looking at the action at the CBOE. By day's end, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio climbed to 0.72. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average inched higher to 0.65.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOptions traders swarmed in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU).Let's take a closer look: Facebook (FB)Facebook shares were flying off the shelf yesterday after the social media king unveiled plans to launch a new cryptocurrency called Libra. FB stock ended the day up 4.24% and is set to open another 1.7% higher this morning.With more than 2.4 billion active users, Facebook is in a unique position to bring the cryptic world of crypto to the mainstream. And the company isn't venturing into the digital currency waters alone. They just announced a slew of large partners including Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) backing their efforts.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 With the day's gains, FB has returned to the north side of its 50-day and 20-day moving averages, officially recouping all of last month's losses. It now sits within striking distance of its April high near $200.On the options trading front, traders chased calls throughout the session. Total activity ramped to 259% of the average daily volume, with 649,521 contracts traded; 78% of the trading came from call options alone.The increased demand drove implied volatility higher on the day to 32%, placing it at the 35th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of $3.82 or 2%. Tesla (TSLA)Tesla shares gained 4.7% on Monday to notch a new one-month high. And the rally is continuing this morning with TSLA stock up another 2.5% premarket. One notable development could be fueling the bulls' fire.Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, tweeted over the weekend, &quot;Just deleted my Twitter account.&quot; Shareholders the world over likely cheered the move given the trouble Musk's aggressive tweets have caused in the past.Although Tesla shares have rallied well off their 52-week lows, many resistance levels sit overhead, including the 50-day moving average. This has been the spot where previous rallies have failed, so it will be telling if TSLA can finally close and stay above it.On the options trading front, puts outpaced calls despite the stock rally. Total activity climbed slightly higher to 109% of the average daily volume, with 427,700 contracts traded. Puts claimed 52% of the day's take.Implied volatility rose to 65%, which places it at the 29th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $9.24 or 4.1%. Micron (MU)Micron shares have now come full circle this year. The four-month uptrend that carried the chip stock 41% higher from January through April has now completely unraveled. Its descending 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages loom ominously overhead and reveal how bears dominate across all time frames.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today With Monday's drop, MU stock now sits at a critical short-term support level of $32. Speculators are likely teeing up breakdown trades in anticipation of the floor's failure.The company's next earnings release is scheduled for June 25, so look for that to provide the next catalyst for Micron's trend.On the options trading front, calls were favored over two-to-one versus puts. Total activity finished just a hair above usual at 101% of the average daily volume, with 123,780 contracts traded. Calls accounted for 72% of the session's sum.Option premiums are pumped up ahead of next week's earnings report. Implied volatility sits at 55% or the 56th percentile of its one-year range. Traders now expect daily moves of $1.11 or 3.4%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-18	2019-06-18 12:40:35	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	There Are Really No Good Reasons to Keep Laying off Visa Stock	Visa (NYSE:V) is up more than 25% over the past year, stoked in part by Federal Reserve rate hikes of 2018 that have translated into higher profit margins for credit card companies. The overall fundamental strength of the company has also been the catalyst behind the Visa stock returns.Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrThe world's largest retail electronic payments network, Visa, is expected to report earnings in late July. There could be some volatility and profit-taking in Visa in the coming weeks, especially as many other financial services firms also report in July.However, I'd encourage long-term investors who would like exposure to the sector to regard any dip in the share price as an opportunity to add Visa stock to their portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today  Long-Term Visa Stock StrengthsRobust Fundamental Numbers: Visa is a quality blue-chip company with a $370 billion market cap. Since going public in 2008, Visa has rewarded shareholders continuously.The group does not issue credit cards or lend money. Instead, the company operates as an &quot;intermediary,&quot; charging a fee on each of the 150 million transactions its network handles every day.Visa has three sources of revenue:  * Service revenues (for services provided to card issuers for the use of Visa products);  * Data processing revenues (fees Visa collects for the authorization, settlement, or clearing); and  * International transaction revenues (for cross-border and currency conversion transactions).On April 24, Visa posted better than expected results for Q2 2019. Revenue for the quarter ending March 31 was $5.5 billion, an 8% growth year-over-year (YoY).Earnings per share (EPS) also increased to $1.31, a 17% YoY increase. As a result of robust growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, the company also increased its outlook for the year.As one of the major credit and debit card processors, Visa has strong pricing power and a good profit margin that stands at over 54%. Visa's leadership position in the industry requires financial flexibility so that the management can continue the growth-centric steps. Its current ratio, which measures Visa's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with its current assets, is a healthy 1.6, compared to the industry average of 2.4.In fact, Visa and its long-time archrival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) can be said to have a duopoly in the cards network sector. Both companies collect transaction fees for without bearing credit risk and control a majority of the digital payment infrastructure. And there does not seem to be much threat to the dominance of either company.Visa's sales numbers are forecast to grow over 10% in 2019 and 2020. Overall, Wall Street expects Visa's profitability, high margins, robust cash flow and healthy financial metrics to continue in the coming quarters, too -- a fact that should bring higher prices for V stock.Mobile Payments Space: Many of us have already paid for a purchase with our smartphones at least once as mobile payments are fast becoming a convenient and swift method to pay bills or make transfers. Analysts expect the global market to reach $4.5 trillion by 2023.The most widely used transaction methods include contactless payments without entering the credit card PIN number at the point-of-sale or using a smartphone to pay a merchant or even a person such as a friend or family member, i.e., peer-to-peer (P2P) payments.If you are looking at ways to benefit from this trend, Visa may be a solid company to consider. It's been boosting its mobile payment offerings. As early as 2011, the group took a stake in Square (NYSE:SQ), the San Francisco-based credit card processing fintech, which was founded in 2009. There are rumors that Visa may end up acquiring Square.Its other strategic investments include Stripe and Marqeta as well as It's currently bidding to buy Earthport,a British payments company, that facilitates money transfer services across borders.Over the past decade, smartphones have become a part of our daily lives and it would not be wrong to expect mobile payments to enter our daily lives in a big way. In other words, as more consumers tap to pay or download an app to transfer money, Visa investors are likely to reap the rewards. What Could Derail Visa Stock?Short-term Technical Analysis and Price Charts: Year-to-date, Visa is up 28%. So, in the next few weeks, there might be some profit taking. As a result of the recent impressive run-up in the stock price, short-term technical indicators have become somewhat over-extended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that Visa's technical message has also become &quot;overbought.&quot;Leading up to its earnings report in late July, Visa stock could trade sideways for several weeks and even have a pullback toward the low-$160's or even mid-$150's level, where the stock is likely to find major support.Visa stock's beta is 0.98, which means its volatility on average mimics that of the broader market. Therefore if the industry or the broader market declines as the companies release earnings, Visa may also be adversely affected.Investors may consider waiting on the sidelines if they do not currently have any positions open in these tech stocks.If you already own Visa shares, you might want to hold your position. That said, if you are worried about short-term profit taking, then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current price point, to protect your profits to date.Current shareholders may also consider hedging their positions. As for hedging strategies, covered calls or put spreads with July 19 expiry could be appropriate as straight put purchases are likely to be expensive due to heightened volatility.I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness. Yet, I find Visa stock to be a compelling buy candidate and by the end of 2020, I'd expect the shares to reach $180.Competition in the Mobile Payment Payments Space: The fintech revolution is evolving and the entire payments industry is growing fast. In addition to Visa, several other U.S. companies are leading the mobile-payment race that requires cutting-edge technology. In October 2014, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced Apple Pay which has now become one of the dominant digital payment apps in the U.S.In the P2P space, investors love PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) which owns the popular Venmo app. The app has over 25 million users and is ahead of its closest competitors -- Apple's Pay Cash, Square's Cash App, and Zelle, which is owned by Early Warning Services, a private fintech company.If there are mixed earnings reports or important news from Visa's competitors hit the wires, there may be short-term volatility or decline in the stock. For example, if any of Visa peers were to issue an earnings warning, due to a potential slowdown in consumer spending in the U.S. or globally, then Visa shares could also be adversely affected in the near-term.However, Visa is a solid company with continued growth prospects in mobile payments. Therefore small price dips on daily headlines should not keep long-term investors up at night.In general, whenever Visa stock price has a correction, such as the one it experienced in late 2018, the shares come back rather quickly, only to make a new high in several months. Bottom Line on Visa StockVisa stock is a fundamentally sound stalwart investment with further growth prospects, profitability, leadership in the respective market, stability, and proactive management -- factors that are likely to translate into a strong balance sheet and robust bottom line in the rest of the decade.There are two important secular trends currently affecting the payments sector in the U.S. as well as many other countries, i.e., payment transactions are increasingly moving to mobile and digital payments are surpassing cash payments. As the industry is growing and being transformed, Visa stock may indeed provide a solid long-term investment for many shareholders.Investors who are interested in financial services, but do not want to commit all their capital to a single stock such as Visa may also consider investing in various exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) that have Visa as a holding, including iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (NYSEARCA:IYG), ISE Mobile Payments ETF (NYSEARCA:IPAY), or Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT).As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-18	2019-06-18 12:00:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa, Mastercard, PayPal Join Facebook in Forming Crypto Effort	(Bloomberg) -- If Facebook Inc.’s new digital currency goes according to plan, it could one day compete with payment giants Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. But for now, all three are set to work with the social-media company on the venture.The currency, called Libra, will launch as soon as next year. It’s what’s known as a stablecoin, one that can avoid massive fluctuations in value so it can be used for everyday transactions. Industry experts and insiders say the payments companies want a seat at the table to help shape the new currency.Read Facebook’s Project Libra white paper here “It’s not unusual for the incumbents -- Visa, Mastercard, PayPal -- to partner with a disruptor,” Harshita Rawat, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in an interview. “They would at least want to participate in how this product is being developed.”New payment methods such as Apple Pay and other mobile wallets are often slow to take off, so any competition is likely to be years away. Still, the earlier payments companies come to the project, the more time they have to ensure their businesses don’t suffer.None of these companies has been shy about pursuing collaboration or other strategic opportunities. PayPal alone has spent billions of dollars buying or investing in potential partnerships as well as competitors. While PayPal hasn’t ventured into cryptocurrencies before, it was a proponent of the blockchain technology that will be used to build Libra.Visa and Mastercard are always looking to embed themselves in emerging payment forms. Both have developed partnerships with cryptocurrency and blockchain firms. They’ve said that Libra can help more people gain access to financial products.“We think cryptocurrencies can address use cases that are not really well served today,” such as areas where cash-based payments remain prominent, said Jorn Lambert, executive vice president of digital solutions at Mastercard. “As such we think it will be incremental to what we do and not a replacement of it.”The payment companies are part of the Libra Association, giving them a say in how the cryptocurrency is managed. There’s currently no time commitment, so members can leave at any time. Once the group’s charter is finalized, there will be a minimum time commitment, according to some members of the group who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.“My sense is that they will try their best to partner and engage with Facebook,” Rawat said. “If Facebook takes the angle that they want to disintermediate card payments, then I think they may not want to participate.”To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.net;Jenny Surane in New York at jsurane4@bloomberg.net;Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Dan Reichl, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-mastercard-paypal-join-facebook-120000164.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-18	2019-06-18 10:52:41	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook's Libra Cryptocurrency Needs More Friends	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Facebook Inc.’s planned cryptocurrency is going to need more friends to work.On Tuesday, the social media giant announced it had signed up 27 partners to develop and administer Libra, a digital medium of exchange for use on its apps and beyond. Uber Technologies Inc., Spotify Inc., Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. are all taking part – but there’s a notable absence of banks, large retailers and consumer goods companies, whose massive marketing budgets are the staple of ad agencies worldwide.This matters because Facebook is, above all else, an advertising platform. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has to prove that Libra will deliver more value to brands than their current advertising setup. Judging by this initial list of partners, a lot of firms appear unconvinced. The company wants to sign up a total of 100 by the time the coin starts next year. It will need every one of them, and more.For Zuckerberg, the best possible outcome is that the coin, which is tied to a basket of foreign currencies, keeps both users and brands locked into the Menlo Park, California-based firm’s ecosystem.In theory, a user might receive a token for watching an ad, which they then spend on something they have also seen advertised on Facebook. The company selling the product could then use that token to buy more ad space on the social network, and so the cycle would start anew. That would mean that, even if Zuckerberg had to spend a little bit more to keep his users engaged, the money would ultimately flow back into his company’s coffers.For brands, the big question is just how much data from that process will Facebook be willing to share? You can see why companies might be wary about signing up on day one. Facebook and its family of apps – Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger – are already something of a walled garden when it comes to advertisers. They regularly complain that they have little visibility over what they call the journey of their customers: What ads did customers see before making a purchase or clicking through to a website? That anonymized data allows them to gauge whether an approach works or not.Many purchases happen on brands’ own websites right now, which is a problem for Facebook, since it doesn’t know itself when a user has decided to buy something. Knowing what exactly prompts a purchase would help the company target future ad campaigns more effectively. Starting its own digital wallet – Calibra – should allow it to plug that gap by inserting itself into the middle of consumers’ transactions. Facebook has said that it won’t use financial data to target ads, but the wallet will nonetheless surely be optimized to execute purchases from within one of its platforms.The model here is Amazon.com Inc. The e-commerce giant knows almost every stage of an online shopper’s journey to purchasing an item, allowing it to target them with precision. That’s a threat to both Facebook and Google’s advertising models, and goes a long way to explaining why Zuckerberg is so keen to make friends. To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Edward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2019-06-18	2019-06-18 10:32:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Facebook's stock set to rise more than 2% after official launch of cryptocurrency Libra coin	Facebook Inc.  on Tuesday said it will roll out its highly anticipated digital currency next year, intended to be used to make payments over the internet as well as on its social-media platform. The cryptocurrency called Libra coin uses blockchain, the digital-ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin  to create its digital currency. However, unlike bitcoin the digital asset will be pegged to hard currencies like the dollar and the euro  to make it less prone to the wild prices swings associated with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The move is widely viewed as an implicit endorsement of the blockchain technology and to a lesser extent crypto assets, which were first created back in 2009 when a person or persons known as Satoshi Nakamoto minted the first bitcoin. The Facebook digital payment venture will be backed by more than two dozen companies, including Mastercard Inc.  and PayPal Holdings Inc. , as well as Uber Technologies Inc.  and Spotify Technology . The cryptocurrency will be overseen by a Geneva-based company called Libra Association, with many of the aforementioned backers serving as members of the independent organization. Facebook is also creating a digital wallet called Calibra that allows users to safely store their Libra coins. Shares of Facebook were climbing more than 2% in premarket trade Tuesday, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 index  and the Nasdaq-100  were also rising, setting up modest opening gains for the U.S. stock market.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0ccc968f-e22b-3872-a100-0177bf8fb856/facebook%26%2339%3Bs-stock-set-to.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-17	2019-06-17 12:14:39	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa Stock Remains a Buy, But Expectations Need to Be Lowered	What does an investor do with an opportunity like Visa (NYSE:V)? The Visa stock price continues to stay elevated, at over 27-times forward earnings. Of the 40 largest U.S.-listed stocks by market capitalization, only Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) sport higher valuations.Source: Shutterstock And yet V stock certainly seems to merit a premium valuation. Few large-capitalization stocks can match its near-term growth prospects. Long-term opportunities come in several forms: lower use of cash worldwide, international expansion, and a move into business-to-business (B2B) offerings.Does an investor follow the Warren Buffett maxim that it's &quot;far better to own a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price,&quot; as I argued back in 2017? Or does valuation matter, particularly in a bull market seemingly running on fumes?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor now, Visa stock seems a worthwhile bet. But investors probably have to temper their expectations. The next decade is not going to look like the last one. The Incredible Rise in the Visa Stock PriceLooking backwards, investors certainly missed a huge opportunity in Visa stock. Over the past ten years, shares have returned 953%, not including an admittedly modest dividend. Those gains haven't come just because of the bull market either. In 2009, the company earned 81 cents per share (adjusting for the company's 2015 stock split). A decade ago, the stock (again, on a split-adjusted basis) traded for $16-plus, implying a P/E multiple right at 20x.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Expects to Soar for the Rest of 2019 Relative to 2019 expectations, the multiple now sits at 31x. And there are two ways to look at that expansion. The first is that the incredible gains in the Visa stock price are coming mostly from higher earnings. Based on the Street's expectations for 2019, V should climb nearly 500% from 2009 levels.The second, however, is a more difficult question: can the multiples assigned V stock really go much higher? This is a much larger company, which makes percentage growth more difficult to achieve. Yet investors now are paying 50%-plus more for the same dollar of earnings. As impressive as Visa's opportunities are, it's tough to argue that its growth potential is better now than it was a decade ago.Obviously, the market today is in much better shape than in June 2009, when it was just three months removed from financial crisis lows. But that's kind of the point: Visa's earnings multiples can't expand much more without the broad market moving higher.In that scenario, earnings growth still can drive returns -- again, profits are expected to rise 15%-plus in 2020. But roughly 16% annual returns (including the dividend) might seem disappointing in the context of the recent performance. Is V Stock the Best Play?As incredible as the performance of Visa stock seems, there's something more incredible: Mastercard. Visa has returned nearly 1,000% in a decade, yet V shares have underperformed their rival over that span. In fact, MA has been the better pick over one, three, and five-year periods as well. Its 10-year return is a staggering 1,460%.At the moment, MA actually is slightly more expensive on an earnings basis than V stock. Mastercard has greater exposure to non-U.S. payments, and thus, at least in theory, more room for growth. And while past performance doesn't guarantee future performance, the better returns from Mastercard shares are at least worth considering.Of course, Visa and Mastercard aren't the only two stocks in the space, either. Will Healy this month highlighted a potential opportunity in Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), which trades at a substantial discount to both V and MA despite significant potential risk in China. American Express (NYSE:AXP) has been an inconsistent performer, but offers value as well.The stories of the four stocks aren't the same; at the moment, it's foolish to argue that DFS or AXP should be treated like their rivals. But when considering V stock at these multiples, investors should at least keep an open mind toward other stocks in the space. Visa Looks Good, but Not GreatAt the least, the next decade for the Visa stock price is not going to look like the last decade. That's probably not surprising: a repeat of the 950%-plus gains would give Visa a market cap of some $4 trillion.But performance could be good -- and still far short of the standard Visa has set. Bear in mind that if V stock appreciated at 10.5% a year for the next decade, it would reach a $1 trillion market cap ten years from now. Maybe that's not unrealistic in a world where credit-card usage continues to rise. Plus, Visa's efforts in cross-border payments and B2B could bear fruit.Still, $1 trillion does seem like a big ask for returns that almost seem middling given the torrid performance of payment companies of late. And it shows the difficulty in Visa stock here. There's a path to a $1 trillion valuation, which is the good news. But whether 10%-plus a year is good enough for investors depends on their view of the markets and the competition.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

After flirting with single-digit prices during the 2008 financial crisis, it began to move steadily higher. Today, it has risen more than 15-fold since that time. The Visa stock price has now surged to around $170.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs both myself and others have pointed out, Visa stock remains pricey. The company's growth and favorable business conditions have taken the forward price-earnings (PE) ratio of V stock above 27.4. However, the average PE ratio of V stock over the last five years is 32.9. Estimated earnings growth of 16.5% this year and its average earnings increase of 20.84% per year over the previous five years has helped to support the high multiples of V stock.Moreover, even market selloffs have resulted in relatively mild pullbacks by V stock. Between late September and the week of Christmas, Visa stock price fell by a little bit less than 20%. However, its PE ratio remained well in the 20s during that time. Also, like most stocks, it quickly recovered. For this reason, I would not expect any significant declines in Visa stock price anytime soon. Given these factors, the long-term owners of V stock should continue to hold onto their shares. Moreover, even at these levels, those buying V stock face few risks. Visa Stock Versus Its PeersThe only reason to not buy  Visa stock may involve how well it compares to its key peers. Given the potential growth of cashless payments throughout the world, Mastercard (NYSE:MA), American Express (NYSE:AXP), and Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) should also generate double-digit profit growth, despite their smaller market shares.However, after looking at  card stocks' PE ratios and growth rates, it becomes clear that the market has been willing to support higher price-to-earnings-to growth (PEG) ratios for companies with higher market shares. Visa stock supports a PEG ratio of 1.9 versus only 1.75 for Mastercard. However, for this year, analysts, on average, predict Mastercard will report earnings growth of 17.4% versus only 16.5% for Visa. American Express, long a Warren Buffett favorite, trades at a PEG ratio of 1.57. AXP's expected profit growth comes in at only 10.8%. However, it has a much lower forward PE of around 13.5.Still, it is Discover Financial whose valuation stands out. Its PEG ratio comes in at only 0.7. It also supports a forward PE ratio of only about 8.2. Despite this single-digit multiple, analysts expect its profit to rise  12.4% this year.In some respects, DFS stock is cheap for a reason. It holds only a 2.2% share of card volumes, a decline from 2.3% last year. Visa remains the dominant player in this area, holding steady at 61.2%. However, in the current environment, all payment card companies will prosper.Moreover, since 2005, DFS has partnered with UnionPay, the dominant payment network in China. From a worldwide standpoint, UnionPay comes in second to only Visa on card volumes. The U.S.-China trade war may add a degree of uncertainty. However, with such an ally, DFS should continue to grow. The Bottom Line on Visa StockVisa stock will rise over the long-term, but some of its peers may fare better on a relative basis. V stock will likely remain expensive, but no major challenges have emerged to its dominance in the U.S. or to its double-digit earnings increases.When it comes to PEG ratios, Visa stock holds up well, slightly besting Mastercard and coming in only slightly higher than American Express's ratio. Still, value investors will find  Discover Financial stock to be a relative bargain, as it could help a growing, China-based peer enter the U.S. market.As a result, investors who don't want to pay the high multiple carried by V stock have other choices. However,the owners of V stock will continue to benefit from Visa's U.S. dominance and the continuing move to a more cashless society.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-06-07	2019-06-07 15:41:36	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	With Washington Turmoil, Visa Stock Is Surprisingly Risky	Cash -- one of the last vestiges of the analog era -- is steadily going out of style. This broad trend only helps credit card companies with mass appeal, such as Visa (NYSE:V). Although you'll often hear personal finance gurus urging their listeners to cut up their plastic, let's be real: Americans love debt-based consumerism. That simple fact should lift Visa stock northward on a longer-term basis.Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrAdding to the bullish case, this scenario is playing out exactly as I stated. On a year-to-date basis, V stock is up nearly 28%. Credit card rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is enjoying a similar burst in sentiment, gaining a massive 38% year-to-date. Compare these performances to the benchmark S&P 500 index, which is up only 14% YTD after suffering volatility since May.And what is the source of this volatility? Just turn on the TV to find out. A few weeks back, everybody was scrambling to decipher underlying signals within the deteriorating complex of U.S.-China relations. Now, President Trump has his eyes focused on Mexico, threatening painful tariffs unless they control migrant inflows. But while all this is going on, the Visa stock price remains elevated.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Like our own Ian Bezek stated in October 2017, V stock is surprisingly recession-resistant. Visa doesn't assume credit risk in the way that a mortgage lender might.Plus, the world community is undergoing a transition to financial digitalization. One of physical cash's final holdouts, Japan, is slowly but steadily shifting toward a cashless society. As a western ally and the world's third-biggest economy, converting Japan is huge for companies like Square (NYSE:SQ). Through natural synergies, you can also expect a swing higher in the Visa stock price.Yet I'm cautious, and here's why: Visa Stock Has Serious VulnerabilitiesThe last time I wrote about V stock, I compared the underlying company to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Making headlines earlier this year, Apple announced its foray into the plastic industry.However, I felt that Visa's broad base, and its decades of expertise in the arena gave it the advantage. I'm still sticking to that narrative.But since writing that piece, the U.S. is on the verge of entering a two-front trade war. Going toe-to-toe with China is bad enough. Simultaneously antagonizing Mexico is a very risky political move for the Trump administration. Obviously, if the situation worsens, it will threaten several jobs.And that's why with this new information, I'm hesitant on Visa stock. Earlier, Bezek mentioned that company shares mitigated losses better in the 2008 fallout relative to many other stocks. That suggests the American consumer is much more resilient than we give it credit for.But another scenario is that consumers used whatever tools at their disposal to keep the rusted train going. Consumer debt statistics indicate that, contrary to the &quot;recovery&quot; narrative, most Americans are deeply troubled. People with credit cards average over $5,800 in debt.Some states are much worse. For instance, Alaska has the most average credit card debt at $8,500 per cardholder. Iowa features the lowest, but still maintains a staggering $5,155 of plastic debt.All you need to do when considering the risk to the Visa stock price is read between the lines. People have no reason to hold such mind-boggling balances in their high-interest rate cards other than cash flow purposes. In order to make ends meet, Americans individually kick the can down the road.V stock has been rising because we've had plenty of road to cover. But these new geopolitical headwinds are too ominous to ignore. Excessive Bad Loans Cloud V StockAdmittedly, our spiraling relations with foreign economic partners got me to question the true state of our own economy. After all, President Trump won because he tapped into the actual fears affecting voters.In other words, Trump called Obama-era data &quot;fake news.&quot; Millions believed him.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Don't Care About Tariffs Now, Trump as President is changing his tune. Rather than fake news, positive labor reports and consumer sentiment represent confirmation that his policies work. But the reality is that Trump was probably right the first time. Certainly, rising consumer debt levels support the pessimistic narrative.What bothers me more is that this narrative has other confirming indicators. For instance, big banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) are only gaining due to issues involving monetary policy. However, they are not generating revenue growth from activities like lending or consulting.Put differently, Americans are not taking on good debt. By that, I mean debt for the purpose of starting new businesses or ventures. Instead, we're seeing an increase in bad debt, or liabilities associated with purchasing junk.What I'm talking about probably won't impact the Visa stock price immediately. But considering that it's so elevated right now, I'd stay on the sidelines with the powder keg dry.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-05	2019-06-05 09:31:28	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Cryptocurrency Is Interesting But It Won’t Move Facebook Stock	Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is reportedly getting into cryptocurrency. The news hasn't done much for FB stock, which has other issues to deal with. Facebook stock fell more than 7% on June 3 amid news of an Federal Trade Commission investigation.Source: Shutterstock That probe, which mirrors a similar Department of Justice investigation into Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the big story for now … and it probably should be. But Facebook's intentions for cryptocurrency are intriguing. The question is whether they really matter to the FB stock price.After all, a number of companies have tried to create value in and around cryptocurrency and blockchain. Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK) notably pivoted to the space. Even IBM (NYSE:IBM) has repeatedly touted its efforts in blockchain. None of the efforts have done anything, so far, to drive profits and all three stocks have headed in the wrong direction.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault Still, Facebook might be different. Its existing base of over 2 billion users can amplify its efforts. The company -- regulatory and reputational worries aside -- will instantly add credibility to the technology. And Facebook is big enough to put money behind the effort and create confidence among users.For now, however, that latter fact is the problem. Facebook is large. In fact, it's huge. FB stock has a market value of $478 billion. At the moment, it's hard to see cryptocurrency moving the needle on that figure even if Facebook's efforts will be fun to watch. Facebook and CryptoNews has been dribbling out about Facebook's intentions for several weeks. Last month, the Financial Times reported that the company had held discussions with several of the big players in cryptocurrency. That even included the Winklevoss twins, who famously sued Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg over the creation of the platform, and who have made several unsuccessful efforts to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.Two days later, the BBC reported that Facebook planned to launch its cryptocurrency, referred to as GlobalCoin, in the first part of 2020. The FT returned this past weekend with a story that the company had held initial talks with the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission about whether its coin would be regulated by that agency. (The CFTC generally regulates futures, which drive much of current trading in bitcoin. Whether a cash-based Facebook cryptocurrency would fall under its auspices remains somewhat unclear.)All told, it does appear that Facebook, at least at the moment, plans to move ahead with GlobalCoin. Reports have suggested it would be a so-called stablecoin with its value pegged to the price of the U.S. dollar. Tether appears to be the most widely used stablecoin at the moment, but that cryptocurrency is embroiled in allegations that funds supposedly backing Tether were used to cover losses elsewhere.Facebook's balance sheet -= the company closed Q1 with $45 billion in cash and investments -- would negate any such worries. Its heft and reach would instantly add credibility. It's not hard to see users and businesses flocking to such an effort. Does Crypto Matter for FB Stock?The question is whether even a success is material to FB stock. Again, this is a company valued at almost half a trillion dollars. Tether has a &quot;market cap&quot; (as cryptocurrency traders define it) of just $3 billion.Certainly, Facebook could drive issuances of well over $3 billion. But what, exactly, does that mean for the social network's profits? It's not clear at the moment but the answer very well could be nothing. The point of Facebook's GlobalCoin might not necessarily be to make money by, say, taking a cut of transactions ala' Visa (NYSE:V) or Mastercard (NYSE:MA). It might instead simply be a way to increase engagement or keep engagement from eroding, which would pressure advertising sales.Even if Facebook were to become a payment processor via its coin, it's not clear how successful it would be - or how much money it might make. The online payments space already is highly competitive, with Visa, Mastercard, PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), and many others. Online shopping -- and online money transfer -- is not a particularly difficult experience at this point.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth Facebook could leverage its user base into driving adoption of its coin -- but even several billion dollars in annual transactions, at a 1% or even 2% fee, doesn't really impact earnings all that much. That might be revenue of a couple hundred million dollars annually, albeit at high margins. But Facebook is likely to earn over $20 billion in 2019 alone. Is Facebook Stock a Buy?That said, there is a bull case for Facebook stock. I argued last month that the company had a path to retake record highs next year … I still believe that's the case. For all the coverage of the company's various scandals, they've had no discernible impact on revenue growth or advertiser demand. FB stock remains reasonably cheap. Better monetization of Instagram and WhatsApp will follow in coming years.To be sure, there are near-term risks. The new, clearer, regulatory worries may keep a lid on Facebook stock, though I agree with others who believe the likelihood of a breakup is minimal. Tech stocks on the whole are selling off, though the declines in FB and GOOGL are in part a cause of that sell-off. (Those declines also are pushing indices lower.)Longer-term, I still believe Facebook stock has upside. And cryptocurrency may, at some point, be part of those gains. But the case here is based on a sober understanding of the company's role in online advertising - and requires an intense focus on its user growth and engagement. Cryptocurrency will be fun to watch but it's not going to matter much to the FB stock price.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-06-04	2019-06-04 11:40:31	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa Stock Got an Overweight Rating for Some Very Good Reasons	I recently came across a stat from April in the Globe and Mail that caught my attention. Specifically, UBS (NYSE:UBS) listed the ten most overweighted and underweighted stocks in the MSCI AC World Index. The number one overweighted stock was Visa (NYSE:V) with Mastercard (NYSE:MA) also making the list in the sixth spot. Being on this list certainly isn't bad news for Visa stock.Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrWhy is the UBS list important?Merrill Lynch research shows that stocks overweighted by portfolio managers underperform stocks underweighted by those same managers over the long haul. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe fact that both Visa stock and Mastercard made the top ten overweighted stocks should at least have shareholders of the respective companies revisiting why they own the stocks. Currently, both stocks are trading at 17 times sales. Is either of them worth owning? Why don't we have a look?  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault  The Big Reason to Own Visa StockVisa CEO Al Kelly recently spoke to Barron's about the opportunities that exist for the $353 billion financial services company. Naturally, Visa continues to benefit from the secular trend to electronic payments away from cash and checks. Of course, so too does Mastercard. However, it is business-to-business payments that's got Kelly excited.&quot;We're already the biggest player in the world in (B2B),&quot; Kelly told Barron's contributor Tae Kim. &quot;Yet I think there is enormous upside. If I use the baseball analogy, we're probably no more than in the second inning as it relates to the B2B opportunity around the world.&quot;A new product for Visa in the B2B space that's sure to drive revenue growth is B2B Connect, the company's cross-border supplier payments platform to simplify international B2B transactions. While Visa Direct helps small- and medium-sized businesses process payments across borders, B2B Connect will allow large businesses to process big-ticket transactions efficiently and securely on a global basis.&quot;Visa B2B Connect is a distributed ledger based, non-card platform. Its unique distributed-ledger based architecture enables significantly shorter transaction times, from weeks to one-to-two days,&quot; The Financial reported in mid-May. Using blockchain architecture, Visa is ready to offer global banks a new alternative for processing high-value transactions. &quot;B2B Connect's digital identity greatly reduces the opportunity for fraud that might otherwise exist with checks, ACH and wire transfers today, while also helping companies remain compliant as part of the regulated financial ecosystem,&quot; Kevin Phalen, global head of Visa Business Solutions at Visa, stated last October while discussing B2B Connect's product details.  Seven months later, it's close to launching B2B Connect, providing investors with another reason to like Visa stock. The Big Reason to Own MastercardBigger isn't necessarily better.While Mastercard's market cap is 28% less than Visa and its operating margins are slightly lower -- 56% compared to 60% -- the fact that's it smaller makes it nimbler than its bigger rival allowing it to move more quickly when it spots an opportunity. &quot;It's smaller in size than its rival Visa but its relative size makes it more nimble, winning the new Apple Card business for example. The global market for electronic payments will continue to grow and MasterCard will continue to grow with it, particularly internationally where a majority of the growth is expected to be generated,&quot; Marketocracy founder Ken Kam wrote in May as part of an interview with analyst John Archer. Archer, whose Tabernacle Fund's largest holding is Mastercard at 14% of the portfolio, believes the stock's current intrinsic value is $230. However, Archer isn't selling because only 10% of the $22 trillion global market for payments is card-based, providing Mastercard with a long runway for growth. Mastercard might be smaller than Visa, but that doesn't make it equally attractive over the long haul.      The Verdict Although I've written more about Visa in this article, there's little difference between the two stocks. The only metric besides having higher operating margins that might tilt the decision in Visa's favor is its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.6, about half that of Mastercard.  As the largest (Visa) and second-largest payment processors in the world, if you don't mind paying 17 times sales, they're both excellent long-term holds.  At the time of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-29	2019-05-29 14:29:01	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Square Stock Is Setting Up for a Spike	Last year the impression was that banks couldn't hold their rallies, so it was easy to short the financial centers. But that was not the case for the payment transactors like Square (NASDAQ:SQ). The perception is that these financial tech -FinTech -- companies are more tech than financials, so their stocks were soaring. But SQ stock has recently hit a snag and it lags the group.Source: Via SquareYear-to-date, SQ stock is still outperforming the S&P 500, up 16%, but that's about half as much Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and about eight percentage points worse than American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Visa (NYSE:V).For the last three months it's even worse. SQ is down 21% when the rest are still up for the same period.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo, is this relative slack in Square stock's performance an opportunity to bet on the bounce? Or is it a leading indicator that the rest of the gang will revert lower? My bet is that the fintech sector is still a bullish bet and that any weakness in Square is an opportunity to buy. For the last two years, SQ stock is up 184% which is more than double its competition. SQ Stock and the MarketIt is important to note that the whole equity market is being held hostage by the crisis of sentiment that we are having due to the tariff war. Keep that in mind for all bullish write ups inside that context.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June First, let's examine the whole fintech sector and why it's a definite winner for the long term. The globe has committed to moving as many financial transactions as possible online, and companies like Square are already there. This is a trend that is not likely to reverse, so demand on their products and services is likely to stay strong for decades. There are smaller companies coming into the arena, but I bet the ones already there will have the advantage.Fundamentally, SQ stock is still relatively new, so it's the most expensive of the bunch. Wall Street gives it the higher valuation because in theory it delivers the most growth. So far, management has not faltered, so this credit should continue until they show that growth is abating.In their last earnings report, SQ beat the metrics but were cautious with their guidance. So the message is that they continue to successfully execute on plans. Don't panic because of the muted guidance -- this is management padding their expectations. Eventually this, too, shall pass and the stock should play catch-up with the rest.SQ stock sells at 8x sales. So although it loses money, it's twice as cheap as Visa and MA, both of which sell at over 16x price to sales. So after a big stock dip like this, I can consider it a value trade here. A lot of the froth has already fallen off.But the best argument for a Square rally scenario from here is technical.The weekly chart shows that SQ stock just bounced off an important support zone. The area around $60 per share has been pivotal for over a year. Bulls and bears are willing to fight over it, which in turn creates congestion. On the way down, this translates into support.Moreover, Square stock still maintains a higher low trend off the Christmas bounce. This is also bumping against the descending line of lower highs, so now it comes into a tight point. Usually, these explode in a big move, and after so much of the froth has already left the stock, I bet odds are it surges higher.If so, the immediate target would be the April and February fail points at $75.50 and $82 per share, respectively.Conversely, stocks are still hostage to geopolitical headline risk, so overall sentiment is sour. Square stock rallies would probably need the help of overall market action. So if the general malaise persists on Wall Street, then SQ is vulnerable.Below $61 per share, it could trigger a retest of the December lows near $51. I don't see this happening, but the technical bearish pattern looms and the neckline is close. So if this is a short-term trade then I have to set tight stop loss triggers. Else, I can hold Square stock for the long term as it will be a winner.In short, Square stock has solid fundamentals in a popular sector. And now also has favorable technical setups. This makes it an attractive bullish bet for the next few weeks.The experts on Wall Street are split on the rating between buy and hold, but they all agree that its stock should be higher. It's trading now well below their average price target near $83.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-05-24	2019-05-24 13:10:32	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	PayPal Stock Will Move Higher, but There Are Way Better Choices	It seems like nothing can stop PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). After a brief slowdown during the bear market in late 2018, PayPal stock had returned to its late-summer highs by January.Source: Shutterstock The move higher continued, and now it trades at record highs. Given the growth in the payments industry, PYPL will continue its rise long term. However, the question is not whether to buy PYPL stock, but if investors should choose it over its closest peers.PayPal stock continues to register impressive growth, even as it seeks to address the competitive threat posed by Square (NYSE:SQ). Fueling this is a rising cashless society and a move toward more ecommerce. This bolsters not only PayPal stock and that of Square, but also payment processors such as Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend This increase continues at a steady but significant pace. According to eMarketer, retail ecommerce sales will rise from $3.453 trillion this year to $4.878 trillion by 2021.PayPal may have also become a force in the banking business itself. Its digital wallet, Venmo, has risen to over 40 million accounts as of the first quarter. Venmo also registered a 73% increase on payments on its platform. This compares well to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) with 37 million digital accounts and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) who with 29.8 million digital users. PYPL lags only JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which claims 51 million active accounts. A Closer Look at PayPal StockGiven this increase, I see ample room for growth for all major players involved. The predicted profit increases in PayPal stock represents the growth well. Analysts expect earnings increases to come in at 23.1% this year and 17.8% next year.This has also brought somewhat higher price-to-earnings (PE) ratios across the industry. PayPal's forward PE now stands at 32.1. While not cheap, that appears inexpensive compared to SQ stock and its 59.3 forward PE ratio. Moreover, the multiples of Visa and Mastercard are somewhat lower, but not by much.But here's the thing.In this sector, multiples tend to rise with rates of profit growth. Square supports a significantly higher PE ratio. However, Wall Street believe SQ's profits will rise by 59.6% this year and 49.3% the next.In 2020, Square's profits will grow at about 2.5 times PayPal's earnings this year. Next year, Square will roughly triple PayPal's growth rate. Given this differential, I see a case for buying SQ when its forward multiple comes in a less than double PayPal's PE ratio.Conversely, investors can pay about 26.4 times forward earnings for Visa. Following what looks like an industry trend, that will buy investors lower but still impressive growth rates. Analysts expect Visa will see a 16.5% earnings increase this year and a 15.6% rate in 2020.Moreover, PYPL has risen more than 46% from its December low. This comes in substantially higher than the 33%-plus growth in SQ over the same period. Given this rapid rise, I cannot rule out a short-term correction. What should investors do?PayPal stock will remain a growth equity for years to come, but it may not outperform a key peer. PYPL trades near record highs. Its massive profit increase justifies its PE ratio in the low 30s. However, one cannot ignore Square stock, which offers almost triple the growth at less than double the valuation.Again, I do not think this negates the bull thesis in PayPal stock. I also believe payment stocks will generally continue to rise long-term. In my view, it comes down to risk tolerance. Investors more comfortable with lower multiples should consider PayPal or maybe Visa. However, for those who will willingly pay a higher PE for more elevated growth levels, Square stock might make a better choice.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-23	2019-05-23 09:31:17	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Tokyo Tailwind Could Spark Next Leg Up For Square Stock	If there's one investment I regret missing out on, it's retail-technology outfit Square (NYSE:SQ). During the summer of 2016, SQ stock dropped to single digits. Late last year, the company completed a dramatic turnaround, with shares briefly touching $100. But even at its current price of just under $66, Square has done well for its long-time stakeholders.Source: Via SquarePartially, I blame the cryptocurrency surge for taking my eyes off the ball. The concept surrounding Square stock is so simple yet so incredibly ingenious. Take a small card-swiper, make it compatible with popular smartphones, and presto! You have a platform that enables small-business owners to compete with the alpha dogs of their industries.I've seen firsthand how this diminutive square device has transformed my local business community. In the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) era where anything physical is subject to disruption, Square brought disruption for -- and in favor of  -- the little guy. This breathed new life in the broader brick-and-mortar business model, fueling SQ stock gains.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential That said, the second quarter of this year is not turning out favorably for the company's equity. Since the beginning of April, Square stock is down nearly 14%.Most of that ugliness comes down to Square's disappointing second-quarter earnings report. While the tech firm beat the consensus print for both earnings per share and revenue, management shared profitability and sales guidance that fell short of analysts' estimates. As a result, SQ stock slipped and still looks pensive.The other problem is competition. Major players, such as Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V), have seen their revenues disrupted by  third party payment processors like Square, Stripe and other fintech entrants. They have the resources, though, to return the favor, casting a cloud on Square stock. SQ Stock Sitting on a Japanese GoldmineNow, I'm not going to guess the nearer-term price swings. Clearly, the bullishness in SQ stock got a little out of hand last year. The latest earnings report brought the speculative fever back down to earth. Ultimately, I think this is a good thing for patient investors seeking an ideal time to jump aboard.That's because Square stock has viable opportunities both here and abroad. In the U.S., small businesses are the engine of the economy. They've also contributed the most nominally to the recent employment surge. Arming them with the tools to succeed is always a net positive.But one of the international markets I'm most excited for regarding SQ stock is Japan. Historically, Japan was a cash-based society, and even to this day, this dynamic remains. It's one of the country's strange contradictions: a tech leader that still transacts in paper.In order to juice-up its economy, the Japanese government is desperately urging its citizenry to adopt card and digital payments. Initiatives are working, albeit very slowly. In fact, taxi drivers in Japan have only recently started to accept credit cards, but most still prefer cash.Since Square stock is an indirect investment into the cashless trend, Japan initially appears a headwind. But here's the thing: Japan is getting older rapidly, so old habits are likely to fade. Furthermore, the Japanese are very well-traveled, and are eager to adopt certain western conveniences.As the next generation of Japanese entrepreneurs and small-business owners step in, they'll serve the next generation of consumers. Very likely, these younger customers and clients will prefer cashless payments. With Square already levering a relatively significant presence in Japan, it's in prime position to profit.That alone could send SQ stock soaring. Buy the Discount in Square StockAdmittedly, my thesis will take some time to filter through to the SQ stock price. But it's also an underreported concept that deserves more attention.Although we typically consider Japan a tech giant, the country is also happy living a contradiction. As more or less a conservative society, change might be slow. Eventually, though, I think it will occur. When it does, it will hit like a tsunami.For one thing, Japan is the world's third-largest economy, and it's not going to give up that slot easily. Of course, it has a penchant for all things high tech. Finally, the Japanese have adopted cryptocurrency at a much quicker rate than many other nations, suggesting a willingness to try new things.When Japan does go cashless, it will catch many companies by surprise. Not Square, which knows full well what's up. Therefore, you should consider getting ahead of this hidden trend, not behind it.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-21	2019-05-21 11:40:39	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	With $83 on the Horizon, Square Stock Finally Is Cheap Enough to Buy	Square (NYSE:SQ) continues its slide. The San Francisco-based payment services company has moved lower even as its peers continue to see their stocks go higher. Despite a steady decline, analysts have mostly held to their price targets on Square stock. Although SQ may remain range-bound for some time to come, investors now have an opportunity to make a trade.  Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified) Given Square's recent trading activity, where it goes from here remains in question. The stock has fallen steadily since its 2019 peak of $82.78 per share in late February. The company provided weak guidance in its quarterly report on May 1. Hence, earnings and revenue beats for the most recent quarter failed to stem the tide. As a result, SQ trades near the $65 per share level.What makes this more confusing is that our increasingly cashless society will require Square's services. This trend has benefitted peers such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) over the last year. Consequently, PayPal and peers such as Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), and American Express (NYSE:AXP) have exhibited remarkably similar trading patterns over the last year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) Not Square.I had taken a bearish position on Square stock in recent months. Even with an improving outlook, I thought SQ would face short-term pain back in March. However, with a further 15%, I have recently begun to hold a more bullish outlook. Square Stock Should Clear TargetsAnalysts appear to agree. The average price target on SQ currently stands at $83.50 per share, very close to the stock's 2019 high. On the low end, one analyst set a $30 per share price target. I could see such a price in a recession. However, with a growing economy and a predicted earnings growth rate of 59.6% this year, I do not think such an outcome will occur.The highest current price target comes in at $101 per share, near the level of its 52-week high. Hence, barring a recession, SQ stock should remain in its range for now.The good news for SQ bulls is that the stock price can rise even if Square remains range-bound. Although profit growth will fall modestly, Wall Street predicts that earnings will still grow at an average rate of 45.47% per year over the next five years. Currently, SQ also supports a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of about 57. With its current level of profit growth, I do not see the PE ratio falling significantly in the near term. Square Stock and ExpansionFor investors who want to look beyond the short term, Square also continues to bolster its ecosystem with new products and initiatives. One example involves its Square Online store.After acquiring Weebly, it was able to offer clients a more comprehensive online store. This now makes Square a competitor of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and expands its reach in the fast-growing e-commerce industry. Now, with its recent alliance with Postmates, the reach of its ecosystem expands further.Financial services has also become a focus. Square already makes business loans. In recent months, it has also attempted to expand on its Cash App and break into banking itself. However, this move to gain FDIC approval and become an industrial loan company still needs to pass regulatory hurdles.Moreover, Square has only scratched the surface of its potential reach. Currently, the company only operates in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, and the U.K. Though it has not announced plans to move into other countries, it holds tremendous potential offshore.All of these factors should eventually translate into growth for SQ stock, even if the equity remains range-bound for some time to come. The Bottom Line on Square StockThanks to the falling price, traders have an improved opportunity for short-term gain as the long-term outlook improves for investors. A falling stock price continues to take SQ toward the lower end of its current range.Analysts have held to their $83.50 per share price target. Further, Square continues to expand its ecosystem as they add e-commerce storefronts, small business loans, and delivery. The company also offers a bright future to investors with likely moves into banking and other foreign markets.Whether one wants to make a short-term trade or build a long-term investment, SQ stock has fallen to a level where both types of investors can likely swipe in profits.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-17	2019-05-17 16:36:03	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	If Square Stock Starts to Fall It Might Be Hard to Stop	The technical outlook for Square (NYSE:SQ) isn't all that rosy, despite how well the company has done over the past few years. Indeed, Square stock has been a beast on the long side and has made many loyal investors a hefty sum of cash. But even with the stock market in rally mode for much of 2019, Square stock has been absent.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)What's going on?Shares have been rolling over as it appears there's been a bit of a &quot;buyer's strike&quot; regarding Square. While Square stock had a violent rally off its December lows, shares are actually flat since Jan. 15. Compare that to its peers and Square stock investors may be getting frustrated.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Chinese Stocks That Could Pop On a Trade Deal PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is up 22.5% in the same timeframe, while the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) is up 13%. Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) are up 18% and 28%, respectively. The year-to-date numbers are even worse.Stock YTD Return SQ 17% QQQ 19.3% V 24% MA 33.6% PYPL 33.8% I know it's hard to complain about a 17% gain for the year, but considering the fourth quarter that we endured, a snap-back rally like that is to be expected. The fact that it's lagging the QQQs and has generated just 50% of the return from its most compared to competitor (PYPL), and SQ stock is frustrating.Will that underperformance continue? Trading SQ Stock  Click to EnlargeAbove is the weekly chart for Square stock. You can clearly see that Square was enjoying a nice, solid uptrend (blue line) for the better part of a year. However, that uptrend came to an end in Q4 2018, when the markets took a painful fall. Square, which was already elevated from its uptrend by quite a bit, was no exception to this selloff.In October, SQ stock hit a 52-week high of $101.15. By mid-December, shares had fallen more than 50% at its lows when it hit $49.82.On the bounce, shares ran to that $77.50 to $80 area, which effectively capped SQ stock from January through April. At $81.56 is the 61.8% retracement for the 52-week range, which more or less acted as resistance. Unfortunately, the 38.2% retracement at $69.43 did not support SQ stock on the downside, nor did the 50-week moving average.I worry about Square in the short- to intermediate term if it can't get over some of these technical levels. Specifically, I want to see Square over the 10-week moving average and above the 38.2% retracement. Over downtrend resistance (purple line) would eventually be nice too.If it can't do that though, it's prone to more declines. Those declines are exacerbated in the event that U.S. stocks take a bigger hit. I have my sights on three potential downside levels: $60 is a notable level of both resistance and support and only gave way amid a flood of selling in December. At $55 is the 100-week moving average, which should provide a bounce should SQ stock test it.Finally, a retest of the lows near $50 should attract buyers. I don't expect this level without a larger flush in the broader market. Bottom Line on Square StockSquare has been a multi-year stud, but that action has not translated to 2019. The company still has a terrific growth profile, with analysts modeling revenue and earnings to grow 43.5% and 60% this year, respectively; 2020's forecast is solid too, at 35% and 49% growth, respectively.While management provided a solid full-year outlook on May 1, second-quarter guidance came up a bit short. At 88 times this year's earnings (after the earnings pullback), SQ stock doesn't have much room for error. Disappointing on guidance, however marginal, can sap momentum in a hurry.Let's see where Square stock can firm up and whether it can regain momentum. Over the 10-week will be the first sign of turning it around.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long V.

2019-05-15	2019-05-15 09:01:05	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Is Visa Stock Too Expensive at $160 Or Is There Even More Upside Here?	Payments processor Visa (NYSE:V) has been a gift that keeps on giving for investors who've held on to their shares. V stock is up roughly 21% so far this year and many believe the firm can keep going. The S&P 500 index is up 13.4% in the same period.Source: Shutterstock However, with a price-earnings ratio of 33.1 and a dividend yield that's below 1%, Visa stock is also an expensive buy. While the V stock price is up there, the company has a lot of room to keep on growing and that make the shares a solid addition to long-term investors' portfolios. Payments Processing GoldmineOne of the biggest reasons investors consider Visa stock at all is the fact that the firm is the largest payments processor in the world, as measured by the number of branded cards issued. That's a big deal because the industry itself has a huge growth runway, so owning the largest beneficiary of that trend has its perks. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Stay Far Away From People are abandoning cash and opting instead for credit/debit cards and digital payments. Back in 2016 we saw the number of non-cash purchases overtake cash for the first time, and since then the gap has only gotten wider. Visa has been on the receiving end of a great deal of that growth. In 2018, Visa processed 124 billion transactions on its network -- a step up from the 111 billion it facilitated in 2017.Those rising transaction figures are the reason Visa has been able to consistently produce double-digit growth over the past few years, a trend that most expect to continue throughout the medium term. Growth AheadWith the largest number of outstanding cards, Visa has a lot of power over the fees it can charge merchants and it's used that power to grow its margins. As one of the most widely accepted credit cards, Visa appeals to customers and that in turn makes merchants more willing to pay a premium to accept Visa payments.It's also important to recognize that Visa stock isn't just a credit card play anymore, either. V has also started branching out into the digital payments space with Visa Checkout, and the firm has also took a position in Square (NYSE:SQ), a smaller payments processor with a firm foothold in next-generation payment methods.  Times They Are a' ChangingSome argue that Visa's dominance in the payments processing space is actually a negative. The firm's near duopoly with Mastercard (NYSE:MA) in the credit card space could make it a target for regulatory action, especially as cash payments continue to dwindle and it becomes more and more necessary to have a credit card on-hand. Plus, there's further to fall when you're already at the top. Investors aren't wrong in saying that Visa stock has high expectations to live up to. We saw that materialize in the second quarter when V announced its earnings results. Despite the fact that Visa beat earnings expectations and met revenue predictions, the stock declined as investors digested the news. For those investors who like the payments sector but looking for broader exposure than just one name, the ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF (NYSEArca:IPAY) might be the way to play it, with V stock, MA and SQ among the top holdings in its 40-stock portfolio. Visa Stock's Worth The PriceSure, there are risks when it comes to buying Visa stock. If you're a value investor, it can be worrisome to invest in a stock that's trading near all-time highs. However, it's important to note that Visa is almost always trading near all-time highs because the firm delivers solid growth more often than not.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy on Overcast Days The buy case for Visa stock is a simple one: the firm has a commanding market share in an extremely scalable business. The growth opportunity is there and Visa doesn't have to work hard to get it. While some of its peers like American Express (NYSE:AXP) are considerably cheaper -- at a P/E of 14.9 -- Visa offers a level of stability and security that others can't simply because of its size and reach.As long as you believe that non-cash transactions will continue gaining momentum, V stock will be a worthwhile consideration. Don't let the company's price-tag scare you, it almost never trades at a huge discount. Visa is the kind of stock you buy and hold on to for years, so its worth a look for long-term investors.

Archrival Mastercard is showing similar bullish action. Both stocks are highly rated.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a24bd311-5de9-3697-91de-6b2bb7ae6406/ibd-stock-of-the-day%3A-visa.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-05-14	2019-05-14 17:59:48	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Why the Outlook of Square Stock Is Still Bright	After nearly reaching $75 per share, Square, (NYSE: SQ) stock is changing hands for around $65 per share. Markets became less bullish on SQ stock after SQ provided weak Q2 guidance.Source: Via SquareEven though its Q1 results beat analysts' consensus outlook, the payment processing firm needs to demonstrate that its initiatives such as its latest partnership with Postmates will be fruitful. With a market capitalization of $28 billion and a forward price-earnings ratio of almost 60, SQ stock is more suitable for growth investors. So how significant is its latest partnership announcement?  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk  Deal with PostmatesPostmates is a network of couriers who deliver food, groceries, and alcohol locally. Following the deal with Postmates, Square customers can use Postmates' couriers to get goods to customers who place orders with SQ.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSquare is no stranger to the delivery business. It owns food delivery services firm Caviar, a company it bought in 2014. Yet Postmates will catapult Square's addressable market size because Postmates has a presence in  more than 1,000 cities.After  raising $100 million in January, Postmates is valued at $1.85 billion. Second-Quarter GuidanceSquare needs to grow its addressable market because it lowered its Q2 outlook. It forecast earnings of $0.14 - $0.16 per share of SQ, below the consensus forecast of 18 cents per share of SQ stock . But the top end of the company's full-year revenue guidance range was raised to $2.28 billion from $2.25 billion previously.Many investors clearly sold SQ stock following the guidance because they felt uncertain about SQ's near-term outlook. Yet the company's full-year EPS guidance of $0.74- $0.78 per share was unchanged, indicating that SQ lowered its Q2 EPS guidance because it expects to delay recognizing some of its revenue by a quarter or two. Strong Momentum in Q1Despite the deceleration of Square's business in Q2, the company's  growth in Q1 still justifies the valuation of SQ stock. Specifically, its seller and cash app ecosystem drove total year-over-year revenue growth of 43%. The Valuation of SQ StockThe 22 analysts covering SQ stock are very bullish on it and have an average price target that is about 20% above the stock's recent $66 share price (per Tipranks). If investors think that the company's revenue will grow between 25% and 45% annually for the next five years, a 5-year DCR Revenue Exit model suggests SQ stock could have a fair value that is about 30% above its current price. The Bottom Line on SQThe  downtrend of Square stock  is puzzling because its peers, namely PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Visa (NYSE:V), and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) have all traded higher recently. But the company's near-term slowdown is scaring buyers away and creating selling pressure on SQ stock.Investors who missed the rally that took Square stock to $100 in October 2018 have another chance to pick up SQ at a decent level. Consider initially buying a small number of shares of SQ. And from there, average down or up over the next few months.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Lower transaction fees are one of the key potential benefits to using Facebook's coin: In theory, merchants could reduce payment fees that are often above 2%, and (as Facebook seems to be aware) it would be much easier to facilitate various microtransactions involving Facebook or a third-party developer or publisher through which a consumer either pays or is paid a tiny sum of money.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/426dd030-c025-3a8e-b5bb-bc6c3d468506/facebook-is-clearly-thinking.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-02	2019-05-02 16:15:39	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	The Bull Thesis for Square Stock Is Still Intact After Disappointing Earnings	The whole payment processing sector is doing well. As of yesterday, Square (NYSE:SQ) was up 32% year-to-date which is double the gain of the S&P 500. The metrics are just as positive for Square stock competitors, too.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)But, SQ reported earnings last night and got slammed down 5% on the headline. The dive continued this morning, with Square stock falling another 5% from the open.SQ beat both the top and bottom lines, but second-quarter guidance was lower than analyst forecasts. This is an unforgivable sin on Wall Street these days, and investors are punishing Square stock &quot;appropriately.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmong other points of contention, SQ management reported a lower gross payment volume than expected. The bears really sunk their teeth into this highlight.  * 5 Stocks to Sell in May Before Investors Go Away Meanwhile, CEO Jack Dorsey's message was that the company is still on target to grow its ecosystem. This is a term that works for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) so perhaps it will for SQ eventually, but it hasn't yet.In reality, after the success of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) earnings, investors expect the same from Square. So this exaggerates the disappointment when the results are not ideal. This is the opposite of what happened with AAPL's earnings situation. Wednesday's rip was perhaps bigger as investors sigh of relief that AAPL earnings were not as bad as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).What didn't help matters for SQ? CFO Amrita Ahuja noted that they will reinvest back into the business. This is code for they will spend a lot of money in order to keep up. Square does face formidable competition from PYPL, Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA), so they have to spend to compete.The exciting part about SQ is that it's the new kid on the block. But as it grows it will come into face to face competitive situation with these behemoths. So this is merely an adjustment period and should not change the overall bullish thesis. Management has been executing on plans well to earn our trust and nothing in this report tells us otherwise yet. Trading Square StockSo is this the right time to catch the falling knife? No, but it depends on the time frames of individual investors.So if I am long the stock I don't panic out of it. There is support relief below these levels even after the dip. The zone around $65 per share has been pivotal for almost a year. This should act as support on the way down.Areas of contentions like this are where both bulls and bears agree on value so they fight it out hard. This creates a stall which, in this case, would be support. This is not a hard line in the sand but rather a zone. So even though a big dip of this size usually is not a one-day event, the selling will abate the deeper SQ goes into the pivotal zone. Even if it fails, there is another one just $5 below it.Furthermore, there still is a bullish pattern in play that suggests that SQ stock is targeting $92 per share and this dip doesn't yet kill it. As long as the dip doesn't accelerate the upside scenario is still viable. I do have to admit that this dip severely reduces the odds of it working out this coming quarter.Square stock is not cheap as it sells at nine times sales. But this is not absolutely nuts as it is in line with say Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Visa and MasterCard actually trade at 16 times sales but they have the benefit of running a huge profit. SQ still is not profitable.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May In the long term, Square is likely to get its act together. They operate in a booming area of electronic payments. The whole world is in the middle of a revolution that is determined to migrate all transaction to electronic format. So as long as management stays on task any serious dip is a buying opportunity of Square stock.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-05-01	2019-05-01 12:27:44	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Trade of the Day: MasterCard Stock Is Going Parabolic	The more the sharp year-to-date rally continues the more I see those ominous parabolic stock charts pop up. The most recent on my screens is MasterCard (NYSE:MA), which thanks to its post-earnings rally on Tuesday, April 30, is now record overbought. Active investors and traders could look to play MA stock on the short side for a trade with defined risk.Source: Hakan Dahlstrom via Flickr (Modified)Before digging deeper into my trade idea for MasterCard stock, let's first examine why overbought or oversold stocks tend to offer good so-called &quot;mean-reversion&quot; trading opportunities, but trading and investing with the trend still ultimately offers better opportunities. This will give us a better understanding of the opportunity in MA.The overbought and oversold stocks I look at for mean-reversion trades in are ones where the stock in question has flipped its chart from steep to vertical, i.e., parabolic, and those opportunities -- in my 21 years of trading experience -- offer some of the highest chances for profitability.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips MA Stock Charts  Click to EnlargeLooking at the multi-year weekly chart of MA stock we see that it has been one heck of a performer over the years. But each time it goes from steep to vertical the stock pauses or mean-reverts lower for a period. Currently, on this longer-term chart, we can see that the stock is once again far removed from its longer-term moving averages while also reaching a fresh all-time overbought reading on the weekly MACD momentum oscillator at the bottom of the chart.To be clear, even this parabolic move does not mean the stock has to immediately reverse gears lower, but in my long-time experience the acceleration to the upside at this speed is unsustainable and at the very least the upside is limited, i.e., capped for the time being.  * 10 A-Rated Stocks the Smart Money Is Piling Into   Click to EnlargeOn the daily chart, we see that MA stock has been pushing higher in 2019 in a well-defined albeit steep slope with the rare multi-day pullback along the way.Over the past two weeks, MasterCard stock rallied in an ever tighter range right into the April 30 earnings report. And to top this off, following the earnings report, the stock rallied even more … taking the steep year-to-date rally into parabolic take-off mode.To look for some reference price levels, I drew a couple of simple yet time-tested lines on the chart. The lower chart defines the 2019 up-trend, while the upper chart defines the 16-month up-trend. After the April 30 rally MA stock is now only a stone's throw away from the upper resistance line, i.e., a couple of percentage points higher. If we take those two lines together we can see a rising wedge pattern, that historically and ultimately lends itself well to a sharp mean-reversion move lower.To explain this high probability candlestick pattern in detail, I am hosting a special webinar on May 1 for InvestorPlace readers. Register here.Active investors and traders at this juncture could look to leg into short positions in MA stock around the $250 - $260 area. The next downside target is $240. Should the stock simply push sideways from here for a few weeks and then flash a bullish reversal higher, a stop loss would trigger on this trade. Alternatively, options traders could look to buy simple at the money puts or put spreads using June or (more conservatively) July options.Attend Serge Berger's special webinar: The highest probability candlestick pattern, period.

2019-05-01	2019-05-01 10:40:20	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	From Here It Looks as If Nothing Can Stop PayPal Stock	Shares of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) continued on their torrid run higher in late April after the digital payments provider delivered first quarter numbers that broadly underscored the company's healthy long term growth narrative. Investors were reassured that it remains the unchallenged leader in the secular growth digital payments market, and that the drivers pushing forward this company remain as vigorous as ever. Consequently, the PayPal stock charged higher.Source: Shutterstock This is nothing new for PYPL stock. Over the past several years, the growth narrative supporting PayPal has remained healthy, the numbers have remained robust, and the stock has remained on an upward trajectory. That's why PYPL stock is up more than 200% over the past five years, versus a 40% gain for the S&P 500.Over-performance in PYPL stock will persist. In the big picture, the same things that got PayPal here (i.e. a huge digital payment shift powering big revenue growth and steady margin expansion, against the backdrop of a stable global economy) will continue for the foreseeable future. As such, PYPL stock projects to remain on a winning trajectory for the next several years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares From a numbers perspective, fundamentals support upside in the stock to $125 in 2019. Thus, with PayPal stock trading around $110 today, upside over the next few months looks good. Strong Q1 NumbersPayPal just reported first quarter numbers. From an expectations standpoint, the numbers were mixed. First quarter profits beat. Revenues were in-line. The second quarter guide met on profits, but came in below for revenues. Meanwhile, the full-year revenue guide was in-line with expectations, and profits were guided above the consensus estimate.In the big picture, though, quarterly beats/misses are just noise for PayPal. The bull thesis on PayPal stock boils down to two things. One, the digital payments shift is happening very quickly, and isn't slowing. Two, PayPal is the face of that digital payments shift, without any major or worrisome competition.As such, all investors need out of quarterly earnings is for the numbers to broadly confirm those two things. How? Continued robust revenue growth and healthy margin expansion. Across the board, PayPal delivered just that this quarter. See the important numbers below:  * Total Payment Volume growth of 25%. This marks the third quarter in a row of 25% TPV growth. TPV growth is expected to stabilize at this level, and come in at up ~25% for the full year, too. Thus, TPV growth has been, is, and remains stable north of 20%.  * Active Account growth of 17%. This marks the second consecutive quarter of 17% account growth. That 17% mark is up from 15% in the year-ago quarter and 10% in the two years ago quarter. Thus, account growth is accelerating higher despite tougher laps.  * Adjusted revenue growth came in right around 20% again and is expected to come in around 20% again this year. Thus, revenue growth remains stable around 20%.  * Operating margins expanded 10 basis points in the quarter, and are guided to keep expanding for the full year. Margins have been on a multi-year uptrend. This uptrend isn't going to end anytime soon.Overall, PayPal's numbers underscored the obvious. The digital payments shift is alive and well, and PayPal remains king in that market. So long as those things remain true - and the valuation remains reasonable - PayPal stock will trend higher. Fundamentals Support Upside to $125Zooming out to the big picture, long term growth fundamentals create a visible pathway for PYPL stock to $125 in 2019. The key to the upside? Robust e-commerce growth, and PayPal maintaining its position as a digital payments leader.In 2016, ecommerce accounted for less than 9% of global retail sales. Last year, the ecommerce penetration level reached nearly 12%. By 2021, eMarketer projects it will run towards 18%. And, assuming current secular trends persist, ecommerce will likely run towards 25% of total retail sales by 2025. Meanwhile, global retail sales are moving higher by a few percentage points every year given population growth, increased urbanization, and inflation.Thus, the ecommerce market is one defined by rapidly rising share in a stable growth retail sales market. Ultimately, that combination positions ecommerce retail sales to grow at a healthy 15%-plus clip for the foreseeable future.PayPal is at the center of that 15%-plus growth market. The more sales move to the digital channel, the more consumers will adopt digital payment methods. Of those digital payment methods, PayPal is among the most popular, and has maintained that title despite rising competition.Consequently, as the commerce market grows at 15%-plus rate over the next several years, PayPal's payment volume and revenues should rise at a similar 15%-plus pace.A 15%-plus revenue growth rate, on top of gradual margin expansion, should reasonably drive PayPal's EPS towards $8 by fiscal 2025. Payment processor stocks, like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), normally trade around 25 forward earnings. Based on that payment processor average 25 forward multiple, a reasonable fiscal 2024 price target for PYPL stock is $200. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 price target of roughly $125. Bottom Line on PayPal StockPayPal's first quarter earnings report was mixed in terms of beating/missing Street expectations, but that's largely irrelevant. What's important is that through continued robust revenue growth and margin expansion the numbers underscore that the long term growth narrative supporting PYPL stock remains as healthy as ever.So long as that remains true, PayPalstock will remain on a winning trajectory towards $125 in 2019.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long PYPL.

S&P 500 e-mini futures were last up 0.2% and jumped  following the report from Apple, which forecast  stronger-than-expected third-quarter revenue.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-p-500-posts-222525450.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-04-18	2019-04-18 19:15:10	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Why You Should Buy and Hold American Express Stock	Although this year the stock market sentiment is in a much better state, the banks still have their reputation that they cannot hold their rallies. But therein lies part of the opportunity in American Express (NYSE:AXP) stock today.Source:  Marcus Quigmire Via FlickrThis round of bank earnings has so far gone much better than the last one. There is some chatter about a sustainable rally in their stocks. On Tuesday we even saw a flip from red to green in stocks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).This hasn't happened in a while, so perhaps the trend that banks can't hold their greens is dying. If so then this will provide a lift to AXP stock as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, transaction companies like AXP, Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Square (NYSE:SQ) rally in sympathy with money center banks. So if the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) rallies then so will the transactors like AXP.In addition, AXP is an excellent financial stock that has proven over the years that they can manage through adversity. Case in point was the debacle over losing the Costco (NASDAQ:COST) account. The stock suffered for a while but has since set new all-time highs.I was lucky to ride the last mega breakout in AXP from the December lows. American Express rallied over 25% so today I am trying to catch the next opportunity. Usually, I consider these technical opportunities tactical trades but this one doubles as a long term conviction investment. This is a stock I want to own for the long term.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever The reaction this morning is slightly negative from the earnings. Management reported a boring quarter where they barely beat the bottom line and narrowly missed sales. The forward guidance was in line so they gave traders nothing to cheer. So AXP will move in line with the overall equity market for now.So if this rally in stocks continues, then AXP stock has the opportunity to break out from $114.40 to target another $10 run from there. There will be resistance there but if the bulls can close above it then the bears will be tired so the stock will overshoot higher.The macroeconomic condition still favors the bullish thesis. We do have threats from lingering headlines of tariff wars. But as we approach another round of elections means that those deals will happen so we go back to trading the profit and loss statements rather than headlines.Most importantly, the threat from the Federal Reserve inverting the curve has disappeared. They have affirmed that they won't cause the short term rates rise above the long term rates so this relives fears for banks. The steeper the curve the better are their profits.For American Express stock, the short term price action from the earnings headline is meaningless for the long term. All global transactions will be electronic so the demand on their services will continue to increase. There are only but a few companies that serve this market and they are a global household name. So they are well set to continue to prosper for years.Then there is the China market opportunity. The U.S. and China are nearing a deal where companies like AXP could have a new opportunity become available in the largest market on the planet.The short term technical threat for AXP stock is at $108 per share. If the bears push price below it they could target $102 per share. This is not a forecast but it is a scenario that could unfold in the next few weeks. But even then, this won't change the overall opportunity for the long term.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-04-17	2019-04-17 16:21:32	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Going Into Earnings, Is Visa Stock Everywhere You Want It to Be?	Visa (NYSE:V) is slated to reports its second-quarter earnings on Apr. 24 after the market closes. The payments processing giant continues to build market share and establish a reputation for beating earnings estimates,  enabling Visa stock to trade near its all-time highs.Source: Shutterstock However, the company has begun to lose one high-profile customer. Moreover, a well-funded competitor has entered the credit-card business. Those developments could cause some owners of V stock to question its rising price-earnings multiple.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth Although those issues don't pose an immediate threat to Visa's dominance, they could make investors think twice about buying Visa stock at its current levels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Visa Should Beat Analysts' Estimates, But Is That Enough?For the second quarter, analysts on average expects Visa's  earnings per share to come in at $1.24. If Visa hits that target, its EPS will have risen 11.7% year-over-year. Analysts' consensus revenue estimate is $5.46 billion, versus the $5.07 billion of revenue that the company reported  in the same quarter of 2018.Since V has exceeded analysts' consensus earnings expectations in each of the previous four quarters, its Q2 results will probably beat the consensus outlook as well. As our society continues to increasingly give up cash, Visa and its peers should continue to benefit from that trend.Furthermore, Visa continues to gain market share from archrival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) as well as peers such as American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover (NYSE:DFS). As late as the third quarter of last year, Visa claimed more than 61% of total U.S. card volume. That makes Visa stock a compelling long-term buy on any pullback, even if the company's Q2 results are surprisingly negative.However, I see signs that the short-term outlook of Visa is not entirely positive. The price-earnings  ratio of Visa stock now stands at around 34.5. That comes in slightly ahead of the long-term average multiple of V stock, which is about 32.6. Since Visa's profit is expected to increase 15.2% this year, I think Visa stock price is mildly overvalued.Meanwhile, V stock looks less than compelling when investors can buy AXP stock at about 14 times its earnings. By buying AXP, whose profits are expected to rise 11% this year,  traders obtain about 72% of the growth of Visa at around 40% of the price. Visa Stock Faces Rising ThreatsAlso, Visa has used its dominant position to raise the fees that it charges merchants. That has prompted Kroger (NYSE:KR) to refuse to accept Visa cards at some of its locations. For now, Kroger is only refusing to accept Visa's credit cards at 21 of its Foods Co. stores in California. However, it will soon extend this ban to both its Smith's Food and Drug stores and its fuel centers in seven states.That places V in an awkward position. If Kroger stops accepting Visa at all of its stores or if other retailers start refusing to accept Visa cards at some of their stores, Visa's revenues could meaningfully drop. However, if Visa relents and lowers its fees, that will likely reduce its profits, negatively impacting  Visa stock.Moreover, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has partnered with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Mastercard on its new Apple Card. At first glance, the card provides some benefits, such as faster cash-back rewards and enhanced security, since it does not use numbers.Still, it appears that the card will limit most of those benefits to consumers who are already using Apple's iOS ecosystem. For that reason, I would not expect the Apple Card to supplant Visa's dominant position. However, Apple Card could take market share from Visa, negatively impacting the Visa stock price. Concluding Thoughts on Visa StockAlthough Visa will more than likely post higher-than-expected earnings and revenue, emerging competitive threats could create doubts about Visa stock.Meanwhile, the valuations of Visa stock have begun to climb above their long-term averages. Also, Visa's rising fees have started to prompt merchants to push their customers to other cards. Furthermore, the Apple Card  will give consumers another reason to avoid Visa.Despite the new threats, Visa stock should continue to benefit from double-digit profit growth. However, retailers and customers will take advantage of  the lower fees of Visa's peers. Also, traders can invest in a credit-card network at a much lower multiple by buying AXP stock.As a result, the driving force of Visa stock could be the rising threats of better alternatives for multiple players. That does not mean investors should sell Visa stock. But investors still need to account for those dangers when they're considering buying V stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-04-16	2019-04-16 14:48:22	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	AXP Earnings Look Key for American Express Stock	It seems overly anxious to argue that American Express (NYSE:AXP) stock needs big first-quarter results. After all, American Express stock is doing just fine, even if it's been quiet.Source: Shutterstock AXP stock did dip sharply in December, but it's recovered those losses. Over the last year, American Express stock has gained nearly 17%, and it has more than doubled in the last three-plus years.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Still, AXP earnings, due to be reported on Thursday morning, do look reasonably important. The outlook of AXP stock still seems somewhat skeptical, if not outright bearish. Investors are worried about its growth and market share. Its Q4 earnings were disappointing, but the market quickly moved on and kept pushing American Express stock higher. Investors may not be so forgiving if AXP earnings are disappointing again on Thursday.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAXP stock has twice failed to break through resistance at about $113, and the average Street price target for American Express stock of $118 suggests an increase of  just 6% from its current level.A &quot;beat and raise&quot; Q1 would likely cause analysts to raise their price targets on AXP stock, leaving AXP well-positioned to reach new highs. If AXP earnings miss expectations, however,  investors may have concerns  about AXP's growth, causing American Express stock to at best trade sideways, as it has for nearly seven months now.As a result, Thursday's earnings do seem to be important for American Express stock,  and investors should review them closely. Expectations for AXP EarningsWall Street is expecting a moderately slow start to the year for American Express. Analysts' consensus revenue estimate projects just 7.6%  year-over-year, top-line growth, below the company's full-year guidance of 8%-10%. The company's margins are expected to be pretty much flat, and analysts on average expect its earnings per share to come in at $1.98, up 6.5% year-over-year.That, too suggests improvement over the rest of the year. Consensus for 2019 as a whole is modestly above the midpoint of the company's guidance, and projects 11% EPS growth.That's good news for AXP stock. AXP is not exactly in a &quot;no-lose&quot; situation, but analysts already expect its growth to accelerate as the year goes on. An in-line quarter, or even a modest miss, won't necessarily endanger that outlook.On the other hand, if AXP results solidly beat expectations, its outlook may get more interesting.  Under that scenario, American Express will have started the year strongly, and will still have the same room for improvement during the rest of the year. Full-year growth estimates may well get raised, and the earnings multiple assigned to American Express stock can also rise. If that occurs, AXP  can reach new highs. AXP Stock and the Post-Earnings CallThat said, the numbers aren't going to be the only aspect of the release to which investors will pay close attention. American Express re-upped its partnership with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) earlier this month. That was a big win for AmEx, which already had lost co-branding agreements with Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU).But American Express had to pay up for the win. It was Delta stock that soared on the news, given that its payments from the deal will double in five years. The end results of that negotiation certainly suggests that American Express' edge over rivals Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has narrowed.So investors will have concerns about AXP's cost and market share  Visa and Mastercard simply are growing faster than AmEx. And the main concern about American Express - and the reason AXP stock is so much cheaper than V and MA - is that at some point, its earnings simply are going to stall out. The entrance of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) into the space only adds to those worries.There likely will be some questions about the Delta deal  and the kind of returns American Express expects on the resulting $3 billion-plus increase in annual spending. Analysts will want management's take on the Apple Card as well. AmEx needs to answer those questions well, and it needs to convince analysts and investors that its place in the credit-card industry is secure. Be Careful With American Express StockAll told, AXP's Q1 results do seem  poised to change the outlook of AXP stock. A beat-and-raise quarter will suggest that AXP's growth remains intact, making the 12.4  forward, price-earnings multiple of AXP stock seem awfully cheap. Any weakness - whether in the company's results or its guidance - will cause investors to ask if fears about AXP's growth are reasonable.That doesn't mean AXP stock is going to move 10% or more on Thursday; AXP simply isn't that type of stock. Rather, AXP's Q1 earnings could shape how American Express stock trades over the next two months  and determine whether AXP stock can finally break through resistance.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-04-15	2019-04-15 11:15:09	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Square Stock Is Taking a Breather, but There’s Lots More Growth Ahead	Since the company's initial public offering, Square (NYSE:SQ) blitzkrieged its way to the top of the markets. While shares have come down substantially from its peak, it's still a winner by almost any measure. For example, on a year-to-date basis, Square stock has gained a very impressive 38%.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)I first came across Square's payment-processing device at an auto-repair shop. My car's windshield suffered a severe-enough crack that required replacement. Once the work was done, I pulled out my credit card. The shop's owner took out his Square-armed smartphone and swiped my card. At that moment, I should have invested in Square stock.Of course, the key to the tech firm's success is disruption. What I recognized on the day my windshield died was that independent companies can finally compete with the big boys. Prior to Square and its innovative device, small-business owners had to invest in clunky machines tied to often-unfavorable contracts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith Square came capacity and freedom. It was a simple idea with a small touch, but it worked. The payment-processing device leveled the playing field, essentially forcing businesses to compete on product and service quality, not resource advantages. That alone is enough for most people to consider buying Square stock.  * 7 Marijuana Companies: Which Pot Stocks Should You Buy? Another reason is the growth of small business in America. Last year, this segment employed nearly 48% of the private-sector workforce. Even more impressive, small businesses number over 30 million.However, not everything surrounding SQ stock is bullish; namely, the share price. While SQ has skyrocketed since the start of the year, it's gone flat since mid-February. That worries folks because it appears the tech firm can go either way.Does Square stock have another catalyst to run on? Square Stock to Ride Disruption Narrative 2.0It turns out, SQ has another long-term story that can shake shares out of its present funk. In the first go-around, the company completely overturned the payment-processing sector. Now, management is turning its attention toward the payment platform itself.Earlier this year, Square announced that it would launch a new debit card aimed at small businesses. While the concept is hardly novel, this particular variation offers unique benefits.For instance, the Square card allows business owners to immediately spend the funds that they earn through their company's sales. This way, owners don't have to wait until the revenues hit their bank accounts, thereby improving cash flow.Another intriguing factor boosting prospects for the card and SQ stock is the purchase discount. If a card-holder elects to do business with fellow Square merchants, he or she will receive a 2.75% discount. That's a sizable benefit, especially compared to traditional charge cards' miserly offerings.In turn, KeyBanc analyst Josh Beck reiterated his &quot;overweight&quot; rating, as well as his $100 target for Square stock. But Beck also noted that Square's debit card will perform better than most people expect. I completely agree with him.Beck addresses the broader narrative, pointing out that roughly 40% of small businesses don't have a business-specific charge card. In other words, this is a grossly-underserved market that SQ can penetrate and later dominate.But what I view as critically important are the nuanced benefits. For instance, the Square card allows users to easily separate business and personal expenses. That might not seem like a big deal until tax season. Then, it can really save much frustration.I suspect that word-of-mouth of all platforms can drive home the conveniences of the Square card. This should eventually translate to a higher price for SQ stock. Demographics and SQ StockIf that doesn't convince you that Square stock is likely to move higher, consider demographic behaviors. Millennials don't just represent the largest workforce in the U.S. Increasingly, they've proven to the most entrepreneurial-minded.According to one survey, 66% of young Americans aspire to start their own businesses. Not only that, this trend crosses international borders. Oxford University released data that showed that the number of entrepreneurial-focused students increased significantly in recent years.Naturally, this rising trend bolsters the long-term case for Square stock. But it goes beyond that. You see, Square doesn't just provide tools in the way that Visa (NYSE:V) or Mastercard (NYSE:MA) does. Instead, it provides simple but effective platforms that encourage business growth.Again, you might think on the surface that differentiating personal and business expenses is a minor concept. And actually, you'd be right. However, it also mitigates one of the most cumbersome administrative tasks associated with owning a business. That's the type of smart thinking that separates SQ stock from the rest.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-07	2019-04-07 21:08:48	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Will Apple’s Pivot to Services Reignite Its Growth Story?	Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has dramatically underperformed over the past six months. AAPL stock is still down nearly 20% from its recent peak, whereas the stock market as a whole is approaching new all-time highs. And tech stocks, in general, have led the 2019 rebound, leaving Apple in the dust.Source: Apple It's not hard to see why. In January, Apple shocked the world with a sales warning. That was the first time Apple issued a sales warning since way back in 2002. Now, to be fair, this isn't the first time that Apple has had a soft hardware cycle.Apple's revenues turned negative year over year in both 2013 and 2016 during the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6s cycles.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStill, this is arguably the worst hardware sales period for Apple within the iPhone age, given the revenue warning. And investors have been slow to forgive AAPL stock.  * 7 A-Rated Healthcare Stocks for Industry Expansion For one thing, CFO Luca Maestri said just months earlier that Apple was anticipating its strongest holiday line-up and sales yet. So to miss on sales by billions of dollars for the quarter came as quite the blow. Not surprisingly, Apple is refocusing investor attention elsewhere with its new push. Apple's Hardware Sales Are Reaching LimitsOn various occasions, I've suggested that Apple has been an anomaly in that it can make serious money on hardware. In general, tech companies that make big profits in hardware tend to lose strength quickly. It's simply too easy for competitors to make similar products at lower prices. For every Apple that dominates a field for ages, you have a Nokia or Blackberry (NYSE:BB) that has a few peak years and then fades to irrelevancy.However, it's starting to look like even Apple is running into limits in terms of how much profits it can wring out of hardware. The addressable share of the market for high-end smartphones is only so large. Particularly in emerging markets, most people will buy cheaper options from the likes of Samsung or Huawei. And even on iPhone pricing, there appears to be a ceiling where some people say enough is enough.Throw in how powerful the average iPhone is now, and users feel less compelled to upgrade with every new product launch. In general, there simply isn't a must-have feature with each new model that drives upgrades if users' previous phone is still working and holds a good charge. Apple Turns to ServicesLast week, Apple announced a ton of new and improved service offerings. Arguably the most interesting and important of these was the news of an Apple Card to take on the likes of Visa (NYSE:V). Partnering with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) for payment processing, the Apple Card could theoretically be a serious rival to Visa. That wasn't it for announcements though. Apple is also rolling out an improved version of Apple TV, an Apple News feature, and an Apple Arcade gaming service.In theory, these could all be interesting additions for Apple that could add significant revenue streams. Apple News, for example, by offering a subscription service for journalism could help that industry turn its fortunes around in the digital age, as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) did for music. It's unlikely to generate big revenues for Apple at least in the near term though. Same for the arcade, which may shift revenues from in app purchases to subscription but is unlikely to make the overall pie much bigger, at least in the short run.And for the bigger announcements, there are serious questions about both. Apple TV+ seems too small to be a serious Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) challenger. If Apple spends $1 billion a year on original content, that's something, but it's only a drop in the bucket compared to Netflix's $8 billion budget, to say nothing of Disney (NYSE:DIS) and other traditional content creators. And over in credit cards, our Josh Enomoto described how Apple's card is a &quot;gimmicky&quot; offering which brings more &quot;hype than substance&quot;. For now, Apple has a lot left to prove with its new services offerings. AAPL Stock VerdictCompared to other tech stocks, AAPL stock looks attractive by comparison. Assuming the market continues moving to new all-time highs, it's not hard to imagine AAPL stock playing catch-up and moving back toward its own previous high at $233/share.In the longer-run, however, I remain an Apple skeptic. The company has largely tapped the growth potential of its major developed markets. People who are going to buy Apple smartphones are already doing so - where's the new marginal consumer that hasn't bought Apple products yet?Meanwhile, in emerging markets, Apple faces a huge challenge. They don't have the same sort of lock-in that they do on consumers in developed markets. In China in particular, which was supposed to be Apple's next big thing, sales are instead going the other direction. That's because WeChat, which runs on all smartphones, is the key must-have application, rather than Apple OS. Chinese consumers are increasingly happy to use other smartphone makers, as Apple OS and its associated ecosystem isn't a primary selling point that makes customers loyal.Overall, Apple's move to services is probably a smart play. Recurring revenue is a great business model, and Wall Street will bid your stock up as you get more of it. In certain markets, such as the U.S., Apple services will probably deliver major growth. As we've seen overseas, however, with something like Apple Music versus Spotify, Apple's brand matters much less in emerging markets. And as such, Apple services probably won't be enough, at least on its own, to make up for stagnating hardware sales.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned GS stock and had no positions in any of the other aforementioned securities.

2019-04-03	2019-04-03 20:35:42	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Square Stock Is Charging for a Big Move	Despite the recent rallies in the market, the media rhetoric continues to be filled with a bearish tone. Everyone is expecting this party to end badly even though there is no evidence of impending doom. We hear it ten times a day: 'we've come so far so fast.' So using this logic, we should up our car insurance policy or stop driving if we haven't wrecked in a while.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified) Sure we have a flattening yield curve but that is not reason to sell stocks of great companies who are still set up for success. Square (NYSE:SQ) is one that still deserve some attention even here near all-time highs. SQ belongs to a group of financial stocks that I call the transactors. So it competes with behemoths like Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and it is holding its own. SQ is the relatively new kid on the block -- a new kid who is kicking ass and taking names. The Demand for SQ Services Is Getting StrongerYear to date, Square stock is up 35% which is more than double that of the S&P 500 and three times more than the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF). Clearly investors like what they see from the company. The advent of blockchain and even the bitcoin craze contributed to the popularity of these transactor companies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut this is not just hype. The need for SQ services is real. The globe is migrating its banking to electronic format. Like everything else nowadays, we want our money fast and cheap and SQ helps get that done.This is a trend that is not going to reverse, so the future is bright for as long as the financial world doesn't collapse.Even though, relatively speaking, the company is young, management has so far proven itself competent. So I consider buying Square stock a viable long-term investment. I am confident that if the stock market in general is higher, then so is SQ.Fundamentally, critics argue that Square's value is too rich and they'd be right. But in this case, SQ is still a growth company so I don't worry so much about its margins. They are suppose to spend a lot to grow. Later, when they start to mature, I'd worry about increasing profitability. This is true for any growth stock I analyze. Trading SQ StockFor those who prefer to trade short term, SQ presents a challenge. This is a momentum stock so it moves fast in both directions. This makes it impossible to spot clear entry and exit points.But in this case there are some important technical clues we can decipher from the charts. The range for SQ stock has recently tightened. In the past year, it's touched both $100 and $50 per share and now it sits exactly in the middle. This builds up energy in the chart that needs to explode, which usually forebodes a big move to release the built up tension in the price.Since we don't know about the direction of the move we then find the important lines to watch here. My hunch is that it will be a rally since the bulls are still in charge of this market and SQ has no specific reason to fall on its own. So if I were to place a bet, I'd say SQ will be breaking it out soon.Towards that, the next three levels to watch are $76.75, $79.25 and $82.90. Each is a mini-breakout level that would bring the next one into its target zone. So depending on my time frame I'd pick one of them to chase SQ stock. If it moves above it then I'd expect it to invite more momentum buyers into it.Of the three, the $83 zone is the most significant. It was where SQ failed worst late February and November so clearly neither bulls nor bears will let it go without a fight. And on the way up, this creates congestion which is resistance to the rally. But if the bulls prevail then they overshoot $10 higher.But since we are still in geopolitical headline mode then I'd have to set stop losses. SQ needs to hold $71.50 else it would trigger an opposite and bearish pattern that would invite momentum sellers.Regardless of the short-term risks, there are opportunities in owning SQ stock for the long term more so than shorting it. If the concept of buying into high valuation is insurmountable then I should at least invest in either Visa or MasterCard because the sector is worth the risk.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-04-03	2019-04-03 18:45:06	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Can Apple Card Charge Up Apple Stock?	The end of March was an eventful period for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). During the final week of the first quarter, Apple held a widely anticipated event. Among the A-listers were Jennifer Aniston, Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon.Source: Shutterstock One of the big reveals at the Apple event was Apple Card, the iPhone maker's first foray into the credit-card business.A self-proclaimed innovative credit card, AAPL emphasized its ability to help customers &quot;lead a healthier financial life.&quot; Moreover, the &quot;Apple Card is built into the Apple Wallet app on iPhone, offering customers a familiar experience with Apple Pay and the ability to manage their card right on iPhone.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVia its Apple Pay mobile payments business, the tech firm has long been a player in the mobile payments arena. With Apple Card, it's looking to bolster its fintech and financial services footprints. Debuting in the U.S. this summer, the card is designed to offer a competitive alternative to traditional, rewards-based credit cards.  * 8 Best Stocks to Buy for an April Rally &quot;Customers will receive a percentage of every Apple Card purchase amount back as Daily Cash,&quot; said AAPL's management team. Unlike other reward programs, members can receive qualifying Daily Cash immediately for their personal usage. Furthermore, every time customers use Apple Card in conjunction with Apple Pay, they'll receive 2% Daily Cash. If they make purchases through the company's retail channels, that figure bumps up to 3%.With 2% cash back, Apple's credit-card venture represents a direct threat to the establishment. Several competing options only offer 1% to 1.5% cash-back rewards on everyday purchases. Apple Card Boasts Some CredibilityIt is too early to assess the impact of this new venture on Apple stock. In the final week of March, AAPL closed modestly lower. But for the month, shares jumped 9.70%, capping a first-quarter gain of 20.4%.Despite some hesitation toward Apple's new venture, the Apple Card levers serious clout. For instance, Apple partnered with Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) to make the card a reality. Goldman, too, benefits strongly from the newfound relationship. The banking giant has been expanding its footprint in the consumer-finance space for several years. Additionally, Goldman's consumer-finance business, Marcus, has more than three million customers, &quot;$45 billion in deposits and $5 billion in consumer loan balances.&quot;With Goldman as the issuing bank, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) stepped up to provide branding and the global payments network. Apple also introduced a titanium card, which the company believes has some enhanced security features compared to traditional charge cards.The details certainly intrigue. According to the tech firm:With no card number, CVV security code, expiration date or signature on the card, Apple Card is more secure than any other physical credit card. All this information is easily accessible in Wallet to use in apps and on websites. For purchases made with the titanium Apple Card, customers will get 1 percent Daily Cash. Bottom Line for Apple StockApple Card could prove to be a nice accompaniment to the underlying company's other revenue streams. But for now, Wall Street is more concerned with declining iPhone sales. Also, AAPL lags in streaming content and the entertainment arena.Here, investors wanted answers about exactly how the device maker's foray into original content will change entertainment. They left largely unimpressed with management's commentary on their streaming service, leaving many questions unanswered.With Apple still scuffling in the streaming industry, analysts continue floating the idea of a takeover of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). However, large-scale acquisitions historically are not part of the company's DNA.So at the end of the day, AAPL has more pressing issues to address to assuage investors. While their plastic venture is interesting, it just doesn't have enough impetus to move the needle for Apple stock.As of this writing, Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-28	2019-03-28 13:39:13	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Don’t Let the Gimmicky Apple Card Turn You Away From Visa Stock	When it comes to widely-distributed credit cards, only two names come to mind: Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). While not attacking other rivals in the sector, these two have long battled for nominal supremacy. As a result, it's not surprising to see Visa stock respond positively over the years.Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrFor decades, the Visa slogan was &quot;It's everywhere you want to be.&quot; And with 323 million cardholders, that message clearly resonated with consumers worldwide. For starters, subscriber count notably exceeds Mastercard at 191 million cardholders. Most critically, over eight million merchants accept Visa, invariably bolstering the V stock price.That sentiment has held true this year as well. On a year-to-date basis, V stock is up nearly 20%, contradicting worries of a global economic slowdown. However, an unlikely competitor has now entered the fray.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Genomic Testing Stocks That Can Ease the Sting of Theranos  Visa Has a New RivalAt the start of this week, consumer-technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched their product showcase. Celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, and even Big Bird made appearances, talking up all things Apple.Of particular interest to Visa's management team, as well as Visa stakeholders, is the Apple Card. Working in conjunction with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) as the bank issuer and Mastercard for payment processing, Apple marketed their new credit card as a product for the masses. It will feature zero fees, a simple interface, and of course, synergistic compatibility with the iPhone and other i-devices.On paper, the new Apple Card threatens Visa in a number of core areas. Primarily, the tech firm aims to disrupt Visa's market share through selling points that appeal to the broader public. While AAPL didn't dive into details regarding interest rates, they implied that they'll accept a wide range of credit scores.Clearly, they're not attempting to compete with the American Express (NYSE:AXP) Centurion Card, which is invitation only. And with Apple's partnership with Mastercard, it's obvious that their focus is on Visa and indirectly, the V stock price.Secondly, almost a billion people actively use their iPhones. Thus, even if Apple stays exclusively within their ecosystem for their credit card, this is still a massive ecosystem. Furthermore, iPhone users are more likely to own other Apple products, enhancing engagement.Finally, iPhone app users have a much higher income than their Android-based counterparts. We're talking an average salary of $85,000 compared to $61,000. Therefore, Apple doesn't necessarily have to win the nominal game in order to win big. Naturally, this concerns folks who are heavily vested in Visa stock. More Hype Than SubstanceAt the same time, I wouldn't get overly worried. Yes, the Apple Card does have some strong attributes. However, we should also consider this latest product's vulnerabilities.First, AAPL has found itself in an awkward position: running low on good ideas, and falling behind on others. Despite substantial efforts, the company's revenues are heavily leveraged towards iPhone sales. Without the iconic smartphone, it's a pretty generic organization.That last statement sounds inflammatory until you consider that names like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) have taken the lead in products like smart speakers. They're also venturing out into viable growth channels like cloud computing and even video games.On the other hand, Apple has a credit card. It's neat and trendy, but it's still a credit card, something that's been around for ages. Since Visa is the top dog in this arena, I doubt the debutant will hurt Visa stock.Second, for all practical intents and purposes, the Apple Card is yet another Apple product. Translation: it's probably not going to work well outside the company's ecosystem. As I mentioned earlier, AAPL levers an enviable network. However, to win the credit card wars, you need the numbers.Sure, most iPhone users are rich. However, a great many are just average income-earners. Invariably with credit cards, you're going to create a different experience for customers based solely on their finances. If you think about it, this sounds awfully discriminatory and is a bad optic for a popular retail-goods manufacturer. This does, however, benefit Visa stock through a PR perspective.Third, and most important, the Apple Card doesn't offer a compelling reason to join up. Even partner Goldman Sachs politely said the same thing. Gimmicks Won't Take down Visa StockIf you worried about Apple's disruption into your holdings of Visa, don't. As their own unbalanced product sales demonstrate, Apple can't even disrupt themselves.Moreover, jumping into credit cards is no easy task, even for a former trillion-dollar company. Not only do competitors require massive resources, they also need networks and a cohesive marketing plan. Apple only has one of these attributes, which subsequently lifts V stock by default.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-25	2019-03-25 19:21:06	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Apple Stock Plummets Amid Special Event Introducing Apple TV+	Today Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) held a special event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino. After spending most of last week week rolling out new hardware with little fanfare, the company pulled out all the stops today.The big announcement everyone has been waiting for is Apple TV+, Apple's new video streaming service. We now know what it is and when it will launch. The company also confirmed a focus on services, with a series of additional subscription-based offerings and its own credit card.Apple stock growth for the past decade has been driven by the iPhone, but the company is looking to services like Apple Music and Apple TV+ to take a leading role in revenue generation for the future. Here's everything you need to know about what Apple revealed today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple TV+ and Apple TV ChannelsThe big news everyone was waiting for today was Apple's video streaming service. It's called Apple TV+ and it arrives this fall. Apple is releasing original content for Apple+ and highlighted shows coming from Steve Carell, Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Steven Spielberg, Jason Momoa, Kumail Nanjiani, Oprah Winfrey and others. Apple TV+ is ad-free and content is downloadable for offline viewing. Pricing was not announced.  * 7 Reasons Apple Streaming Won't Move the Needle for Apple Stock Also new is Apple TV Channels, in a newly revised Apple TV app. The app will be a hub for paid services like Hulu, movies from iTunes, network TV apps, live sports -- and Apple TV+, of course. Content is all played within the Apple TV app. Customers can subscribe to services within the app, instead of having to sign up on a website.The new Apple TV app launches in May (fall for the Mac), but in a big move, it will also be rolled out for smart TVs Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) devices and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) FireTV streamers. Apple News+AAPL is pushing the trusted angle of Apple News, positioning its app as a source that offers content based on reputable sources rather than headlines that have viral click potential -- that was a definite dig at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Apple News+ is a new paid, subscription version that adds access to over 300 magazines to the app. Also included is access to several large newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal. Continuing the trust theme, AAPL says publishers will not be able to track readers.The cost of a subscription is $9.99 per month (including full family access), with the first month free, starting today in the U.S. and Canada. Apple CardWith Apple Pay on track to hit 10 billion transactions this year, AAPL is introducing its own credit card. Apple Card arrives in minutes after application, within the iOS Wallet app, and it's accepted anywhere worldwide that accepts Apple Pay.Apple Card's transaction history -- made more readable using machine learning and Apple Maps -- will reside in the Wallet app as well, along with spending and balance.AAPL is offering a rewards system called Daily Cash that offers 2% cash back on purchases (3% back on purchases from Apple), paid daily, along with simplified payment options.Apple is partnering with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) for the Apple Card. For locations where Apple Pay is not accepted, a physical card (made of Titanium) is also supplied. Apple Card comes to the U.S. this summer. Apple ArcadeLeveraging the popularity of game apps on the App Store, Apple Arcade is a subscription service for mobile, desktop and &quot;living room&quot; games (iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV). All games can be played offline, so internet access is not required to play once downloaded. There are no ads, and no in-app purchases. AAPL is providing financial backing for some developers to ensure high quality, exclusive titles: over 100 at launch. Apple Arcade launches this fall, but pricing was not announced. OutlookWill Apple's new video streaming service be a potential Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) killer? That's doubtful, but Apple TV+ should be a solid contender that quickly racks up subscribers. The key advantage AAPL will have - besides original content not available through other services -- is the ability to put its offering front and center on every iPhone, iPad and Mac computer. That's over a billion devices (plus all those third party streamers now supported), and that same advantage helped to rapidly grow Apple Music from a standing start to the world's second largest music streaming service that now claims 56 million paying subscribers.Apple stock has been on a roll through March, gaining 10% through the month as excitement built for the big event. We'll find out shortly whether investors remain confident in Apple TV+ and the company's services push.  As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-20	2019-03-20 12:28:09	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	EBIX Stock Is Risky at Best but Still Worth a Good Hard Look	Insurance data company Ebix (NASDAQ:EBIX) has been evolving and increasingly, Ebix stock has started a slow march up. It's a pleasant surprise as I first ran into this company almost a decade ago, when I was still at ZDNet.At the time they were buying a health care information company called A.D.A.M., for $66 million. I recently found my story on the Ebix Web site.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince then, Ebix has ridden a lot of ups and downs. The stock traded as low as $9.26 per share in 2012. But it found its footing and rose to as much as $83 per share last year. It opens for trade March 12 at about $51.30 per share.Ebix is worth looking at again because it's no longer the company it was. It's a broader company, with interests in insurance as well as health care. It is also much more focused on India, which is where  CEO Robin Raina hails from.That's the real story.  * Top 7 Service Sector Stocks That Will Pay You to Own Them  Payment Innovation and Ebix StockTransaction processing has long been an American lake, dominated by Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and their networks of processing partners, many of which have operations in Atlanta, where Ebix is based in the suburban town of John's Creek.But India's government recently pushed through a powerful transaction processing innovation, a Unified Payments Interface that has made India the innovation center of the global payments industry.Not only did India create a low-cost payment infrastructure, it also pushed people to use it, banning high-denomination bills to fight tax evasion and pushing commerce into the new system.The rise of low-cost digital payments has boosted Alibaba Group Holding (NASDAQ:BABA), Tencent Holding (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and even American companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), all of which have taken advantage of the new infrastructure, at the expense of banks and traditional processors.This is what Ebix is tapping into. India Moves and Ebix StockEbix' market cap is barely $1.5 billion, but U.S. dollars go a long way in India.The company has made 11 deals in India in just 14 months, all in various areas of ecommerce infrastructure. The purchases cost about $500 million. Raina wants to invest another $500 million this year, and take what had been the remittance system ItzCash, now renamed EbixCash, public.Raina's latest deal, announced March 11, is a proposal to buy Yatra Online (NASDAQ:YTRA), the ticketing firm behind Yatra.com, an Indian rival to Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) or Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG).The company had already bought 80% of Zillious, another online travel booker. The plan is to make Yatra part of EbixCash, then take the whole thing public.On March 1, Ebix announced its revenue for 2018 was up 37% to $497.8 million and a few days later it announced plans to be at a run rate of $750 million by the end of this year. The country's footprint in India is large enough for it to sponsor one of the country's leading business conferences and host the country's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. The Bottom Line on Ebix StockIndia is one of the world's fastest growing economies, and electronic transactions, thanks to government help, are one of the fastest-growing parts of that economy.Ebix has transformed itself, in barely a year, from a small American company focused on health payments into a real competitor inside this enormous opportunity.It has taken real risks to do this, with long-term debt of $274 million and a revolving line of credit worth another $424 million.  Its operating cash flow, $89.8 million last year, can hardly keep up.Ebix is all-in on India and has made itself a speculative stock in the process. But speculating on Ebix stock is worthwhile, and if you want that kind of international exposure, here it is.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-18	2019-03-18 17:48:47	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard Stock Still Has Plenty of Juice Left in the Tank	Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has a reputation for seasoned readers as a well-known credit card company. Younger readers will understand the brand -- and Mastercard stock -- in an entirely different way.Source: Hakan Dahlstrom via Flickr (Modified)Fundamentally, MA is payment processing company. It acts as a middle man between merchants and customers and financial institutions. A bank issues a credit or debit card to a customer that is supported by MasterCard.When the customer uses that card, MA secures the transaction while the bank awaits payment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the other side of the transaction, Mastercard is the middle man between the merchant and the customer. MA gets a fee from the merchant and a fee from the bank for its services.This has been a good business, especially since U.S. consumers drive about 70% of the economy. MA stock wins as consumers spend more, and more consumers enter the market.The other strength Mastercard stock has is that it is backed by a global brand. MA operates in 210 countries worldwide and that kind of brand recognition is a great asset as new financial technology (fintech) companies pop up in various countries trying to take some business from larger global players.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary One of the big changes in the financial sector recently has been the growth digital payments and everything that comes along with that.We've seen the massive change that e-commerce has brought to retail. Now that change is happening in the financial sector. It has taken a while because there are far more regulations and protocols to sort out than there are on the retail side.And you don't have to imagine the growth of fintech, because if you understand how retailers have changed since e-commerce has become commonplace, simply remember that all those retail transactions are being done electronically, mostly with credit cards.And it's the volume of transactions that really matter to MA. Each transaction means a commission for MA. And that's ultimately a big deal for Mastercard stock. Bottom Line on Mastercard StockHowever, MA stock has much more going on than simply acting as a middle man for transactions. All this online activity means there's a huge amount of financial risk if financial clients, merchants or customers get hacked.These cybersecurity resources are a significant part of MA's value-added business. Because of its size and breadth, the company has some of the best security in place for itself and its customers. It's also well capitalized, so if there's a breach, it's not going to throw up its hands and shut down the business.MA is in fintech growth mode right now, with acquisitions of smaller players coming quickly. It's the main reason Mastercard stock is trading more like a tech stock than a financial stock.Just this week it announced it is moving forward with the purchase of Transfast, a peer-to-peer (P2P) cross-border payments provider that operates in 125 countries and integrates with 300+ banks. P2P is a huge new market and this announcement shows that MA is staying ahead of the curve in this dynamic space.All this and more reinforces why my Portfolio Grader has MA stock as an A-rated stock right now.

2019-03-15	2019-03-15 11:14:22	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	MasterCard Stock Is A Buy, But Is It A Better Buy Than Its Card Peers?	Mastercard's (NYSE:MA) battle with long-time archrival Visa (NYSE:V) continues, with a win in the bidding for fintech firm Transfast. Coming in the wake of losing out in an effort to purchase a similar company, cross-border payments network provider Earthport, MA stock investors can be confident the payments processor is doing all it can to remain competitive.Both Mastercard and Visa have seen their stocks rise as the world moves to cashless economies. With the evolution to digital money, the entire payments industry continues to benefit from double-digit profit growth.At the same time, it makes a decision to invest in MA stock or V shares more than a simple buy-or-sell question. In this industry, investors should not ask if they should buy Mastercard stock; they should find out if it or one of its peers would bring more profit?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips MasterCard Keeps Up Yet Falls BehindWith MasterCard buying Transfast and Visa presumably winning the bidding war to acquire Earthport, both firms get better access to bank accounts and ACH networks globally. Perhaps more importantly, both card processors expand their presence in peer-to-peer money transactions.So, as the world more toward a cashless society, the MA-Visa rivalry gets more heated. In nearly all cases, most merchants accept both types of cards. Yes, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) only accepts Visa, but such exclusive instances are rare.  * 7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5% However, despite this parity, Visa dominates in terms of gross dollar volume, which covers all types of transactions. As of the third quarter of 2018, Visa controlled 61.5% of the market. This compares to only 25.2% for MA, and 11.1% for American Express (NYSE:AXP). Mastercard Benefits From Fintech GrowthHowever, where Mastercard lags in credit cards, it has compensated with its moves into debit cards and e-commerce. Thankfully for Mastercard stock bulls, these areas will see the most near-term growth in the fintech space.The benefit -- and the problem -- with this fintech sector is that every equity in the industry would probably bring profits. Even Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS), which holds only 2.2% of the market, should see double-digit profit growth this year. One could make an argument that MA stock would deliver higher returns than Discover. However, whether it can outperform its other peers is the bigger question. Should I Buy MA Stock?The MA stock price hovers near its 52-week high of about $228 per share. Still, it struggles to stand out even as it posts stellar numbers. In both profit and valuation, Mastercard and Visa appear similar. Mastercard stock analysts forecast profit increases of 16.3% this year and 18.4% in 2020. This barely exceeds the 15.4% rate for 2019 and 15.8% 2020 growth predicted for Visa. Moreover, the forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio slightly exceeds that of Visa, 25.5 vs. 24.8.  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio I like Mastercard stock better now than last year when I panned it for its high multiple and lower profit growth. Achieving near parity with Visa has changed the value proposition. However, it has not made MA stock more of a bargain than Visa.Moreover, if we evaluate these stocks purely on valuation, both American Express and Discover trade at single-digit PE ratios. Both have grown profits more slowly than Mastercard. However, with American Express set to overtake Mastercard as the second-largest processor of credit cards, AXP stock could become the equity of choice in this space. Bottom Line on Mastercard StockAlthough Mastercard stock remains a buy, the fintech sector appears to offer better options. The purchase of Transfast should enhance Mastercard's ability to conduct transactions. However, it continues to struggle to differentiate itself from Visa even as Visa achieves increasing dominance with credit card transactions.MA stock will continue to benefit from double-digit profit growth for the foreseeable future. Also, even though its 25.5 PE ratio exceeds its peers, most analysts would not call Mastercard stock &quot;overpriced.&quot; Still, for investors who intend to pursue a higher return, they might see a larger profit by buying AXP stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

The move, which has not been finalized, would represent another step in tightening the financial noose on the government of President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters.

Through thick and thin, the financial technology sector remains in favor on Wall Street. Companies like Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Square (NYSE:SQ) rarely come under fire from negative outlooks, so they make for strong bets on the upside potential of equity markets.Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrFintech offers the best of both words in the financial sector: They are prone to rallies and not considered dead money like bank stocks. When it comes to Visa stock specifically, it rallies similar to the Nasdaq Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) and outperforms the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLF).In fact, yesterday, it set a new all-time high while the S&P 500 is still struggling to breach last year's neckline battle zones. Clearly, investors want to own more Visa stock and MasterCard than most other sectors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo is it too late to buy V stock? The answer to this varies from one investor to another and depends mostly on time frames. How to Approach Visa Stock HereThose who want to invest in it and own the shares for the long term, the simple answer is that it's not too late to own it. Over the span of years, I don't need to be surgical with my entry points. If the stock market is higher later, then so is Visa.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary For that purpose, even though V  stockis at all-time highs, it is not expensive. It's cheaper than MA and sells at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 34. While this is not dirt cheap, since it's almost double that of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it's not bloated either. So owning shares here for the long term is not likely to be a major financial debacle. There is not a lot of froth to lose so the downside risk should be limitedShort term, chasing a runaway stock like this at all-time highs is not ideal. It leaves the buyers' portfolios vulnerable to short-term dips. But then again, here the matter of intentions makes a difference.For those who are looking to trade Visa stock and not necessarily be in it for the long-term investment, then going long Visa stock here would be a tactical trade. The idea is to buy high and sell higher. But for that, we need precise levels to mark the stop loss points. Bottom Line on V StockTo understand the support levels we need to know how the rally up to here unfolded. V stock is now 25% off its December lows. But the breakout really started from $140 per share on Feb. 1 and after its earnings report. That level was a neckline with $146 per share as the target. So those are two major lines of support for the mid-term.More recently, a secondary pivot level developed around $145 per share. The bears tried to break on Mar. 8, but the bulls prevailed so that now becomes an important level to hold. If it fails in the near term, it would target support at $140.  * 7 Inexpensive, High-Dividend ETFs to Buy On the lower time frame charts, there is a shorter-term recent level of contention at $149.70. This served as the floor for the recent poke to new all-time highs. So by default, this becomes the first level of support and if fails, it should also be the stop loss trigger for momentum traders. This does not affect those who are in the stock for the long haul.There is also another micro support zone between $151 and $152 per share that is an even tighter stop loss levels for momentum traders. Where I stop myself out depends on my own level of risk tolerance.  Click to EnlargeThe first stop, however, remains in my overall thesis on Visa stock and my goals for the trade. I need to know if I am trying to trade it or invest in it. It is also important that if I am in it for a trade that I don't turn it into an investment.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-03-14	2019-03-14 12:38:38	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	The Visa Stock Upside Is Small and Getting Smaller	Market correction. What market correction? For Visa (NYSE:V), it's as though the October drop never happened. Visa stock is already up 25% from its December bottom and has hit new all-time highs.Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrVisa enjoyed a modest pop on its most recent earnings report. That release showed EPS ahead of expectations by a few cents, along with a revenue beat.But the big driver for the stock has simply been the improving economic outlook and hopes for higher earnings as Visa raises merchant fees yet again. It's strategy may be about to run into problems, however.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What's Going on with Kroger?The first item of concern is that Kroger (NYSE:KR) is expanding its fight with Visa. Last August, Kroger stopped accepting Visa cards at nearly two dozen of its California stores citing high fees. It stepped up its criticism dramatically earlier this month.  * 15 Stocks Sitting on Huge Piles of Cash Kroger's Smith's Food & Drug Store division will stop accepting Visa cards next month. Smith's operates 142 food stores and 108 gas stations predominately in the Rocky Mountain states.&quot;While no other Kroger banners are presently affected by this announcement, Kroger continues to explore options to reduce the cost of accepting credit cards in order to keep prices low for customers,&quot; Kroger said in a statement.Mike Schlotman, Kroger's Executive Vice President and CFO elaborated:&quot;Visa has been misusing its position and charging retailers excessive fees for a long time […] They conceal from customers what Visa and its banks charge retailers to accept Visa credit cards. At Smith's, Visa's credit card fees are higher than any other credit card brand that we accept. Visa's excessive fees and unfairness cannot continue to go unchecked.&quot;Smith's will keep accepting all rival cards from American Express (NYSE:AXP), Discover (NYSE:DFS), and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), along with, interestingly enough, Visa debit cards. Most Visa bulls have dismissed this move as merely sour grapes from a struggling grocery chain. A Sign of Trouble to Come?As it is, credit card companies often earn higher margins on a customer's grocery purchase than the grocery store itself. While it's easy to blame Kroger, they face a challenging situation.Mastercard and Visa keep hiking their fees, taking advantage of a near monopoly situation. Meanwhile, grocery stores face intense competition, with more coming from the likes of Aldi and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) every year.Over time, as retail gets more challenging, payment fees are likely to come down. As it is, Mastercard and Visa routinely get sued and face regulatory pressure from politicians for charging high fees. See the multi-billion dollar settlement that Visa, Mastercard, and certain banks just had to pay out.Visa has enjoyed a huge run in profitability since its IPO in significant part since it keeps taking a bigger and bigger portion of the pie in each retail transaction. But this can't go on forever. For one thing, retailers are going bust left and right. Kroger's may be an isolated move now, but at some point they'll put up a joint front to fight back against high fees.Additionally, technology will offer more and more ways to keep fees competitive. Sure, Visa and Mastercard are easy and secure ways to pay. But retailers, with the right incentives, should be able to move more transactions to competing smartphone-based channels. I don't see Visa and Mastercard being displaced anytime soon (the tech isn't moving that fast), but if Visa tries to stick it to the retailers too much, it will encourage faster adoption of substitute options. Visa Stock: How Much Should You Pay?What's the right price for Visa stock? That depends on what you think a proper P/E ratio for the firm is. And that, it appears, very much depends on what part of the economic cycle we're in.Between 2010 and 2012, Visa stock consistently traded under 20x trailing earnings. From 2013 to 2015, it generally trafficked in the 25x to 30x range. From 2016 to 2018, things got frothy, with Visa stock consistently over 30x earnings and moving over 40x for a time.So, today's 33x P/E ratio could be viewed as a decent correction to where it was over the past couple years. That said, I think there's still a lot of optimism baked in at current prices. I doubt Visa stock is going back under 20x earnings anytime soon, more market participants have discovered how great a company Visa is. But 25x earnings is certainly a realistic target when the market rolls over.Earnings have been growing at 15%/year compounded over the past five years. If that were to keep up, 33x earnings seems a little aggressive, but it's a justifiable price. It is a PEG ratio of over 2x after all, .However, should earnings growth slow down, 33x earnings is almost certainly too expensive. And with merchants hitting a breaking point on fees, don't expect Visa to keep being able to increase earnings by taking more of the retail pie forever. Visa Stock ConclusionVisa stock makes for a fantastic long-term buy and hold investment. There's no disputing that fact. If you buy at a halfway-decent price, you are likely to earn a solid total return as the company exploits its dominant market share to keep gobbling up more and more business.If you're looking at Visa stock as a shorter-term trade, however, there are reasons for concern. You're looking at a stock already up 21% over the past year and 15% year-to-date. We're only in March, so 15% year-to-date is quite the run. Visa stock is already at new all-time highs, well ahead of the market as a whole.And the analyst consensus for Visa stock is only around $160, suggesting less than 10% upside. Visa stock would have to put up great earnings to get analysts to lift their targets much higher. Again, V stock is a solid investment, but this isn't the most compelling entry point.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held DFS stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

2019-03-13	2019-03-13 14:11:59	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	PayPal Stock Still Has Plenty of Room to Run	Last year was especially hard on the financial sector. It developed the reputation that the banks could sustain a rally. But one segment within the financials is hotter than ever and held up well even last year. Unlike traditional money centers, financial technology or &quot;fintech stocks&quot; like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and even old dogs like Visa (NYSE:V) or Mastercard (NYSE:MA) continue to rally through thick and thin. Wall Street is enamored with their business models, and this has benefitted PayPal stock.Source: Shutterstock In fact, PayPal stock is up 21% in the past 12 months; whereas, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLF) is down 10% for the same period. The fastest and most expensive runner of the fintech bunch is Square (NYSE:SQ), which is up 35% year-to-date, but PYPL, V and MA are all strong regardless as each is up around 15% for the same period.Today, the story is about PayPal and how it should be a winning investment for the long term and offer short-term opportunities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips How to Approach PayPal Stock TodayFor years, the global trend has been to transition finances to strictly online transactions. From regular shopping to global money flow, we demand our money to flow fast and worldwide. This was most evident during the Bitcoin craze of 2017. Although the value of the coin is debatable, everyone agrees that the blockchain technology behind it is attractive and encapsulates the concept.  * 10 Dividend Stock Winners Transactor companies like Paypal offer the blockchain concept of moving money fast and they are operational now. So they are best suited to sustain their success for years to come. Since the transition to electronic finance is in its infancy, there is enough business for all the current competitors to thrive.So PYPL stock is likely to do well for the long term, but the problem for investors is that it's a momentum stock. It moves fast in both directions and this presents a problem to many. On the way up it seems like it's ready to correct thereby forcing traders to miss out on the upside.Case in point, while Wall Street is still expecting a correction in stocks, PYPL stock is almost at its all-time highs. Clearly, the fintech bulls are used to the momentum aspect of this trade. The idea is to buy high and sell higher. Else we'd end up missing the whole trade.Fundamentally, Paypal stock is not cheap. It is almost twice as expensive as V and three times as expensive as American Express (NYSE:AXP). But for as long as it is growing fast, investors will give it a pass on that front.Younger companies need to over spend in order to catch up so it is more important that traders judge their top line performance and not the margins. At least PYPL is in the black whereas SQ still loses money.For those who want to own the shares for the long term, then, the actual timing is less important. If the stock market is rising, then PYPL will be higher later. But not every one wants to hold stocks for the long term and for those kinds of investors, there are short-term clues for more surgical entry and exit points. Bottom Line on PYPLFor the short term, PYPL is near its all-time highs, so buying it up here requires courage. But with proper stop loss levels, traders can do it provided they stick to their exit points well.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks That Deserve Your Attention in 2019 PayPal stock recently broke out of the $94 zone so that would be the best level of short-term support if the rally fades from the top. The closest support level, which usually is the weakest, is at $97. Below that, there are two similar supports at $96 and $95. So depending on personal preferences and risk tolerance, those would be the significant short-term levels to trade. This only applies to those in it for the short term. Longer term, it can fall to $88 per share and not change the bullish thesis much.In summary, Wall Street is attracted to financial tech because the transition into an electronic environment plays right into the hands of companies like PayPal. That means you can own it or trade it with confidence for years to come.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-03-01	2019-03-01 19:52:20	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	7 Top-Rated Stocks to Buy for March	Stocks have been doing very well in 2019. Some of this is a recovery from the massive selloff in Q4 of last year, and some of it is a rosy picture of the coming year.Underlying much of it is the Federal Reserve's repositioning on interest rates. Its stated policy was to raise at least twice in 2019 to stay ahead of creeping inflation. When that remained the case, companies' earnings were disappointing investors and their projections were equally dour, selling got started in earnest.But when the Fed relented on rate hikes, the market began to breathe easier. And as long as the Fed continues down that path, the market should continue to run.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRecent GDP numbers were decent, if not salacious. Yet there remains contradictory data that should keep us all vigilant about expecting this bull to lift all stocks into the future -- consumer spending in December was the worst since 2009.Granted the government shutdown may have had some effect, but most of the December shopping was done by the time it kicked in, so it may have been a worse number because of that, but not by much.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever The seven top-rated stocks to buy for March are delivering A ratings for their quantitative qualities, meaning investors like what they see and are buying these shares enthusiastically. Capital Investment Company (CIC)Source:  lee via FlickrCapital Investment Company (NYSE:CIC) is what is known in the industry as a blank-check company. Basically, it raises private equity capital in tranches and then looks for a company to buy.This the CIC's fourth such deal and it has done well with its first three investments. The first was in 2009, starting Maryland real estate investment trust Two Harbors Investment Corp (NYSE:TWO), which is now the third-largest mortgage REIT in the U.S.The second deal was in 2015, investing in Lindblad Expeditions (NASDAQ:LIND), an adventure travel company. The stock is up 48% in the past year as adventure travel becomes a very popular travel choice among many demographics.The third deal was in 2017, merging with Cision (NYSE:CISN), a media research company.Each of these deals is a separate &quot;company,&quot; so you're essentially investing in CIC's next project. And from the looks of things, investors are coming aboard swiftly. Haymaker Acquisition (HYAC)Source: Shutterstock Haymaker Acquisition (NASDAQ:HYAC) is another blank-check firm that focuses on the consumer sector, including media and hospitality industries as well as traditional retail consumer products and services.A number of these blank-check companies showed up on my Portfolio Grader this time around, which is an interesting development. It seems that institutional investors and hedge funds are looking for market alternatives for diversification, rather than just investing in publicly traded companies or investing in private companies directly.  * 10 Best High-Growth Stocks for Young Investors It seems private equity companies are now starting to be publicly traded themselves. This could be interesting. Big financial institutions may see this as a way to outsource their alternative investing portfolio without having to build or expand current operations. An interesting sector to watch, to be sure. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is the forefather of consumer staples companies. The Ohio-based company has been around since 1837 and has found a way to not just survive, but thrive during the past 182 years.It has seen depressions, world wars … pretty much anything an economy and consumers can throw at a company. Pampers, Tide, Downy, Charmin, Tampax, Old Spice, Pantene, Dawn, Gillette, Vicks, Crest, Olay, Secret and that is just to name a few.It's no surprise that a couple of years ago it went through a significant purge of brands it has accumulated over the years and refocused on its core divisions and brands. And it has paid off.In the past 12 months, this steady-Eddie company was up 23%, not including its rock-solid 2.9% dividend.And even while the markets are booming, the smart money is buying into PG as not only a great hedge, but a great total return foundation pick. Mastercard  (MA)Source: Hakan Dahlstrom via Flickr (Modified)Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is another well-known brand with a deserved reputation for smart growth and solid returns. But the thing is, MA is transforming with its industry.While there is plenty of buzz about financial technology companies (aka, fintechs), MA is one of the original fintechs. And savvy investors are starting to realize it. Money is going digital and MA hasn't been sitting on its hands.For everyone concerned, a cashless world is very convenient. And for banks and companies, digital transactions are significantly cheaper than cash transactions. The downside for some is that cash provides some level of anonymity and privacy -- it isn't logged into a database with a name and account attached to it.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market But with the big money on digital payments, MA, with its global reach and well-respected brand is an easy choice for financial institutions and businesses around the world. Nike (NKE)Source: Shutterstock Nike (NYSE:NKE) is the 800-pound gorilla of the athletic footwear and apparel market. With a market cap of nearly $135 billion, it's nearly 3x larger in market than its major competitor Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY).Even a hot company like Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) is a chimp compared to this massive primate. Although LULU has been in the press a lot recently, and I do like the company.Even though NKE has returned a respectable 31% in the past 12 months, it hasn't seen the growth that LULU has seen. Still, it looks like there's a shift of interest back into a major diversified player like NKE.And one of its big retail partners, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) recently announced that it's investing $275 million in Asia, which is already a strong market for NKE, and this will only help the brand. And a stronger consumer at home- and the advent of spring and summer sports -- will also be a boost. Diageo (DEO)Source: Puamella via Flickr (Modified)Diageo (NYSE:DEO) is a sin stock. So, if you're not interested in one of the world's largest and best alcoholic beverage companies, then you can skip this recommendation.But if you're interested in a great company with a return of 352% in the past 17 years (give or take) -- that's about a 20.7% annual average return -- then read on.Guinness, Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Ketel One, Ciroc, Captain Morgan, Tanqueray are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the brands that sit in the DEO portfolio.Combine that with the fact that younger drinkers are buying less beer and wine and buying more high-end alcohol, they're choosing quality over volume in the U.S. And that is a big deal, since much of the U.S. consumer-focused market has always counted on U.S. consumer to be of the more-is-better mentality.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks the Street Loves Also, with the loosening of cannabis laws, infused products in North America are going to be big … and hip. DEO will certainly be a major player in this burgeoning sector. Starbucks (SBUX)Source: StarbucksStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) started as a single store that operated in the famous Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle. It remained a single store for a decade until Howard Schultz joined the team.After a trip to Italy, Schultz realized the potential for cafes in the U.S., done in a truly American style. In 1987 he and a group of investors bought the original Starbucks and turned it into what we see today -- 24,000 retail stores in 70 countries.Essentially, SBUX has turned a classic European business into a quintessentially American product and brand. The past decade has seen a lot of the company's growth. And the amazing thing is, given its vast network, it still finds ways to grow its bottom -- and top -- line.And if we've learned anything about corporate chiefs that run for high public office, it's that it does wonders for their brand. Now that former CEO Schultz is looking into a presidential bid, you can be sure that for now it's free advertising every time he speaks or is featured on a new segment.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-02-28	2019-02-28 21:46:05	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Strong Q4 Numbers Underscore Why Square Stock Is a Winner	This morning, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock initially dropped before quickly reversing course. The payments processors reported fourth-quarter numbers that were largely above expectations, but included a mixed guide. Investors were initially disappointed by a weak Q1 profit guide. But they shrugged that off, and instead focused on an above-consensus full-year 2019 revenue and profit guide. Consequently, SQ stock reversed course, and ended up trading higher on the day.Source: Via Square This reversal makes sense. Square's Q4 numbers were strong and underscored that the company's underlying secular growth drivers in non-cash payments processing and digital banking remain robust. The full-year 2019 guide implies that these drivers will remain robust for the foreseeable future. As such, a weak Q1 profit guide is just a hiccup in what is otherwise a very strong growth narrative. It should be ignored, and SQ stock should trade higher on these good numbers. In the big picture, SQ stock is a long-term winner. The company is capitalizing on a secular shift towards non-cash payments, while simultaneously building out multiple digital banking initiatives, the sum of which will keep Square's growth rates high and strong for a lot longer. Margins are also ramping with great pace, and profits are soaring.But, SQ stock is already up 700% over the past three years. How much more upside is left?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the long term, a lot. In the near term, only a little. Based on reasonable growth assumptions, Square stock remains on a winning track towards $150-plus price tags. But, over the next few months, fundamentals imply that upside is capped around $85. As such, I wouldn't be buying SQ stock in bulk here. But, I wouldn't be selling either. This stock remains a long-term buy-and-hold. Strong Q4 Numbers Paint A Positive PictureSquare's Q4 numbers were really good. Net revenues rose by over 50% again. Adjusted revenues rose by over 60% again. Gross Payment Volume, or GPV, growth was again above 25%. GPV mix improved to include 24% of sellers with greater than $500,000 in annualized GPV, versus 20% last year and 16% two years ago. Adjusted Subscription and Services-Based revenue more than doubled year-over-year.Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded roughly 300 basis points year-over-year, continuing what has been a multi-year margin expansion narrative. On top of 60%-plus adjusted revenue growth, this margin expansion powered 97% year-over-year EBITDA growth.All in all, Square's quarter was very good. To be sure, there are some lingering concerns regarding slowing GPV growth. GPV growth has decelerated from 30%-plus a few quarters ago, to under 30% in each of the past two quarters. This signals that the non-cash payments processing tailwind is slowing, which isn't great news.But, it's not deal-breaking news either. Of course, growth will naturally slow here. The fact that it's only slowing by ~1 percentage point each quarter despite being up at 30% and lapping 30%-plus growth is actually impressive. Moreover, the big growth narrative here isn't GPV growth. It's over on the subscription and services side of Square, where Square is building a banking ecosystem surrounding its core payments platforms. Revenue in those businesses is more than doubling year-over-year. That revenue is also high-margin, so it's additive to the bottom-line and is helping drive profit growth.Thus, while GPV growth is slowing, Square's Q4 numbers underscore that this company remains on a winning trajectory. The company continues to be a 20%-plus grower in payments processing, and is building out a robust portfolio of ancillary payments and banking related products like business payments cards and a mobile money app, most of which are seeing incredible traction. So long those businesses continue to ramp, Square will remain a big revenue grower with a strong margin expansion narrative. Long-Term Drivers Imply Big UpsideFrom a valuation perspective, SQ stock has healthy long-term upside. But, upside in the near term will likely be capped by what is becoming an increasingly full valuation.Considering Square's relatively small GPV (less than $100 billion annualized), huge addressable payments market ($40 trillion in global consumer spend) and persistently large growth rates (25%-plus GPV growth has become the norm for several years), it increasingly appears as though Square's payments processing business will continue to be a 20% grower for a lot longer. Meanwhile, considering how well all of its other subscription and service businesses like Cash App are doing, it also increasingly appears that revenue growth on that side of Square will likewise remain well in excess of 20% for the foreseeable future.Meanwhile, margins are consistently rising by roughly 200 basis points every year. So long as robust revenue growth persists, this trend of 200 basis points of margin expansion every year should persist, too.Putting all that together, I think Square projects as a 20%-plus revenue grower for a lot longer, while margins should continue to ramp towards 30% in the long run. Modeling those assumptions out, I believe Square can do about $4.25 in EPS by fiscal 2025.MVP stocks -- Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) -- all trade around 30 to 35 forward earnings. Based on a peer average 32.5 forward multiple, a reasonable 2024 price target for SQ stock is close to $140. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 price target of roughly $85. Bottom Line on SQ StockStrong Q4 numbers and a healthy fiscal 2019 guide imply that Square remains on a winning trajectory, powered by secular growth drivers in non-cash payments processing and various digital banking initiatives. If Square can stay on this winning trajectory, then price tags close to $150 make sense for SQ stock in the long run.  * 9 Best Stocks to Buy on U.S.-China Trade Optimism Having said that, valuation looks pretty full in the near term. As such, investors may want to wait for a big dip before buying more shares.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long SQ and PYPL.

She doubts whether there will be much uptake of this new card, which hasn&apos;t been officially confirmed or announced, given a highly competitive landscape for rewards credit cards. &quot;It is unclear that a value proposition centered on integration to the Apple eco-system is really enough to drive significant adoption,&quot; she wrote.

2019-02-21	2019-02-21 20:00:43	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	3 Strong Stocks to Buy Now	Investors' rising risk appetite can be seen in virtually every corner of the market. And that makes finding strong stocks to buy a cinch. Small-caps just logged their eight consecutive up day. Breadth is notching new highs confirming that equities of all sectors are joining in the bullish revelry. And volatility is in the tank. The CBOE Volatility Index just fell to a fresh four-month low.With this morning's mild drop, however, traders are hitting the pause button. And that's a good thing. Low-risk entries were drying up because many stocks had rallied far from support zones. Here's to hoping sellers can press their advantage and deliver a multi-day pullback. A single day of selling followed by a rapid snap-back doesn't do anyone any good.  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills In compiling a shopping list of strong buy stocks to snag into weakness, I found the following three beauties that deserve your consideration.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  Mastercard (MA)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Mastercard (NYSE:MA) shares were already on the mend, but last month's earnings report pushed the recovery into overdrive. Indeed, the buying has been relentless, and now MA stock sits a stone's throw from all-time highs. The 20-day, 50-day and 200-day are all rising beneath the price to show the bulls' dominance across all time frames.This week's pullback is providing the first clean buying opportunity seen since January's earnings release. Thus far it has been shallow and seen little volume which shows there isn't any conviction behind the selling pressure.I suspect this dip will be bought and MA will soon boom to record highs. To capitalize, buy the May $220/$230 bull call spread for around $4.50. The risk is limited to $4.50, and the reward is limited to $5.50. Boeing (BA)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim To those that have been paying attention, Boeing (NYSE:BA) needs no introduction. Ever since breaking out of its year-long base, BA stock has been a mainstay among market leaders. Making the bull case is easy. The trend points higher, all moving averages are rising, accumulation days litter the landscape, and its earnings growth has been robust.Today's drop may finally usher in a bout of consolidation or perhaps even a retracement. Either way, BA is a big-time buy into any weakness. To combat its lofty price tag, you can buy spreads over single options. Bull calls should do the trick.  * 7 Restaurant Stocks to Watch in 2019 Buy the May $420/$440 bull call for $9. In fine-tuning the entry, you could wait to see if this morning's weakness gets bought. The price of the spread will cheapen if we see additional down days.  Yeti (YETI)  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim Our final selection is the wildcard. Since going public late last year, YETI Holdings (NYSE:YETI) were stuck in a range, waiting for a catalyst to kickstart a tradeable trend. Last week, the spark finally arrived in the form of an earnings report that impressed the Street. The high volume breakout and subsequent upside followthrough make YETI a must-watch stock.It's now in an established uptrend complete with rising 20-day and 50-day moving averages. The amount of volume accompanying the surge adds legitimacy to the resistance breach and suggests it should have staying power. Yesterday's bearish engulfing candle may signal a pullback or a pause is in the cards, but either pattern will ultimately prove a buying opportunity.Because YETI is still in its infancy, its stock options are illiquid. So, go with a straight stock purchase if you're going to play it.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-11	2019-02-11 17:50:47	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	3 Big Breakout Stocks to Buy	This earnings season has had no small number of winners. Indeed, the number of companies rallying after their reports is significant compared to other quarters in recent years. Over the weekend my search for the best stocks to buy revealed many breakout setups in companies that scored strong post-earnings rallies.The appeal of the breakout pattern is multi-fold. First, when a stock breaks a previously impenetrable ceiling, it signals buyers are strengthening their grip. Consider it a bullish omen that portends higher prices on the horizon. Second, interested spectators actively scan for stocks breaking to fresh highs. They often jump into breakout stocks, adding further fuel for continued upside.Third, stocks with clear resistance levels provide easy price zones to trade around. This allows traders to build low-risk, high-reward trades.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months With that, let's take a look at three breakout stocks to buy.Source: ThinkorSwim  Starbucks (SBUX)Do you know what's better than a 52-week high? All-time highs! And that's what Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares reached today. The coffee-chain giant has held up very well during the market's recent temper tantrum. Boosted by two solid earnings reports, SBUX stock has held firm over the past four months.The up-gap and follow-through after January's release lifted SBUX directly into overhead resistance at $69. And rather than forming a handle to its cup, the stock cut right through the ceiling on Friday. The rally is continuing this morning.To capitalize on the breakout, buy the April $70/$75 bull call spread for $1.90. The risk is limited to $1.90, and the reward is capped at $3.10.Source: ThinkorSwim  Mastercard (MA)The turnaround in Mastercard (NYSE:MA) following last quarter's descent has been orderly, and downright impressive. January's robust earnings release and the subsequent jump in the stock price were merely the icings on the cake. With MA stock now north of rising 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages, bulls have officially wrested back control of the trend across all time frames.The fact that sellers couldn't muster more than a two-day pullback before buyers rushed back in is telling. Friday's bullish engulfing candle suggests we want to see buyers of a break above the minor resistance pivot at $217. A run toward the peak at $225.35 seems only a matter of time.  * 7 Reasons You Want Boeing Stock in Your Portfolio Buy the April $220/$240 bull call spread for $6. The risk is limited to $6 and will be forfeit if MA sits below $220 at expiration. The reward is limited to $14 and will be captured if the stock rises above $240. World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)Source: ThinkorSwim Momentum traders fell in love with World Wrestling Entertainment (NYSE:WWE) last year. Tripling in value will do that to a stock. Though the fourth-quarter thrashing soured sentiment for a spell, this year's turnaround has buyers returning.WWE stock is rising above all its major moving averages, and last week's earnings release spurred a price breakout over $84. I particularly like how quickly the early morning weakness was bought up during Thursday's trading after the company's report.With resistance now felled, WWE is positioned for a run back to its all-time high of $97.69. Bull call spreads provide a cheap, limited-risk way to bank on further upside.Buy the April $85/$95 call spread for $4.05. The risk is limited to the original cost, and the reward is limited to $5.95.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-11	2019-02-11 14:46:54	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	How to Trade Square Stock Right Now	Square (NYSE:SQ) has outperformed the stock market and most other names since tech stocks' Christmas Eve lows. Square stock is up more than 40% from its lows and is now consolidating nicely near $70 per share.Square is far from perfect, though. The stock is much more volatile than the broader market and is susceptible to large moves in both directions. With the market teetering on a potential pullback ( it has risen some 15% from its December lows and is rapidly moving towards its 200-day moving average), Square stock could either be a pillar of strength or a weak link in the chain. Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)If investors eliminate their emotions and rely on unbiased logic, they have a chance to profit from SQ stock. So let's look at the charts a bit before diving into a wider overview of Square stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months  Trading Square StockSQ is holding up relatively well, particularly with the overall markets under some pressure after a big, multi-week rally. So far, SQ stock is staying above its 200-day moving average, which is near $69. This appears to be a rather key level when it comes to Square stock. The 200-day was resistance about a month ago, but once Square pushed through the 200-day, this level became support.Furthermore, short-term, uptrend support (depicted by the blue line on the chart above) comes into play around $69 as well and follows the 200-day moving average pretty closely. On a slightly deeper pullback, the risk/reward of Square stock would be solid for bulls.For bulls who are already long, a close below this area gives them a way to reduce their risk. If Square stock temporarily breaks below $69 and recovers in the same day, I would be much more likely to consider taking a long position in Square stock. That scenario would signify that the support of Square stock temporarily gave way, and that bulls responded by buying the shares with enough force to get them back over the key level of $69.So what happens if SQ falls below $69? If that happens, $65 is on the table. That's about the level where trend support (depicted by the black line) and  the 50-day moving average come into play. If $69 holds, becoming support, look to see if Square stock moves over $72 to $72.50. That area is both short-term, downtrend resistance and the 100-day-moving average. If Square stock climbs above $72.50, it could retest its recent highs near $78.Know your levels and let the price action guide your actions. Don't fight what the stock price is doing. The Bottom Line on SQ StockSquare is not cheap and never really has been. However, investors counter the valuation argument with a few observations.Their first contention is that Square could be a takeover target for banks and/or payment processing companies. Perhaps the recent massive deal between SunTrust Banks (NYSE:STI) and BB&T (NYSE:BBT)will kick M&A in the financial sector into high gear.Presently, Square stock is valued at just under $30 billion. It's also got a surprisingly resilient balance sheet. SQ has total assets of almost $4 billion versus total liabilities of $2.8 billion, while the company has less than $1 billion of total debt.SQ is not on the list of stocks with the strongest balance sheets, but I was surprised that Square wasn't more leveraged. The fact that SQ has positive cash flow also makes Square stock more attractive.The bulls' other argument is the company's  growth. Square will report its earnings at the end of February, and analysts expect the company to report strong, full-year growth. On average, analysts expect its sales to surge 60% to $1.58 billion and predict that its earnings will balloon 70% to 46 cents per share.As mentioned earlier, the valuation of SQ stock is high; the shares are trading at 156 times this year's consensus earnings estimate. But it's not easy to find companies that are  growing as quickly as Square. In 2019, the average estimate calls for a further 43% expansion in sales to $2.25 billion and projects that its earnings will grow 52% to 70 cents per share.SQ stock is still expensive, as it's far more costly than its peers like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). But growth investors won't mind its high valuation as long as its management continues to deliver.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

  * 7 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy That Tore Up Earnings 

Source: Shutterstock From a headline perspective, the quarter wasn't very good. Earnings topped expectations, but revenues were simply in-line with estimates. That's a shocker for this company. PayPal normally beats on both the top and bottom line. Indeed, this is the first time in two years that PayPal didn't report a double-beat quarter. Also, the first quarter guide came in light of expectations, heightening investor concerns that slowing global economic growth is weighing on PayPal. 

All in all, a glance at the headline numbers makes the drop in PayPal stock seem obvious and warranted. But a closer look reveals that this dip is a buying opportunity.

The core trends underlying PayPal stock remain robust, and the fourth-quarter report affirmed that. Total payment volume growth, engagement growth, revenue growth and margins were all stable in the quarter. Meanwhile, account growth and Venmo volume growth actually accelerated higher in the quarter. Plus, the guide next year calls for continued robust revenue growth and healthy margin expansion, while management said on the conference call that &quot;economic growth is stronger and more resilient than recent market volatility would indicate.&quot;

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Overall, PayPal's quarter wasn't bad. At all. Instead, it was business as usual -- and business as usual projects to be the norm in 2019, as well. So long as business as usual persists, PayPal stock will remain on an uptrend and dips will be buying opportunities.

### Underlying Growth Trends Remain Favorable

It's easy to look at PayPal's quarter, see that a 30-forward-multiple stock didn't double-beat expectations and write off the sell-off in PayPal stock as an overvalued stock suffering from a slowing growth trajectory.

But that isn't what's happening here.

PayPal's growth isn't really slowing at all. Total payment volume growth in the quarter was 25%. This figure has run in the 20% to 30% range for several quarters now, so the fourth quarter's 25% mark is very normal. Also, fiscal 2019 total payment volume growth is projected to be 25% -- again, a very normal number for this company.

Engagement growth was also stable in the quarter at 9%, while adjusted revenue growth was also stable at 21%. Next year, adjusted revenue growth is expected around 20%, implying year-over-year stability. Margins also held largely stable in Q4, and are expected to gradually expand in 2019.

Elsewhere, growth rates actually improved. Account growth accelerated to 17% in the quarter, from a 10-15% range that the metric had been stuck in for several quarters. Venmo volume growth also accelerated to 80%, after being stuck at 78% for two consecutive quarters.

Overall, the underlying growth trends at PayPal remain healthy and vigorous. Moreover, management projects those trends to remain healthy in 2019, thanks to a still-favorable economic backdrop. As such, 2019 will be business as usual for PayPal.

Business as usual has led to PayPal stock more than doubling over the past three years. It should lead to similar big gains over the next several years.

### Valuation Lends Itself to $100 Prices Soon

The post-earnings sell-off in PayPal stock has dragged the stock price down below $90. The stock won't stay there for long. Within the next several months, PayPal stocks should rise toward and above $100.

The math here is simple. PayPal has been a consistent adjusted revenue-grower in excess of 20%. This year is expected to be largely more of the same. Growth will inevitably slow over the next several years thanks to the law of large numbers. But, secular growth drivers in e-commerce and mobile commerce will keep growth healthy over the next several years. Thus, this is easily a 15% revenue grower that could hit $36 billion in revenue by fiscal 2024.

During that stretch, margins will expand gradually with scale, but will remain largely within the 20-25% range. Gradual margin expansion on top of big revenue growth should propel EPS towards $7 by fiscal 2014. Payment processor stocks, like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), normally trade around 25 forward earnings.

Based on a 25 forward multiple, a reasonable fiscal 2023 price target for PayPal stock is $175. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a fiscal 2019 price target just shy of $120.

### Bottom Line on PYPL Stock

The growth trends underlying PayPal stock remain favorable, mostly due to resilient economic growth and continued expansion of e-commerce and mobile commerce. So long as these growth trends remain favorable -- and the valuation remains reasonable, as it does today -- PayPal stock will trend higher, and dips are nothing more than buying opportunities.

2019-01-31	2019-01-31 20:50:14	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	5 Top Stock Trades for Friday: MSFT, FB, PYPL, V	"After a well-received round of earnings on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning, U.S. stocks are again moving higher. Investors are shifting from a fear of losses to a fear of missing out, jumping on the boat even after big moves higher. Let's look at some of the biggest top stock trades for Friday.

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #1: Microsoft

Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are in a precarious spot now after failing to rally on earnings. It's trading smack in the middle of its 21-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which are all within about 60 cents of each other.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 5 Dividend Stocks to Help You Through the Market's Mayhem 



It's got downtrend resistance just above and support in this $100 to $103 region just below. If tech stocks continue higher and the Nasdaq holds up, it's hard to imagine that MSFT will break below support. Below $100 and my concerns would rise, though.

Over resistance, and Microsoft could fly to its prior highs.

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #2: Facebook

Shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are surging -- finally -- up almost 12% following its better-than-expected earnings results. FB stock was consolidating nicely below $150, which were the March/April lows from the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

With Thursday's move, shares are erupting over this mark and are now pinning near the 200-day moving average. If it can't hold the 200-day, it will likely serve as temporary resistance.

However, given how much pressure FB has been under over the past few quarters, a continued move is certainly not out of the question. I find it worthwhile to mention that today's high perfectly kissed the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the July highs to the December lows. If FB pulls back and/or consolidates, look for the 38.2% Fib to buoy it as well as uptrend support (purple line).

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #3: PayPal

Shares of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are pulling back slightly on the day, contrary to what the bulls were hoping for when PYPL reported earnings. However, it's holding up over the backside of prior downtrend resistance and is a great company.

I like this one from the long side, with prior downtrend resistance, the 50-day and the 200-day moving average all just below. Investors buying on Thursday, or Friday on another slight decline, can use the $84 level as their stop-loss.

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #4: Visa

Visa (NYSE:V) has a similar -- albeit not identical -- chart to Microsoft. The main difference is that V doesn't have as much support below it. On a day where MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is running, V is under pressure following its earnings results.

Keep it simple: support rests down near $130 and V will need to close above $138 to trigger a breakout. This one has a great long-term story and investors should feel comfortable nibbling a longer-term position down here.

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #5: Raytheon

Shares of Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) are down slightly, falling about 4% after reporting earnings. But this one has come up quickly from its recent lows and is also a high-quality company.

I like RTN -- although perhaps not as much as a few other in-favor stocks at the moment -- particularly if it's able to hold its 21-day and 50-day moving averages. If so, a continued rally is not out of the question. Over time, it may even make its way back up to the $185 to $190 level.

  * 7 Stocks With Too Much Riding On China 



Below $160 and RTN would raise a red flag for me, but if I am a short-term investor or long-term trader (however you want to think about it) I would not be all that disappointed with Thursday's fall following its big rally.

Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long V.

Source: Hakan Dahlstrom via Flickr (Modified)

Mastercard (NYSE:MA) reported earnings per share of $1.55 for the fourth quarter of the year. This is better than the company's earnings per share of $1.14 from the fourth quarter of 2017. It was also a boon to MA stock by beating out Wall Street's earnings per share estimate of $1.53 for the quarter.

The most recent Mastercard earnings report also sees the company bringing in net income of $899 million. This is an increase over the company's net income of $227 million reported in the same period of the year prior.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Operating income in the Mastercard earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2018 came in at $1.23 billion. The financial services company reported operating income of $1.52 billion for the fourth quarter of the previous year.

Mastercard earnings for the fourth quarter of the year also include revenue of $3.81 billion. This is up from the company's revenue of $3.31 billion reported during the same time last year. It was also not a hindrance to MA stock by matching analysts' revenue estimate of $3.81 billion for the period.

&quot;These results reflect strong execution in growing our core business and driving new capabilities to improve the customer experience and enhance security across all transaction types,&quot; Ajay Banga, President and CEO of Mastercard, said in a statement. &quot;When you combine this with the strategic investments we've made for the long term, we are very well positioned for continued growth.&quot;

MA stock was up 3% as of Thursday afternoon.

Mastercard also said cross-border payments volume -- a measure of cardholders’ spending abroad -- climbed 18.9 percent last year, higher than the 14.6 percent growth in 2017.  Analysts were concerned about that metric after Visa said on Wednesday that cross-border spending climbed 3 percent in the three months through December, the smallest uptick in at least five quarters, as spending in the U.S. by consumers from outside the country declined.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-surges-revenue-outlook-tops-144639997.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-01-31	2019-01-31 15:24:49	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Visa Stock Is Stalling on Earnings… But It’s Not Done Yet	"Visa (NYSE:V) reported earnings last night and it popped on the headline. This on a day where Visa stock had already moved up 2% going into the earnings event. This morning investors are stepping back as V is down a little.

Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via Flickr Visa is a quality company which makes V stock one to hold for the long term. Small dips on headlines are not critical for the overall long-term investment. Those who need exposure to the financial sector should consider buying Visa stock. 

This is not 2018. Last year, sentiment was terrible and markets could not maintain a rally. This was especially true for the financials and consensus was that they could not sustain rallies. But transactor companies like Visa, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and even Square (NYSE:SQ) have the best of both world.

When financial stocks rally, V stock also rallies. But if the bank stocks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fall, the transactors only fall in sympathy for a short while. Then they continue to move with the markets in general, not the banks.

So far this year the macro-sentiment has been the opposite of December. The Christmas crash, as bad as it was, did flip the switch. Thus far, the bears have failed this year.

Case in point: last night, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which is a stock that has many haters, spiked 9% on their earnings headline. Sellers couldn't even materially hurt a controversial stock like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) who faces a slew of serious challenges.

So, unless things change again, I expect the bulls to remain in control. The macroeconomic conditions are still strong in spite of a few pockets of weakness. Overall, companies are delivering strong P&Ls. So shorting here makes little sense.

### Trading Visa Stock

I am already long American Express (NYSE:AXP) and profitable with it. But Visa stock is another one I'd buy here. This would be a trade I can hold for years.

My approach to this also has short-term opportunity. Technically, V stock has been trading in a tight range for January. And coming into the earnings event it was trading just below a potential breakout line. When that happens, a breakout from a tight range usually over shoots in that direction once the limit is breached.

In this case, if Visa can rise above $140 per share it can invite more buyers. The upside target could then target the $150 zone. There are a few spots of potential resistance along the way. First at $141 and $142.20 per share which were failure levels on December 12th and 7th respectively.

Then, there is a bigger pivot point at $145.75 which was an important island reversal on December 4. Breaking out of that one can really heat the rally up. Will there be dips? Likely. But in the long run, if the markets are higher then so is Visa stock.

Investors aren't going to regret buying shares at this valuation over the years. Visa sells at a 33 price-to-earnings ratio which is in line with MA but much cheaper than PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) which sells at 50 P/E and SQ who still loses money. Only AXP is cheaper from that perspective.

### The Bottom Line for Visa Stock

I believe that from here, the blindside is to the upside for Visa stock. Meaning the likelihood of an upside surprise is far greater than a trap door. Consider the fact that the resolution to the China/U.S.tariff standoff could include an open door to Visa and its competitors to enter the Chinese markets unrestricted. If that happens, then the upside is massive.

The analysts on Wall Street agree. They almost uniformly rate V stock as a BUY yet it is still trading much lower than their price range. They too believe that more upside is definitely the likely scenario for years.

Click here for a bonus video that I recently shared discussing Square (SQ). I think it can help looking at this one here too. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

The company posted net income of $900 million, or 87 cents a share, up from $200 million, or 21 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.

Net revenue climbed to $3.8 billion from $3.3 billion, in line with the FactSet consensus. Mastercard said that gross dollar volume rose 14% during the quarter, while purchase volume climbed 15%. Cross-border volumes rose by 17%. Peer Visa Inc. reported earnings and revenue beats on Wednesday afternoon, but the company&apos;s cross-border trends sparked some concern among analysts.

2019-01-29	2019-01-29 17:43:36	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	New B2B Debit Card From Square Almost Completes the Puzzle	"Roughly a week ago, payments middleman Square (NYSE:SQ) launched a debit card designed specifically for merchants who are already using its platform. SQ stock jumped on the news, and understandably so. Backed by Mastercard (NYSE:MA), the card gives small businesses immediate access to funds that they might otherwise have to wait days to use.

The marketability of the card is clear. Even if it can only be used by Square's current customers, certainly most of them will be interested in the offer; waiting for funds to clear can hurt small businesses over time.

But the new Square Card's real strength lies in the fact that it's a piece of a puzzle for SQ stock that's not yet complete, but soon could be.

### Square Card Will Be an Easy Sell

Square Card is another shot at Square's rival, Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), which has taken similar -- though not identical -- initiatives. With Square Card, Square's customers will be able to immediately access the payments made to them. without paying a fee. Prior to the launch of Square Card, merchants could immediately access payments made to them, but they had to pay a 1% fee to do so.

Moreover, Square merchants who use their Square Cards to buy goods and services from other Square merchants will receive a 2.75% rebate on those purchases.

In simplest terms, the payments company is developing its own ecosystem…. one that Nomura Instinet analyst Dan Dolev believes plugs the company into a total addressable market of $50 billion. Dolev, however, thinks that Square Card will only increase Square's revenue by $2 million to $7 million within the next couple of years.

More than that, though, adding another feature to the list of benefits offered to merchants will certainly inspire more companies to consider using Square's services. Over time, the card should help Square increase its customer base, ultimately raising Square's bottom line and boosting SQ stock.

But that's not the only reason that the current and would-be owners of Square stock should celebrate Square Card.

### Another Piece of the Puzzle

Square Card is a debit card that effectively allows merchants to bypass traditional banks. But the debut of the new product may only be a stepping stone to SQ becoming a full-blown bank.

If the idea sounds familiar to longtime fans of SQ stock, there's a reason for that. SQ filed paperwork to become a true bank, with insured deposits, in September 2017. Square was aiming to become a government-approved bank primarily because it wanted to provide loans and credit that small businesses generally aren't able to get from their local banks.

SQ withdrew that application in July of last year, but the idea never really went away, and in December of last year, Square refiled the application.

If the application is approved -- and there's no clear reason it wouldn't be -- Square will become a one-stop solution for merchants, allowing Square's customers to avoid dealing with conventional, local banks altogether.

### The Bottom Line on SQ Stock

Although Square already facilitates loans, it only does so by referring customers to Utah-based Celtic Bank.

But facilitating loans is not a big business for Square. Securing its own bank charter would allow SQ itself to become a lender, which is a more profitable role. With more potential earnings on the table, Square would certainly more intensively market its loans. And, since two million merchants are already using Square to accept customer payments, SQ has two million potential customers to whom it can easily market its loans.

All of Square's customers would likely understand the benefit of having real-time access to payments via a debit card.

The valuation of SQ stock certainly isn't low, but there's more than enough growth in store to keep the long-term rally of Square stock going.

As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. You can follow him on Twitter, at @jbrumley.

2019-01-22	2019-01-22 15:49:58	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Payments and Banking Create a Bright Future for Square Stock	"Over the past several years, Square (NYSE:SQ) has made a name for itself on both Main Street and Wall Street as a trusted payments processor that is at the heart of the cashless commerce revolution. This has propelled Square's revenues to more than double over the past three years, which has in turn led to a more than six-fold increase in Square stock.

Over the next several years, the narrative will be slightly different, but the results will be the same.

Square has been gradually and successfully turning into a bank. The company has developed multiple financial tech services catered to small businesses, the sum of which have been adopted in bulk. More important, they are posing a threat to the traditional banking industry.

As Square continues to grow its banking operations alongside is payment processing business over the next several years, the company has an unique ability to be a dominant player in both industries.

Here's the bull thesis. Major payments processors have $100 billion-plus market caps. So do major banks. Square has a market cap of just $30 billion.

Thus, while bears can pound on the table all they want about valuation, the big picture idea here is that you have a hyper-growth company attacking exceptionally large and valuable markets from a unique angle. Revenue growth is large. Margins are sky high. Earnings potential is enormous.

Overall, Square stock looks like it's still in the early innings of a multi-year growth narrative. As this narrative plays out, Square stock will only head higher, making this stock a solid long term buy-and-hold.

### Payments Processing Is a $100 Billion-Plus Opportunity

Before we jump into the banking side of Square, it's necessary to understand that Square stock has huge upside in a long term window through payments processing alone.

Digital and card payments are the future. Gone are the days of cash and coins and here are the days of credit cards and e-payments. As an enabler of non-cash payments across multiple channels, Square is at the core of this transition.

They have a brick-and-mortar presence through Square machines that allow retailers of all shapes and sizes to affordably and easily process card payments. They have an online presence through Square software which does the same thing for e-payments. Recently, they extended into the mobile game sector and now have payment software that can be incorporated into apps.

Overall, everywhere the consumer is these days, Square is there, too, making it easier and more convenient than ever to buy and sell things.

This is a huge market. It essentially comprises the entire global consumer spend pool. That pool measured $28 trillion in 2010, projects to measure $40 trillion in 2020, and will likely surpass $50 trillion in a decade.

Square has a market cap of just $30 billion today. Granted, that market cap is because the company only controls about 0.2% of global consumer spend today. But that share has been rising over the past several years. It will continue to rise because Square is only expanding its omni-channel presence.

As such, over the next several years, Square's market share should run up to 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, 1%, so on and so forth.

From this perspective, Square projects to be a major player in the global payments processing market. Major players in this market include PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Visa (NYSE:V), and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). All three of those companies have market caps over $100 billion. Thus, at $30 billion, Square stock has plenty of runway through payments processing alone.

### Banking Is a $100 Billion Opportunity, Too

On the banking side of things, Square's opportunity is just as large and arguably even larger.

Square has made some quietly aggressive and smart moves in the banking sector over the past several quarters. Namely, the company has developed and continually improved a suite of fintech services catered towards small to medium sized businesses in the U.S.

These services include things like Square Capital, Square Payroll, and Square Card. They are essentially the same services that a big bank would offer businesses. They are just offered by Square instead.

Square is winning this battle. Why? Because traditional banking is old, with old technology and old faces and names. Square is the exact opposite. It's a new company, that is using new methods and new technology to create new solutions. They are new faces, new names, and new ideas.

It's a classic case of out with the old, in with the new. That's not to say big banks aren't adapting. They are. They will remain in control of this market for the foreseeable future. But, if the company's early successes in banking are a sign of anything, it is that Square will one day become a major player in this market.

Major players in this market all have $100 billion-plus market caps. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has a $230 billion market cap. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is at $340 billion. Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) valuation hovers around $280 billion, while Citigroup (NYSE:C) is at $150 billion.

To reiterate for emphasis purposes, Square's market cap is a fraction of all those market caps at just $30 billion.

As such, through expanded operations in the financial services sector, Square has a tremendous opportunity to grow into something much, much bigger.

### Bottom Line on SQ Stock

Square stock has two $100 billion-plus opportunities in front of it in the payment processing and financial services sectors. More than that, the company is rapidly gaining ground in each sector and has visibility towards becoming a major player.

As such, with Square hovering around a $30 billion market cap, Square stock looks good here for big gains in the long run.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long SQ, PYPL, and V.

### Where AXP Stock Stands

Up until a week ago, traders believed that financial stocks could not rally. But that is starting to change lately  -- they have recently bought bank stocks up with both hands. This is thanks to good reactions to the Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) earnings reports. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLF) is up more than 4% in the past 5 days on top of a 10% bounce off the December lows.

However, AXP stock this morning is not getting the love that the others did this week. Perhaps the disappointing Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) report on Thursday morning soured the mood a little on Wall Street. America Express did miss slightly on both earnings and revenues, but nothing that damages its sustainable bullish thesis.

AXP is not a bank, but credit card stocks do often trade alongside the traditional financial centers. American Express is financial technology stock, or FinTech, and those are faster movers than banks.

Consider one extreme stock of the bunch, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock, which is up 72% in the past year. Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are up 13%, 20% and 9% respectively for the same period. American Express stock is lagging, down 1%, so it has some catching up to do. This is reason number one to own it now -- while it still lags.

Yes, they disappointed the Street with their earnings, but if the stock market is going higher this year then AXP will recover and rally along. Management stated yesterday that they &quot;are starting 2019 in a position of strength.&quot; This is confidence that I can bank on, and the second reason to buy.

Thirdly and perhaps the reason with the biggest upside potential on the stock is China. The tariff war has been terrifying to Wall Street but it also presents a great opportunity for AXP stock. Part of its effort to resolve the face-off with the U.S., China is likely to open its doors to U.S. companies.

American Express has the best chance to be the first U.S. mover into a massive market, having already received preliminary approval. It will be competing with Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) Alipay and Tencent (TCEHY), but it is up to the task and will be a growth market for it.

Last night, management delivered decent guidance for 2019 but lacked the wow-factor. They raised their full year revenues but kept the same range on earnings per share. These days, investors want to see upgrades in guidance. But in the face of so much uncertainty, a cautious management team is a smart one. They are aware and realistic of opportunities and pitfalls.

The bottom line and as long as stocks are rising, AXP stock dips are buying opportunities in upwards moving markets.

There are some negatives like a slight increase in provisions for losses but nothing too alarming. After all we are in a rate hike cycle and this is when things can go wrong, but this is not 2008. We don't have flagrant systemic risk. Today's stocks prices are better founded with much less froth.

The negative reaction last night and this morning are too extreme. America Express stock is too good to be punished this harshly on a tepid report.

Nevertheless, the short-term reaction to earnings events are always binary so they don't matter much over time. So luckily they are just that, short term. With time the good fundamentals will prevail over this temporary tantrum.

For any bullish trade to work out we first need the macro-economic environment to allow for it. This year we are eliminating the major reasons that plagued the bulls last year. Recently the Federal Reserve assured us that they won't invert the yield curve on purpose. Now we only need to eliminate the tariff war threat. The rhetoric on that front are also improving as both sides are showing signs of lenience.

2019-01-16	2019-01-16 18:57:12	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Should You Buy American Express Stock Before Earnings?	"We're only a few days into earnings season and so far it's a mixed bag. Overall, bank earnings aren't suggesting there was an issue from the consumer side. Those that did poorly were mostly from a result of the Fed or fourth-quarter volatility. That bodes well for credit card companies like American Express (NYSE:AXP). AXP stock will be in the spotlight on Thursday when the company reports its quarterly results after the close.

Currently, analysts expect fourth-quarter earnings of $1.80 per share. If AXP hits this mark, it will represent 13.9% year-over-year (YoY) growth. American Express has beat earnings estimates for seven straight quarters. Worth noting, unlike some bank stocks, estimates haven't come down for AXP. In fact, they have climbed a penny per share over the last 30 days and are flat over the last 90 days. Despite this, the stock has been under pressure.

  * 10 Growth Stocks With the Future Written All Over Them 



On the revenue front, analysts are calling for sales of $10.56 billion in sales, representing a impressive YoY gain of 19.5%. Short of management providing disappointing guidance, it's hard to imagine AXP stock falling should the company beat these estimates.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Valuing American Express Stock

Analysts expect American Express to grow sales 20.8% in fiscal 2018 to $40.44 billion. For earnings, they're looking for $7.38 per share, 25.7% YoY. This leaves AXP stock trading at just over 13 times this year's earnings. That's cheaper than both Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) -- two stocks that I like very much.

I like V and MA for their consistency. With AXP, there's been a few more bumps in the road. Estimates call for a notable deceleration in growth in 2019, but analysts are still looking for positive results. Expectations call for 7.6% sales growth in fiscal 2019 and 10.2% earnings growth.

13 times earnings is reasonable for double-digit earnings growth in 2018 and 2019, and strong sales growth both years. Last quarter, AXP beat top- and bottom-line expectations, raised guidance and expanded its partnership with the fast-growing PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).

These are things we like to see from a company. From a fundamental perspective, AXP is attractive, although because of its loaning business, it does not operate solely on the &quot;tollbooth&quot; business like Visa and MasterCard. Online spending and holiday shopping was strong last quarter, which bodes well for all the credit card companies. One worry though? Falling gas prices. While lower gas prices is a boon for consumers, it hurts transaction revenue for companies like V, MA and AXP. Let's see if that impacts the top line this quarter.

### Trading AXP Stock

Shares are up about 10% off the recent lows, as AXP stock has gone from $89 to $98. Near $98, American Express stock has been consolidating nicely over the last few days. It's currently holding up over the 21-day moving average and earnings will decide if the next move is up or down.

So which is it?

A reaction to earnings ahead of the announcement is impossible to predict. But we can look at a few key levels to consider. For instance, on the downside, we have the 21-day just below current prices at $96.78. That's a little too close to expect it to hold as support. However, $95 has been notable and could stand up as support should AXP stock come under pressure. The last line in the sand comes down near $89 to $90. This mark has held up throughout 2018 and I would expect it to now, provided something horrible doesn't come from the quarter.

  * 7 Oversold Small-Cap Stocks With Massive Profit Growth 



On the upside, The $100 to $102 level has been significant and may act as resistance going forward. It doesn't help that the 200-day is at $101 and the 50-day is just under $103. However, a 5% pop would clear AXP stock over all of these levels and make it an enticing post-earnings entry for bulls should the stock close above these levels.

As a result, speculators have been dumping Square stock for months now. SQ stock has plummeted from $100 recently to as low as $50 two weeks ago.

In October, I warned, &quot;If This Analyst Is Right, Square Stock Is About to Crash.&quot; At the time, Square was still trading for $80/share. Mark Palmer and Giuliano Bologna of BTIG released a scathing report at the time suggesting that SQ stock was worth just $30/share. And give them credit, it's been a great call so far.

At the time, I suggested that $30 was a pretty fanciful target, but that Square stock certainly did seem like a sell. But what's happened in the ensuing three months? Is Square's current $58 price reasonable?

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index 



### Square: Valued Like a Bank?

One way that investors manage to lose lots of money, over and over, is by falsely labeling companies as &quot;tech&quot; outfits. Investors tend to give tech stocks, particularly in bull markets, extremely generous valuations.

The so-called Fintech sector was clever in marketing themselves as tech first, rather than as quasi-banks. Tech companies get way more investor enthusiasm than financial firms. This is a central part of the bearish case for Square stock in particular.

Bulls have long touted Square as a tech platform that should be valued in line with other innovative software or application firms. BTIG suggested otherwise, saying Square is much closer to a bank than the bulls would like to admit.

You could also make the middle ground argument that Square should be priced like a credit card company such as Visa (NYSE:V) or Mastercard (NYSE:MA).

However, both of these more favorable comparisons miss a major point. Pure tech companies usually don't lend to their customers, and the credit card companies tend to offload all the credit risk onto banks.

There is a reason the credit card operators routinely trade for 20-25x earnings while big banks are often under 15x earnings. Visa makes money on every transaction with minimal risk, whereas the bank issuing the credit card shoulders the risk of the consumer not paying.

Square is planting itself firmly in the bank category by lending directly to small businesses. This is arguably even riskier than normal credit card lending. Most consumers pay their credit card bills faithfully and generally only default if they lose their jobs or experience some catastrophe.

Small businesses, on the other hand, go bankrupt exceptionally often. More than 20% of restaurants fail in their first year, and more than 50% within the first three years, for example. You wouldn't lend to small businesses for long without taking major credit risk.

### Core Business Isn't That Large

There's always been an issue of just which customers Square should target. On the one hand, you had it making flashy deals with the likes of huge companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). On the other hand, Square's bread and butter has been small  (often very small) businesses.

Currently, Morningstar estimates that about half of Square's clients execute $125,000 or less in annual payments using Square's platform. In other words, just a few hundred dollars a day of payments on average.

That's fine and well, if Square can get tons of business of this size to stay loyal to its platform, it can eventually make profits. However, once businesses start doing more annual revenues, they tend to want to switch to much cheaper payments providers such as Global Payments (NYSE:GPN).

Thus, Square faces an inherent problem. You need tons of micro-businesses to reach profitable scale as a payments processor. But if you target more mid-sized businesses, then your profit margin on each transaction needs to come down a lot to stay competitive.

So far, it seems Square has struggled to find the right balance to achieve consistent profitability. That, in turn, is probably why it is spending so much energy on newer products like Cash App along with riskier direct lending to its customers.

### Square Stock Has Further to Fall

For Square stock, everything comes down to how the economy goes. If the economy keeps on humming and tech stocks recover from this correction, SQ stock will also come flying back. If the stock market and FAANGs hit new highs, SQ stock could even reach $100 again. But I'd argue Square is far from the best pick even if you are bullish on the market.

It's important to keep your downside risk in mind. So many tech companies with fantastic balance sheets, strong profits, and little credit or recession risk are trading down 30-40% over the past few months. Square, on the other hand, is much more of a gamble. We have no idea what sort of returns Square Capital, its lending arm, will produce during a recession, but odds are they won't be good.

More generally, Square's business model is still relatively unproven. Are there enough small businesses willing to pay Square's higher payment processing rates?

The company has been around quite awhile now and still hasn't found a path to consistent profits. Instead, it seems to be adding ancillary services such as lending, the Cash App, bitcoin trading, and so on to try to augment a core business that just isn't that promising.

If Square does reach solid profitability, a large part of that will probably come from its lending business. In that case, expect investors to view Square stock and trade it accordingly.

Put it all together, and you have a company that has more downside risk than other tech firms in a recession. The combination of credit risk and tech stock selling has formed a vicious circle for Square.

Even if things do turn around, Square will probably still underperform other tech outfits that have more compelling business models. With so many great tech companies on sale now, you can do better than SQ stock.

2018-12-04	2018-12-04 20:43:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Mastercard boosts dividend shortly after announcing new European interchange resolution	Mastercard Inc.  announced Tuesday that it was boosting its quarterly dividend to 33 cents a share, up from 25 cents a share previously. The company also said that it has received board approval for a new share-repurchase program that will allow it to buy back up to $6.5 billion of its Class A shares, which will become effective after the company&apos;s prior $4 billion repurchase program is complete. The dividend announcement didn&apos;t help Mastercard&apos;s stock much, as shares are down roughly 4% in afternoon trading Tuesday amid a general market selloff and a early-morning filing from Mastercard that discussed inter-regional interchange fees in the European Union. Mastercard said it would reduce the interchange fees on cross-border transactions coming into European Economic Area companies to 0.2% for debit and 0.3% for credit, for card-present transactions. The company said it would lower card-not-present, or e-commerce, interchange fees to 1.15% for debit and 1.5% for credit. Mastercard also said it would pay a $650 million fine in the fourth quarter related to this issue. &quot;The issue appears to be resolved voluntarily, eliminating the risk, cost, and distraction of outstanding litigation, and even the potential negative impacts to the networks are modest,&quot; MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis wrote Tuesday. Mastercard shares have gained 33% so far this year, while Visa Inc.  shares have risen 22%. The S&P 500  is up 1.4% in that time.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9ee85fc6-0bf3-31ab-85bd-1e332f56a847/mastercard-boosts-dividend.html?.tsrc=rss

The European Union competition enforcer said interchange fees in which the merchant's bank pays a charge to the cardholder's bank which then passes the cost to the merchant, result in higher consumer prices.  Visa, the world's largest payments network operator, and No. 2 player Mastercard have proposed a 0.2 percent fee on debit card payments carried out in shops and a 0.3 percent fee on credit card payments, the Commission said on Tuesday.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-mastercard-propose-merchants-tourist-105231153.html?.tsrc=rss

2018-11-15	2018-11-15 02:00:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	PayPal named a &apos;top pick&apos; at Barclays	Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal labeled PayPal Holdings Inc.  his top pick in payments and processing late Wednesday in initiating coverage of the category. &quot;PayPal remains a scarce asset levered to most dynamic parts of the payments industry,&quot; wrote El-Assal, who began coverage of the stock with an overweight rating and $110 price target. He sees PayPal shares as attractive given that the company has a market capitalization of roughly $100 billion but is growing organic revenue by about 20%. El-Assal wrote that PayPal has significant exposure to &quot;tech-enabled&quot; online channels as well as fast-growing international markets. He&apos;s also upbeat about opportunities from Venmo. &quot;Given Venmo revenue historically has carried no profit, even modest uptake of monetization should have an outsized earnings impact,&quot; he said. El-Assal also assigned overweight ratings to shares of Visa Inc. , Mastercard Inc. , and Square Inc. , among other payments names. PayPal&apos;s stock ended Wednesday&apos;s regular session up 0.3% and was up 0.4% in after-hours trading. The S&P 500  dropped 0.8% on Wednesday.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/28627bcb-33e6-3d51-918f-681836deda96/paypal-named-a-%26apos%3Btop.html?.tsrc=rss

Mastercard posted a sizable third-quarter earnings beat and in-line revenue on Tuesday morning, but shares slumped after the release. Analysts chimed in with positive commentary on Wednesday. &quot;Although Mastercard&apos;s third-quarter top-line results were just in line and the stock sold off yesterday, we found a lot to like including accelerating underlying volume growth, rising yields and lower expenses,&quot; wrote Buckingham Research analyst Chris Brendler. Benrstein&apos;s Harshita Rawat called the company&apos;s third-quarter volume metrics &quot;pristine&quot; and highlighted discussion by Mastercard&apos;s executives of emerging opportunities in business-to-business payments. Wednesday was a strong day for financial-technology stocks in general, with Square Inc.  shares up 6.8%, PayPal Holdings Inc.  shares up 4.1%, and Visa Inc.  shares up 3.8%.

2018-09-17	2018-09-17 15:55:00	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	PayPal is a &apos;safe-haven stock&apos; like Visa and Mastercard, says Instinet	Instinet analyst Bill Carcache on Monday called PayPal Holdings Inc.  shares &quot;an oasis in a challenging market&quot; and said that PayPal is a &quot;safe-haven stock (in the same family as Visa Inc.  and Mastercard Inc. .&quot; He believes that the company will be able to &quot;accelerate&quot; Venmo&apos;s monetization efforts and card-volume growth. In a recent conversation with the company&apos;s chief financial officer, Carcache learned that demand for physical Venmo debit cards has outstripped supply. &quot;Issuance delays represent a short-term obstacle and suggest that Venmo card monetization efforts will continue to ramp gradually over time as customers receive and activate their cards,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Notably, Venmo debit card volumes are largely funded via ACH [Automated Clearing House, or bank-account funding], debit cards, and stored balances and are expected to exert downward pressure on the transaction expense rate.&quot; Pricing opportunities for the core PayPal platform and the ability to pay with rewards are other growth opportunities highlighted by PayPal&apos;s CFO at the recent meeting with Carcache. He rates PayPal&apos;s stock a buy with a $120 price target. Also on Monday, PayPal announced the global rollout of its new marketing and checkout tools. The shares are down 1.6% in Monday&apos;s session, though they&apos;re up 43% over the past 12 months. The S&P 500  has gained 16% in that time.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a7e392ae-2842-3e0d-b287-63ae548fa30c/paypal-is-a-%26apos%3Bsafe-haven.html?.tsrc=rss

The new payment option is in partnership with fintech company Simplex, per the company’s blog post.Up until today, users who wanted to purchase cryptocurrencies were limited to a few options that included bank deposits and wire transfers. In addition to these, the company also offers a means of buying altcoins using either bitcoin or litecoin for countries where bank wires and deposit options are unavailable.The addition of Visa and Mastercard debit/credit card options makes it cheaper and faster to purchase cryptocurrencies on the platform. The new payment options are accessible via the website and the app.Speaking with 
<i>Bitcoin Magazine</i>, Abra CEO Bill Barhydt stated, “Today we have users from over 70 countries, but the majority of these users who are outside the U.S. could only fund their Abra wallet using bitcoin. With this launch, we can now offer a simple way for customers globally to use Abra to buy their first bitcoin using any Visa or Mastercard and then start investing in any of the other 24 cryptocurrencies we support today.”The new payment options come with increased buy limits, faster processing times and more accessibility. Users who purchase bitcoin with their Visa or Mastercard will now be allowed to buy up to $20,000 worth of bitcoin at a time — which is a step above the $2,000 limit placed on bank deposits.Users will also be able to store purchased bitcoin into any supported wallet. The company says processing time would be shorter, as new bitcoins should be available in digital wallets 30 minutes after purchase.Abra is one of the few cryptocurrency platforms that hasn&apos;t embraced KYC/AML regulations in their entirety. In an email sent to its customers last month, the company said users were not mandated to provide “any form of identification&quot; to use its platform. Barhydt has said that Abra is able to avoid &quot;all these complexities&quot; because it doesn’t hold customers’ funds. The company, however, requires American customers to submit their ID to increase funding limits via bank transfer options.

Companies have binged on debt, capitalizing on record-low interest rates to add about $14 trillion of obligations to their balance sheets since the 2008-09 global financial crisis—using some of it to buy back $5 trillion in stock, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/84015b06-ba11-39dc-acb8-1bb4841e3bd3/%5B%24%24%5D-5-stocks-that-can.html?.tsrc=rss

The payment companies are worried India's data onshoring move could set a precedent and nudge other major governments to implement similar rules at a time when there is heightened scrutiny on how companies globally handle their customers' data.  The industry's tussle with RBI also comes as Prime Minster Narendra Modi aggressively pushes digital and cashless modes of payment that leave an electronic trail as part of a campaign to crack down on the black economy.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-india-resists-lobbying-u-143851070.html?.tsrc=rss

Americans illegally bet an estimated $150 billion on sports games each year, a figure that’s enticing for credit-card issuers looking to gin up extra spending by their customers.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/cad16a70-0a1d-3815-a597-b7131fa544d1/sports-gambling%27s-next-hurdle.html?.tsrc=rss

2018-01-18	2018-01-18 15:30:21	MA	Mastercard Incorporated	Why PayPal has Partnered with Credit Card Companies	While PayPal (PYPL) has talked about its customer acquisition rate gaining momentum after it decided to partner with card companies Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), this boost may just be a beneficial side effect of the partnerships.  PayPal went into partnership with Visa and MasterCard with specific goals in mind, namely to enable customers to pay any way they want.  At the Credit Suisse 21st Annual Technology, Media & Telecom Conference, PayPal CFO (chief financial officer) John Rainey said, “What the network agreements did for us, though, was fundamentally, they’re all about providing our customers choice to allow them the way they – to transact however they want,” adding that “if they want to use a Visa card or a MasterCard or a particular issuer card, they can do that.	http://finance.yahoo.com/r/e3e200fb-9b86-3f67-b4f4-3d51b64cfb17/why-paypal-has-partnered-with-credit-card-companies?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=feed&yptr=yahoo&.tsrc=rss

Commenting on the deals a few months later at the WSJDLive conference in Laguna Beach, California, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman stated that “we think we can be great allies…to advance the cause of digital payments,” according to The Wall Street Journal.
