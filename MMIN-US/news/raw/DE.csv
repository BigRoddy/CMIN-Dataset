2021-05-17	2021-05-17 01:48:54	DE	Deere & Company	Microsoft Conducted Probe on Gates’s Involvement With Employee	(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. conducted an investigation into co-founder Bill Gates’s involvement with an employee almost two decades ago after it was informed in 2019 of his attempt to start a romantic relationship with that person.The board reviewed the matter and held a “thorough investigation” with the help of an external law firm, the software giant said. It didn’t reach a conclusion to the probe because Gates had stepped down before it was completed, Microsoft said.“Microsoft received a concern in the latter half of 2019 that Bill Gates sought to initiate an intimate relationship with a company employee in the year 2000,” Microsoft said in a statement. “A committee of the Board reviewed the concern, aided by an outside law firm, to conduct a thorough investigation. Throughout the investigation, Microsoft provided extensive support to the employee who raised the concern.”Dow Jones earlier reported that Microsoft’s directors found Gates’ involvement with the female employee to be inappropriate and decided last year that he had to step down from the board, citing people familiar with the matter who weren’t identified.Microsoft didn’t provide further details on the investigation.The billionaire said in March last year that he was stepping down from the board to devote more time to philanthropy. Gates hasn’t been active in a day-to-day role since 2008, Microsoft said at that time. Gates co-founded the software company in 1975 and served as its CEO until 2000, the same year his foundation was started, and was chairman until February 2014.‘An Affair’A spokeswoman for Gates said his decision to leave the board has nothing to do with the romantic involvement with an employee.“There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably,” she said, adding that his “decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter.”The belated investigation into the affair came at a time that was marked by a groundswell of discussion at Microsoft about the treatment of women and Me-Too conversations in the broader industry. Since 2000, Microsoft had also put in place processes for investigating allegations and overhauled them with the goal of making them stronger, the company said.Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich resigned after the board was informed that he had had a consensual relationship with a subordinate, even though that relationship had ended years before and predated his appointment to the top job at the company. The board conducted investigations internally and via external counsel to confirm the violation of the company’s policies and made the announcement June 2018.Gates and Melinda French Gates announced their divorce earlier this month after 27 years of marriage. Several reports, including those that emerged over the weekend, said she had raised concerns over his dealings with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The New York Times had reported in 2019 that Gates had met with Epstein several times, and once stayed late at his New York townhouse. Epstein had died in jail two months prior while awaiting trial on federal charges related to sex trafficking.Gates’s spokeswoman denied the reports. The “characterization of his meetings with Epstein and others about philanthropy is inaccurate,” she said. “The rumors and speculation surrounding Gates’ divorce are becoming increasingly absurd.”While Gates’ dealings with Epstein weren’t a part of the scope of the Microsoft investigation, it was discussed by some board members, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.Stock TransfersThe split also put a spotlight on the Gates fortune, valued at about $144 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, as well as their foundation.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest of its kind on the planet. With more than 1,600 employees and offices around the world, it has already distributed more than $50 billion since its inception to causes like vaccine development and women’s empowerment.Last week, Cascade Investment, the investment company created by Gates, transferred stock in Deere & Co. to his wife, bringing the total amount she’s received since they announced their divorce to more than $3 billion.The investment vehicle transferred about 2.25 million shares worth about $851 million, according to a regulatory filing. That followed similar disclosures tied to Mexican companies Coca-Cola Femsa and Grupo Televisa and about $1.8 billion of stock in Canadian National Railway Co. and AutoNation Inc.Read More: Gates Divorce Roils World’s Biggest Family Philanthropy EngineMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-board-had-gates-investigated-231542876.html?.tsrc=rss

Batteries that power everything from cell phones to airplanes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips These are the kinds of technologies people think about when looking into the future. They don’t think about tractors. 10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks for Your Reliability Short List But that’s the cool thing about the Roaring 2020s. These breakthroughs touch everything. They create new industries and transform old ones. That’s why I think this decade will bring some of the best opportunities investors ever see. Take the story of a 184-year-old company that began with a new way to plow dirt and is now moving headlong into advanced technology. Companies everywhere must do the same … Autonomous vehicles (AVs) — or self-driving cars — will change the way we get around in ways we haven’t seen since Henry Ford introduced the Model T in 1980. AVs are going to reshape the American landscape. How you vacation, where you live, even the way we design our cities and neighborhoods will change. With this much at stake, many of the world’s smartest, richest, most powerful entrepreneurs, investors and corporations are working day and night to make early and strong entrances into this market that will one day be massive. I have no doubt the winners of this race will see their stocks advance 10-fold … 20-fold … even 100-fold over the coming decade … taking investors along for the ride of their lives. But autonomous driving technology isn’t just for cars. It isn’t even just for busses, or trains, or airplanes. More than 70 years before Henry Ford introduced the Model T, a blacksmith by the name of John Deere saw a broken steel sawmill blade and had an idea. Farmers had to constantly stop working to knock dirt off their cast-iron plows. Deere thought that if the plows were made of polished steel, the dirt would slide off and make farming a whole lot easier. Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) began in 1837 with what was a “high tech” plow at the time, and you know the rest of the story. It grew into one of the world’s biggest companies that manufactures all kinds of equipment for agriculture, construction, lawn care and more. Deere continues to embrace innovation and is now focused on new technology that will reshape the company and its industry. The company itself says it is transforming from a “machinery company” into a “smart technology company.” Investors like what they see. The stock has jumped more than 200% in the last 12 months — which included the pandemic — giving the company a valuation of $120 billion. I got to see some of what Deere is up to a little over a year ago at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. I’m more of a city boy, so I can’t say I’ve done a lot of farming or lawn care in my time, but what I saw was cool. The company is focused on three main areas of innovation … Electric power: The days of tractors growling through the fields and belching smoke into the air are coming to an end. “Electrification is not just about replacing the fuel tank; it’s about replacing the complete engine,” said Martin Kremmer of the John Deere European Technology Center. This results in zero emissions, low maintenance costs and increased efficiency and productivity. Efficiency and productivity will improve even more as next-generation batteries are rolled out. The coming breakthrough battery technology will power all electric vehicles of the future. Deere recognizes its importance … and so do smart investors. That makes now the time to get in position for the biggest profits. Autonomy: Yes, tractors will drive themselves one day. In fact, some believe tractors might get there before cars because they operate in open fields instead of crowded streets. But in this case, autonomy means more than self-driving. For example, Deere is developing autonomous ways to spray crops. One way is through drones, which would house a scanner that identifies weeds and automatically triggers a pesticide spray when needed. (The drones would also rely on battery power.) Artificial intelligence (AI): High-resolution cameras take 20 pictures per second, and using AI, the system “learns” the difference between weeds and crops. It then sprays weed killer where needed instead of blanketing an entire field. That’s better for the environment, more effective for the farmer and cheaper to boot. With this kind of innovation occurring in industry after industry, you can see why I believe the Roaring 2020s will be a decade for the investing record books. Several once-in-a-generation technologies are converging at the same time and transforming virtually every aspect of our lives — from healthcare to instant communication to robotics to electric power and much more. Even an industry like farming, which you could say is as old as dirt, is becoming “smart.” The impact these technologies have on the global economy will one day dwarf the internet. To make money, you want to invest in companies leading the way. And to make the big money, you want to do it soon … while it’s still early.

2021-05-04	2021-05-04 04:16:55	DE	Deere & Company	Bill and Melinda Gates to Divorce With $146 Billion at Stake	(Bloomberg) -- Bill and Melinda Gates, who for decades have overseen one of history’s greatest fortunes and philanthropic operations, said they plan to divorce.The announcement Monday that the couple is splitting after 27 years of marriage has the power to ripple through the technology industry, a vast portfolio of business and real estate holdings and into the realms of global health, climate change policy and social issues including equality for women.The pair, who command an estimated $146 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, made no public hint of their financial plans, though they emphasized that they will cooperate on continuing their philanthropy.“After a great deal of thought and a lot of work on our relationship, we have made the decision to end our marriage,” the two said in a brief statement posted on Twitter. “We have raised three incredible children and built a foundation that works all over the world to enable all people to lead healthy, productive lives.”Bill Gates, the 65-year-old co-founder of Microsoft Corp., ranks as the world’s fourth-richest person. Melinda Gates, 56, is a former Microsoft manager who’s gained international prominence co-running the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It’s already given away more than $50 billion.They will remain co-chairs and trustees of the foundation, a spokesperson for the organization wrote in an emailed statement.“No changes to their roles or the organization are planned,” according to the statement. “They will continue to work together to shape and approve foundation strategies, advocate for the foundation’s issues, and set the organization’s overall direction.”The couple filed for divorce in King County on Monday, an online search of court dockets shows. They have a separation agreement, according to a copy of a divorce petition posted by the website TMZ, which doesn’t elaborate on the terms. It calls their marriage “irretrievably broken.”It’s the second bombshell divorce among the uppermost ranks of the world’s richest people in recent years, following the 2019 separation announcement of Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott.That split, which divided the couple’s stake in Amazon.com Inc., immediately made MacKenzie one of the world’s richest people. In the months that followed, she became one of the most influential philanthropists in the world, giving away billions of dollars to often overlooked causes among billionaire donors.But for Bill and Melinda Gates, separating assets potentially poses a bigger challenge than dividing the Bezos fortune, which was largely concentrated in Amazon stock.Bill Gates’s net worth originated with Microsoft but shares of the software-maker now probably make up less than 20% of his assets. He’s shifted much of his stake into the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation over the years and his exact stake hasn’t been disclosed since he left Microsoft’s board last year.Gates’s biggest asset is Cascade Investment, a holding company he created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends that’s run by Michael Larson. Through Cascade, Gates has interests in real estate, energy and hospitality as well as stakes in dozens of public companies, including Canadian National Railway and Deere & Co.Monica Mazzei, a divorce attorney and a partner at Sideman & Bancroft LLP in San Francisco, said the big question concerning the couple’s foundation and family office is to what extent they plan on working together going forward.“Even in the most amicable divorces I’ve seen, the preference has been to split the foundation in two so that there’s more autonomy and less intermingling,” she said. The same principle applies to family offices, where the investments could be divvied up into two separate pots.`Challenging Stretch’Washington law may offer some clues to how they divide their assets. As a community property state, anything acquired during a marriage is considered equally owned by both partners, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the fortune would be split in half.“It is not a mandatory 50-50,” said Janet George, a family lawyer in Washington with the firm McKinley Irvin. “The courts can award more or less, depending on what is just and equitable.” The public might never find out how they split the fortune, because it can be hidden behind private contracts, she said.Washington mandates a 90-day cooling off period from the day a couple initially files for divorce before the process can be finalized by a judge. The couple’s divorce filing -- listing Melinda as the petitioner and Bill as joining, with both of them signing -- asks the court to dissolve their marriage on a date noted in their separation agreement. “It’s been a challenging stretch of time for our whole family,” their eldest daughter, Jennifer, wrote on Instagram.Their youngest child is 18.Becoming PhilanthropistsThe pair met in New York in the 1980s, early into Melinda’s time at Microsoft.When deciding whether to marry, Bill made a pro-and-con list on a whiteboard -- Melinda related how she walked into his bedroom to find him tabulating various factors in the Netflix documentary series “Inside Bill’s Brain.”The couple’s philanthropy has always been deeply rooted in their relationship and marriage. The day before they wed in Hawaii, Bill’s mother, Mary, who had been trying to convince him to dramatically increase his charity, gave Melinda a letter which closed with the words “From those to whom much is given, much is expected.” Mary Gates died several months later.But it was on a trip to Africa during their engagement that the couple decided they would become serious philanthropists.“We fell in love with everything we saw but it’s really not at all trite to say that we really fell in love with the people,” Melinda said at a Salesforce event in 2016. “It just started us on this series of questions of sort of saying to ourselves, ‘What is going on here?’”Later on in the trip, the couple filled out a marriage questionnaire to make sure they had the same values. That’s when they decided “the vast majority of resources from Microsoft would go back to society,” Melinda said. “It was an easy discussion. We just thought it would be later in our lives when we got to do it.”(Updates with separation agreement in eighth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-146-011354614.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-03	2021-04-03 13:39:32	DE	Deere & Company	Why Is John Deere Part Of The New Ark Funds Space ETF?	The Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKX) launched last week and many of the holdings were surprises to investors looking for a pure play on space companies. What Happened: One of the most surprising names in the new Ark space ETF was Deere & Company (NYSE: DE). The farm equipment maker is the 13th largest holding in the new ETF, representing $10.8 million and 3.1% of the fund’s assets as of Thursday. The inclusion shows Ark is not only including pure space companies. The fund also will hold companies that could benefit from the growth of space. “Aerospace beneficiary companies are companies whose operations stand to benefit from aerospace activities, including agriculture, internet access, global positioning system, construction, imaging, drones, air taxes and electric aviation vehicles,” according to Ark Funds. Related Link: Cathie Wood Could Be Launching A Space Exploration ETF Why It’s Important: Since the 1990s, John Deere has worked on using GPS technology to improve precision agriculture. In 2018, John Deere partnered with NASA to improve its self-driving tractors. The company tapped into NASA’s global network of ground stations. Most self-driving tractors cultivating the majority of American farmland rely on NASA technology. The NASA model for commercial software can help predict yields and classify land types using satellite imagery. “This innovation resulted in perhaps one of NASA’s most important contributions to modern society — highly accurate GPS navigation anywhere on Earth, including crop fields,” the Food Institute said on the GPS improvements brought from NASA software. The link between space and agriculture companies appears here to stay: In December 2020, NASA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture extended a long-standing partnership on space-based assets. Ark Funds sees Deere & Company and other agricultural-related names, such as top holding Trimble Inc (NASDAQ: TRMB), as winners in the growth of satellites and GPS. DE Price Action: Shares of Deere & Company ended the week up 0.29% at $372.12.

2021-03-26	2021-03-26 14:17:16	DE	Deere & Company	8 Hot Stocks to Buy for Your Well-Diversified Portfolio	Beyond these hot stocks, the markets have certainly climbed a wall of worry since the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. last year around this time. And there are some sectors where investors are now rotating out of, looking for the next leg up in the markets. That certainly makes sense. But there are sectors and select stocks that are just warming up. They have plenty left in the tank and will continue to grow briskly in coming quarters. The pandemic actually lit a fuse under these stocks and the transition to the “next normal” will work in their favor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Value Stocks That Will Reward Investors Who Have Some Patience These eight stocks to buy for your well-diversified portfolio are great additions for anyone looking to add some quality growth stocks to their collection: Deere & Co (NYSE:DE) Dolby Laboratories (NYSE:DLB) Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) Simply Good Foods (NASDAQ:SMPL) Thor Industries (NYSE:THO) Williams Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) Hot Stocks to Buy: Deere & Co (DE) Source: mark stephens photography / Shutterstock.com Nothing runs like a Deere. The slogan has been with the company since 1978. Now, most companies are changing their slogan every couple years to stay “fresh” and “contemporary.” DE has been around since 1837 doing pretty much what it has always done — build some of the best agricultural, forestry and lawn care equipment in the business. When you drive through rural areas, especially now that planting season is starting, see how many green and gold tractors are in the fields and lawns. But selling tractors isn’t cool, right? How about the fact DE stock is up 164% in the past 12 months and it’s still trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 33x? As hot stocks go, DE is one of the coolest. Dolby Laboratories (DLB) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Once the biggest thing in motion pictures, DLB has been able to take its audio technology and equipment and pivot to whole new world of possibilities. Started by Ray Dolby in 1965, movies with Dolby sound were the mark of excellence for decades. And then Dolby moved to audio devices as well. Dolby sound is now a pedigree that all the top ear buds, laptops, home stereos and home theaters all have now. It has managed to remain relevant and grow its brand even as new competitors and digital sound have challenged DLB’s dominance. 7 Value Stocks That Will Reward Investors Who Have Some Patience New remote working mandates will change the workplace long term, and that means re-arming workers with equipment. It also means new demands for in-home entertainment. DE stock is up 38% in the past 12 months, yet it trades at a P/E of 31x. Etsy (ETSY) Source: quietbits / Shutterstock.com This online farmers’ market/designers’ storefront is one of my favorite growth stocks and I continue to think it’s one of the best growth stocks out there, even if it has soared 375% in the past 12 months. A few years ago, there was concern about how ETSY was going to break through and find a way to grow. As it was reworking its model, new e-commerce stores were flooding the space. But when the pandemic hit, it really launched ETSY. It was a very hot stock because it pulled in new shoppers as well as new vendors. And the company started helping new vendors build out their sites, so it was easier to launch a store on the platform. Now ETSY is a real player in the consumer retail space with a $27 billion market cap. It’s here to stay … and grow. Logitech (LOGI) Source: Ismail Sadiron / Shutterstock.com While some LOGI product is in just about every home with a computer set-up, this Switzerland-based firm has managed to keep a low profile for a long time. It makes peripherals — headsets, speakers, keyboards etc. — for digital platforms and has always had a very solid reputation in the business. The thing is, this isn’t a flashy sector to operate in, so LOGI usually isn’t making the spotlight. But the pandemic thrust its product lines into shopping carts. The stock is up 143% in the past 12 months, yet it’s still trading at a P/E of 18x. That goes to show you how undervalued this stock has been. The Top 10 Trending Reddit Stocks Today The “new normal” will also be a boon for LOGI, since that means retooling office workspaces and re-equipping them for the next leg in this post-covid world. Mosaic (MOS) Source: Shutterstock Have you ever heard of potash? Basically, it’s potassium that was traditionally derived by soaking plant or wood ash in water. The potassium’s water-soluble nature means it’s great for making fertilizer, glass, ceramics and soap. Today, potash is mined. But its demand is huge, especially as a fertilizer. MOS is one of the world’s top potash and phosphate manufacturers, with significant exposure in the Brazilian agricultural sector. Brazil is one of the largest non-GMO producers of soybeans in the world. Food demand remains a growth industry, even when other more cyclical industries fade. And this is especially true now that plant-based meat substitutes are hot. MOS is the key player for these hot stocks and has been on a quiet run of its own. The stock is up 187% in the past 12 months, yet it’s trading at a P/E of 17x. Simply Good Foods (SMPL) Source: melissamn / Shutterstock.com Part of the new food trends is also lowering carbs — less processed oils, flour and ingredients. More whole foods. And after the pandemic, there are more than a few people who added a few pandemic pounds while sitting around binge watching The Office for the fifth time. SMPL makes Atkins and Quest brand health products. In January it reported its Q1 for its fiscal year and it was strong. Sales were up 52% and net income was up 22.5 million versus a $4.8 million loss in the same quarter a year ago. It also raised its guidance for the rest of fiscal 2021. 7 Red-Hot Reddit Penny Stocks Generating Buzz Today The stock is up 86% in the past 12 months but hasn’t moved much recently. This hot stock is consolidating, which makes it a good buy before Q2 numbers come in in April. Thor Industries (THO) Source: Michael Gordon / Shutterstock.com One thing the pandemic underscored was how great it felt to get outside. And THO is all about that. Recreational vehicle (RV) and boat makers were very hot stocks when the summer rolled around. Largely that was because you could be out with your family or pandemic pals in a controlled environment. And you could take it where you wanted to go. The thing is, there’s also a new generation of people that have realized that the RV life is a pretty cool thing combined with nearly universal mobile connectivity. Unemployed recent college grads, burnt-out young overachievers and even hipsters have taken to the roads. And they like it. Thor Industries is one of the leading RV builders, making some of the most sought after brands in the business. THO stock is up 190% in the past 12 months, yet it’s selling at a P/E of 18x. There’s still plenty of road ahead for this one. Williams Sonoma (WSM) Source: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com While the name might conjure upscale cooking, kitchen and houseware, that’s only one knife in the block for this retailer. It also owns Pottery Barn and West Elm furniture brands. This was certainly the right space for a pandemic. Can’t go out to eat? Well, why not upgrade your kitchen and dining experience at home? No vacation? Why not redecorate? Whether it was one extra piece here and there, or new cookware sets, money was flowing into WSM. And WSM has done a very good job with its e-commerce sites as well, in-store sales might have lagged, but online shopping has boomed. It’s one of the hot stocks in upscale retail sector, up 303% in the past 12 months. 7 Growth Stocks to Buy That Cater to New Trends Yet its Q4 earnings, reported in mid-March, continued to impress. They even beat analysts’ expectations. And the good times will continue to roll as the economy recovers.

2021-03-05	2021-03-05 16:50:37	DE	Deere & Company	3 Industrial Stocks That Are Ignoring the Sell-Off	Panic was in the air this week. The interest-rate hobgoblins came out of the closet to haunt investors everywhere. Well, not everywhere. Oil stocks cared not a whit for the drama. Nor did industrial stocks. In fact, both of these sectors were where traders went to hide. I’m intrigued by the buoyancy from the industrial sector and will shine a spotlight on three strong stocks to buy. Equities flexing their muscles during times of turmoil are easy to see. Just sort your watchlist by percentage change. They’re the few darlings sitting in the green when everything else is red. From a charting perspective, outperformance appears when prices remain above support and key moving averages while everything else melts down. 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain Industrials score high marks on both fronts. The sector has stood tall this week, allowing its chart to stay above the rising 20-day moving average. Here are my three favorite setups in the space:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) Deere (NYSE:DE) Emerson (NYSE:EMR) After a closer inspection of each chart, I’ll reveal an options trade you can use to bank profits. Industrial Stocks: Caterpillar (CAT) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Let’s start with a logic chain. The underpinning of surging interest rates is inflation. Inflation pressures are rising because commodity prices are climbing. Commodity prices are climbing because global growth expectations are lifting. And do you know who thrives on global growth? Cyclical stocks like Caterpillar. The past week of selling appears nothing more than a garden variety pullback for CAT stock. What’s more, the prior advance saw a sharp uptick in momentum and a quartet of accumulation days. With institutions heavily favoring the feline, the wind is at the back of buyers, and higher prices are more likely than lower ones. The Trade: Buy the May $220/$230 bull call spread for $3.80. You’re risking $3.80 to capture $6.20 potentially. Deere (DE) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Deere is following in Caterpillar’s footsteps. Indeed, their price charts boast many similarities. DE stock’s last upswing had some serious firepower behind it, thanks to an impressive earnings report. Its top and bottom-line growth had buyers eagerly snatching up shares, and I can’t see them completely abandoning shares in light of a little interest rate scare. Plus, for all its fury, the past week of selling delivered a textbook three candle retracement. The profit-taking was mild compared to the previous ascent. DE was up seven days in a row preceding the drop, so it arguably needed to cool. 9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain Thursday saw a test of the rising 20-day moving average the ultimately succeeded. Buyers swooped in to maintain the integrity of the short-term trend. If you’re looking for dips to shop, this one belongs at the top of your list. The Trade: Buy the June $340/$360 bull call for $8.50. You’re risking $8.50 to capture $11.50 potentially. Emerson (EMR) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Emerson Electric rounds out our trio of industrial stocks to buy. The market’s temper tantrum hasn’t affected the EMR chart one bit. In fact, while the S&P 500 was getting torched on Thursday, EMR was tagging a record high. The outperformance is again on full display this morning. While the broad market is sinking, EMR is up 1%. Whatever is spooking stocks at large is having zero impact on investor appetite for Emerson. And that’s a fact that demands attention for strength seekers. The typical volatility or past behavior of EMR’s price trend seems to lend itself to position trading over swing trading. The uptrend has been slow and steady. I like buying more time with a call spread to give the stock plenty of runway to continue ascending. The Trade: Buy the June $90/$95 bull call for $2. You’re risking $2 to capture $3 potentially.

2021-02-25	2021-02-25 07:25:43	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Ramps Up Quarterly Dividend By 18%	Deere hiked its quarterly common stock dividend by 18% to $0.90 per share. Shares of the manufacturing company spiked almost 2.5% to close at $345.66 on Feb. 24. Deere (DE) announced that the new dividend will be paid on May 10, to shareholders of record as of March 31. The company’s annual dividend of $3.60 per share now reflects a dividend yield of 1.04%. Deere CEO John C. May said, “The dividend increase is a reflection of Deere’s recent strong performance and it shows our confidence in the company’s future direction.” Last week, Deere reported fiscal first-quarter results. The company’s 1Q earnings more than doubled to $3.87 per share on a year-over-year basis and beat the Street estimates of $2.14 per share. Revenues jumped 19% to $9.1 billion and surpassed the consensus estimate of $7.21 billion. For fiscal 2021, the company projects net income to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $5 billion. (See Deere stock analysis on TipRanks) On Feb. 23, Merrill Lynch analyst Ross Gilardi increased the stock’s price target to $395 (14.3% upside potential) from $330 and reiterated a Buy rating “to reflect the upside revision in outlook.” Gilardi anticipates “the market to continue looking forward to mid cycle earnings power after the breakout Ag & Turf performance in 2H’20 and expected meeting of mid cycle targets early.” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 14 analysts suggesting a Buy, 3 analysts recommending a Hold, and 1 analyst suggesting a Sell. The average analyst price target of $349.94 implies 1% upside potential to current levels. Shares have increased almost 33% over the past three months. Deere scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

2021-02-21	2021-02-21 07:00:31	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Pops 10% As 1Q Profit More Than Doubles	Deere’s shares surged 9.9% on Feb. 19 as the manufacturing company posted better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results. The company’s new operating strategy and a 23% rise in net sales drove the earnings beat. Deere’s (DE) 1Q earnings more than doubled to $3.87 per share on a year-over-year basis and beat the Street estimates of $2.14 per share. Revenues jumped 19% to $9.1 billion and surpassed the consensus estimate of $7.21 billion. The company’s net sales from equipment operations came in at $8.1 billion, up 23% year-over-year, driven by improving conditions in the farm and construction sectors. For fiscal 2021, the company projects net income to be in a range of $4.6 billion to $5 billion. (See Deere stock analysis on TipRanks) Deere CEO John C. May commented, “As our recent performance shows, these steps are leading to improved efficiencies and helping the company target its resources and investments on areas that have the greatest impact.” Following the 4Q results, Oppenheimer analyst Kristen Owen reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $331 on the stock. “The company saw improved volumes across the portfolio, with favorable mix and strong price realization driving margin expansion in each segment,” Owen commented in a note to investors. “With the separation of its Ag & Turf portfolio into two distinct segments,” the analyst expects “greater visibility into precision ag uptake and DE’s ability to price for higher tech content, as well as providing a potential roadmap for migration into the Construction portfolio.” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 12 analysts suggesting a Buy, 3 analysts recommending a Hold, and 1 analyst suggesting a Sell. The average analyst price target of $319.93 implies 3% downside potential to current levels. Shares have increased 28.6% over the past three months. Deere scores a 9 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

2021-02-19	2021-02-19 22:27:50	DE	Deere & Company	4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: BA, DE, Litecoin, RCL	It was an up-and-down session that’s now mostly flat for the S&P 500. Now, let’s look at a few top stock trades for next week, after this holiday-shortened stretch. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Boeing (BA) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Four weeks ago, Boeing (NYSE:BA) tested down into its 21-week moving average, then caught a sharp bounce off that level. Since then, we’ve had back-to-back tight-ranged weeks. On the plus side, earnings are out of the way and Boeing continues to hold over the 10-week moving average. Moving nicely on Friday, bulls will be looking for Boeing to give us a two-times weekly-up rotation by clearing the highs from the prior two weeks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips If it can do that, as well as hurdle the 50% retracement, the $234 level could be in play, followed by the December high near $244. Above that puts the 61.8% retracement on the table near $250. 7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of On the downside, a break of the 10-week moving average puts the 21-week moving average on deck, followed by the $188 to $190 area. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Deere (DE) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Man, what else can we say about Deere (NYSE:DE) at this point? The stock looks like a high-flying tech holding more than an industrial/agriculture company. That said, it does have some tech components to the business model. Regardless, this stock has been moving straight up for months now. Each dip to the 10-week moving average — including this week — has been bought aggressively by the bulls. The institutional support is robust with this one, which would have me crossing it off my “short list” in a hurry. Now at the three-times range extension and new record highs though, and I’m in no hurry to chase this one either. Above $335, and a run to $350 is possible, then $380. A break of the 10-week moving average will eventually happen, putting the 21-week moving average in play. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Litecoin (LTC-USD) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Tuesday was Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD). Wednesday was Bitcoin Cash (CCC:BCH-USD). Thursday was Etherium (CCC:ETH-USD). Now let’s look at Litecoin (CCC:LTC-USD) as we wrap up the crypto week and as bitcoin hits a $1 trillion market capitalization today. Litecoin had a pretty rough correction from its 2019 high at $146.95 down to its 2020 low at $24.85. However, it’s been on fire over the last few months. Shares ripped up through the prior 2019 high, then consolidated its gains by finding support at the 10-week moving average. Once that consolidation ended though, it was off to the races again. Now pushing through the 161.8% extension, let’s see if Litecoin can push up to $250, then $269.50, as the two-times range extension comes into play near the latter. 7 Stocks Riding the Crypto Craze On the downside, I would love to see the 161.8% extension act as support, as well as $200. Below puts this week’s low in play near $186.50. Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Royal Caribbean (RCL) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Last but not least is Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL). Up almost 17% this week, shares are rallying into earnings scheduled for Monday. This one has been on fire, reclaiming its 10-day, 21-day, 50-day and 100-day moving averages amid the four-day rally. It doesn’t look like much after such a wide trading range over the last year, but it’s a nice run. Ahead of earnings does make it a little tricky, though. Over the 50% retracement and its short-term moving averages puts the bulls in control for the moment. On a bullish earnings reaction, let’s see if shares can clear the recent high near $85. Above puts the 61.8% retracement in play, then the $100 mark. On a bearish reaction, see if RCL stock holds the 100-day moving average — the lowest of the four listed above. Below uptrend support (blue line) and the 38.2% retracement and 200-day moving average are in play.

2021-02-19	2021-02-19 17:55:44	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Surges With Cashed-Up Farmers Signaling Best Year Ever	(Bloomberg) -- Deere & Co. lifted its earnings guidance above analyst estimates, with elevated crop prices and an improving farm economy signaling a record windfall for the biggest maker of agricultural machinery. Shares surged to an all-time high.After a trade war and pandemic disruptions, Deere is betting that American farmers are finally ready to overhaul aging fleets as grain prices reach multiyear highs and agricultural profits soar amid a flood of government aid. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago economist David Oppedahl called the agricultural outlook “the rosiest in years” based on a survey of bankers.The company is in “early days in terms of seeing some of this demand pick-up,” executives said on a conference call with analysts and investors. Orders into the fourth quarter are “a good indicator of the replacement demand that we’ve been expecting.”Net income for fiscal 2021 is forecast at $4.6 billion to $5 billion, the Moline, Illinois-based producer said in a statement Friday. That compares with the $3.6 billion to $4 billion that Deere forecast in November, and the $4.06 billion average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.For the fiscal year ended in November, net income was $2.75 billion.The manufacturer has set a high bar for performance going into 2021, with its shares jumping 55% last year, the most since 2007. Improving farm fundamentals and sentiment will help drive double-digit revenue growth at Deere in 2021, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, which also cautioned that supply-chain disruptions and rising costs remain risks.“Our results were aided by outstanding performance across our business lineup and improving conditions in the farm and construction sectors,” Chief Executive Officer John May said in the statement.Competitor AGCO Corp. earlier this month forecast 2021 adjusted earnings per share that beat the average analyst estimate, with the company saying it sees North American margins increasing for the year.Deere shares rose as much as 12% to a record $335.21. The stock was up 10% at 12:44 p.m. in New York.(Updates with company comment in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-surges-cashed-farmers-signaling-145719699.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-02-19	2021-02-19 16:45:42	DE	Deere & Company	Encouraging Deere Outlook Adds To Economic Optimism Amid Vaccine, Stimulus Hopes	A day after a lackluster session, stocks seem poised to bounce back as investors continue to be optimistic about a stimulus package from Washington and positive economic impact from the vaccine rollout. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen added fuel to the stimulus hopes after yesterday’s closing bell when she told CNBC that a large relief package is necessary for the economic recovery. On the vaccine front, a study of Israeli healthcare workers has shown that the Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE)-BioNTech (NASDAQ: BNTX) shot is 85% effective after just one dose. In another encouraging sign for the economy, farm and construction equipment maker Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) handily beat earnings estimates as revenue also came in ahead of expectations. Perhaps more importantly, the economic bellwether company lifted its full-year earnings guidance. And like those old ads saying nothing runs like one, shares of DE are up more than 5% ahead of the bell. With things generally looking brighter, Treasury yields are making their way higher, with the 10-year yield above 1.3% and the 30-year yield near 2.1%. In addition to investors selling government debt because they feel less of a need for the safe-haven investments at the moment, Treasury yields have been rising because of concerns over potentially higher inflation. Higher yields can dim the attractiveness of tech and other growth stocks, and the threat of inflation also can make investors worried about potentially tighter monetary policy. Plus, mortgage rates—which track closely with Treasurys—have been trending higher. Freddie Mac reported yesterday that the average rate on a 30-yr fixed mortgage rose eight basis points over the past week. Still, interest rates are low by historical standards. And the Fed has said it has no plans to stop its $120 billion a month bond purchase program anytime soon while forecasting the next rate rise in terms of years, not months. Headwinds Sap Enthusiasm Yesterday, investor optimism took a hit from retailing giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT). Although revenue surpassed expectations, the company’s earnings came up short as WMT’s decision to repay property tax relief in the U.K. cost it 7 cents a share on the bottom line. Perhaps the most disappointing thing for investors came from its outlook, with the company seeing a relatively tepid earnings picture for the 2022 fiscal year. Because WMT is such a heavyweight in retailing, especially for lower-income shoppers, that outlook may not bode too well for the trajectory of the economic recovery for some of those hit the hardest. The labor market also held some disappointing news yesterday as new unemployment claims rose to 861,000 in the latest week. That was way above a Wall Street consensus for 775,000, and up from an upwardly revised 848,000 the prior week. While the jobless news isn’t good for the economy, it can also be interpreted as heightening the pressure on Washington to get a new stimulus package hammered out, which would likely be a bullish scenario for the economy and market. Adding to the nuanced picture, housing data on Thursday were mixed, with housing starts coming in below expectations but building permits exceeding forecasts. Economic, Earnings Reports On Tap Next week’s economic calendar is pretty full. On Monday, investors are scheduled to get the latest leading indicators report from the Conference Board. Tuesday brings consumer confidence data, and new home sale numbers are on tap for Wednesday. In addition to the weekly jobless claims number, Thursday holds reports on durable goods, pending home sales, and gross domestic profit. Friday’s calendar holds more inflation data, including the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. As for this earnings season, there are still plenty of companies that haven’t reported yet. Next week’s slate includes reports from Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE: RCL), Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE: NCLH), Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD), Toll Brothers Inc (NYSE: TOL), Lowe’s Companies Inc (NYSE: LOW), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA). Taking that last one first, it could be interesting if MRNA sheds any additional light into how its vaccine rollout is going, a process that is linked to the economic recovery Wall Street Seems to have been pricing in. The cruise line companies might be able to provide more clarity on the reopening trade, while NVIDIA’s fortunes might offer a glimpse into the global chip shortage. Meanwhile, HD, TOL, and LOW could add additional color to what’s going on in the housing market, especially interesting in light of what interest rates are doing. CHART OF THE DAY: COPPER TOP? Copper futures have hit their highest point since 2011 and are near the psychologically important level of $4 per pound. The red metal is often seen as a leading indicator of economic prospects as the commodity is widely used for applications like pipes in houses and wiring in automobiles and appliances. It appears the metal is being supported by demand in China and expectations of tight supply as the global economy gets back on its feet. There may also be bullishness because of the push for a domestic infrastructure revamp and greener economy. Of course, with such a strong run up it’s also possible that speculative traders have been piling in, not wanting to miss out on the upward momentum. Data source: CME Group.

Green Progress: There’s no doubt that the coronavirus pandemic has been a global tragedy in terms of lives and jobs lost, but there has been at least one major silver lining. The decline in travel and decreased demand for electricity as governments have sought to curb the spread of the disease have led to a decrease in harmful emissions. A new report from BloombergNEF and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy says energy demand in the United States for electricity and transportation fell by 3.8% and 14.4%, respectively, helping reduce the nation’s year-on-year harmful greenhouse gas emissions by 9%. “This fall in emissions is the most significant on record and puts the United States on track to meet its 2025 Paris Agreement commitment, though energy demand and emissions are expected to rebound with widespread vaccinations in 2021,” the groups said. At the same time that domestic greenhouse gas emissions were receding, natural gas and renewable generation kept expanding their share of the resource mix, with a record 33.6 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity added to the grid in 2020. Green Pressure: With clean energy on the rise but climate change still a threat, there’s increasing pressure for companies to be green. “Given how central the energy transition will be to every company’s growth prospects, we are asking companies to disclose a plan for how their business model will be compatible with a net zero economy,” Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK), said in his annual letter to CEOs. A net zero economy would emit no more carbon dioxide that it removes from the atmosphere, and Fink noted that companies that aren’t quickly preparing themselves for the transition to such an economy “will see their businesses and valuations suffer.” Green Profits: The latest update on the Carbon Clean 200 from As You Sow and Corporate Knights shows that the group of publicly traded companies ranked by green energy revenues has outperformed carbon-heavy indices. And that’s not just for 2020 when energy companies tanked because of the pandemic. From July 2016 through the end of last year, the Clean200 companies generated a total return of more than 113% compared to the broad global MSCI ACWI Index’s jump of more than 78% and handily outperforming the MSCI ACWI Energy Index’s decline of more than 13%. “While we’re not promising any home runs, we are happy to report that the Clean200 now has more than a four-year track record of outperforming its high-carbon global counterparts,” the report said.

2021-02-18	2021-02-18 15:05:05	DE	Deere & Company	Preview: Deere's Earnings	"On Friday, February 19, Deere (NYSE:DE) will release its latest earnings report. Check out Benzinga's preview to understand the implications. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Sell-side analysts expect Deere's EPS to be near $2.12 on sales of $7.21 billion. Deere EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $1.63. Sales were $6.53 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin. View more earnings on DE If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Friday, EPS would be up 30.06%. Sales would be have grown 10.41% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q4 2020 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 EPS Estimate 1.49 1.26 1.80 1.26 EPS Actual 2.39 2.57 2.11 1.63 Revenue Estimate 7.68 B 6.70 B 7.76 B 6.42 B Revenue Actual 8.66 B 8.93 B 9.25 B 6.53 B Stock Performance Shares of Deere were trading at $311.97 as of February 17. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 74.58%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders should be satisfied going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Deere is scheduled to hold the call at 10:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.

2021-01-29	2021-01-29 14:36:29	DE	Deere & Company	The InvestorPlace Q&A: Embrace the Food Revolution With the ANEW ETF	This is part of a four-part series exploring the four facets of the ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (NYSEARCA:ANEW) ETF: The Future of Work, Genomics and Telehealth, the Digital Consumer and the Food Revolution. Click on other themes where linked to read other installments. Food is one of the most basic, and most vital, things in the world. We all need it, and as concerns about both the health of our planet and the health of what we eat rise, so does worldwide focus on the companies creating our meals. The ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (NYSEARCA:ANEW) is an exchange-traded fund with holdings that focus on the food revolution alongside three other future-looking themes detailed above. As shared in ProShares information on the fund:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips “According to a 2019 report by AgFunds, global investment in agriculture-related technology reached $16.9 billion in 2018, up 43% from 2017. Revenue from food innovations is also projected to grow from $135 billion in 2018 to $700 billion by 2030, a 15% compound annual growth rate. Leading the way, a 2019 UBS report forecast the plant-based protein segment to grow 28% annually over this period.” Plant-based protein is a topic of conversation not just in investing circles, but in social ones as well. Part of the appeal is the sustainability of such foods — it takes more resources to create a pound of beef than a pound of most plant-based foods. 7 of the Best Dividend Aristocrats on the Market But the nature and method of creation for our food is not the only area ANEW looks at. There’s also the future of how that food gets to the consumer. Grocery delivery has gotten a boost from stay-at-home orders in 2020, but the space is expected to grow regardless. The fund charges an 0.45% expense ratio, or $45 per $10,000 invested annually. I had a chance to discuss the ANEW ETF with Scott Helfstein, Executive Director of Thematic Investing for ProShares, and talk about how ANEW is helping you invest in these changing food trends. InvestorPlace: As investors become more socially conscious, sustainable and responsible farming is getting more and more in the forefront. What companies are helping farmers make the transition? How did the trade war with China impact this sector? Scott Helfstein, executive director of Thematic Investing for ProShares: There are a number of fascinating innovations taking hold in the food industry, which is not an area people generally associate with high tech, but in which we desperately need greater efficiency. Currently, 51% of the habitable land on the planet is dedicated to food production and we will have 2 billion more people to feed by 2050, according to UN projections. Sustainable practices like using smaller autonomous tractors that put less burden on the land, artificial intelligence algorithms to minimize water use and maximize yield, or drones that identify crop regions being impacted by blight to target pesticide use are becoming more commonplace. Deere (NYSE:DE) is one of the companies that likely helps drive automation and efficiency. The trade war with China hit the U.S. farm and food production sector as exports of soybeans dried up. Then Covid-19 impacted the meat packing supply chain. These events are a double-edged sword. Many producers might not have the capital to invest following these exogenous events, but it is also more important to manage costs and produce efficiently. InvestorPlace: Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) has been the face of the plant-based meat movement, but they are far from the only player. What are some of the other interesting names in the space that readers should know? ProShares: Beyond Meat is certainly the standout, especially with many competing plant-based products coming from large and diversified food companies and conglomerates. In 2019, only 14% of Americans had tried plant-based meat substitutes, but 42% had plant-based milk products in the fridge. That suggests we are still early in adoption and there will ultimately be a number of players competing. Food-science and ingredient innovations are essential but less-spoken-of components in the growth of the plant-based meat industry. Products have to taste good with flavor and fragrance as important elements. Established food-science company Kerry Group (OTCMKTS:KRYAY), for example, provides a portfolio of taste, scent, and texture solutions developed for use in plant-based meat products. InvestorPlace: As the ProShares’ data on the ANEW ETF says, “According to a 2019 report by AgFunds, global investment in agriculture-related technology reached $16.9 billion in 2018, up 43% from 2017.” What companies are at the forefront, innovating technology and processes to help feed the world? ProShares: There is investment and innovation going on across the industry from automation to genetically engineered products. McCormick (NYSE:MCK), known for flavoring and spices, partnered with IBM (NYSE:IBM)last year to use Watson and artificial intelligence in flavor development. We do not normally think about AI in the food industry, but advanced analysis will play an increasingly important role. Corteva (NYSE:CTVA), which was spun off from DuPont (NYSE:DD), is the largest seed company in the world. The product portfolio includes genetically modified seeds and advanced chemical compounds, but they also support clients with data analysis services. InvestorPlace: The rise of food delivery didn’t start in 2020, but the Covid-19 shutdowns and stay-at-home orders certainly accelerated it. How much of this change will remain once the pandemic is in the rearview mirror? ProShares: As restaurants slowly reopen in coming months following the vaccine rollout, we would expect demand for food delivery to decline, but we also believe that the pandemic has changed the way many people get food. For example, online purchasing of food and beverage increased 221% in the second quarter of 2020 and 162% in the third quarter. Most Americans had not ordered food online before the pandemic, but the majority indicate they are satisfied. Food delivery will be an important segment in the growing experience-on-demand trend. The rise of so-called “ghost kitchens,” massive food preparation facilities with no actual restaurants are likely here to stay as companies invest in building this capability. Companies will not be keen on shutting those facilities after making large investments and realizing tremendous efficiencies. Some traditional fast food companies have invested significantly to build delivery and takeout capabilities in recent years. InvestorPlace: One problem in the agriculture world that many people never even think about is zoonotic diseases, or diseases that can pass from animals to people. What are some of the ways companies in this fund are helping reduce or prevent transmission of such diseases? ProShares: As a front-of-mind standout, Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) is developing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine which just began phase 3 trials in the US. Some early signs from testing in primates shows that the treatment may keep people from passing the virus to others. Novavax also has an Ebola vaccine in phase 1 trials and both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV vaccines in pre-clinical development. Further away from the headlines, consider Neogen (NASDAQ:NEOG), which produces a comprehensive array of technology products and services to promote food safety, including zoonotic disease prevention, across food supply chains. For example, NEOGEN has a suite of diagnostic products for diseases such as Swine Influenza Virus. InvestorPlace: What are some of the other interesting companies in ANEW that particularly service this Food Revolution aspect of the fund, and why should investors be excited about them? ProShares: Customer preferences are changing with an increasing emphasis on healthy snacks and organic foods. Hain Celestial (NASDAQ:HAIN) is one example of an innovator in the healthy snack space. While known for tea, that only represents 5% of revenue. So, this a food company, but also a life-style play. Scott’s Miracle Gro (NYSE:SMG) is another interesting name as people are increasingly growing food at home and there are few scale players in the retail garden market. The U.S. Census Bureau recorded 8.6% growth in nursery and gardening sales in June 2020 during COVID-19 compared to another home category like furniture that was down 35.7%. Whether eating healthy, growing food at home, adding plant-protein, customer behavior and consumption patterns are changing. ANEW’s focus on food revolution is intended to keep investors at the forefront of these changes.

Against Dollar Bounce	"On CNBC's ""Options Action,"" Carter Worth compared the move in the U.S. dollar with moves in the commodity sector and in Deere & Company (NYSE: DE). The U.S. dollar is in a free fall, while commodities and Deere are trading sharply higher, he said. The U.S. dollar has dropped to levels last seen in 2017-2018, and Worth expects it to bounce off the lows and move back to the trend line, which is 3% to 4% above the current price level. Worth believes a potential move higher in the U.S. dollar would hurt commodities and Deere, and he wants to sell the stock and commodities.Mike Khouw suggested a bearish options trade in Deere. He wants to buy the March $290 put for $15 and sell the February $280 put for $7.75. The trade would cost him $7.25 which would set the break-even at $282.75, or about 3.8% below the current stock price.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Cramer Weighs In On Deere & Company, Alibaba And More In Latest 'Lightning Round'(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

2021-01-08	2021-01-08 16:31:17	DE	Deere & Company	Facebook, Twitter, Google Face Calls to Ban Trump Accounts	(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are facing mounting pressure from lawmakers, activists and civil rights groups to enact tougher policies and more forcefully purge misleading content and accounts -- including the ones held by President Donald Trump -- after a mob of pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol.Coinciding with the imminent shift of power in Washington to the Democrats, social networks have taken their most aggressive steps yet to muzzle Trump over the last two days. But civil rights groups and lawmakers say the internet companies allowed misleading content to proliferate for too long, resulting in dangerous -- and deadly -- consequences.“Despite repeated red flags and demands for fixes, these companies failed to act until well after blood and glass lay in the halls of the Capitol,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said in an interview. “Yesterday’s events will renew and focus the need for Congress to reform Big Tech’s privileges and obligations.”Some lawmakers are considering offering measures that would require more transparency about political ads on the internet, such as who paid for them. Civil rights and other advocates say they hope public outrage over the insurrection will spur internet companies to bolster their voluntary efforts to tamp down online propaganda.“We’re going to be talking about how to regulate and rein these companies in,” said Jessica González, co-chief executive officer of Free Press, which pushes for media accountability. “But gosh, it shouldn’t be this hard to do the right thing.”Earlier: Trump Loses Social Media Megaphone as Facebook, Twitch ActA large group of Trump supporters, with the president’s encouragement, stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, delaying the certification of Joe Biden’s election, which Trump has repeatedly and without basis called fraudulent. Trump had used Twitter, Facebook and Google’s YouTube to urge supporters to strike out, and for hours said nothing as the mob grew violent. Once he urged the crowd to be peaceful, he repeated his claim that the election had been stolen from him.Facebook said Thursday it was extending a 24-hour ban on Trump’s posts for at least two weeks until Biden takes office. Twitter suspended Trump’s account for 12 hours on the condition that he remove three tweets, including a Wednesday video in which Trump expressed his love for the insurgents and called the election fraudulent. A spokesperson confirmed that Trump had deleted the offending tweets, giving him access to his account. But Twitter warned that Trump could receive a permanent suspension if he continued to break its rules.Earlier: Trump Concedes Biden Will Take Office, Condemns Capitol AttackIn his first tweet since gaining access to his account, Trump on Thursday evening posted a video in which he condemned the riot by his supporters at the U.S. Capitol and said he would prepare for a smooth presidential transition.YouTube also removed Trump’s Wednesday video. The company said he will accumulate “strikes” against his account for continued violations, which could block him from uploading content in the future. Twitch, the live-streaming service owned by Amazon.com Inc., disabled Trump’s account indefinitely while Snap Inc. banned the president from posting on its Snapchat app until further notice.The bans, while unprecedented, were too little and too late for some. “Facebook has finally taken the long-overdue step of blocking the President’s account -- at least for the next 13 days -- but I’m deeply frustrated that it took a group of domestic terrorists storming the Capitol before they were willing to do so,” House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said in a statement on Thursday. “I also can’t help but wonder if the decision was an opportunistic one, motivated by the news of a Democratically controlled Congress.”Thompson and civil rights advocates are calling on the social media companies to remove the president’s accounts altogether.Trump, through a spokesman, decried the bans. “It is indisputable that nobody has been more successful at using digital media than President Trump to communicate directly with the American people,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. “But it’s incredibly ironic, yet not surprising, that when the President spoke to the country at a critical time Big Tech chose to censor and block him from doing so. Big Tech is out of control.”A Facebook spokesperson pointed to the company’s statements condemning the violence from Wednesday, and added that the company has worked with civil rights groups to refine and tighten its content policies.A YouTube spokesperson said that, over the last month, the platform has removed thousands of videos that spread misinformation claiming voter fraud in the 2020 election, including several videos that Trump posted Wednesday to his channel.A Twitter spokesperson said the company continues to evaluate the situation, “including examining activity on the ground and statements made off Twitter. Our global public interest policy — which has guided our enforcement action in this area for years — ends where we believe the risk of harm is higher and/or more severe.”Facebook and Twitter have rules that ban certain content, such as threats of violence, hate speech and false information on voting procedures. For Trump and other world leaders, Twitter has allowed more leeway because of the heightened news value of communications from top government officials, though it places violating posts behind a warning screen.But the companies have struggled to police Trump’s incendiary posts ever since the 2016 presidential campaign. Both have preferred to leave up as many posts as possible to avoid having to decide what’s problematic. Twitter, for example, designed a special warning label to cover offending tweets without removing them entirely.The companies, particularly Facebook, faced criticism that they were bending their policies to benefit Trump and other Republicans while letting election misinformation go unchecked. In July, civil liberties advocate Laura Murphy, who was hired by Facebook to review discrimination on the platform, in a report lambasted the company for failing to apply its voter suppression rules to Trump’s inaccurate posts about mail-in ballots.That same month, leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Anti-Defamation League and Color of Change, a racial justice advocacy group, organized an advertiser boycott of Facebook over the proliferation of hate speech on the platform.Civil rights leaders have continued to press Facebook to eliminate misleading posts about the election, arguing they erode the public’s confidence in the electoral process. Last fall, Rashad Robinson, the Color of Change president, asked Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to take action against a post by Donald Trump Jr., the president’s elder son, that encouraged supporters to “enlist” in an “army for Trump” to protect the election. Robinson said he cited the history of voter intimidation efforts at the polls but was told the post didn’t violate Facebook’s policies.In September, Change the Terms, which includes dozens of civil rights, human rights and consumer protection groups, called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to ban event pages that promote bringing weapons to events. The organization wrote to Zuckerberg after a militia group used the platform to encourage citizens to take weapons to Kenosha, Wisconsin, amid protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake. The page was eventually taken down.Several legislative efforts could see traction, including Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar’s Honest Ads Act, which would require more disclosure of who is paying for political ads. “I will continue my push to stop election interference and the spread of disinformation online, including by working to advance the Honest Ads Act,” Klobuchar said in a statement. The Minnesota lawmaker first offered the measure after Russia’s effort to meddle in the 2016 election through ads and phony posts.Democratic Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island has also proposed limiting the ability of Facebook and others to micro-target users using demographic criteria such as religion or race. A spokesman said Thursday the effort would likely come back, and could be strengthened.Cicilline, who chairs a House subcommittee on antitrust, is pushing forward with legislation aimed at curbing the power of large tech companies, including Facebook. It could become the vehicle for lawmakers wishing to stop social media content that misinforms or incites violence.Lawmakers in both chambers have explored ways to increase the companies’ liability for the content that users post by limiting a controversial legal protection under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Biden has advocated removing the safe harbor entirely.(Adds Klobuchar statement in fourth to last paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-twitter-google-face-calls-163117984.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-25	2020-11-25 20:12:55	DE	Deere & Company	4 Top Stock Trades for Friday: NKLA, DE, NIO, CRSR	"It was a quiet session on Wednesday, the last full day of trading this week. Remember, the stock market is closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving and only open for a partial session on Friday. Let’s look at a few top stock trades moving today. 
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Nikola (NKLA)
Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com
Investors already know Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) is a volatile holding, but it has really been proving it over the past few sessions. 
Shares were up for eight straight sessions coming into Wednesday. While up nicely from the session lows, Nikola is still down over 10% at the time of this writing. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
From here, the road map is rather clear. We need to see shares hold $30, a notable level in its public trading thus far, as well as the 200-day moving average. Below those levels could put $25 in play, followed by the 50-day moving average.


					7 of the Best Cheap Stocks for December				

On the upside, bulls need to see NKLA take out the 20-day moving average. That’s followed by this week’s high at $37.95 and the $40 mark. 

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Deere (DE)
Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com
Deere (NYSE:DE) is dipping ever so slightly on earnings, down about 2% on the day. 
Shares are now struggling to hold the 10-day moving average and the two-times range extension. 
If the stock holds this area, look for Deere to retest the $266 area, which is near the all-time high and is current resistance. Above it could kickstart a move up toward the $300 mark, with the 261.8% extension coming into play at $301.46.
If support fails to hold, it could open up a retest of former resistance near $240 and the 50-day moving average. Thus far, the latter has been a very solid support mark. 
Deere has been a trustworthy long, but the divergence in the RSI (as it makes lower highs while the stock makes higher highs) is something to note. It doesn’t ruin the bullish setup necessarily, but again, it’s just something to keep an eye on for the shorter-term traders. 

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Nio (NIO)
Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com
Nio (NYSE:NIO) has been one of the most robust names in the market this year as it relentlessly grinds higher. 
As has been the case for a few months now, the stock continues to hold the 10-day moving average. However, bulls have to be feeling a little giddy here, which could create volatility. 
I like this name so long as it’s above the 10-day and last week’s high near $50.60. 
Falling below these marks could put the 20-day moving average in play. Ultimately, I would love to someday see a test of the $38 area, which should be support as long as Nio remains in good shape.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Corsair Gaming (CRSR)
Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com
Speaking of strength, have you seen Corsair Gaming (NASDAQ:CRSR)? Holy moly, this one has been on a run. 
Perhaps the stock just blew off its top or maybe it makes new highs on Black Friday. It’s hard to know anymore with some of these stocks. 
All I have to say is, be careful with it. Dip buyers will likely jump at the opportunity to buy CRSR on a test of the 10-day moving average. This mark hasn’t been tested in 11 sessions, so it’s bound to act like a magnet here. 
Initially, that could be good for a bounce. If the stock knifes right through the 10-day though, CRSR may need some more time to reset. On the upside, reclaiming $46 could put $50-plus back on the table. 
All in all, take care with CRSR. It’s a wild mover. And for that matter, take care with all your trading endeavors. Happy Holidays and good luck on your Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping.

During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.Ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, the earnings calendar was light. One major issue, John Deere & Co. (NYSE: DE), did announce earnings and is the PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day.Flirting With All-Time High: Just over two weeks ago, on what turned out to be one of three huge ""Monday vaccine rallies,"" Deere made a new all-time high at $265.87 but retreated to end the session at $248.67.Over the next four sessions, it put in a series of lows ranging from $245.96 to $249.49 and embarked on a pre-earnings rally. On Tuesday, it came up shy of its all-time high but did post a new all-time closing high at $261.51.Before today's open, the company announced a huge third-quarter EPS beat of 90 cents and a sales beat just shy of $1 billion. The company attributed the impressive numbers to the major improvement in equipment demand in the quarter. Deere forecasts 2021 net income in the $3.6-$4 billion range.View more earnings on DENothing But Buyers, Then Sellers: As expected in this market environment, buyers swarmed the issue by taking it all the way to $270 just after 9 a.m. ET. However, it wasn't able to hold that elevated and only managed to open at $263.01 before mounting another rally.Double Top: As the true liquidity came into the issue, the rally was abruptly halted at its exact all-time high ($265.87) and sharply reversed course. As of 1:45 p.m. ET, the issue has given back all of those gains and is now deep in the red by $5.50 at $256.01.Can't Say We Didn't Warn You: When the issue was being discussed on the show, it was trading at just under $270. Co-host Dennis Dick noted its peer Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) wasn't making a sympathy move: ""In fact, it justs looks like it's sitting here collecting dust.""The author of this article was skeptical the issue would be able to sustain all of the premarket gains. As always, the emphasis was put on taking out the premarket high and continuing higher early in the session.The full discussion on the issue from today's show can be found here:See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: FuelCell Energy  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Pivotal Investment(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-25	2020-11-25 15:34:16	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Tractors Offer a Smooth Post-Covid Ride	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Investors looking to ride the industrial recovery could do a lot worse than a Deere tractor. The maker of the iconic green-and-yellow plows and diggers reported fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, continuing a tradition of pre-Thanksgiving numbers. Even after a banner summer quarter and a significant jump in analysts’ earnings estimates, Deere & Co. still managed to outperform in the three-month period ended Nov. 1. Not only that: Deere is targeting as much as $4 billion in net income in 2021, a record. For context, that’s in line with analysts’ estimates for 2022 — meaning Deere is a full year ahead of schedule. Deere’s earnings report fits in with the broader narrative of an industrial recovery that’s continuing apace despite a resurgence in coronavirus cases across the world. Separately on Wednesday, data from the Commerce Department showed that U.S. durable goods orders increased at a faster-than-expected rate in October. Core bookings (which exclude defense and aircraft purchases), also surpassed economists’ estimates. That positive momentum — coupled with the recent good news on the vaccine front — has fueled a sharp rally in industrial-related stocks in recent months. Indeed, going into earnings day, Deere shares were up more than 50% for the best year-to-date showing since 2007. But while valuations are getting ahead of themselves in some corners of the industrial world and downright stretched in others, a deeper look at Deere’s latest earnings suggests the stock’s rally has further to go. Demand is part of it. Whereas many parts of the economy were running hot before the pandemic, the agricultural sector had been mired in a multiyear slump, in part because of the U.S.-China trade war. Farmers are working with the oldest tractor fleet in more than a decade, leaving ample room for a recovery as rising crop prices and improving visibility in export markets at last give them the confidence to start spending again. Through the end of September, China’s agricultural spending was tracking well below the country’s purchasing commitments in the phase one trade deal inked pre-pandemic, says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Christopher Ciolino. Lately, though, the country has been stepping up its purchases to help feed a hog population that’s recovering from the African swine fever. President-elect Joe Biden’s administration is expected to de-escalate tensions with China, which may help support demand. Deere expects a 10% to 15% sales gain for its agricultural segment in fiscal 2021.But farmers aren’t just buying any old tractor; they’re paying up for them, too. Operating profit in the agricultural segment was up an impressive 63% relative to an 8% sales gain in the fourth quarter. The biggest factor was higher prices. Deere has stopped trying to sell tractors to everyone in the world and is instead focused on highly differentiated products that can help large farmers improve productivity, Melius Research analyst Rob Wertheimer said this week in a video presentation.While much of the initial margin improvement opportunities have now been priced in to the stock, Deere is aiming to further press its advantage by investing in software and data-management tools that can drive higher crop yields and increase precision, he said. The idea is to build an ecosystem that makes Deere indispensable to farmers, not just in the physical harvesting and planting operations but the planning of those processes as well.The most promising of its technology offerings — the Blue River artificial intelligence platform, which can distinguish between weeds and crops and spray herbicides accordingly — is expected to become commercially available in 2021. Deere said on Wednesday that it was targeting an operating margin of 15.5% to 16.5% for its agricultural segment next year. That compares with 13.3% in 2020 and 10.6% in 2019. That kind of profit lift doesn’t come around every day. It’s been a difficult year in so many ways, but Deere investors at least have plenty to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-11-25	2020-11-25 15:20:54	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Earnings Greeted With Cheer As Company Cites Improved Equipment Demand	"The elevator ride takes a pause this morning, but it's still been an impressive week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) now sits just below 30,000 in pre-market trading after topping it yesterday, and there's a chance this milestone moment could draw some new cash into the market, according to one school of thought.While 30,000 is just a number, as we noted here yesterday, it's an attention grabber. All those headlines probably got noticed by people who may not have been invested or who just hadn't cared enough before to put more money into the market. Now they may be wondering what they missed. The post-Thanksgiving period could be interesting in determining whether cash on the sidelines starts to roll in. Having said that, the market has come a long way very quickly, so caution could be the word of the day. Long-term investors should consider how they got here and not get carried away by all this optimism. There's possibly a reckoning up ahead when people realize there's a long way to go before the country recovers from the pandemic, and that an effective vaccine may be one thing but getting it produced and in the arms of those who need it is extremely complicated. The mood this morning seems a bit subdued ahead of the holiday, and profit-taking could creep in after the big rally and before people go home for their turkey tomorrow. If history is any guide, we shouldn't expect much direction from today and Friday's sessions, though things may get choppy due to low volume. Instead, it might be better to wait until everyone's back Monday for more clues about where things might go next. This morning did bring some earnings news, with Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) having a nice quarter and shares rising in pre-market trading despite DE just missing analysts' average revenue estimate. Critically, the company said demand for its heavy equipment is improving, which could be another sign of the world's economy continuing to recover. DE became one of a number of firms recently to issue solid 2021 guidance, and that seems to be more in focus than the revenue miss. There's also some data ahead of the holiday. Weekly initial jobless claims came in a day early and totaled 778,000, above average Wall Street estimates for the second straight week. This figure has remained stubbornly high, reinforcing ideas that the economy still has a long way to go. Meanwhile, seasonally adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 33.1% in Q3 was the same as last time, so no big deal there. The market's shown no reaction to these numbers ahead of the opening bell.This One Goes To 30,000 With so many headlines centered on 30,000 (see chart below), you might have missed some other key developments. First of all, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) clawed over 3600 again, a level it's had trouble holding in previous rallies. We'll see if it has more luck this time. Second, a closely watched economic barometer, copper, hit nearly three-year highs (see more below). Meanwhile, gold keeps sinking and threatens to slip below $1,800 an ounce for the first time since July. In addition, the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) of small-cap stocks set a new record high Tuesday. Often the RUT is thought of as an index that best reflects the domestic economy, since its smaller stocks tend to have less international exposure. The RUT has been on a roll lately, up 23% since the end of September. In comparison, the SPX is up just 7.5% over the same time frame. These things--along with a Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) now flirting with its post-pandemic lows --suggest a ""risk-on"" trade really taking hold after some fits and starts earlier this month.However, it's important not to get carried away, because a few economic signals aren't exactly lighting up the room and a tough winter may be ahead due to COVID-19. Also, some contrary indicators like investor sentiment hit high levels recently. Some market watchers say this can sometimes suggest weakness ahead. VIX popped back above 22 this morning and the bond market seems to be getting a slight bid. Crude, however, continues to soar and sits at post-pandemic highs above $45 a barrel. The question as we head into Wednesday's session--likely to feature light-volume pre-holiday trading--is whether these gains can hold. The pattern in recent weeks is that stocks roar out of the starting gate and then slowly tire as the weekend finish line approaches. You can't necessarily rule out profit-taking today and Friday (a holiday-shortened session), but there is a little less geopolitical worry compared with a few weeks ago. It's possible geopolitics played at least some role in making people nervous about holding long positions into the last two weekends.Whatever ultimately happens, volume is likely to be light the remainder of the week, meaning the action could get judged as less meaningful. Market Update won't publish tomorrow, but will return Friday morning. Cautious Data Vs. ""Vaccine Put""One cautionary note popped up Tuesday when headline consumer confidence for November failed to meet analysts' expectations at 96.1 (the consensus on Wall Street had been 96.5, according to research firm Briefing.com). The figure was also down from October's upwardly revised 101.4. More alarmingly, the Expectations figure fell pretty dramatically from October to below 90 for the first time since August. ""Attitudes about business conditions for the next six months have worsened,"" Briefing.com said. That's just one data point, but combined with some other ones recently it doesn't necessarily point to continued meteoric gains. There also appears to be what analysts call ""froth"" in the market, like Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares rolling up 6% gains Tuesday despite a lack of news. This isn't to rain on anyone's parade, only to say that long-term investors should consider avoiding the urge to get caught up in the FOMO, or ""fear of missing out"" kind of trading that can happen at times like these.Don't count out possible spillover strength from media reports this week that President-elect Biden could choose ex-Fed Chairman Janet Yellen for Treasury secretary. It's a good probability that Yellen's name helped the market gain traction Tuesday thanks to her reputation as a policy dove and someone who's hands-on about trying to help the economy (and by association, the markets). Certainty around the election and cabinet appears to have helped market confidence. The Fed already has already committed to long-term low rates, so having Yellen down the street from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sounded pretty good to many investors. Speaking of Powell, Fed minutes from their last meeting are due for release later today. So are the monthly Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices, an inflation gauge the Fed watches closely.CHART OF THE DAY: THE LONG ROAD TO DOW 30K. The venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI--candlestick) closed above 30,000 for the first time ever Tuesday. But it's not been a straight line. As this 20-year chart (with lines at each 10,000 mark) shows, after first eclipsing 10,000, it rose to over 14,000, then was cut in half during the 2009 financial crisis. Though it breezed through the 20s over the last three years, it stopped just short of 30,000 before the pandemic earlier this year. Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.Mega-Caps Take the Sidelines: If you're lucky, maybe you can remember that amazing feeling the first time you swam across a pool by yourself as a kid, with no mom, dad, or teacher helping you out. In a way, the entire market might be enjoying that feeling right now, because it's not just staying afloat but actually getting close to lapping all-time highs without much support from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) or the other ""mega-cap"" stocks. These six stocks--which also include both share classes of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)--continue to make up a hefty percentage of the S&P 500 Index (SPX) on a valuation basis, and still accounted for a big amount of the SPX'S 2020 total return through mid-November. In recent weeks, however, their influence has waned a bit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI), which includes MSFT and AAPL, surpassed 30,000 on Tuesday even though neither MSFT nor AAPL were among its top-10 daily gainers. AAPL has actually had a pretty tough week and is flat over the last month.In a sense, it feels like the market's training wheels are off, or it's making that first solo doggy-paddle across the pool. While AAPL and MSFT both rose Tuesday, it was companies like Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) leading the $DJI higher. It's just one day, but the trend lately has favored the more ""cyclical"" sectors that tend to do better in an improving economy. Energy, Financials, and Industrials easily outperformed Info Tech and Communication Services over the last month, and that feels like a positive trend.Separate Ways: Gold's having an interesting week on the charts that might reflect more investors embracing risk. It fell below a firm support line near $1,850 on the charts that had held pretty much since mid-summer, and finished just above $1,800. Maybe monitor this market to see if the trend can hold. Gold is now down double-digits from its August all-time high, putting it officially into correction territory. It's still up sharply year-to-date, however.A metal that tends to zig when gold zags is copper, and it's also worth watching for insight into the global economy. Copper, if you haven't noticed, has been on an absolute tear, corresponding in part with the rally in electric vehicle stocks (EVs use more copper than normal cars). Copper closed above $3.30 on Tuesday and is near levels last seen in December 2017.Giving Thanks: Despite the market's recent advance, there's still a lot of economic and illness-related stress across the country. Let's not forget this on Thanksgiving, and also let's remember to be thankful to so many people in the medical profession, first responders, food workers, teachers and everyone else who continue to face COVID-19 exposure through the very nature of their jobs. Not everyone has the choice to stay at home. We all hope a vaccine becomes available soon to protect these courageous employees.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

2020-11-25	2020-11-25 11:40:08	DE	Deere & Company	What Does Deere's Debt Look Like?	Over the past three months, shares of Deere (NYSE: DE) moved higher by 24.49%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Deere has.Deere's Debt According to the Deere's most recent balance sheet as reported on August 27, 2020, total debt is at $48.47 billion, with $39.40 billion in long-term debt and $9.07 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $8.19 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $40.28 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Deere's $77.26 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.63. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

The maker of John Deere and world's largest farm equipment producer forecast net income of $3.6 billion-$4.0 billion for fiscal 2021 as it expects to benefit from improving conditions in the farm economy and stabilization in the construction and forestry markets.

Total revenue fell 1.7% to $9.73 billion, but beat the FactSet consensus of $8.59 billion. Agriculture and turf sales increased 8% to $6.20 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $5.51 billion, and construction and forestry sales dropped 16% to $2.46 billion but was above expectations of $1.99 billion. Looking ahead, Deere expects conditions in the farm economy to improve and in the construction and forestry markets to stabilize, after challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Higher crop prices and improved fundamentals are leading to renewed optimism in the agricultural sector and improving demand for farm equipment,"" said Chief Executive John May.

2020-11-24	2020-11-24 15:07:26	DE	Deere & Company	Earnings Outlook for Deere	"Deere (NYSE: DE) announces its next round of earnings this Wednesday, November 25. Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Wednesday's Q4 earnings announcement.What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.Earnings And Revenue Sell-side analysts expect Deere's EPS to be near $1.37 on sales of $7.65 billion. Deere reported a profit of $2.14 per share when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $8.70 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin.View more earnings on DEThe analyst consensus estimate would represent a 35.98% decrease in the company's earnings. Sales would be down 12.1% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has compared to analyst estimates in the past:Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2019  EPS Estimate 1.26 1.80 1.26 2.14  EPS Actual 2.57 2.11 1.63 2.14  Revenue Estimate 6.70 B 7.76 B 6.42 B 8.44 B  Revenue Actual 8.93 B 9.25 B 6.53 B 8.70 B  Stock Performance Shares of Deere were trading at $261.12 as of November 23. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 55.17%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably content going into this earnings release.Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call.

2020-11-17	2020-11-17 15:26:06	DE	Deere & Company	Analyzing Deere's Unusual Options Activity	"On Tuesday, shares of Deere (NYSE: DE) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $254.86.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-11-20  * Strike Price: $260.00  * Volume: 665  * Open Interest: 2815Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-28	2020-10-28 00:56:33	DE	Deere & Company	Trump Considers Fracking Order as He Woos Ohio: Campaign Update	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump is considering an executive order on fracking as he criticizes Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s stance on energy policy. Texas’ high court ruled that counties would each have just one drop box for voters who want to hand-deliver mail ballots. And Biden is maintaining a 6-point lead in Nevada, a state Biden is seeking to flip. There are seven days until Election Day and 48 days until the Electoral College meets.Other Developments:Trump Pins Hopes on Rallies That Could Be Sealing His DefeatBlue Wave May Curtail Muni Tax Break, Breckinridge Advisors SaysStimulus Hopes Put On Hold Until After Election as Senate LeavesAmy Coney Barrett Quickly Enters Fray of Trump’s Acrimonious Legal BattlesTrump Considers Executive Order on FrackingTrump is considering issuing an executive order to require an economic analysis of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, according to several people familiar with the matter, as the president seeks to use what he portrays as Biden’s mixed messages on energy to woo voters in the swing states of Pennsylvania and Ohio.The order would call for U.S. agencies to analyze the economic impact of fracking, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic deliberations. The order would also require an evaluation of how fracking, which is used to coax oil and gas out of underground rock formations, could be expanded, they said.Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, declined to comment on the order but said: “Since taking office, President Trump has prioritized all forms of domestic energy production which has led to America becoming energy independent.”The possible order, which was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes as fracking has emerged as a hot button issue of the 2020 election, with Trump claiming that Biden wants to ban the technique, despite the Democrat’s assertions to the contrary.Biden said during a primary debate in March that he would ban fracking but his campaign clarified the next day he was only referring to banning it on federal lands. Biden has since said he doesn’t support a national fracking ban. Natural gas development is a major economic engine in Pennsylvania and Ohio. -- Jennifer Dlouhy and Ari NatterTexas High Court Limits Ballot Drop Boxes to One per County (7:46 p.m.)Texas counties won’t have multiple ballot drop boxes ahead of the Nov. 3 national election.The state can restrict counties to just one drop box for voters who want to hand-deliver mail ballots for fear they won’t arrive in time to be counted if sent by post, the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.That means whether it’s Harris County, where Houston is located with more than 4 million people, or Loving County, population 169, each gets one drop box.The high court didn’t hear oral arguments and issued its decision without explanation. Two lower Texas courts had earlier ordered the state to let counties keep multiple drop boxes open to make voting easier for people seeking to avoid voting in person during the pandemic.A historically reliable Republican stronghold, Texas has become a battleground this year. The RealClear Politics average of recent polls has Trump up by just 2.4 percentage points. -- Laurel Brubaker CalkinsBiden Maintains His Lead in Nevada, a State Trump Wants to Flip (3:39 p.m.)Biden leads Trump by 6 percentage points in Nevada, a state that Hillary Clinton won by just 2 points in 2016 and that Trump is seeking to flip.A New York Times/Siena College poll released Tuesday finds Biden leading Trump 49% to 43% among likely voters in Nevada. Biden’s lead is buoyed by Hispanic voters who support him 59% to 30%, as well as younger voters 18-29 who support him by 56% to 32%. Women back Biden in the poll 54% to 36%.The poll was conducted Oct. 23-26, after the presidential debate last week, and finds nearly no change in the numbers from the same poll taken at the beginning of October.Trump has visited Nevada twice since August, a sign of the Republicans’ interest in flipping the swing state, which has backed presidents of both parties, including George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.The poll has a margin of error of 3.8 percentage points and was conducted among 809 Nevada likely voters. -- Emma KineryTrippy Trump Facebook Ad Skirts Policy on Declaring a Win (2:06 p.m.)A Trump campaign ad featuring screaming flowers appears to skirt Facebook’s policy against candidates prematurely declaring a win.The ad, which ran on Monday, features an animated sun with Trump’s face rising over a field with flowers that bloom to reveal a famous video of a woman screaming after Trump won the 2016 election.“It’s morning in America,” a narrator says to Edvard Grieg’s “Morning Mood,” as what sounds like a newscaster says “Donald Trump is still president of the United States.”Facebook Inc. says that political ads from politicians who claim victory prematurely are against company policies, and should be removed. The company stopped accepting all new political ads early Tuesday morning, a week before the election, but will still allow advertisers to promote ads that have been previously uploaded into its system.The ad could be a violation depending on when the Trump campaign runs it. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump on Monday also uploaded a series of ads promoting record GDP growth in the third quarter, though those numbers have not yet been released. -- Kurt WagnerBiden’s Stutter Mocked on Trump Campaign Call (1:40 p.m.)A Republican congressman mocked Biden’s childhood stutter on a Trump campaign call Tuesday.In a call to highlight Biden’s past comments on fracking, Representative Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania imitated a stutter as he argued that Biden “gets himself caught up” when talking about the natural gas extraction method.“Look he’s been against fracking since the beginning of this primary season. He’s pledged that he would eliminate, he kind of stumbles: ‘I ... I ... I’ll ... I’ll ... I’ll ... we’ll ... we’ll ... we’ll ... we’ll ... we’ll ... w-we’ll work it out, we’ll work it out,’” Kelly said.Biden says he would ban new oil and gas permits on public land but would not ban fracking. But in a bid to win Pennsylvania voters, Trump has seized on Biden’s verbal missteps during the campaign to argue that he would ban fracking outright.Trump campaign surrogate Lara Trump and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey have also mocked the way Biden speaks at campaign events, although both denied they were talking about his stutter. -- Mario ParkerBloomberg Spending $15 Million for Biden in Texas, Ohio (11:35 a.m.)Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is spending $15 million to support Biden’s efforts to flip Ohio and Texas, a spokesperson said Tuesday.Bloomberg’s Independence USA PAC will run TV ads in both states starting Wednesday until Election Day on November 3.“Mike looked at the polling data and it was clear that Texas and Ohio are in play for Biden. He is investing in expanding the map, beyond the ‘Blue Wall’ to places like Florida, Texas and Ohio, where it’s close but a win could make a big difference,” a different spokesman, Kevin Sheekey, said.In Ohio, the ads will focus on the coronavirus, the economy and Biden’s recovery plans. In Texas, the ads will focus specifically on the coronavirus and will air in both English and Spanish. The spokesperson also said Bloomberg was increasing his spending on behalf of Biden in Florida.Trump and Biden are essentially tied in Ohio and Florida, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polling, and Trump is leading Biden by 3.2 percentage points in Texas, a state that hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1976.Bloomberg, who spent $1.1 billion on his unsuccessful presidential campaign, has donated $107 million to federal candidates and committees this cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. He’s given $30 million to Independence USA PAC, his own super PAC, which has spent $32 million backing Biden.Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. -- Mark NiquetteYouth Voter Turnout Could Match 2008 Levels (10:08 a.m.)Young voters are showing enthusiasm, as high as with the runup to the 2008 election, which saw a historic turnout as the country elected its first Black president, Barack Obama.In a poll by the Harvard Institute of Politics released Monday, 63% of 18- to 29-year-olds said they will “definitely be voting” this year.That’s much higher than the 47% of 18- to 29-year-olds who said the same in the institute’s 2016 poll and comparable to a poll in 2008 which found 63% of 18- to 24-year-olds said they would definitely vote.If true, that’s a good sign for Biden as the poll showed that young likely voters backed Biden over Trump, 63% to 25%.The poll of 2,026 18- to 29-year-olds was conducted Sept. 23-Oct. 11. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.Biden Says He May Have a Shot at Texas (9 a.m.)Biden said he thinks he may be the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry Texas since 1976.In an interview with the NBC affiliate in Dallas-Fort Worth Monday night, Biden said the campaign has put a “major effort” into the Lone Star State.“Eight days to go, and the Lone Star State has a shot of becoming blue again,” he said. “We have 17 battleground states across the country. We’re not losing focus on securing the many pathways to 270,” he said, referring to the number of Electoral College votes a candidate needs to win the presidency.Texas demographics have been trending toward Democrats in recent years, but Republicans still dominate state politics. Trump currently has a 3.2 percentage point lead in the RealClearPolitics average of polls, below the nine-point margin of his win in 2016.Biden running mate Kamala Harris will stop in Houston Friday, while the campaign is spending millions on ads in the state.Trump Urges Mail-In Voters to Change Their Ballots (7:42 a.m.)Trump erroneously told voters having second thoughts that they can change their votes in most states Tuesday.Echoing an argument he made just days before the 2016 election, Trump said that Google searches for “can I change my vote” have been trending upwards, claiming that it was for him.“The answer in most states is YES. Go do it. Most important Election of your life!” he tweeted.Only a handful of states allow mail-in voters to change their ballots after submitting them and the practice is not common. Voters in Wisconsin have until Thursday to request that their ballot be spoiled and they be issued a new one, while voters in New York can simply show up on Election Day to have their mail-in ballot nullified.Trump claimed that searches spiked after the second debate, while conservative media sites have claimed the searches are related to stories about Hunter Biden. But most of the recent surge has been driven by those stories, with related searches like “change my vote trending” and “top Google searches.”Older Veterans Back Trump, Younger Veterans Like Biden (6:47 a.m.)A slim majority of veterans say they will vote for Trump, but his support is concentrated among older veterans, according to a new poll.In a survey by the Military Times and the Institute for Veterans and Military Families released Monday, 52% of people with some military experience backed Trump and 42% backed Biden.That’s a drop for Trump, who got about 60% of voters with some military experience in 2016, according to exit polls.Trump’s numbers were buoyed by strong support among veterans over 55, who backed him over Biden, 58%-39%.By contrast, veterans under the age of 34 supported Biden over Trump, 46%-42%; and veterans age 34-54 backed Biden 51%-40%. Those two groups also showed higher numbers of respondents saying they’d vote for a third-party candidate.The nationwide poll of 1,733 veterans was conducted Oct. 1-13.Two Conservative-Leaning Papers Back Trump, While Another BalksTrump picked up the endorsement of the conservative-leaning editorial boards at the New York Post and the Spokane Spokesman-Review in Washington state.But he lost the Topeka Capital-Journal in Kansas, which supported him in 2016.In an editorial announcing its decision, the Capital-Journal’s editorial board said that Biden is “committed to following the science and leading our country out of this pandemic.”“Yes, you might have heard that he’s also a Democrat. He deserves your support anyway,” the paper wrote.The Spokesman-Review, while endorsing Trump’s “market based solutions” and approach to trade, added that he is “a bully and a bigot,” who “panders to racists” and “tweets conspiracy theories” while handling the coronavirus poorly, denying climate change and seeking to dismantle the Affordable Care Act without an alternative.Coming Up:Trump will visit Lansing, Michigan; West Salem, Wisconsin; and Omaha, Nebraska on Tuesday. He’ll be in Bullhead City and Goodyear, Arizona on Wednesday.Biden will be in Atlanta, Georgia Tuesday and former President Barack Obama will be in Orlando, Florida.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-stutter-mocked-trump-campaign-174054157.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-22	2020-10-22 02:55:50	DE	Deere & Company	U.S. Official Says Iran, Russia Trying to Interfere in Election	(Bloomberg) -- A top U.S. intelligence official warned that Iran and Russia are attempting to interfere with the presidential election, with Iran already spreading false information to American voters.“We have confirmed that some voter registration information has been obtained by Iran, and separately by Russia,” Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said at a hastily called news conference Wednesday evening in Washington. “This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to convey misinformation.”“We ask every American to do their part to defend against those who wish us harm,” Ratcliffe said. “Do not allow these efforts to have their intended effect.”The voter information obtained was publicly available, and no hacking was involved, according to a U.S. official who asked not to be identified discussing the sensitive matter. Iran has been sending threatening emails to Democratic voters that purport to be from the right-wing Proud Boys group, according to the official.Ratcliffe, who was joined by FBI Director Christopher Wray, said Iran intended to harm President Donald Trump’s re-election effort.“We have already seen Iran sending spoofed emails designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest and damage President Trump,” he said. Before becoming intelligence chief, Ratcliffe was a Republican congressman from Texas who fervently supported Trump’s claim that he was the victim of a “witch hunt” by “deep state” opponents who sought to link him to Russian interference in 2016.Neither Ratcliffe nor Wray took questions from reporters.Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that Trump “has directed the FBI, DOJ, and defense and intel agencies to proactively monitor and thwart any attempts to interfere in US elections, and because of the great work of our law enforcement agencies we have stopped an attempt by America’s adversaries to undermine our elections.”The administration rushed out the announcement -- while the president was speaking at a campaign rally in North Carolina -- because the interference was about to be reported by at least one news organization, according to a person familiar with the matter, adding that White House officials wanted to control the narrative and seem transparent. Another person said that the White House and Ratcliffe made the decision.Why Disinformation Is a Major Threat to 2020 Election: QuickTakeIran views Trump as an arch-enemy since he quit the multinational nuclear accord with the Islamic Republic, expanded economic sanctions and ordered the killing of one of its top generals.John Hultquist, a senior director at the cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc, said in a statement that the episode “marks a fundamental shift in our understanding of Iran’s willingness to interfere in the democratic process.”U.S. stock futures dropped on the news, with S&P 500 Index contracts down 0.7% at 9:30 a.m. Hong Kong time, while the dollar edged higher.Local media in Florida first reported on Tuesday that Democratic voters were receiving hate mail threatening violence in messages that claimed to be from the Proud Boys. The emails read, “Vote for Trump or else!” in the subject line.Although voter registration material is available publicly, the emails falsely asserted that they had the voters’ personal information because local election systems had been compromised by hackers.“You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you. Change your party affiliation to Republican to let us know you received our message and will comply,” read one of the emails reviewed by the cyber research firm Proofpoint. “I would take this seriously if I were you.”In a joint statement, Marco Rubio of Florida, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Mark Warner of Virginia, the panel’s top Democrat, said, “Our adversaries abroad seek to sow chaos and undermine voters’ belief in our democratic institutions, including the election systems and infrastructure that we rely on to record and properly report expressions of the voters’ will.”Alireza Miryousefi, a diplomat at the Iranian mission in New York, said in a statement that his country “has no interest in interfering in the U.S. election and no preference for the outcome. The U.S. must end its malign and dangerous accusations against Iran.” Just before Ratcliffe and Wray spoke about the election threat, the Washington Post reported that Trump is considering firing Wray after the election. Trump has faulted Wray for not providing fuel for the president’s contention that anti-Trump bias drove the FBI’s investigation into whether anyone involved in his 2016 campaign colluded in Russia’s interference.Russia’s RoleAlthough Ratcliffe made only passing reference to Russia in Wednesday’s announcement, the U.S. intelligence community reported in August that “Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate” former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s Democratic opponent, and “Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump’s candidacy on social media.”The intelligence assessment also said that “Iran seeks to undermine U.S. democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country in advance of the 2020 elections.”What Is Election Hacking, and Can It Change Who Wins?: QuickTakeIn September, Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. found social media accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency -- the Kremlin-linked troll farm that used a coordinated operation on social media in an effort to help the Trump campaign in 2016 -- that were attempting to build an audience on the American left ahead of the 2020 vote.Last month, Microsoft Corp. reported that Russia and Iran had attempted to hack into political targets ahead of the Nov. 3 election.Ratcliffe’s announcement came the same week that U.S. charged six current and former members of Russia’s military intelligence unity for a series of destructive cyberattacks in recent years.(Updates with decision about the announcement, Iranian reaction, beginning in ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-official-says-iran-russia-014010292.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-29	2020-09-29 08:00:12	DE	Deere & Company	The Man Who Didn’t Want to Be a Trump Fed Governor	(Bloomberg) -- One June morning in 2019, the White House called economist Marc Sumerlin.President Donald Trump had a pair of vacancies to fill on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, and Sumerlin, a former aide to President George W. Bush, was a candidate for one of them.For the other seat, the White House had a much more controversial choice in mind: Judy Shelton, a libertarian who had in the past promoted a return to the gold standard and questioned whether the central bank has too much power.Sumerlin was invited to meet the president in the afternoon, but with a condition: he had to be prepared to accept Trump’s nomination.He declined, according to people familiar with the matter. Sumerlin told at least one administration official that he did not want to be paired with Shelton, whose nomination has since been stuck in the Senate for 15 months.The episode, never before reported, helps illustrate the difficulty Trump has experienced trying to lasso the Federal Reserve. In the past two years, Trump has proposed six different people to the two empty Fed seats. None has been confirmed by the Senate.“Marc Sumerlin was never a top-tier candidate,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. “He withdrew himself from consideration because he did not want to go through a confirmation process, not because of another potential nominee.”The president’s Fed troubles stand in contrast with his success filling positions in the U.S. judicial system. In the past four years, Trump has replaced about a quarter of U.S. judges with his appointees, including two Supreme Court justices. On Saturday he announced his third nominee to the high court, Amy Coney Barrett -- one more than Barack Obama, Bush or Bill Clinton got to appoint in two terms each as president.On the Fed, the president has filled three out of seven board seats and elevated an Obama pick, Jerome Powell, to become chair. But Trump has challenged the Fed’s independence in ways never seen before, publicly badgering Powell to lower interest rates and criticizing his decisions. The president’s comments have drawn rebukes from Congress, with lawmakers seeking promises from Fed officials and job candidates to withstand political pressure.Trump repeatedly criticized Powell after the Fed raised interest rates in 2018, and by December of that year was considering replacing him, Bloomberg News reported. More recently, he’s has complimented the Fed chairman for the central bank’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.This account of Trump’s Fed nomination process is based on interviews with current and former administration officials who asked not to be identified discussing personnel matters. Sumerlin declined to comment.Trump’s failed Fed nominees have included people too partisan or unorthodox to garner enough support in the Senate, including the former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain and Stephen Moore, an economic pundit at the conservative Heritage Foundation who advised Trump’s 2016 campaign.Cain and Moore were nominated in 2019 after the Senate didn’t act in 2018 on the nominations of two more mainstream candidates, economists Nellie Liang and Marvin Goodfriend, who withdrew from consideration. Both Goodfriend and Cain have since died.[Read more: Trump’s 0-for-4 Streak on Fed Choices Raises Concern on Vetting]Some candidates likelier to sail through the Senate have turned down the opportunity, in some cases because they feared damage to their credibility as a stalled Trump nominee, according to people familiar with the process.Other people considered for board seats include St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, who has said he had “exploratory discussions” with Trump in early 2019.Shelton was nominated in July 2019 along with Christopher Waller, executive vice president and director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. His appointment is non-controversial, but because the White House paired him with Shelton, he too remains stuck in the Senate.Sumerlin became a favorite of Trump’s top two economic advisers, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow, early in 2019 after Liang and Goodfriend withdrew their names. Sumerlin, who worked for ex-Fed official Larry Lindsey for 10 years after he left the Bush administration, keeps a relatively low public profile beyond the occasional appearance on C-SPAN.He interviewed with both men, but his candidacy came to a halt in April 2019, when Trump unexpectedly announced that he would nominate Cain and Moore for the seats.Within weeks both flamed out -- before their nominations were even sent to Capitol Hill -- as Republican senators voiced fervent opposition.When the White House turned back to Sumerlin, he told officials that he wanted to protect his business, the Washington consulting firm Evenflo Macro, and that he also did not want to stand alongside someone as controversial as Shelton.Shelton was an informal adviser to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Known before her nomination for her unorthodox, libertarian views on the gold standard and the role of the central bank, she has been outspoken since Trump named her. She has notably challenged the basic mandate Congress sets for the Fed -- to seek maximum employment and stable prices -- and has suggested the central bank should focus on the dollar.Senators of both parties tend to be unwelcoming toward Fed nominees who harbor out-of-the-mainstream views, given the potential effects on the economy.“Nobody wants anybody on the Federal Reserve that has a fatal attraction to nutty ideas,” Republican Senator John Kennedy said earlier this year. After grilling Shelton in her nomination hearing, he eventually supported her in a banking committee vote in July. The panel cleared her by a vote of 13-12 along party lines.A group of former Fed officials, including ex-Vice Chair Alan Blinder, published an open letter in August calling on the Senate to reject her nomination over her “ill considered” views.Fifteen months after their nominations, Republicans who control the Senate still have not scheduled a floor vote for Shelton or Waller.Senator John Thune, the chamber’s No. 2 GOP leader, said earlier this month that Shelton doesn’t have enough support to win confirmation. Republican leaders would move forward on her nomination before the November election if she can secure the votes, he said.Kudlow said earlier this month that Trump stands “firmly in favor” of putting Shelton on the Fed.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/man-didn-t-want-trump-080012363.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-23	2020-09-23 00:14:49	DE	Deere & Company	Trump to Meet With State Enforcers Before Expected Google Case	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump is set to meet with Republican state attorneys general at the White House on Wednesday to discuss allegations of online censorship against conservatives, according to people familiar with the matter.The meeting, which is expected to be around midday, comes as the Justice Department is preparing to brief state officials later in the afternoon on its forthcoming antitrust case against Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which could be filed as soon as next week, according to people familiar the matter.Attorney General William Barr, who has been a key ally of Trump’s in taking on tech giants over how they police content on their platforms, will also attend the White House meeting with the states, said one of the people.Barr’s Justice Department and a nationwide group of attorneys general have been investigating Google’s conduct in online search and digital advertising, two markets where the internet giant is dominant. The Justice Department’s Google lawsuit, which several states are expected to join, will focus on competitive harm from online search, according to two people familiar with the matter.Google controls about 90% of online search as well as vast swaths of the technology used by advertisers and publishers that deliver display ads across the web. One of the central complaints against Google is that it has used its near-monopoly in search to dominate display advertising and shut out competition.The Justice Department declined to comment.The states, which are led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, could still pursue their own case in coming weeks, Bloomberg has reported. The Justice Department has focused on the company’s internet search operation. Paxton’s case focuses on the company’s dominant position in the sale of online ads, although some states have looked into other issues, including Google’s Android mobile operating system, Bloomberg has reported.As the Justice Department bears down on Google, Trump has claimed the search giant and its peers are trying to manipulate information online to benefit the left.“Online censorship goes far beyond the issue of free speech,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere in a statement. “It’s also one of protecting consumers and ensuring they are informed of their rights and resources to fight back under the law.”Trump wants to hear from the state law enforcers as they “are on the front lines,” Deere said. Some Republicans have floated the idea that attorneys general could use state laws banning deceptive business practices to punish companies for their denials if they are found to be biased.The Google lawsuit would mark the biggest monopoly case brought by the U.S. since the Justice Department and a group of states accused Microsoft of illegally monopolizing the market for computer operating systems. That case, brought under former president Bill Clinton, nearly led to the company’s breakup until it was settled by the George W. Bush administration.(Updates with Barr to join White House meeting with attorneys general in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-meet-state-enforcers-expected-001449113.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-09-21	2020-09-21 13:14:01	DE	Deere & Company	Deere (DE) Hits 52-Week High: What's Driving the Upside?	Improved outlook, robust farm equipment demand, expansion initiatives and solid estimate revisions are contributing to the rally in Deere's (DE) shares.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-hits-52-week-high-131401220.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-09-21	2020-09-21 11:38:03	DE	Deere & Company	Deere To Strengthen Presence In Australia, New Zealand- Report	Agriculture and equipment manufacturer Deere is planning to expand further in Australia and New Zealand based on a Sept. 18 Bloomberg report.Luke Chandler, Deere’s (DE) chief economist, who is now assuming the role of managing director for Deere’s operations in Australia and New Zealand, said that he will target growth in construction and forestry, including road building and government infrastructure projects. The company will also bolster its precision agriculture business, turf and some mining operations.In Australia, Deere recently released new software updates to the John Deere Operations Center and its MyOperations App to 'help users further unlock the power of precision agriculture'.The company has a strong presence in the agriculture business in the Australian and New Zealand markets. However, rival Caterpillar (CAT) is stronger in the mining and construction space.“John Deere’s construction business is incredibly strong in North America, but we see a real opportunity given the sophistication of the clients and customers there,” said Chandler in an interview with Bloomberg.In the tractor sector, Deere will focus on developing precision agriculture tools, many of which help farmers cut costs. “Around 60 per cent to 65 per cent of agriculture production is exported, so Australian and New Zealand farmers need to be extremely competitive in the world market” stated Chandler. He also noted that these nations don’t enjoy subsidies and safety nets available elsewhere in the world, including the US and European Union.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo analyst Andrew Casey increased the price target for Deere to $230 from $220 on Sept. 15 but maintained a Hold rating. The analyst noted that the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) crop progress report suggests the crop remains in decent shape and is also developing quicker than usual. However, crop rated in good to excellent condition decreased for corn and soybeans, which were down 100bps (basis points) and 200bps, respectively, from the previous week.Casey views the negative revisions to crop condition as a modest medium-term positive for farm equipment stocks. (See DE stock analysis on TipRanks)Deere stock has advanced 28% year-to-date. However, the average analyst price target of $218.69 indicates a possible downside of 1.5% in the months ahead. The Street is cautiously optimistic about Deere and has a Moderate Buy consensus based on 11 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell rating.Related News:   Boeing Gets Two Orders For 737-800BCF Freighter Jets   Smart Sand Inks $2M Deal For Eagle’s Oil & Gas Unit; Analyst Bullish   Rolls-Royce Seeks To Raise $2.5B, Including From Singapore’s GIC- Report More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Tesla Drums Up Workers In Effort For Record 3Q Car Deliveries - Report   * Illumina Confirms $8B Acquisition Of Cancer-Detection Firm Grail   * Goldman Adds BJ’s Wholesale To Conviction Buy, Lifts PT   * Comscore Partners With Samba TV To Expand In Europe; Needham Says Buy	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-strengthen-presence-australia-zealand-113803331.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-18	2020-09-18 16:26:18	DE	Deere & Company	Tractor Giant Deere Plans to Expand in Australia, New Zealand	(Bloomberg) -- Tractor giant Deere & Co. plans to expand in Australia and New Zealand, with its one-time chief economist leading the charge.Luke Chandler, who has become managing director for the two countries, said he’ll target growth in construction and forestry, including road building and government infrastructure projects. The Moline, Illinois-based firm will also boost its business in precision agriculture -- key for Australian farmers to compete globally -- as well as in turf and some mining operations.Australia is a commodities powerhouse, being a large exporter of goods ranging from barley and wheat to iron ore and natural gas, while New Zealand dominates the global dairy market. Deere, known for its green and yellow tractors, is already a leader in agriculture in the region, but the mining and construction sectors are currently dominated by Caterpillar Inc.“We have been present in the Australian and New Zealand market in agriculture and turf for a number of years,” Chandler said in an interview. “John Deere’s construction business is incredibly strong in North America, but we see a real opportunity given the sophistication of the clients and customers there.”Deere’s business in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Africa and the Middle East accounted for $3.8 billion in sales last year, or almost 10% of the company’s total revenue. The company doesn’t break down earnings for the two countries to be led by Chandler, who served the last three years as chief economist.While Deere will support some mining operations, it’ll be more focused on equipment for infrastructure and earth moving. In the tractor sector, there will be a focus on developing precision agriculture tools, many of which help farmers cut costs by, for example, providing information needed to reduce fertilizer application.“Around 60% to 65% of agriculture production is exported, so Australian and New Zealand farmers need to be extremely competitive in the world market,” Chandler said, noting that those nations don’t have the benefit of subsidies and safety nets seen elsewhere in the world, including the U.S. and European Union.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tractor-giant-deere-plans-expand-162618807.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-08	2020-09-08 15:44:42	DE	Deere & Company	Trump Likely to Back Extended Offshore Drilling Ban Near Florida	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump is set to endorse an extended ban on offshore oil development on Florida’s western coast as he courts voters worried that drilling imperils the state’s beaches and tourism-based economy.At issue is a moratorium on selling new leases in an area of the eastern Gulf of Mexico about 150 miles from the Florida coast -- a ban that is set to expire in 2022, unless Congress renews it. Trump is expected to endorse the extension of that moratorium during a visit to Florida on Tuesday, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named before a formal announcement.The White House declined to respond to a question about the moratorium but said in a statement that Trump is slated to discuss his administration’s conservation and environmental protection efforts in the region during an afternoon speech in Jupiter, Florida.“These projects aim to reinvigorate the Everglades, enhance regional water storage capacity, and reduce harmful discharges from Lake Okeechobee, helping address the problems of blue-green algae and the red tide,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere.Trump cannot extend the statutory ban on oil leasing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico without Congress, and it’s unclear that lawmakers would enact the change this year.Oil industry advocates, including the American Petroleum Institute, had lobbied the administration to sell leases in the eastern Gulf after the moratorium expires. And for a time in 2018, Trump’s Interior Department was charting plans to do just that.Oil industry advocates also have floated a compromise to make the moratorium permanent while also shrinking the boundaries of the off-limits area by about 50 miles, so companies can tap the most tempting prospects in the region.The eastern Gulf of Mexico is a draw to oil companies because it is close to existing pipelines and infrastructure, including refineries in Texas and Louisiana. The area also is believed to have major oil and gas reserves. Energy companies already discovered a jackpot of natural gas roughly 30 years ago -- at least 700 billion cubic feet and as much as 3 trillion cubic feet -- in the Destin Dome, located about 25 miles south of Pensacola, Florida. The same geological trends that have yielded major oil discoveries in other parts of the Gulf could be replicated in its“America’s offshore energy resources are a strategic asset,” said Erik Milito, head of the National Ocean Industries Association. “The economic, national security and environmental stewardship benefits the offshore provides impact every American. The benefits are nonpartisan; we should not limit American offshore production.”But environmentalists have warned that an oil spill in the eastern Gulf could send crude floating around the state and washing up the east coast. Florida voters and politicians have cautioned that oil spills could cripple the state’s tourism economy.Politico reported earlier Monday that the Trump administration was planning an announcement of an expanded drilling moratorium.The issue has been a political hot potato for Trump. Shortly after taking office, he ordered the Interior Department to consider scheduling new sales of drilling rights along U.S. coastlines, with an eye on annual auctions of territory in the western and central Gulf of Mexico, Arctic waters north of Alaska, and the mid- and south-Atlantic. The agency responded in January 2018 with a draft plan opening the door to selling drilling rights in more than 90% of U.S. coastal waters.But by spring 2019, administration officials had decided to delay their plan to expand oil leasing until after the 2020 election, worried that the president and Republican leaders in the southeast U.S. would lose votes if they pushed forward with selling new drilling rights in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-likely-back-extended-offshore-154442144.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-31	2020-08-31 02:42:51	DE	Deere & Company	Right-Wing Group Says Supporter Dead in Portland: Protest Wrap	(Bloomberg) -- The man shot to death in a protest in Portland on Saturday night was a supporter of a right-wing group that has frequently clashed with other demonstrators there.The death was the third fatality in less than a week as racial equality protesters clashed with armed counterprotesters backing President Donald Trump and law enforcement in several cities across the U.S. Two protesters were killed last week in Kenosha, Wisconsin, a city that has seen widespread demonstrations and violence since a Black man, Jacob Blake, was shot seven times in the back by police.The past week has marked a new violent chapter in protests that began with the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, as demands for racial justice have increased amid a divisive presidential campaign.In Portland, the dead man was part of a a caravan of counterprotesters to a Black Lives Matter demonstration on Saturday -- a group the Portland police said it had tried to keep away from protesters downtown. Trump tweeted his support for the caravan earlier, calling them “great patriots.” He later tweeted his condolences.In Kenosha, the two deceased were protesters shot by a 17-year-old who had traveled from another state, armed, ostensibly to defend property and help police keep the peace. A hearing to extradite the 17-year-old suspect in that case, Kyle Rittenhouse, from his home state of Illinois was delayed for 30 days.Trump plans to go to Kenosha on Tuesday, over the objection of the state’s Democratic governor. Spokesman Judd Deere said the White House “has been humbled by the outreach of individuals from Kenosha who have welcomed the President’s visit and are longing for leadership to support local law enforcement and businesses that have been vandalized.”On Monday afternoon, Trump is scheduled to meet at the White House with Attorney General William Barr and Chad Wolf, the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security.Former Vice President Joe Biden will speak Monday in Pittsburgh “on whether voters feel safe in Donald Trump’s America” and the Democrats’ differing vision, his campaign said. Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, called on Trump to stop “fanning the flames of hate and division“ in society.“I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same,” said Biden, who plans to campaign nationally and speak against violence.Portland shootingIn Portland on Saturday, police said some Trump supporters in trucks who were blocked in by protesters began exiting their vehicles. Fights broke out, the police said, and the caravan left the area about 8:30 p.m. Gunshots were heard about 15 minutes later. The police have released few other details and have asked the public for help finding the shooter.Even before the affiliation of the victim had been confirmed, both sides of the political divide were quick to blame each other for encouraging the violence that led to the killing.A visibly angry Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler denounced Trump for inciting his supporters to violence in his tweets. Portland, he said, is committed to ending the protests through reform of “systematic injustice.”“We all saw this coming,” the Democratic mayor said in a news conference. “I’d appreciate that either the president support us or stay the hell out of the way.”Trump unleashed a tweetstorm Sunday, reiterating accusations that Democratic leaders of cities and states aren’t controlling protests and saying the National Guard has and would do so. Wolf, the president’s nominee to head the Department of Homeland Security, said “all options are on the table” in terms of sending troops even if local officials do not request them.After golfing in Virginia, Trump again took to Twitter as Wheeler spoke, calling for “law and order” and criticizing the Portland mayor by name.Kenosha ralliesProtest continued in Kenosha, though the rally Sunday was in support of the police. The night before, more than 1,000 people demonstrated against the shooting of Blake, who is in the hospital and is reportedly partially paralyzed.“There were seven bullets put in my son’s back. ... Hell yeah, I’m mad,” said Jacob Blake Sr., the father of the shot man. “What gave them the right to attempted murder on my child? What gave them the right to think that my son was an animal? What gave them the right to take something that was not theirs? I’m tired of this.”Breonna TaylorIn another high-profile case, Kentucky’s Attorney General Daniel Cameron said he has received the FBI ballistics report in the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor in a no-knock raid in March. Cameron, who spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention, said his office doesn’t plan to make an announcement this week as additional analysis is needed.University of Alabama football players and coaches are planning a march at 4 p.m. Monday to protest social injustice, running back Najee Harris said. The march will meet at the schoolhouse door at Foster Auditorium, he said, the site where then-Governor George Wallace placed himself to prevent the enrollment of two Black students almost six decades ago.Key Developments:As Clashes Between Armed Groups And Leftist Protesters Turn Deadly, Police Face Complaints of Tolerating VigilantesBiden to Address Violent Protests in Campaign Swing, Aide SaysWolf Says Portland Officials Foster Violence Among ProtestersFacebook CEO Says ‘Kenosha Guard’ Page Was Left Up By MistakeMLS, NWSL Clubs in Utah to Be Sold After Uproar Over Owner’s CommentsSee the latest from Bloomberg QuickTake:In Portland:In Kenosha:From the Washington March on Friday:Several sports teams and leagues joined the NBA’s walkout:For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wing-group-says-supporter-dead-222656887.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-08-28	2020-08-28 13:36:04	DE	Deere & Company	Battle Of The Stocks: Is Deere Or Caterpillar A Better Investment Right Now?	The US economy contracted 31.7% (revised estimate) on an annualized basis in the second quarter, marking the steepest decline ever. The COVID-19 pandemic erased millions of jobs and crushed several businesses. The fate of the companies in the industrial sector is closely tied to the economy.Heavy equipment manufacturers like Deere and Caterpillar are significantly impacted by the economic downturn. However, Deere’s recent results indicated that the situation may be better-than-feared.   We will analyze the recent performance of Deere and Caterpillar and use the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool to see which stock offers a more compelling investment opportunity.Deere (DE)Deere impressed investors with its better-than-anticipated results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 (ended August 2) and a better outlook for the full fiscal year despite continued uncertainty. The company’s fiscal third-quarter revenue declined 11.1% to $8.93 billion and EPS fell 8.5% Y/Y to $2.57 as shipments dropped amid the crisis.The farm equipment company, which derived about 68% of its last year’s net sales from the Agriculture and Turf business, stated that the demand for small tractors remained strong in the quarter due to an increase in projects for home and property owners amid the pandemic. The segment’s sales declined 5% to $5.67 billion due to lower shipment volumes. But the decline was lower than anticipated supported by higher pricing.It now expects fiscal 2020 sales for the Agriculture and Turf business to fall 10% compared to the previous forecast of 10% to 15% decline. That's thanks to the benefit from replacement demand as the farm equipment fleet continues to age out.Deere’s Construction and Forestry segment’s sales fell 28% to $2.19 billion reflecting lower shipment amid the crisis, partially offset by higher pricing to some extent. The company is now anticipating a 25% fall in the segment’s fiscal 2020 sales, reflecting an improved outlook compared to the previous forecast of a 30% to 40% drop.Most importantly, Deere has been curbing its production to right-size its inventory levels and is also cutting down costs amid challenging market conditions. These efforts and a faster than anticipated recovery helped the company raise its fiscal 2020 net income forecast to $2.25 billion, up from the previous projection of $1.6 to $2.0 billion.At the same time, Deere plans to intensify its investments in Precision Agriculture as farmers are seeking advanced technologies and more automation. It is also enhancing its capabilities in the aftermarket and retrofit business.Following the results, RBC Capital analyst Seth Weber increased his price target for Deere stock to $228 from $180. The analyst maintained his Buy rating as the company’s fiscal third-quarter results and improved guidance for fiscal 2020 highlight its &quot;ability to navigate fluid markets&quot;.Weber also raised his fiscal 2020 EPS estimate to $7.21 from $6.15 and fiscal 2021 view to $9.45 from $8.65. He believes that the company is well-positioned for fiscal 2021 based on its agriculture orders and declining inventory in construction. (See DE stock analysis on TipRanks)Based on 12 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell, Deere scores a Moderate Buy consensus from the Street. Deere stock was up about 21.8% year-to-date as of August 26. An average analyst price target of $217.44 indicates a further upside of 3.1% over the next 12 months.Caterpillar (CAT)Caterpillar beat analysts’ predictions for the second quarter but COVID-19 caused a significant decline in its top-line and earnings due to lower demand in the company’s end markets. The second-quarter revenue fell 30.7% Y/Y to $10 billion while its adjusted EPS plunged 70.3% to $0.84.The pandemic caused Caterpillar’s dealers to cut machine and engine inventories by about $1.4 billion compared to an increase of $500 million in 2019’s second quarter. Revenue from the company’s larger segments--Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation fell 37.4% and 24.4%, respectively. And revenue from Resource Industries and Financial Products declined 35.2% and 12.6%.One favorable trend in the second quarter was that the Asia Pacific business fared better than North America due to improved demand in China. Caterpillar did not provide any full-year guidance, unlike Deere. But, it cautioned that it expects dealers to reduce their inventory by over $2 billion by year-end.The company expects the residential construction business to improve in North America and drive the demand for small equipment. Deere is also optimistic about the medium and long-term prospects for mining, although it expects the overall demand for Resource Industries to remain soft.Within the Energy & Transportation business, the company expects to benefit from demand for data centers and emergency power while continued challenges in oil and gas might hurt the demand for reciprocating engines.On August 3, Credit Suisse analyst Jamie Cook raised her price target for Caterpillar to $159 from $144 and maintained a Buy rating based on a better-than-expected quarter. Cook noted that the market was disappointed by Caterpillar's third-quarter forecast which indicates that the sales and margins will be down sequentially, implying that the second quarter is not the trough of earnings.However, the analyst believes that Caterpillar’s earnings will bounce back next year and that the company’s bottom line has been more resilient than in prior downturns. (See CAT stock analysis on TipRanks)Caterpillar stock has declined about 4% so far in 2020 and the average analyst price target of $141.07 does not indicate a possible upside. Eight Buys, 9 holds and 1 Sell add up to a Moderate Buy rating for Caterpillar stock.The better stockDeere stock has outperformed Caterpillar on a year-to-date basis.

The money is intended to be used to establish 12 new research institutions.What You Need to Know: The new funding from the government aims to ensure that every sector of the U.S. economy is engaged with AI and quantum information science, or QIS.The program is the &quot;nation's largest single investment in AI to date.&quot; The areas highlighted in the funding announcement were agriculture, climate research, machine learning, education and chemistry.The National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Department of Energy are participating. Three publicly traded companies were mentioned by the White House and all have a major presence in AI and/or QIS. IBM's AI, Quantum Background: IBM (NYSE: IBM) has been a leader in both AI and quantum research, and is now working on decreasing the amount of money and time it takes to get a drug to the market using its AI platform.IBM recently partnered with Workday Inc (NASDAQ: WDAY) to launch an AI solution for workers returning to the office, Workday Adaptive Planning, which is intended to help with facility management and contact tracing.The company's IBM Watson supercomputer, which competed on &quot;Jeopardy&quot; in 2011, has been at the forefront of many AI initiatives.IBM recently said that it hit a quantum computing milestone, reaching a quantum volume of 64. The company's latest progress in QIS will likely be available on future releases of IBM Cloud Software Services.IBM is slated to contribute runtime on its quantum computers for the White House initiative. IBM's Cloud and Cognitive segment is its second-biggest revenue producer.Microsoft Pushes Further In AI: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) uses an AI platform to help with many different markets.The company is experienced in quantum technology, believing it can help complete highly complex calculations quicker on items that would take current computers billions of years.Azure Quantum is now available in limited preview for customers. Microsoft is set to contribute personnel and materials for the White House project.Deere Uses AI To Help Farmers: After years of simply selling tractors to farmers, Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) has shifted to using technology to create better products and solutions.The company acquired NAVCOM back in 1999 to help improve GPS signals. In 2017, the company acquired Blue River for $305 million.Blue River relies on AI for devices like its See and Spray, which can reduce weeds by 50%. AI in agriculture is a growing market expected to go from $852 million in 2019 to $8.4 billion in 2030, according to a recent P&S Intelligence report. What's Next: Some have called for the U.S. government to spend more on AI and quantum research. The Stanford Institute wants to see $120 billion spent over the next five years.The Trump administration committed to doubling funding to $2.2 billion in 2022.The European Union has committed to spending $1.69 billion to invest in AI in 2020.

The company reported third-quarter worldwide net sales and revenues came in at $8.925 billion versus $6.70 billion estimate. The company also raised its fiscal 2020 net income guidance from $1.6 billion to $2 billion to $4.25 billionBMO analyst Joel Tiss maintains an Outperform rating on Deere with a $235 price target.Morgan Stanley analyst Courtney Yakavonis maintains an Overweight rating on Deere with a price target lifted from $181 to $247.BofA Securities analyst Ross Gilardi upgraded Deere from Neutral to Buy with a price target lifted from $194 to $234.View more earnings on DERBC Capital Markets analyst Seth Weber maintains an Outperform rating on Deere with a price target lifted from $180 to $228.BMO: Key Takeaways Deere's earnings report is highlighted by confirmation that end-market demand is performing &quot;better than feared,&quot; Tiss wrote in a note. Other key takeaways from the earnings release include the adoption of the company's precision-agricultural technology platform is accelerating and now exceeds 25% on new machines, and CEO John May's &quot;aggressive&quot; restructuring program will take time to implement but management kept its 15% operating margin goals unchanged.Morgan Stanley: Conference Call Highlights Deere's report marks a &quot;tangible step&quot; towards management's 15% mid-cycle operating margin target despite disruptions from COVID-19, Yakavonis wrote in a note. Management provided further color and commentary on its conference call and some of the more notable highlights include:  * The retail environment remains strong in North America while planned underproduction positions Deere to produce at retail demand next year. Also, new and used large ag inventories were low and used inventories are at levels that haven't been seen since 2014.  * North American small ag demand is benefiting from stay at home trends while large ag demand is relatively stable, although still down from last year. U.S. farmer sentiment was described as &quot;fluid&quot; despite trade and government support concerns remaining.  * Fiscal fourth-quarter margins should see a smaller material price benefit as material prices after material prices became a tailwind in the fourth quarter of 2019.BofA: The Quarter 'We've Been Waiting For'Deere reported a beat-and-raise quarter that puts the company on &quot;solid footing&quot; into the new fiscal year, Gilardi wrote in the note. The company is also showing impressive margin performance despite a low point in the grain cycle.Most notably, Deere delivered a 630 basis point Ag & Turf margin expansion despite a 5% decrease in sales. In fact, Ag & Turf showed its best margin performance since 2013 when corn was $6 per bushel versus $3.25 now.Meanwhile, the end market is demanding more automation in their machinery and Deere offers a best-in-class product lineup that helps farms increase productivity at every stage of the crop rotation.The bottom line, Gilardi said the company's precision agriculture leadership and ESG merits should command a sustained multiple expansion moving forward.RBC: Outlook Commentary Deere lifted its full-year 2020 net income outlook, partly due to upside in the recent quarter, Weber wrote in a note. FINCO profit for 2020 was lifted from $490 million to $510 million to reflect a provision for credit losses of 37 basis points due to higher uncertainty.Cash from operations was also increased from $1.9-$2.3 billion to $2.8 billion while R&D and SA&G are expected to be lower by 5% to 7%, respectively.Price Action: After trading higher in Friday's session, shares of Deere were trading higher by another 3% at $205.86.Latest Ratings for DE  DateFirmActionFromTo  Aug 2020Deutsche BankMaintainsHold  Aug 2020Credit SuisseMaintainsOutperform  Aug 2020B of A SecuritiesUpgradesNeutralBuy    View More Analyst Ratings for DE   View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from Benzinga  * Plasma Treatment For COVID-19 Unlikely To Be 'Home Run,' Says Ex-FDA Commissioner  * James Beard Foundation Calls Off New Awards In 2020, 2021  * Estee Lauder Wins Over Another Analyst: Why RBC Is Turning Bullish(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-23	2020-08-23 09:07:36	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Gains 4% On Raised 2020 Profit Outlook	Shares of Deere & Co. appreciated 4.4% on Friday after the farm and construction equipment manufacturer reported better-than-expected 3Q results and raised its profit outlook for fiscal 2020.Deere's (DE) 3Q revenues of $8.93 billion surpassed analysts’ expectations of $6.7 billion. The company’s earnings of $2.57 also beat Street estimates of $1.26. However, top and bottom-line results declined by 11% and 8.5%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Looking ahead, Deere now anticipates the rate of decline in agricultural and construction sales to be more modest than it had forecast during 2Q results. As a result, the company increased its net income guidance for fiscal 2020. The company now projects a profit of $2.25 billion, up from the previous guidance range of $1.6-$2 billion.  (See DE stock analysis on TipRanks).Ahead of the earnings, BMO Capital analyst Joel Tiss on Aug. 17 lifted the stock’s price target to $235 (17.8% upside potential) from $150. Tiss stated that demand across Deere’s end markets are expected to be “better than feared” despite the headwinds, which includes low grain prices and trade disputes.Currently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 9 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell. The average price target of $189.38 implies downside potential of about 5.1%. Shares are up 15% year-to-date.Related News:   BMO Capital Lifts Deere’s PT Ahead Of 3Q Results   JPMorgan Cuts Deere To Sell Ahead Of 3Q Results   Ross Stores Reports Surprise 2Q Profit Despite Store Closures More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Gilead Says FDA Could Broaden Remdesivir Use Despite Data; Analyst Slashes PT   * Susquehanna Raises Keysight’s PT On 5G Rollout Boost   * D.A.

2020-08-21	2020-08-21 21:05:30	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Raises Outlook With Farm Demand Cushioning Downturn	(Bloomberg) -- Deere & Co., the largest maker of agricultural machinery, increased its sales outlook for the year as farm-equipment demand remained resilient despite an “uncertain” market due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Moline, Illinois-based producer said net income for the fiscal year would be $2.25 billion, up from a May estimate of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. The company said it expects agriculture and turf equipment sales to decline 10%, compared with a prior range of 10% to 15%, with a better outlook in the U.S. and Canada. The shares surged as much as 6.2% and closed at a record high $199.50 in New York.“Although unsettled market conditions and related customer uncertainty are expected to have a moderating effect on key markets in the near term, we believe Deere is well-positioned to help make our customers more profitable and sustainable,” Chief Executive Officer John May said in a statement Friday.Deere’s shares are up 15% this year as agriculture demand held in better than other sectors despite the coronavirus and uncertainty over U.S.-China trade relations. North American farm-equipment sales surged in July, led by small tractors, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, as farmers replace aging fleets. Fiscal third-quarter net income of $2.57 a share was down from $2.81 a year earlier, but exceeded the highest estimate among analysts.Deere turned in a “remarkable operating performance” in the quarter, Robert W. Baird & Co. analysts including Mircea Dobre said in a note. “Importantly, this beat was not just about cost cutting as revenue was well ahead of expectations. U.S. ag fundamentals remain challenged though stabilizing.”Still, sales of corn for food, auto fuel and animal feed have shriveled as efforts to stem the spread of coronavirus shut restaurants, kept drivers off the road and closed meat plants. That, along with prospects for record yields and ample inventories, may keep pressure on prices and limit any increases in spending on machinery.In June, Deere shook up its management and adjusted how it operates in an effort to respond more quickly to changing market conditions.“The company has announced broad employee-separation programs that will be completed during the fourth quarter in support of its strategy to create a leaner, more agile organization,” according to the earnings statement.In addition to boosting its outlook for its agriculture and turf equipment group, Deere said the construction and forestry group’s estimated sales decline was pared to 25% from the previous 30% to 40% drop.(Updates shares in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-raises-sales-outlook-while-101648605.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-21	2020-08-21 14:05:26	DE	Deere & Company	Foot Locker, Deere Earnings In Focus As Both Companies Beat Expectations And Get Lift	It seems a bit ironic that in a week where the market set an all-time high, it might have to claw its way back today to avoid a disappointing finish.That's the way things look this morning, and it's actually not a huge surprise. Number one, there appears to be some profit-taking going on. Number two, the story continues to be thin volume, which can cause quicker moves up or down. Also, the market is still near the highs and maybe some people don't want to take risk into the weekend. It's been a long time since the market had a Friday where it sold into the weekend, so today could be an interesting test of whether this early weakness lasts. Any kind of recovery into the late hours of the session might help set up a positive scenario for the start of next week. Even in that scenario, the question remains how much more near-term enthusiasm there is to take things up even higher without some sort of major catalyst.Cheer From Deere, and Foot Locker Jumps Good news this morning came from the heart of the Midwest in Moline, Illinois, where Deere & Co. (NYSE: DE) reported earnings and revenue that beat analysts' estimates. The caveat is that everything was down from a year ago, including equipment sales.DE, like just about everyone, got weighed on by the pandemic, and said &quot;unsettled market conditions&quot; and &quot;customer uncertainty&quot; have had a moderating effect. Despite that, shares rose 2.5% in pre-market trading and investors await the company's call for more insight on how the company is tractoring through the economic crisis. In the construction area, residential has been strong but a glut of office space is possible, so consider listening to DE's discussion of demand for construction equipment.From tractors to shoes: Investors are running toward Foot Locker Inc. (NYSE: FL) this morning. That company beat analysts' earnings estimates and saw shares jump nearly 5% in pre-market trading. A huge surge in same-store sales appeared to provide major traction. This lines up nicely with some of the strong retail results seen earlier this week from companies like Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Walmart, Inc. (NYSE: WMT). It might also be positive for Nike, Inc. (NYSE: NKE), which FL tends to follow.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and its German partner grabbed some headlines this morning with an announcement that their COVID-19 vaccine candidate is in final-stage testing and well-tolerated by people receiving it in the clinical trial. This is really a &quot;show-me&quot; situation where investors might want to see data and the actual filing before getting too excited. Remember, vaccines are a tough business and many companies are racing to develop them like never before. Hopefully, some of these products will be successful.You'd think with all this good news, stock indices might get a lift. No dice. Even as the opening bell approached, investors looked at a sea of red numbers. We'll see if anyone comes in to buy as the session gets underway.Back in the Zone After spending Wednesday flirting with the &quot;reopening trade,&quot; markets went back to their old comfort zone Thursday as the FAANGs reasserted dominance. It wasn't just the FAANGs, but really the Tech sector in general driving things along for the Nasdaq (COMP) as the week advanced. Information Technology topped the sector leader board with 1.3% gains Thursday and is the third-best performer over the last week behind Consumer Discretionary and Communication Services (sectors that some FAANGs also call home). Cyclicals and &quot;value&quot; sectors like Energy and Financials got taken out to the woodshed Thursday and haven't had much traction the last week. So much for the argument heard around Wall Street a couple days ago about sector rotation. It just doesn't seem to be happening. Momentum is mostly in the &quot;growth&quot; stocks, meaning Tech, and until the trade stops working, portfolio managers might be tempted to keep putting money there. What's concerning to some analysts is how the mega-caps (mainly FAANGS) continue to muscle higher while much of the rest of the market either marches in place or actually moves lower.Tech is up 25.4% year to date, with Consumer Discretionary second but way off the pace at 16%. Remember, too, that Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN)--one of the FAANGS and a $1.65 trillion stock that's up about 75% so far this year--is a gigantic gorilla in the room helping Consumer Discretionary roar.Microsoft Syndrome for Nvidia? While Tech doesn't show signs of yielding its pole position in the sector starting grid, it's not all cut and dry. For instance, last month a couple of huge names in Tech ran into trouble following earnings as both Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) gave up ground. With INTC, the selling was partially tied to product issues, but with MSFT, a better than expected earnings report basically got the cold shoulder from investors.The same thing appeared to happen this week with Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), so maybe it should be called the &quot;Microsoft Syndrome&quot; NVDA seems to be hitting every single number there is, and it got a bunch of upgrades. The stock fell early Thursday despite all that and finished barely higher on the day. Some people pointed to the price-to-sales ratio being up at around 25, which is above its traditional level of around 20, and said this hints at the stock being overbought.While that can't be ruled out, there may be more fuel in this engine. This is a situation where momentum is trading, and all the momentum in semiconductors is with NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). INTC seems to be going the other way, though shares got a boost yesterday from news it would buy back some stock. That's good news in one sense because it suggests INTC doesn't need to throw all of its spare cash at its production problem to ramp up machines or anything like that. Let's face it, though. We haven't seen a lot of companies doing buybacks since the whole Covid thing started, and what INTC is doing when it buys back stock doesn't expand their business. It could be a cautionary note for investors.Before wrapping up the chip talk, one thing that didn't get much attention with NVDA earnings was how they made their name by being a chip-maker for video gaming and now their data center business is outpacing games. They're expected to release a new chip for games in early September, so they're bifurcating themselves in  a very healthy way that seems to be attracting investors.As we've seen over the last few years, companies that can't expand beyond their original business sometimes get left in the dust. AMZN doesn't just sell books now, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) doesn't just sell computers. It's good to see other Tech companies branching out, too.  CHART OF THE DAY: PROTOCOL NOT FOLLOWED: Historically, gold and the dollar often track different directions. That was the case earlier this month as gold (/GC--candlestick) climbed to record highs while the dollar index ($DXY--purple line) retreated. Lately, however, gold is pulling back despite what remains a weak dollar. This pattern could reflect thin, late-summer trading. Data Sources: CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Risk Measures Getting a Bit Fuzzy: Turning to Treasuries for a minute, the 10-year yield seems to be backtracking as the week continues, falling to around 0.65% by Thursday's close. That might have reflected economic concerns raised by the Fed in its July meeting minutes.At the same time, gold also retreated Thursday and the dollar index can't get back on its feet. Normally you'd be more likely to see gold climb along with Treasuries if investors are getting cautious, but things are a little out of whack lately so it's hard to look at this and see any kind of takeaway.Instead, it might just be that it's late summer, people are still coming back from vacation, volume is thin, and the market lacks direction. It wouldn't be shocking if this kind of lackluster trading continues into early September, with Labor Day being the traditional end of the season. What if Treasury Yields Start Rising? One thing some analysts warn about is possible risk-aversion if 10-year yields start moving higher, say to between 0.7% and 0.9%. The current low yields could be helping fuel the growth sector rally, but if borrowing costs start rising, that trend might lose some steam.With yields basically in a holding pattern between 0.5% and 0.7% for months now, maybe it's too soon to worry about that. It's just something to consider tucking away. Especially with MarketWatch reporting Thursday that Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech next week could focus on how the Fed might let inflation run hotter than it has in the recent past before cranking up rates.Any prolonged inflation scenario would likely put pressure on the bond market, and as we saw in late 2018, a rise in Treasury yields (which move the opposite direction of the underlying Treasury note) can cool off stocks. Whether the same thing would occur without the Fed actively raising rates the way it did back then remains to be seen.First Impressions Don't Always Count with Earnings: What happened earlier this week with Walmart shares is a handy reminder of how earnings reports sometimes play out in the market. WMT skyrocketed ahead of the opening bell Tuesday after the company reported a really nice quarter, highlighted by huge gains in online and same-store sales. That was all good. What wasn't so good was what happened to shares after that pre-opening salvo. They finished down about 0.7%. Investors might have been scratching their heads, wondering what happened. Often it's not what a given company says in its press release that moves shares on earnings day, but what it says on its call. That might have been the case with WMT, as executives noted that sales had eased lately thanks in part to government stimulus drying up. This led to some analysts saying that maybe the peak had passed for retail this year, and that's not what investors wanted to hear. A great example of people buying the press release and selling the earnings call came in early 2018 when shares of Caterpillar, Inc. (NYSE: CAT) soared in pre-market trading on strong earnings only to plunge during the call. The pitfall, apparently, was when a CAT executive made comments that left many investors thinking the company's best quarter of the year was already behind it. So the lesson could be, pay attention to earnings calls before making any big moves in the market.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only. Member SIPC.

2020-08-21	2020-08-21 13:19:39	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Has Good News for Investors, Not Workers	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Deere & Co.’s improving outlook provides more fodder for an equity market that’s ready to believe in a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The company’s plan to cut jobs anyway should give pause. The agricultural equipment maker said on Friday that it expects to earn about $2.25 billion in 2020, up from a high-end estimate of $2 billion in its May guidance range. Sales declines in its agricultural segment won’t be as steep as previously thought as farmers replace aging equipment and non-professionals stock up as part of the pandemic-fueled boom in spending tied to landscaping, hobbies and home improvement. Even the construction division that’s been hit hard by the macroeconomic downturn and the woes of the oil and gas industry is holding up better than expected. Sales in that business are projected to be down 25% globally this year, compared with an earlier forecast of as much as a 40% slump. Both divisions benefited from price increases in the most recent quarter. Deere’s results are in line with the overall “could have been worse” theme of the industrial earnings season. It is in no way a V-shaped recovery, but the damage isn’t as bad as it might have been and businesses are seeing early evidence of demand improvement. There’s a major caveat to this messaging in the form of jobs, however. The boosted profit outlook doesn’t just come from a market demand recovery; one reason Deere thinks its financial statements can weather the crisis better than expected is because it’s expanding workforce reductions. The company said it has announced “broad employee-separation programs” due to be completed in the fourth quarter in an effort to create a “leaner, more agile organization.” About $175 million of associated restructuring expenses are included in the net income forecast, with estimated annual savings of $175 million.These kinds of announcements just keep piling up from manufacturing companies, with more and more cuts being labeled permanent. Can things really be trending in the right direction if so many workers are being left behind?This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-08-21	2020-08-21 11:50:16	DE	Deere & Company	Deere's Debt Overview	Over the past three months, shares of Deere Inc. (NYSE: DE) increased by 31.05%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Deere has.Deere's Debt According to the Deere's most recent balance sheet as reported on May 28, 2020, total debt is at $50.14 billion, with $38.96 billion in long-term debt and $11.18 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $8.90 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $41.24 billion.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Deere has $77.33 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.65. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Debt Is Important Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * A Preview of Deere's Earnings  * Return On Capital Employed Overview: Deere  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For August 13, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-20	2020-08-20 16:53:57	DE	Deere & Company	A Preview of Deere's Earnings	On Friday, August 21, Deere (NYSE: DE) will release its latest earnings report. Here is Benzinga's outlook for the company.Earnings and Revenue Deere EPS is expected to be around $1.24, according to sell-side analysts. Sales will likely be near $6.70 billion. Deere reported a profit of $2.71 per share when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $8.97 billion. If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Friday, EPS would have fallen 54.24%. Sales would be down 13.66% on a year-over-year basis. Here's how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past:Quarter Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2019 Q3 2019  EPS Estimate 1.80 1.26 2.14 2.85  EPS Actual 2.11 1.63 2.14 2.71  Revenue Estimate 7.76 B 6.42 B 8.44 B 9.39 B  Revenue Actual 9.25 B 6.53 B 8.70 B 8.97 B  Stock Performance For a full 12 months, the return has risen by 30.19%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably relaxed going into this earnings release.

2020-08-18	2020-08-18 14:32:15	DE	Deere & Company	Return On Capital Employed Overview: Deere	Looking at Q2, Deere (NYSE: DE) earned $1.27 billion, a 40.33% increase from the preceding quarter. Deere also posted a total of $9.25 billion in sales, a 41.7% increase since Q1. In Q1, Deere earned $905.00 million, and total sales reached $6.53 billion.Why ROCE Is Significant Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Deere's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. In Q2, Deere posted an ROCE of 0.11%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on DEROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Deere is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.In Deere's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions.Q2 Earnings Insight Deere reported Q2 earnings per share at $2.11/share, which beat analyst predictions of $1.8/share.See more from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For August 13, 2020  * How Does Deere's Debt Look?  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Deere has.Deere's Debt Based on Deere's balance sheet as of May 28, 2020, long-term debt is at $38.96 billion and current debt is at $11.18 billion, amounting to $50.14 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $8.90 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $41.24 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Deere's $77.33 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.65. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry, whereas average for another.Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-07	2020-08-07 13:56:59	DE	Deere & Company	The Pandemic Is Dragging Brazilian Farmers Into the Digital Age	(Bloomberg) -- The pandemic is accelerating a digital revolution in agricultural powerhouse Brazil by forcing farmers to buy equipment and get assistance online, according to Deere & Co.Lockdowns and social distancing are preventing the traditional face-to-face interaction between farmers and providers at dealerships and rural fairs, with both parties reverting to video conferencing or specialized applications.Brazilian growers, who are younger than their U.S. counterparts on average, have adapted well to digital platforms as the virus keeps them on their farms, said Rodrigo Bonato, Intelligent Solutions Group director for Latin America at the world’s biggest tractor maker. Machinery sales are expected to match last year’s levels amid another bumper harvest, according to industry group Anfavea.“The pandemic has caused a paradigm shift,” Bonato said in an interview. “People in the countryside need to be connected to the world, and the pandemic is accelerating that.”A lack of viable communications networks in rural areas has been a barrier to Brazilian growers tapping into databases and platforms that can help them lift yields and cut costs.With higher demand by farmers to connect for everything from virtual medical appointments to technical assistance, telecommunications companies are more interested in building networks in remote regions, Bonato said.Brazil has about 9.5 million hectares (23 million acres) connected, or 25% of the soybean planted area. In five years, connectivity may reach 70-80% of Brazilian farms, he said.That could help lift efficiency in a country that’s already the biggest exporter of soybeans, sugar and coffee.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-sees-pandemic-speeding-connectivity-145307847.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-20	2020-07-20 08:00:00	DE	Deere & Company	Giant Wireless Sale Offers 5G Spectrum Sliced Into 22,631 Pieces	(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. is moving into the new era of fast 5G wireless internet and the Muscatine Power & Water utility in Iowa wants to join the ride. So does the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative Inc. that serves Kaktovik and Atqasuk in remote northern Alaska.They are among more than 200 companies registered to bid in an unusual government auction set to begin July 23. At stake is potentially $10 billion worth of lucrative spectrum that can be used for wireless internet and is assigned by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission through competitive bidding.The number of registered bidders makes it one of the biggest auctions of its type in history. Combined with another sale scheduled for December, it represents a giant leap toward a future of super fast internet and connected cars, appliances and mobile devices.Past sales offered licenses covering entire metropolitan areas at prices that only wealthy corporations such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. could afford. This one offers smaller licenses -- seven in each county in the country for a total of 22,631.That means companies with modest finances -- such as Muscatine Power and the Alaskan co-op -- can get rights to spectrum in just their area. The FCC designed it that way to assure the next generation of wireless service isn’t limited to a handful of telecom behemoths, and to give companies with new uses for the technology a shot.“It’s really a game-changer for all of these non-traditional users,” said Kurt Schaubach, chief technology officer with Federated Wireless, a company based in Arlington, Virginia, that helps coordinate use of the airwaves being auctioned.It is the first offering by the FCC in recent years of airwaves suitable for the advanced 5G systems. Proceeds will go to the U.S. Treasury and estimates range to as much as $10 billion by Raymond James.“We’ve never had an auction of this size,” said Michael O’Rielly, an FCC commissioner who guided the auction’s design. In an interview he ticked off participants -- the big national wireless providers, cable companies “of all shapes and sizes,” electric utilities and companies beaming broadband over the air.The frequencies are in the so-called midband range of airwaves, where signals travel well and also can carry abundant data. Both features suit the 5G networks that will link billions of devices in automated factories, homes and elsewhere. Auction winners can only buy four of the seven licenses available in each county, ensuring that no single user can snap up all of an area’s airwaves. Each of the seven licenses provides rights to use the airwaves across an entire county.The Muscatine municipal utility, which offers internet service and runs an electrical grid and water system, could buy airwaves covering just Muscatine County, where there are fewer than 17,000 households.Utilities and electricity distributors could use their winnings to expand wireless broadband networks, manage electricity distribution, and install remote meter-reading.Tractor maker Deere & Co. is poised to take part. Its products include tractors and combines that link with mobile internet service.The airwaves can be used for more rural broadband coverage, enhancing what farmers can do in the field, and supporting manufacturing operations, said Jennifer Hartmann, a spokeswoman for Deere, which is based in Moline, Illinois.A cohort of petroleum companies and utilities have registered to bid.“Utilities for decades have struggled to acquire the amount of spectrum they need” because they lack the capital available to big telecom providers, said Rob Thormeyer, spokesman for the Utilities Technology Council that advocates for utilities’ communications systems.National mobile carriers enrolled in the sale including AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile US Inc. may be most interested in airwaves to supplement urban coverage.Largest U.S. cable providers Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. are also registered to bid. Each has seen a swell of subscribers who buy wireless service that rides on Verizon’s airwaves. If the cable providers can buy airwaves and set up nodes for their customers’ use, they could pay Verizon less.It’s the first big sally into airwaves auctions by cable companies in over a decade.“This is the only good 5G spectrum they could get their hands on for awhile,” said Gregory Williams, an analyst with Cowen & Co.The airwaves to be sold are in the so-called CBRS band. The acronym stands for Citizens Broadband Radio Service. It’s located in the 3.5 gigahertz band. The auction runs as long as bidders are competing, a process that typically takes weeks to unfold.An auction in December is expected to produce even higher bids for spectrum in the so-called C-Band. It will offer swathes of airwaves congenial to mobile broadband, and to allow higher power transmissions that can send signals farther.The FCC bars participants from publicly signaling bidding strategies, and many declined to discuss the sale. Verizon, Comcast, Charter, AT&T, the Muscatine utility and the Arctic Slope cooperative all declined to comment or didn’t respond to queries.A robust sale with high total bids would bode well for 5G auctions to follow, including the C-band sale on Dec. 8 of airwaves to be surrendered by satellite providers, said Harold Feld, senior vice president for the Washington-based policy group Public Knowledge.“We’re going to see how much are companies willing to pay for this kind of 5G spectrum,” Feld said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/giant-wireless-sale-offers-5g-080000875.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-10	2020-07-10 18:04:18	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Cotton-Bale Packager Seeks Ban on Alleged China Knockoffs	(Bloomberg) -- A company that develops packaging for cotton bales harvested with Deere & Co. tractors says it’s facing Chinese knockoffs and wants a U.S. trade agency to block the copycats from entering the country.Israel-based Tama Group and its U.S. unit filed a complaint on July 7 with the U.S. International Trade Commission saying two Chinese companies and their North American distributors are working together to sell cheaper replicas of a plastic wrapping Tama designed and patented more than a decade ago.TamaWrap is exclusively designed for John Deere tractors that Tama’s complaint says revolutionized cotton baling, enabling “a single machine to do what, until then, was impossible -- harvest, collect, bale, and uniquely wrap cotton with a single machine and on-board wraps.”Having an all-in-one John Deere machine is an advantage for growers, with nearly half of cotton harvesting globally still being done by hand.Cotton futures in the U.S. have climbed to four-month highs recently on concern that drought will hamper crops in Texas, the biggest U.S. state grower.But a global supply glut has been taking form in recent months amid pandemic lockdowns that have hit retail demand for clothing and other goods in the U.S. and abroad.The Chinese companies “seek to enter into the United States market for automated cotton harvesting on the backs of Deere and Tama only after Deere and Tama created the market in the first place, and are just now realizing the benefits of their tireless efforts to develop and foster this market,” Tama said in its ITC complaint.Order SoughtTama seeks an order preventing further imports of the rival packaging and a halt to sales of products already brought into the country.The ITC complaint names Zhejiang Yajia Cotton Picker Parts Co. and its distributor, Arkansas-based Southern Marketing Affiliates Inc. It also names Hai’an Xin Fu Yuan of Agricultural Science and Technology Co. and its distributor, Canada-based Gosun Business Development Co.Tama says the companies’ knockoffs use its trademarked yellow color and are designed to uniquely work inside John Deere machines, but don’t work as well. The company received exclusive patent rights in the U.S. for the plastic cotton-baling material in 2004, and TamaWrap launched in the country in 2009.TamaWrap’s material includes tracking technology known as radio frequency identification technology, or RFID, allowing user management of individual cotton bales and customer service through the Tama mobile app, the company said in its ITC complaint.Mirror LawsuitsTama filed mirror lawsuits against the companies seeking damages in federal courts in Texas. Those suits are typically put on hold until the ITC completes its investigation. The companies didn’t respond to requests for comment. Tama is also suing the two manufacturers individually in China, along with a third company, over the same technology, according to the complaint.The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Wrapping Material and Methods for Use in Agricultural Applications, 337-3468, U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). The district court cases are Tama Group v. Southern Marketing Affiliates, 20-1780, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas) and Tama Group v. Gosun Business Development Co., 20-2375, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-cotton-bale-packager-seeks-180418408.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-07	2020-07-07 15:36:09	DE	Deere & Company	Trump Insists That Schools Open, But Teachers Aren’t So Sure	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump has made his position clear: “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!” he tweeted Monday. As Covid-19 surges in parts of the U.S., many teachers aren’t convinced.The pandemic’s ever-shifting nature has robbed school districts of the ability to plan with certainty -- not only for instruction, but to provide protective equipment and intensive cleaning. Even if a sustained decline in infections allows them to open their doors, many are preparing a mix of in-person and remote education that is certain to fall short of the president’s expectations.“The reality is that they have to map out several scenarios for the fall with the real possibility that they don’t know what the scenario will be on the first day of school,” said Betheny Gross, associate director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington at Bothell, which has been tracking districts’ responses to the coronavirus shutdown.In Washington on Tuesday, Trump will host a gathering of health and education leaders -- as well as students and parents -- for an event billed as a “National Dialogue on Safely Reopening America’s Schools.”The event comes as many students approach five months without setting foot in a classroom. Proponents of returning say distance learning is hobbling children’s development and the economy, with parents trying to juggle work and their offspring. Many teachers say they’re well aware of the benefits of face-to-face instruction, but worry about endangering students and peers.Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House’s coronavirus task force, told Bloomberg Radio on Tuesday that it’s important to keep students, teachers and administrators safe, as well as families that include older people.“I think if we put the child at the center and say, what is best for the American child? What experiences do they need? And when we come to the conclusion that they need to be in school, then we need to really figure out how to make that a safe environment,” Birx said. “We have to bring in testing into the schools.”Economic DragBut Trump’s demand that schools open this fall was a reminder of how politicized the issue has become. “It’s not surprising,” said Douglas Harris, chair of the Department of Economics at Tulane University in New Orleans and a public-education expert. “The economy can’t really open back up again until kids go back to school.”Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, the nation’s biggest teachers union, said schools need a massive allocation of federal stimulus funds to purchase protective equipment and hire cleaners. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday predicted Congress this month will pass one final rescue package.Teachers agree that remote instruction isn’t optimal, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. The real debate, she said, is around how to return to school safely -- and the need for money to do it right.“Either you have to be a moron about not understanding how government or schools work, or you have to be really callous and craven that you’d wait till the end, till it’s almost too late,” Weingarten said.To maintain social distancing, schools will have to use lunchrooms, gyms, libraries and trailers as classrooms. Some are considering rotating classes in mornings and afternoons or three days a week. Others may keep older pupils online, while using high-school classrooms for younger children who don’t learn well via Zoom, Garcia said.Gross said schools may also need to rotate through different scenarios as the school year goes on and the pandemic changes anew.In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday reiterated that no decision has been made on whether students across the state will be able to return for in-person learning in the fall.“We obviously very much would like to,” Cuomo said, adding that New York City and 700 school districts are in the process of developing reopening plans that must be submitted to the state.In Texas, where Covid-19 cases have surged since the state embarked on one of the country’s most aggressive reopening plans, most teachers surveyed by the Houston Federation of Teachers have said they would prefer to not return to in-person learning until it is “safe,” according to Andy Dewey, the group’s executive vice president.Defining Safe“The definition of safe is where we have disagreement,” he said by phone Monday. “The problem is this: The district hasn’t given us any guidance on it because the district says the state hasn’t given any guidance on it.”The latest survey conducted by the El Paso branch of the AFT showed that just 7% of 790 respondents were in favor of full face-to-face learning at the start of the school year. About 20% said they supported a “hybrid” return, while roughly 72% said they favored remote learning. The city and surrounding area’s two main school districts both plan to start the first few weeks of the year virtually.Teachers for the Houston Independent School District have until the end of this week to decide whether they want to resign to avoid potentially being required to return to classrooms. After that, they risk having their teaching certificates suspended for a year if they defy an in-person start to the school year, with a permanent notation that could make it harder for them to get hired in other districts, Dewey said.Leslie LaFollette, a third-grade teacher at Kiker Elementary in Austin, said she’s prepared to move to Massachusetts, where her wife has family, if educators aren’t allowed to stick to online learning.“It’s drastic, but I’m willing to do that if we lose the option,” said LaFollette, 46. “I miss my kids, I want to be with them. But not to the detriment of their health and my health.”In Seattle, site of the first major U.S. outbreak, officials are pursuing a hybrid reopening. Parents have been asked to fill out a questionnaire with their preferences so the district can plan. In August, families must finalize their pick.“We’re focusing on making that as equitable and safe as possible,” said Julie Popper, spokeswoman for the Seattle Educational Association, which represents some 6,000 members, including teachers and staff.Before opening, the union wants to make sure Seattle is spending enough on staff and protective equipment to meet state health and safety rules, as well as adding custodial workers to disinfect, and having nurses and mental-health professionals in every school daily, Popper said.Peer InteractionIn North Carolina, Angie Mangin is optimistic about getting her two incoming eighth-graders back to school, especially her daughter, after having them home-learning since March.“My son wasn’t too affected by the change, but my daughter needs that interaction with her peers,” said Mangin, 54, who works in the insurance and risk department of Circle K convenience stores.Tulane’s Harris, who studies the economics of education and education policy, said there’s simply no guarantee everyone is going back. “It’s hard to imagine that schools will reopen fully in person on a large scale,” he said.Trump, who avoids wearing a mask in public and has convened rallies without social-distancing requirements, has urged local governments to reopen. Stacy Davis Gates, vice president of the Chicago Teachers Union and executive vice president of the Illinois Federation of Teachers, said she didn’t trust him to lead on education policy.“President Trump has been virtually missing in action with respect to keeping Americans safe countrywide,” Gates said. “It gives me a great amount of anxiety to know that he is going to set the standard for my children and America’s children.”(Updates with comment from Birx in sixth paragraph.

They asked not to be identified because the Trump proposal isn’t final and hasn’t been announced.The news buoyed U.S. stock futures early Tuesday, including for companies that may benefit from a burst of new public spending. Fluor Corp. surged 11% before regular U.S. trading, while Vulcan Materials Co. climbed 8.3%.The draft plan is emerging as lawmakers from both parties and Trump debate the timing and scope of more stimulus for a U.S. economy plunged into recession by nationwide lock-downs needed to halt the spread of coronavirus. It’s the latest sign of momentum in Washington for some kind of infrastructure spending blitz ahead of the election.House Democrats have offered their own $500 billion proposal to renew infrastructure funding over five years. It’s unclear how long the administration’s draft would authorize spending or how it would pay for the programs.Trump is pushing to rev up the U.S. economy -- which four months ago was the centerpiece of his argument for a second term -- as he trails Democrat Joe Biden in most national polls. The White House has explored ways to shift the next round of federal virus aid from personal financial support to growth-fostering initiatives, such as infrastructure spending.The White House declined to comment specifically on the administration’s plans.“Since he took office, President Trump has been serious about a bipartisan infrastructure package that rebuilds our crumbling roads and bridges, invests in future industries, and promotes permitting efficiency,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.Trump has periodically called for more spending on infrastructure, including during his 2016 presidential campaign. In March, as the pandemic tightened its grip on the U.S., he urged as much as $2 trillion in new investment in U.S. roads, bridges and tunnels.That echoed his push two years ago for Congress to dedicate $1.5 trillion toward new infrastructure investment. But hopes for federal legislation ended in May 2019 after Democrats said Trump walked out of a meeting on a $2 trillion plan and vowed not to work with them unless they stopped investigating him and his administration.Lawmakers who attended a closed-door meeting with the president in February 2018 said he told them he’d support a 25-cent per-gallon increase in gas taxes, but Trump never publicly endorsed it. The idea drew opposition from Republicans who don’t want to raise taxes and Democrats worried about the impact on low-income populations.It’s possible that the infrastructure measures currently being drafted could be rolled into the next round of pandemic relief. The House passed $3 trillion in additional stimulus in May, but the Republican-led Senate spurned that bill and will instead weigh its options next month.The Democratic bill to reauthorize the current infrastructure program was unveiled this month. It includes investments in roads and bridges, funding to make certain projects more resilient to climate change, and funding for public transit and Amtrak, among other priorities. The House Transportation committee is set to take up the measure on Wednesday.The existing surface transportation authorization law, known as the FAST Act, authorizes $305 billion over five years and expires on Sept. 30. Lawmakers will either extend it or come up with a long-term replacement. It’s not yet clear how closely the administration’s plan will align with the Democrats’ proposal -- or with what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might do.Infrastructure spending has long held appeal for lawmakers as a way to spur growth, and the pandemic is renewing calls to fast-track roads and other projects. Mary C. Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, called for public-works spending on infrastructure, including projects that could help low-income people.“We need to focus on investments that leverage the talent of everyone and contribute to the economy’s long-term growth prospects,” Daly said in a speech Monday. She cited health, education and digital infrastructure, such as internet access.One major question facing lawmakers will be how to pay for the measures, a hurdle that has stopped previous moves on infrastructure. Increasing the federal gas tax to support a massive round of new spending is unlikely though, as Trump cheers low gas prices and calls for other measures, including a payroll tax cut, to put cash in Americans’ pockets as the country copes with fallout from the virus.Congress has shown little concern about the more than $2 trillion allocated to curb the pandemic’s economic damage, though some conservatives have begun to urge Trump to turn off the taps. But interest rates are near zero, making additional government spending more palatable, Daly said.“Now is an especially good time to take on this type of debt,” Daly said. “Even before the crisis, we were in an environment of low interest rates – and that is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. This makes public spending relatively cheap and easy to finance.”(Updates with futures trading in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-team-weighs-1-trillion-023458531.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-22	2020-05-22 20:32:24	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Beats on Earnings, Misses on Guidance Amid Virus Barriers	(Bloomberg) -- Deere & Co. may have done a better job than expected navigating the first months of the pandemic, but there’ll be no letup in threats to the machinery maker in the months ahead.Declines in sales and profit in the February-April period were less severe than analysts predicted as agriculture -- deemed essential in the lockdown era -- proves relatively resilient. Lower costs and better pricing helped prop up margins even amid supply-chain disruptions and China trade deal concerns weighing on its customers.The company, which dropped annual guidance in March as it cut back operations, bucked an industry trend by providing a new profit forecast -- of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. That’s just below the average analyst estimate and a sharp drop from last year. Shares fell for the first time in three days.“Deere continues to produce and ship machinery and repair parts to meet demand,” it said in a statement. “Responding to this demand in the face of the pandemic has been a challenge as a result of various regulatory, economic, and other barriers that have affected production facilities and the supply chain.”Deere forecast its 2020 worldwide agriculture equipment sales to be down 10% to 15%, and said industry sales would decline 10% in the U.S. and Canada -- its biggest money-making region. It said construction and forestry equipment sales would drop 30% to 40%.Deere’s fiscal second quarter is often its strongest as farmers buy planting equipment for the growing season.The cycle of farmers replacing aging machinery will persevere through near-term challenges like the trade war, tough growing conditions and the economic shutdown, according to Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold. A $19 billion government aid package may also boost American farmers’ purchasing power.The decision to reinstate guidance is positive, and may prove to be conservative given the solid quarter, said Chris Ciolino, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. Results showed “really just strong execution on the cost side and better pricing.”Defensive PlayThe Moline, Illinois-based company is also shoring up its liquidity. It raised $4.5 billion in funding during the pandemic.“Deere’s solid balance sheet, good credit metrics and management prudence are likely to help soften the impact of the virus outbreak, at least in the near term,” said Stephane Kovatchev, a credit analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.Fiscal second-quarter adjusted earnings were $2.11 cents a share. compared with the $1.62 average estimate and $3.52 a year ago.(Updates with shares)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-beats-earnings-misses-guidance-203224994.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-21	2020-05-21 16:41:51	DE	Deere & Company	Ford Is the Poster Child for America's Grand Reopening	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- After a prolonged shutdown, Ford Motor Co. officially resumed production at its North American factories this week. It hasn’t been as smooth a process as the company might have hoped: Ford had to temporarily close two critical facilities this week to allow for a deep cleaning after workers tested positive for the coronavirus. An Explorer SUV plant in Chicago was closed a second time after an employee at a nearby supplier facility tested positive for the virus, causing a parts shortage.This is the reality of manufacturing for the time being as companies fret about worker safety and the legal and reputational risks of not doing enough to protect employees. Unlike Ford, whose products fall into a category of consumer spending that’s become even more discretionary amid the pandemic, wide swaths of the industrial sector were deemed essential and allowed to remain operational. Those companies, too, have had their share of growing pains as they adjust to a new way of working.Boeing Co. temporarily closed its factories in the Puget Sound area in March after a worker died of the coronavirus and later briefly shuttered work at its 787 plant in South Carolina. CBS Minnesota reported earlier this month that a Honeywell International Inc. facility in Minneapolis had closed after a worker tested positive. Whirlpool Corp. closed its Amana, Iowa, refrigerator plant at least twice after employees tested positive for the virus, according to the Gazette local paper. Deere & Co. and Altria Group Inc.’s Philip Morris USA are among the many others that have had to close plants on a limited basis to avoid outbreaks among workers. Lockheed Martin Corp., meanwhile, said this week it will temporarily slow production of the F-35 fighter jet because of delays at suppliers.  It’s a lot harder, though, to bring factories back to life than it is to just figure it out as you go along. Ford may be a manufacturer, but because it’s one of the few to have experienced an extended lockdown, it’s arguably a better benchmark for the non-industrial economy. You better believe that office-based companies that have sent most of their workers home are keeping a close eye on how the likes of Ford fare in flipping the switch back on. Seeing the automaker’s setbacks this week, companies that can operate without their employees clustered in the same place may be less keen to rush back. They’re getting a more continuous stream of work out of their employees now than they would if they had to hit the pause button and clear out the office every few weeks. And the mixed messages from the White House aren't helpful: President Donald Trump is due to visit a Ford factory in Michigan that’s been converted to ventilator production and has been wishy-washy on whether he will adhere to the company’s face-mask requirements. Already, American Express Co. CEO Steve Squeri and Visa Inc. CEO Al Kelly said this week that most of their employees would work from home for the rest of the year. Some 28% of employers recently surveyed by Challenger, Gray & Christmas said they would make work-from-home arrangements permanent for at least some employees. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and social media site Twitter Inc. are among those who have publicly said remote working will be their indefinite default option. Facebook Inc. said Thursday it would follow suit and move to a more permanent remote workforce.At the end of the day, manufacturing or non-manufacturing, it's all interconnected. How permanent this shift to work from home will be is debatable, but if companies end up needing less office space, by default that means fewer HVAC systems, commercial lighting, fire and security products or even 3M Co.’s Post-it notes. And if workers aren’t going to be commuting, do they still need to buy cars from Ford? There's a lot riding on getting reopening right.     This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-05-16	2020-05-16 10:00:00	DE	Deere & Company	Broken Ventilators Spark Push to End Limits on Who Can Fix Them	(Bloomberg) -- A group of state officials has an idea to expand the availability of ventilators and other equipment hospitals need to treat coronavirus patients: let more medical facilities fix the ones they have.In a letter to equipment manufacturers, the state treasurers of Pennsylvania, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, and Rhode Island said hospitals sometimes had to wait longer than a week for technicians under their maintenance contracts to fix equipment. Manufacturers have refused to supply parts to anyone who hasn’t undergone the expensive company training.“In a global pandemic with this kind of urgency and this kind of devastation, where every second counts, there shouldn’t be a single ventilator in any hospital that can’t be used because of these restrictions,” Pennsylvania State Treasurer Joe Torsella said in an interview.Torsella led the group calling on manufacturers to release all repair manuals and service keys and to allow hospitals to use technicians of their choice instead of those required under maintenance contracts. The effort also turned a spotlight on an issue that some consumer rights groups are hoping could lead to a more permanent change.Twenty states are considering legislation that would give consumers more rights to repair, resell and modify products they buy, whether it’s more access to the software on John Deere farm tractors, going outside Apple Inc.’s “Genius Bar” to fix a broken iPhone, or selling digital books after they’ve been read. Some, but not all, also include provisions that would cover medical equipment, which are tightly regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The pandemic may give the movement a boost because of the outcry over reports of broken or unavailable ventilators. In April, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group sent a petition with 43,000 signatures calling on manufacturers to release repair information.Hundreds of biomedical engineers, also known as biomeds, signed a letter to be released Monday by PIRG that calls for greater access to service materials and for making product-specific training “on fair and reasonable terms.”As the outbreak spread over the past month, some medical equipment makers such as Medtronic Plc and General Electric Co. agreed to turn over manuals and other information to ensure hospitals have what they need.The companies, along with Draegerwerk AG, sell medical equipment for as much as $1 million or more for each machine. Draegerwerk, which biomeds said has particularly strict rules, is projecting an increase in sales as hospitals need more devices to treat coronavirus patients. Even more profitable are the required service contracts to keep complicated equipment like ventilators, patient monitors, and MRI machines working.“We provide 24/7 technical support to the hospitals we supply as well as rapid on-site service,” said Marion Varec, a spokeswoman for Draegerwerk. “In fact, we provide manuals, to the extent consistent with FDA quality standards. We listen to our customers and support their needs.”Legislative proposals have been strongly fought by the industries affected, and the medical device industry has been among the most vocal. It’s trying to get Congress to pass legislation that would impose more stringent requirements on hospital and independent biomedical technicians, or biomeds. Instead, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was told to investigate whether there was a difference in the quality of service -- the agency determined in 2018 that there was no fall off in quality of repairs when it was done by in-house hospital technicians or trained independent biomeds.Among those weighing in on behalf of the biomeds was the Defense Department, which called the profit margins on maintenance “astounding” and said the markup for parts could be more than 1000%.Leticia Reynolds, president of the Colorado Association of Biomedical Equipment Technicians and a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, said there’s a big difference in what you can do at military hospitals and at civilian ones.“In the military, you can work on pretty much anything,” said Reynolds. In the civilian sector, “If you haven’t been to their school, they say ‘We won’t help you,’ or ‘You can’t buy parts.”’The industry said its employees are held to a higher standard than those working for hospitals or with third-party repair firms, known collectively as independent servicing organizations, and its efforts were to put all technicians on the same level.“Currently, only servicing activities performed by medical device manufacturers are held to any quality, safety, or regulatory requirements by the FDA,” said Peter Weems, Director of Policy & Strategy at the Medical Imaging and Technology Alliance. Independent servicing organizations are not required to register with the FDA, report deaths or serious injuries, or adopt quality management systems.Some hospital officials are critical of the medical equipment industry.“It’s not about safety, it’s about maintaining a business advantage,” said Patrick Flaherty, vice president of supplier performance at Pittsburgh-based UPMC, a group of more than 40 hospitals, who called the manufacturers “monopolists and cartels.” “It’s absolutely repulsive if you try to cloak it under patient safety.”Hacking ThreatOthers say that the additional protections are needed with regard to complicated medical equipment -- especially as more systems become networked and vulnerable to hacking.“This is life-saving and life-sustaining equipment,” said Nick Lewis, systems director of environmental safety management and compliance at Baptist Memorial Health Care in Memphis, Tennessee. “Having tight controls -- whether that be passwords, or when they update software -- they have to be pretty tight with that stuff or we could potentially put ourselves at risk with cyber issues.”Amid a dire shortage of personal protective gear for doctors, nurses and other first responders through the country when the Covid-19 virus migrated from Asia and Europe, U.S. hospitals also found ventilators in short supply and some delivered from the National Stockpile broken. Hospitals and critical care facilities had to adapt other equipment, such as reconfiguring anesthesia machines and transport ventilators.Hospitals PreparedMassachusetts General Hospital sent a team to inspect and repair the entire contingent of ventilators the state received from the National Stockpile, knowing smaller hospitals wouldn’t have the trained technicians, said Paul Biddinger, director of emergency preparedness at the Boston hospital.“Early on, as we saw the coronavirus emerging as a threat, we tried very hard to anticipate what the impact on our system could be,” Biddinger said.At the Johnson Memorial Health in Johnson, Indiana, the hospital found powered air-purifying respirators needed by health-care professionals in the Covid unit that were so old there was no way to buy the connector hoses that pump fresh air, said marketing director Jeff Dutton.“Someone knew a small business in Franklin that had a 3D printer and was able to replicate the part perfectly,” Dutton said.Manufacturers initially kept to their long-standing policies when it came to access to manuals, software codes and parts. But as the scope of the crisis grew, many began easing restrictions, posting their closely kept service manuals on their websites, or dropping objections to having them posted on sites such as iFixit.com, which crowd sources manuals.It’s unknown whether they will try to pull them back once the pandemic is over. Jared Wilson, co-founder of Insight HTM LLC, which does repairs and maintenance at ambulatory surgical centers, said he is bizarrely “grateful” for the pandemic.“Typically we’re in what was the morgue, the bottommost corner of the hospital,” Wilson said. “This really has brought to light the issue of maintenance of equipment. We’ve been striving for this for so long.”Flaherty said the work being done at hospitals and critical care centers around the world spotlight that some of the rules are unnecessary.“If Covid did not create a learning platform for people, then it’s a missed opportunity,” Flaherty said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broken-ventilators-spark-push-end-100000601.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-28	2020-03-28 12:00:54	DE	Deere & Company	Don’t Drop Your iPhone Now: Repairing It Is a Problem	"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, you are in Minneapolis and you drop your iPhone, who will repair the cracked screen? If you’d like an authorized repair, with Apple Inc.-certified parts, the options are suddenly limited. Apple’s retail stores, and the service centers inside of them, are closed indefinitely. Similarly, Twin Cities-based Best Buy Co., which offers authorized Apple repairs in its stores, is not repairing products in-house at this time. Apple maintains a modest network of authorized repair shops, but — thanks to Covid-19 business shutdowns — the closest one available to repair an iPhone is nearly 200 miles away, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. That leaves one reasonable authorized repair option: Mail in that iPhone and wait.Admittedly, this might not appear to be the most pressing issue during a pandemic. But consider: Covid-19 is spreading at a time when dependence on personal technology is more important than ever, connecting Americans to family, work, health information and news. As that dependence has grown, manufacturers of electronics — from mobile phones to essential medical equipment like ventilators — have made design and policy decisions that restrict device repair to themselves and their chosen representatives. In normal times, those decisions might amount to an expensive inconvenience for consumers. During a pandemic, they raise a pressing question: Who will repair our stuff if the manufacturers can’t or won’t?It’s not a question the U.S. faced during the 1918 flu pandemic. A century ago, most of the devices purchased by Americans were mechanical in nature, and home mechanics were plentiful. The Ford Model T circa 1918 was designed to be serviced by its owner or anyone nearby with basic mechanical skills. In the 1920s, American farmers started the mass adoption of mechanical tractors, and so had to develop formidable repair skills to keep them running. When World War II arrived, and farm equipment and repair parts became scarce, manufacturers like John Deere Inc. actively sought to aid farmers in the personal upkeep of their equipment. That self-reliant spirit persisted for most of the 20th century, epitomized by weekend mechanics working on their cars in the driveway.By the early 1990s, however, the skills and motivation to repair at home, or to start repair businesses, were in decline. As manufacturing jobs shuttered, mechanical and repair skills withered. At the same time, globalized manufacturing drove down the costs of manufactured goods. Once-expensive repairable televisions gave way to disposable $300 flat screens. The TV repair shop, once a fixture in American cities, has largely disappeared.More intentional reasons for the decline also emerged. Device, appliance and even farm-tractor manufacturers opted to wring more money out of their service and parts businesses by restricting access to repair parts and documentations. For example, on March 31, camera manufacturer Nikon Corp. will stop providing official parts, tools, software and repair manuals to the U.S. repair shops in its authorized repair network. (In 2012, it stopped selling parts to independent camera repair shops.) It will now only provide certified repair and parts in two Nikon-owned facilities. For camera owners, that means waiting longer, and probably paying more, to get their stuff fixed. For independent repair shops, it means one less reason to stay in business.Nikon’s practices aren’t unique. Apple restricts parts, diagnostic software and repair documentation to its stores and a small network of authorized repair shops. It also actively dissuades independent repair shops from fixing Apple products. One of the world’s most valuable companies is suing a small, unauthorized Norwegian phone repair shop for selling aftermarket iPhone screens. Without aftermarket parts, such shops cannot fix iPhones.And John Deere, once a proponent and partner in the independent repair of tractors, has built a repair monopoly by installing software that effectively prevents anyone but its authorized service centers from doing even simple repairs to its tractors. For some farmers, this practice has resulted in delays in planting, a particularly ominous prospect during a spring pandemic. Equally ominous, if not more so, is the prospect that in-house medical technicians — especially in hospitals in emerging markets — will not have access to repair documentation, software and tools in the midst of the pandemic.It's too late for manufacturers to provide more convenient, affordable and accessible repair options to most consumers and businesses during this pandemic. But there are some radical steps that could easily make a difference right now. For example, manufacturers of medical equipment such as ventilators should release repair guides for therapy devices to hospitals rather than forcing them to wait for a certified technician. Similarly, Deere and other farm equipment manufacturers should suspend their software locks for the 2020 planting season, at a minimum, to ensure that there’s no delay in servicing needed farm equipment. Finally, consumer electronics manufacturers, including Apple, should post information on how consumers can quickly obtain simple repairs like battery and screen replacements while authorized repair is unavailable.Longer-term, the states and federal government need to pass long-stalled “Right to Repair” legislation to expand access for all Americans. Key provisions include requirements that manufacturers make repair documentation for their products freely available, and sell parts and diagnostics to independent repair operations at a fair market price.Self-reliance has long been a part of the American self-image. Giving back the right to repair stuff is a good way to ensure it’s maintained during and after Covid-19.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Adam Minter is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-03-27	2020-03-27 12:09:17	DE	Deere & Company	What Made You Think the Rally Wouldn’t Get Sold?: Taking Stock	(Bloomberg) -- An 18% jump in three days would be great for the highest-beta asset, let alone a gauge of 500 of the largest companies in the U.S.The S&P 500 has gained that much since Tuesday, pushing through a number of resistance lines at light speed and clocking the biggest three-day run since 1933. The VIX Index, which measures projected volatility over the next 30 days, has lost half a point (or 1%) in the same time.Price swings aren’t likely to subside when investors are going through a range of conflicting emotions a dozen times a day. Millions have lost jobs, the economy is faltering and the U.S. now has more confirmed cases than any other country in the world. But a package of stimulus should provide some relief, and the market caps of companies have jumped by billions of dollars a day this week, recouping some of what they lost in recent, similar plunged.The same rally would look a lot more sustainable if the VIX was at 35 and not 60, Tallbacken Capital Advisors says.​Certainly, it’s a good to see half of the S&P’s industry groups up 20% or more since Tuesday and the Dow Jones up 21% during that time. But without concrete data on the state of corporate earnings and the economy, yet alone the ETA of a peak in the outbreak, it doesn’t mean all too much. Not a single stock in the Dow Jones is trading above its 50-day moving average, even as the index is on track for the best week since 1931. Caterpillar withdrew its financial outlook for the year and Boeing moved by tens of billions of dollars a day, showing the firm’s true value is a mystery.In and OutAnalysts will also have to square the stock market advance with data from EPFR Global that showed investors pulled $18.7 billion from U.S. equity funds in the week ending Wednesday, the biggest outflow since at least the beginning of the year.Futures are taking a breather with what has become a modest decline of 2.9% on Friday. Italian stocks fell the most in two weeks as the nation’s business newspaper reported, citing parliamentary documents, that the country may need new economic stimulus in addition to the package already discussed. China posted the biggest fall in industrial profits on record but the Shanghai Composite still eked out a gain.Today’s final University of Michigan consumer sentiment for March may offer a good view into how bad consumer spending may be in the coming months. Data on Thursday showing last week’s jobless claims quadrupled to a record 3.2 million all but guarantees spending will slow.So why did stocks rally after an unprecedented spike in jobless claims? Investors could’ve thought the terrible print is as bad as it’s going to get, or that weak economic releases in the weeks ahead are already factored in.On Tap For Next Week:And next week will be busy with economic announcements. We’ll get U.S. pending home sales on Monday, a measure of signed contracts (not closings) that’s a good leading indicator of closings that are at least one month out. Shortly after that we’ll get March Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity. But we’ll have to wait until Friday for the most important one -- the monthly jobs report.The jobs data is expected to show U.S. payrolls fell in a negative territory in March for the first time in almost a decade. Still, the figure surveys people on the second week of the month, in this case, before the surge in claims triggered by the nationwide shutdown, and won’t likely be a good indicator of the real state of events.“The April-May data will provide a clearer perspective on the extent of damage inflicted on the labor market,” says Bloomberg Economics’ Eliza Winger.Consumer confidence print on Tuesday will provide a good lens into how negative consumers’ opinions are on current economic conditions. And we’ll see a final PMI manufacturing print for March on Wednesday, together with ISM manufacturing, construction spending and mortgage applications.The week will be relatively light in terms of earnings, but Constellation Brands (before the bell on Friday) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (Thursday) will be the ones to keep an eye out for.Sectors in Focus:KB Home is up 8% after a blowout quarterly report after the bell Thursday. Watch peers for a reaction.Watch General Motors after the firm announced in a memo (described to Bloomberg News after the bell) that the firm’s salaried staff will have 20% of pay deferred starting April 1 through the fourth quarter of this year or first quarter of 2021, in a move to preserve cash.Lululemon reported an acceleration of sales growth in the latest quarter, but refrained from offering an outlook for the current year, in a move that caused a target price upgrade at Piper Sandler and a cut at Guggenheim.Notes From the Sell SideCaterpillar was cut to neutral from buy at BofA, which cited the heavy machinery company’s exposure to the energy sector, as well as uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus.The company recently pulled its forecast due to the pandemic, as have Cummins and Deere, “which only underscores the degree of demand and supply side uncertainty emanating from the COVID-19 outbreak.” Caterpillar “has a strong balance sheet and nearly 4% dividend yield, but so do a lot of other companies,” the firm wrote, adding that a strong yield “is not enough” in the current environment.Goldman sees a risk from Caterpillar’s energy exposure, noting that it has seen “one major capital spending cut after another from the large E&Ps, as well as pipeline project deferrals in the midstream space.”Separately, JPMorgan raised its view on Deere & Co., citing valuation after a recent pullback, though the firm continues to see risks for the machinery company.Analyst Ann Duignan remains “cautious on the structural challenges facing U.S. agriculture,” along with the impact of a strong dollar and ethanol fundamentals. However, Deere’s “balance sheets were in a strong position coming into this crisis and our revised [free cash flow] assumptions suggest they will still be in decent shape coming out of it.”PepsiCo was upgraded by two notches at Credit Suisse, to outperform from underperform, at Credit Suisse, which cited the food company’s valuation and “near, medium, and long-term drivers.” In the near-term, the pandemic “highlights defensive nature of PepsiCo,” including its “strong positions in water, sports drinks, juice brands and beneficiary from snack pantry loading.” Over the longer term, analyst Kaumil Gajrawala sees PEP’s beverage business improving.Tick-By-Tick to Today’s Actionable Events:8:00 Robert Kaplan, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President, on Bloomberg Radio8:30am -- Feb.

2020-03-24	2020-03-24 00:00:00	DE	Deere & Company	Tractor Makers Stung by Trade Wars Now Face Virus Cutbacks	(Bloomberg) -- Tractors and combines should be flying out of U.S. dealerships as farmers desperately need to replace an aging fleet. They’re not, and at the same time, production in Europe is being hampered by supply chain shortages.Welcome to the coronavirus conundrum. Dogged in the past year by trade war uncertainties and low crop prices that kept farmers from ponying up cash, the world’s big machinery companies are now struggling to deal with the ambiguity surrounding a deadly pandemic, unable to say how long it will last or how economically damaging it may be.The result: Both Deere & Co. and AGCO Corp. pulled their financial outlooks on Monday, and both said they were cutting back operations. For Deere, the decision comes just a month after it announced an unexpected earnings boost and maintained its annual outlook on early signs of stabilization in the U.S. farm sector. Now, with coronavirus sapping its ability to forecast the future with any confidence, the company is changing its path.“The market is pricing in meaningful downside” for machinery companies, “but a global pandemic has not occurred for over a 100 years, thus there is not much precedent to fall back on,” Mircea Dobre, senior research analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., said in a recent note.Already, large-tractor sales are 50% below their peak, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Normally, that would be a sign that much-needed buying should occur. Instead, as the U.S. starts shutting down to stem the virus’s spread, Deere said it is reducing some operations and closing others on a temporary basis, even though its industry has been federally designated in the U.S. as an essential infrastructure businesses. Further updates will be provided in the Company’s second-quarter earnings announcement and conference call scheduled for May 22, 2020, the company said.In February, Deere forecast an earnings range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion in a statement that made no mention of the coronavirus already erupting in China. That compared with an average estimate by analysts of $2.9 billion. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.63 a share for the first quarter, up from $1.54 a year earlier.In Europe, production has already been significantly reduced or suspended in several of AGCO facilities as the virus has raged across that continent, the company said in its statement. AGCO blamed that on shortages and constraints in the European supply chain. Additional production disruptions in other regions are expected, the statement said.Since the virus erupted in China, Deere has had a special crisis team of 10 people meeting daily on its impact, although everyone involved in global supply management is ultimately involved. Deere has also booked premium space on charter flights to obtain crucial parts directly from China, the company told Bloomberg in an email.In Brazil, a key market for global machinery makers, the coronavirus spread is leading to suspensions of agricultural fairs, worsening the outlook for sales. Rural fairs, events in the countryside where machinery makers can exhibit equipment, play an important role in machinery sales for companies. Last year, Agrishow, the biggest rural fair in the nation, totaled 3 billion reais in sales.Weak farm fundamentals and lack of detail on the phase-one U.S.-China trade deal are bearish factors for 2020. Longer term, though, the aging fleet and the world’s population growth will be supportive, according to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence. That will make adoption of high-tech and pricey precision agriculture methods and aftermarket services more important for profits.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tractor-makers-stung-trade-wars-000000696.html?.tsrc=rss

Germany said it was likely at the start of an epidemic, and 700 people remained confined in a hotel in Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands.In the U.S., President Donald Trump and federal health officials plan to brief the public Wednesday on efforts to prevent the spread of the pathogen.

St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M, which makes everything from dental equipment to Post-it notes, is the biggest supplier of the masks, which are widely used by health-care workers.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told a House panel Wednesday that the U.S. has about 12 million N95 respirators stockpiled currently, but would need significantly more in the event of an outbreak in the country.Azar Says 15th Case Confirmed in U.S. (2 p.m. NY)Azar said the U.S. has a 15th confirmed case of the coronavirus.

He told a House panel Wednesday that the administration is planning to spend “at least” that amount and would work with Congress on a final figure.“We’re trying to be flexible,” he said in response to questions.Azar on Tuesday faced critical questioning about the administration’s response from members of both parties at congressional hearings on Tuesday. Democrats responded with their own plans to respond to the virus. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday proposed $8.5 billion in spending for the virus response.

The aim is to help the U.S. company boost sales of it famous green and yellow John Deere tractors, a tough task in a continent with the world's highest poverty rate and the least mechanised agricultural sector.

2020-02-25	2020-02-25 11:40:17	DE	Deere & Company	John Deere hopes to break ground in Africa through tractor-hailing tech	"<p>John Deere, the world's leading manufacturer of farm equipment, is teaming up with Africa's ""Uber of tractors"" - betting on a future where farmers summon machines at the touch of a button.</p>
              <p>(SOUNDBITE) (English) JOHN DEERE'S HEAD OF AFRICA, JACQUES TAYLOR, SAYING:</p>
              <p>""We do like to see that every farmer has access to mechanization."" </p>
              <p>The American company is hoping to boost sales of its famous green and yellow tractors on the continent - via Hello Tractor's technology, a small black box allowing farmers to hail tractors, monitor their movements and transmit information such as fuel levels.</p>
              <p>It's currently being trailed on 400 tractors in Ghana and Kenya - but John Deere plans to offer it to all contractors who buy its equipment in Africa.</p>
              <p>But the risks are clear: held back by low incomes, tiny landholdings and a lack of bank financing, tractor numbers have long been stagnant on the continent.</p>
              <p>Jacques Taylor is John Deere's head of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
              <p>(SOUNDBITE) (English) JOHN DEERE'S HEAD OF AFRICA, JACQUES TAYLOR, SAYING:</p>

2020-02-21	2020-02-21 21:17:24	DE	Deere & Company	4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: WORK, GLD, DE, DBX	Stocks are under pressure on Friday, falling as coronavirus worries continue to weigh on equities and drive up safe-haven plays. That said, here's a look at some top stock trades for next week. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Slack (WORK)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comSlack (NYSE:WORK) is up more than 2% on the day, despite jumping more than 6% in pre-market trading on reports that Uber (NYSE:UBER) will move all of its employees onto the platform. WORK has had momentum after similar reports of IBM (NYSE:IBM) doing the same thing earlier this month.Slack's rally drew in sellers on Friday, but the stock is still looking better overall. Earlier this month, Slack broke out over the 100-day moving average, then held this mark as support on a pullback.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA few days later, it pushed above the $26 IPO price. Now, investors want to see it hold up above the $26 to $27 area. Above keeps Friday's high of day and $30-plus on the table.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy Increasing Their Dividends in 2020 Below this area and the 20-day moving average, though, and the 50-day and 100-day moving averages are on the table, with both near $23. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Gold ETF (GLD)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comThe SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD) remains red hot, as investors continue the flight-to-safety trade even as equities have done well the last few months.With Friday's gap up, the GLD is hitting new 52-week highs, while sporting an overbought condition on the relative strength index (RSI). The move caps six straight sessions with a gain, as GLD broke out over $150 this week.Just because shares are overbought, doesn't mean the stock can't run higher possibly to $160. However, investors may prefer to wait for a dip. Preferably, a drop down to the $150 breakout mark will be met with support -- a strong sign that bulls are still in control.It would also be attractive to see the 20-day moving average hold as support. Below both measures puts the 50-day moving average on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Deere (DE)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comShares of Deere (NYSE:DE) are hitting new annual highs on Friday, after surprisingly better-than-expected quarterly results. The stock is pushing through recent resistance near $177, but struggling to hold its gains above this mark.Above resistance puts a move up to $185-plus on the table. However, failure to close over resistance keeps downside levels in the realm of possibilities too.That would first put the 10-week moving average on the table near $172, followed by a slightly deeper dip down to the $161 to $163 area. There, Deere will find the 50-week moving average and uptrend support (blue line).After such a favorable reaction to earnings, I wouldn't normally look for such a pullback. But when considering current resistance along with the possibility of a larger market correction, these downside marks become possible.  * 3 Wild Stocks To Wrangle In This Bullish Market Overall, just stay open-minded and flexible. Let price be the guide, not opinion. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Dropbox (DBX)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comBucking the trend on Friday is Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), which is up 23% at one point after reporting earnings.The charts for this one are really interesting. With the move, shares are ripping through the 20-week moving average -- which roughly translates to the 100-day moving average. This measure has been resistance for several months now, stymieing each rally in DBX stock.Furthermore, the stock burst through the 50-week moving average and long-term downtrend resistance (blue line). One measure many investors are surely not considering is the newly established 100-week moving average, which just came into play at $23.76. Guess what Friday's high is so far? DBX came within 4 cents of that mark.On the upside, the 100-week moving average is now the mark to clear for more upside. If it can, $26 is on the table. On the downside, though, see that $20 to $21 holds as support. $21 is the IPO price for Dropbox, while this area also marks the 50-week moving average and backside of prior downtrend resistance.The chart for DBX is my favorite from this week, purely from a technical perspective. However, that doesn't mean it's the best buy or anything like that. Just pure technicals that make it a fun one to study.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-02-21	2020-02-21 19:17:02	DE	Deere & Company	Coronavirus Caution Keeps High-Flying Deere’s Feet on the Ground	(Bloomberg) -- If there was one dark cloud in Deere & Co.’s otherwise stellar quarterly earnings it was how much the coronavirus outbreak could weigh on the machinery giant’s customers and suppliers in the coming months.Deere surprised investors Friday by delivering profit growth and pointing to green shoots in farmer confidence after two years of being hammered by trade wars and wild weather. Its shares surged the most in three years to a record.But on a call with company executives, analysts asked what was behind the decision not to raise its earnings outlook. One reason for the cautious approach is the deadly virus that’s disrupted trade, transport, labor and industry.The company is working on contingencies to ensure it can get parts to facilities in case the outbreak impacts its suppliers in China, executives said on the call. They flagged a $40 million expense for expedited air freight that will hit in the second quarter. Less of a concern are Deere’s sales in the Asian nation, although road building there has been affected.“Even with the beating of the quarter and a lower tax rate, they do seem to be little bit more cautious partially due to the $40 million,” Ashish Gupta, senior machinery analyst at Stephens Inc., said after the earnings call.While the phase one trade deal between Beijing and Washington has improved farmer confidence, it’s still too early to provide forecasts on China’s agriculture purchases as overall activity has slowed in the Asian country, Deere said.Deere maintained its fiscal 2020 net income guidance, forecasting a range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion. That compares with the $2.9 billion average analyst estimate.The company’s cautiously optimistic view on agriculture was supported by government crop projections released Friday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects American soybean stockpiles to sink to pre-trade war levels as China comes back into the market.To contact the reporter on this story: Laura Yin in Seattle at yyin26@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net, Simon CaseyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-caution-keeps-high-flying-191702358.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-21	2020-02-21 14:40:28	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Surges Most Since 2016 on Surprise Growth in Farm Recovery	(Bloomberg) -- Machinery giant Deere & Co. delivered an unexpected increase in earnings and maintained its annual outlook as early signs of stabilization in the U.S. farm sector offset a slowdown in construction. Shares rose the most in three years.“Farmer confidence, though still subdued, has improved due in part to hopes for a relaxation of trade tensions and higher agricultural exports,” Chief Executive Officer John May said in a statement accompanying its fiscal first quarter results.While the CEO didn’t mention the coronavirus in the statement, his comments may help ease concerns about how much the outbreak will delay China’s return to U.S. agricultural markets as laid out in the phase one trade deal. The tit-for-tat tariff spat with China made American farmers cautious on replacing large equipment, Deere’s top moneymaker.The company’s shares were up 8.1% at 9:37 a.m. in New York, erasing losses earlier this year and heading for the steepest daily advance since November 2016. Investors will be looking for more detail on the company’s prospects for this year in light of coronavirus on a conference call scheduled for 10 a.m. in New York.Deere maintained its fiscal 2020 guidance, forecasting a range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion. That compares with the $2.9 billion average analyst estimate.The company’s cautiously optimistic view on agriculture was supported by government crop projections released Friday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects American soybean stockpiles to sink to pre-trade war levels as China comes back into the market.Still, fundamentals for American farming remain challenged with increasing competition from South America and the Black Sea region compounded by a strong dollar. Two of Deere’s peers issued disappointing 2020 outlooks. A survey released Thursday indicated that more than half of U.S. farmers said they planned to spend less on capital equipment this year.As Deere reduces production to work through excess inventory and faces weaker demand, Bloomberg Intelligence expects a slow start to fiscal 2020. The company said it’s proceeding with measures to create a more focused organizational structure.Precision Ag“The Coronavirus has driven investors to a defensive positioning in machinery and Deere has been the defensive play,” Stephens analyst Ashish Gupta said in a Feb. 18 report. “The long-term thesis centers around Deere coming out the farm machinery winner due to investments in precision ag and we do not think an F1Q results shortfall is likely to change that.”Deere reported adjusted earnings of $1.63 a share for the quarter, up from $1.54 a year ago. The average analyst estimate was $1.25. The result was helped by a tax benefit. Sales fell 6%, dragged down by lower construction shipment volume and unfavorable currency effects.“We expect a positive stock reaction as we think full-year EPS estimates are likely to move higher,” Citigroup Inc. analysts said.(Updates with shares in first and fourth paragraphs)To contact the reporter on this story: Laura Yin in Seattle at yyin26@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net, Lynn ThomassonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-beats-estimates-maintains-guidance-120856418.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-14	2020-02-14 03:24:41	DE	Deere & Company	Trump’s Fed Nominee Shelton Faces Doubts Among GOP Senators	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s pick for the Federal Reserve Board, Judy Shelton, came under fire from Republican lawmakers on Thursday, signaling trouble ahead for her nomination.Speaking to reporters after a Senate Banking Committee hearing on her appointment, Senators Richard Shelby from Alabama, Patrick Toomey from Pennsylvania and John Kennedy from Louisiana all said they had not decided if they would vote for her confirmation.A single Republican “no” vote on the committee is enough to block the Shelton nomination, assuming Democrats -- who were pointed in their criticism of her at the hearing -- are united in opposition.“I think the Fed should be independent and we should have mainstream people on there,” Shelby, the committee’s longest-serving member, told reporters. “I don’t think she’s a mainstream economist. She’s different. Another voice.”While the White House expressed confidence that Shelton would be confirmed, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday night that Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, would be pressing members of the committee to approve her nomination.The former economic adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign is a controversial pick because of her past comments on the gold standard, the dollar, and whether the Fed’s congressional mandate to pursue maximum employment and stable prices is meaningful.Shelton’s confirmation could place a Trump loyalist at the very heart of the central bank as she’s publicly supported the president’s policies. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed and its chairman, Jerome Powell, for not doing more to boost the economy. If the president is re-elected in November and Shelton joins the board, she could be Trump’s pick to succeed Powell as chair in 2022.Speaking to reporters outside the hearing room, Toomey said Shelton’s answers didn’t eliminate his concerns about her, adding that he hasn’t made up his mind whether to support her nomination. During his questioning of her, he voiced concern about what he saw as Shelton’s past suggestions that the Fed respond to other countries’ attempts to devalue their currencies by pursuing a similar path of its own.“I just want to stress this is a dangerous path to go down,” Toomey said.While saying that Shelton was academically qualified for the Fed job, Shelby said in the hearing he was troubled by some of her past writings and questioned her on whether she backs a return to the gold standard as a value of money.“You never go back with money,” Shelton replied, adding that it can be beneficial to look at something that worked in past decades.Trump’s other Fed nominee, economist Christopher Waller, faced few questions at the hearing. He is a Ph.D. economist and head of research at the St. Louis Fed.‘Nutty Ideas’Kennedy said he wasn’t bothered by apparent shifts in some of Shelton’s views.“At the same time, and I’m not suggesting this is the case with either one of the nominees, nobody wants anybody on the Federal Reserve that has a fatal attraction to nutty ideas,” he told reporters.QuickTake: What Trump Can (And Can’t) Do to Steer Fed PolicyResponding to questions about whether Shelton’s nomination was in jeopardy, White House spokesman Judd Deere said “the nominations of Judy Shelton and Christopher Waller are not being pulled. Both were in front of the Banking Committee today and the White House expects both to be confirmed by the Senate to the Federal Reserve.”Fed IndependenceShelton answered multiple challenges on her allegiance during the hearing, saying: “I pledge to be independent in my decision making. Frankly, no one tells me what to do.”She also came under fire from Democrats about her suitability for the role. Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, pressed Shelton on her controversial views in his opening remarks at the hearing.“Ms. Shelton has too many alarming ideas,” Brown said, adding that she’s also “flip flopped” on her views. “A vote for Ms. Shelton is a vote against Fed independence,” he said.Panel chairman Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho, closed the meeting with some words of support for Shelton, telling her “you have been very solid in defending your writing and your positions.”He later told reporters that a committee vote on the nominations was possible after Congress returns from next week’s recess, but he wasn’t sure.“I’m going to see how it plays out.”(Updates with Larry Kudlow’s involvement, in fifth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Max Reyes, Steve Matthews, Rich Miller, Justin Sink and Saleha Mohsin.To contact the reporters on this story: Craig Torres in Washington at ctorres3@bloomberg.net;Christopher Condon in Washington at ccondon4@bloomberg.net;Erik Wasson in Washington at ewasson@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, John HarneyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-fed-nominee-judy-shelton-154904254.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-30	2020-01-30 14:26:19	DE	Deere & Company	Virus Raises Worry China Won’t Meet U.S. Trade-Deal Pledges	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. China’s promises in its phase-one trade deal to increase purchases from the U.S. -- which experts already were calling unrealistic -- will be even tougher to fulfill now that a new virus is hammering demand and interfering with supply chains.In the first year of the deal, which takes effect in mid-February, China committed to buy an extra $76.7 billion worth of American goods beyond what it purchased in 2017, and an additional $123.3 billion in the second year. The agreement signed just over two weeks ago marked an easing in tensions that flared as the world’s two largest economies waged a trade war.As the novel coronavirus spreads, attention is focusing on a part of the agreement which states the U.S. and China will consult “in the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event” delays either nation from complying with the agreement.“It obviously is going to have some ramifications economy-wide, which we hope will not inhibit the purchase goal that we have for this year,” U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Wednesday. “We’ll have to look ahead and see.But the honest answer is we just don’t know yet. But we’re hoping for a very quick conclusion.”The deadly virus may push jobs back to the U.S., Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.“Well, first of all, every American’s heart has to go out to the victims of the coronavirus,” Ross said during an interview on Fox Business Network Thursday. “I don’t want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease. But the fact is, it does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain, on top of all the other things.”“I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America. Some to U.S. Probably some to Mexico as well.”The health crisis has hit financial and commodity markets in recent days.China’s yuan sank through 7 per dollar Thursday, breaching that threshold for the first time this year. The spread between U.S. 10-year Treasury yields and three-month OIS rates turned negative, inverting the yield curve for the first time since October. Futures prices for soybeans -- a key component of China’s import commitments in the deal -- fell for an eighth straight day, the longest skid in almost two months.Meanwhile, economists are ratcheting up their estimates of the blow to economic growth. Nomura International Ltd. says the drag could exceed that seen during the SARS outbreak of 2003.So far, the world’s two biggest economies seem more focused on measures to prevent the spread of the disease.“The U.S. and China are in close coordination on the coronavirus and protecting the public health of both countries,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said. “The president appreciates President Xi’s cooperation.”(Updates with comments from commerce secretary in fifth paragraph)To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: James Mayger in Beijing at jmayger@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeffrey Black at jblack25@bloomberg.net, Malcolm Scott, Michael S.

2020-01-27	2020-01-27 17:30:36	DE	Deere & Company	Sonos Should Give Up Hardware-Only Business Model	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- How long should a manufacturer be responsible for maintaining support for legacy products? Consumer devices have increasingly become smart and connected, only to later be abandoned by the manufacturer. Smart suitcases have turned dumb, talking toys gone mute, and wireless security cameras bricked into paperweights. Most recently, Sonos got a lot of grief for announcing that older versions of their smart home speakers would soon lose access to services and functionality. Customers complained that they had spent thousands on their audio systems, with some products still on the market as recently as 2015.A hardware device is a one-time purchase, while software updates require continuous labor. As technology improves and devices last longer, the initial manufacturing cost may end up being a small proportion of the total lifetime cost of production. Many manufacturers have shifted to business models that treat the device sale as a loss leader for future revenue streams. Amazon can afford to underprice the Echo because it enables consumers to buy more stuff from Amazon, Google and Spotify teamed up to give away Google Home Minis, and even Apple recently lowered prices on its iPhones to grow a user base for its subscription services.At the more controversial end of the spectrum, companies like John Deere have used the Digital Millenium Copyright Act to legally prevent users from repairing their own equipment, forcing their customers to continue paying into a lucrative repair market.Sonos boxed itself into a corner early on by promising customers free software updates for life. As CEO Patrick Spence testified at a Congressional hearing earlier this month, “Our business model is simple — we sell products which people pay for once, and we make them better over time with software updates.”The company is in a particularly difficult position because Sonos began as a home audio company before the advent of smart home assistants. Its earliest speakers weren’t designed with the processing power and storage required to take advantage of today’s features. To minimize complexity, Sonos designed its audio system so that all devices in a home network would share the same software. Once one product is no longer eligible for updates, the whole setup would stop receiving updates. Sonos customers lodged public complaints and bullied the company into submission. Sonos promised to keep the updates coming.A better long-term solution for the company might be found by looking to a different coalition of rebellious customers: a group that has been quietly reverse-engineering their speakers to liberate them from the company’s software entirely. It’s not an easy task. A Sonos speaker integrates a speaker and a microprocessor running a proprietary operating system. In order to jailbreak the speaker, a user must gain access to the internal hardware and install their own software.It would no doubt please these customers were Sonos to make their legacy speakers open source. Sonos has already indicated that the company can remotely erase the software; it could similarly perform a remote reinstallation of an open-source operating system like Linux or Android. The company’s tech-savvy fans could then continue to improve the software — which could be downloaded by other users — while Sonos focuses on its core competency of manufacturing high-end speakers.In the future, device manufacturers may be less generous about promising a lifetime of free software support. After all, most technological improvements these days are done in software. When it comes to cars, the internal combustion engine hasn’t changed much since fuel injectors were introduced in the 1980s. The performance improvements seen in recent decades have come from better sensors and smarter software to interpret sensor data.Autonomous vehicles will have an even tougher sell, as it’s inevitable that self-driving technology will continue to improve after initial release. Will further updates be free, or will the vehicle manufacturer hold consumer safety for ransom?While it’s easy to insist that customers should have free access to software updates running on devices they rightfully own, it’s hard to reconcile a sustainable business model with a lifetime of free software. A device that requires a paid subscription or leaves software updates as an exercise for the customer is better than one that turns into a brick.To contact the author of this story: Elaine Ou at elaine@globalfinancialaccess.comTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Sarah Green Carmichael at sgreencarmic@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Elaine Ou is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2019-12-02	2019-12-02 15:07:00	DE	Deere & Company	Deere shares fall in early trade after BofA Merrill Lynch downgrade	Shares of agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co.  slid about 1.5% Monday, after BofA Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral following a disappointing earnings report and softer-than-expected guidance. Analysts led by Ross Gilardi lowered their stock price target to $150 from $175. &quot;The set-up on agriculture into next year is very challenging, and there is no guarantee that FY20 is necessarily the bottom if US farmers respond with higher corn and soybean plantings,&quot; they wrote. &quot;Deere also seems late in cutting production on construction equipment.&quot; The company's agriculture and turf division is suffering from steadily eroding margins, offsetting the good news in precision agriculture, said the note. Agriculture and turf margins have fallen for five straight quarters, predating the large production cuts in North America in the second half of 2019. &quot;Deere supposedly had worked through supply chain efficiencies earlier in the year, but continued to blame higher production costs and SG&A in FQ4,&quot; said the note. &quot;Now competitor CNH  is getting a lot more focused on precision agriculture. End result, positive margin benefits of precision ag probably remain invisible to the casual glance until at least FY21-22.&quot; Deere shares have gained 11% in 2019, while the S&P 500  has gained 25%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/75454678-a917-3184-a4ff-15a901459452/deere-shares-fall-in-early.html?.tsrc=rss

Prime Minister Boris Johnson broke away from the general election campaign to rush back to his Downing Street offices, and will chair an emergency “Cobra” meeting this evening.Key Developments:Police shoot dead male terror suspect after stabbing in London Bridge at about 2 p.m.Two civilians killed in the attack, three being treated in hospital, police saidOfficers say suspect had a hoax bomb strapped to his bodyJohnson returned from his constituency to Number 10 for updates on incident; will chair emergency ‘Cobra’ meeting at 9:30 p.m.Labour suspends election campaigning in London on FridaySecurity strengthened around British capital, with more armed police deployed after terrorist attackPolice Trying to Identity Victims (8:25 p.m.)Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said officers are still working to identify the people killed in Friday’s terrorist attack and that three others are being treated in the hospital. ‘Our counter-terrorists detectives will be working around the clock to identify those who have lost their lives, to support all the victims and their families,” she said.“We will be working as fast as we can to understand who this man is, where he comes from and whether there is anyone else who we need to find quickly,” Dick said. She said she expects police cordons to remain in the area “for some time.”Dick said the attack started at Fishmonger’s Hall, a livery company building on the north side of London Bridge, and said members of the public had shown “extraordinary courage stepping in to tackle this attacker.”U.K. Police Confirm Two Dead (8:15 p.m.)U.K. police confirmed two members of the public died in the terror attack on London Bridge. “As well as the suspect, who was shot dead by police, two of those injured in this attack in the London Bridge area have tragically lost their lives,” Cressida Dick, Metropolitan Police commissioner, said in a statement outside the London police service’s headquarters.“My heart goes out to their loved ones and to the three further injured victims who I understand are being treated at hospital,” she said. “The empty ideology of terror offers nothing but terror and today I urge everybody to reject that.”Johnson Cancels Saturday Campaign Events (7:50 p.m.)Prime Minister Boris Johnson canceled his planned events for campaigning in the election on Saturday, a Tory official said. He will focus instead on the government’s response to the London Bridge attack.The premier will lead a meeting of the government’s emergency “Cobra” committee at 9:30 p.m., his office said. He called Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to discuss the incident earlier on Friday.Labour Suspends London Campaigning (6:50 p.m.)Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn suspended his party’s campaigning in London for Friday evening as he called on the U.K.’s “democratic process not to be derailed by terror.”“We are suspending campaigning in London tonight as a mark of respect for those who suffered in this attack,” Corbyn said in an emailed statement. “We will not be cowed by those who threaten us. We must and we will stand together to reject hatred and division.”Earlier Conservative leader Boris Johnson suspended his own campaigning for Friday evening.Two People Dead After Attack: BBC (6:36 p.m.)Two members of the public have died after the London Bridge attack, the BBC reported, citing a government source.Earlier the police said several people had been injured during the stabbing at a premises near London Bridge. A spokeswoman for the Met Police was unable to confirm the report.Johnson Praises Civilians Who Stopped Attacker (5:45 p.m.)Boris Johnson vowed to bring all involved in the attack to justice, promising the U.K. will not be intimidated by terrorism.“Anybody involved in this crime and these attacks will be hunted down and will be brought to justice,” Johnson said in a pooled TV clip. “This country will never be cowed or divided or intimidated by this sort of attack, and our values -- our British values -- will prevail.”Johnson said he would stop his own campaigning this evening and he would be reviewing the matter in the next few hours. In the middle of the 2017 election, campaigning was suspended across all parties after a terrorist attack.“I urge everyone to be vigilant and one cannot help but think back to what happened in 2017 in a similar part of the city, and I hope people as fast as possible will be able to go back to their business,” he said.Mayor Urges Londoners to ‘Stand Resolute’ (4:55 p.m.)Mayor of London Sadiq Khan called on his city to “stand united and resolute in the face of terror” in the aftermath of the “cowardly and evil” attack.Khan praised the “breathtaking heroism from members of the public who literally ran towards the danger, not knowing what confronted them.” he said they didn’t know the bomb strapped to the suspect was a hoax. “They really are the best of us, another example of the bravery and heroism of ordinary Londoners running towards danger, risking their own personal safety to try and save others,” he said.“I’m mayor of the greatest city in the world -- one of our strengths is our diversity,” he told journalists outside the Metropolitan Police headquarters. “We do know there are people out there who hate our diversity, who hate what we stand for and are trying to seek to divide us.”Khan said the attack on London Bridge “appeared to be an isolated incident,” and the police aren’t looking for any other suspects.Trump Pledges Support to U.K. (4:40 p.m.)U.S. President Donald Trump condemned the violence on London Bridge and offered his country’s full support, a spokesman said.“President Trump has been briefed on this morning’s attack at the London Bridge and is monitoring the situation,” said Judd Deere, deputy press secretary at the White House. “The United States strongly condemns all horrific acts of violence on innocent people, and we pledge our full support to our Ally, the United Kingdom.”Trump is due to visit the U.K. next week for a NATO summit.Police: London Bridge Attack Was Terrorism (4:24 p.m.)U.K. police confirmed they had shot dead one male suspect and declared the attack a terrorist incident. “I’m now in a position to confirm that it has been declared a terrorist incident,” said Neil Basu, Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner, in a statement outside the London police service’s headquarters. “I must stress we retain an open mind as to any motive. It would be inappropriate to speculate further at this time.”He added the police believe the item strapped to the body of the suspect was a hoax explosive device.Police Ordered Diners to Flee (4 p.m.)The streets around London Bridge were locked down and armed police cleared restaurants and shops in the area. Officers are treating the incident as terror-related “as a precaution,” although the circumstances are still unclear, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.During the incident on Friday, armed officers burst into restaurants in the Borough Market area at London Bridge and urged diners to leave as fast as possible. They shouted “Out, out, out,” to people at the Black and Blue bar. Diners walked away with their hands on their heads. Nearby, police shouted to pedestrians to “run.”Officers closed off the bridge and evacuated passers-by from the surrounding area. On the north bank of the River Thames, police officers shouted to pedestrians to move back from the bridge 100 meters, and then urged them to take shelter in any nearby building, shouting: “Move inside for your own safety.”Incident Revives Memories of 2017 Attack (3:45 p.m.)The same area of London was the scene of a terrorist attack just a few days before the general election in June 2017 in which eight people were killed and 48 injured. Three Islamist terrorists drove a van at pedestrians on the bridge before arming themselves with knives and running into Borough Market, where they stabbed people in restaurants and pubs. Armed police responded and killed the attackers.Johnson returning to Central London (3:35 p.m.)Boris Johnson is returning to his office in central London after police shot a man at London Bridge and a number of people were injured.“The prime minister is on his way back to No 10 from his constituency where he will receive further updates on the London Bridge incident,” Johnson’s spokesman James Slack said in a statement.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also expressed his concern. “Shocking reports from London Bridge. My thoughts are with those caught up in the incident. Thank you to the police and emergency services who are responding,” he said on Twitter.Johnson Being Kept Updated on London Incident (3:10 p.m.)Boris Johnson said he’s being kept informed about the unfolding incident at London Bridge, in which there have been reports of gunshots and stabbings. Police said they are “currently responding to this incident as though it is terror-related.”Armed police locked down the bridge and evacuated the area. The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that after being called to a stabbing at a premises nearby, they had detained one man. A number of people have been injured, they said.“I’m being kept updated on the incident at London Bridge and want to thank the police and all emergency services for their immediate response,” Johnson said on Twitter.Home Secretary Priti Patel also posted on Twitter, saying she’s “very concerned by ongoing incident at London Bridge. My thoughts are with all affected.” She urged people to follow the advice of the police. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he’s in “close contact” with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner.Corbyn in Fresh Attack on Billionaires (12:45 p.m.)Jeremy Corbyn opened a new broadside on billionaires opposing his plans for a re-distributive socialist economy after The Daily Mail and General Trust bought the i newspaper in a 50 million pound deal ($64.5 million).“Two billionaire press barons now own half of the top 10 daily newspapers,” Corbyn said in a posting on Twitter. “Remember this when they attack Labour’s plan to make the super-rich pay their fair share.”“We are committed to preserving its distinctive, high quality and politically independent editorial style,” DMGT said in a statement on its acquisition of the i newspaper.Free Trade Group Attacks State Aid Proposals (12:20 p.m.)The Adam Smith Institute, a think tank aimed at promoting free trade which had close links with former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said it was disappointed with Boris Johnson’s plan to change state aid rules and procurement provisions to make it easier to support British companies, calling it a “form of Trumpian protectionism.”“We shouldn’t free ourselves from the European Union in order to just enslave ourselves to the whims of Whitehall,” said Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute. “Making a profit is a proof of the value added to society, and there must be no business that is too big to fail.”Tories Pledge Tougher Foreign Takeover Rules (12:05 p.m.)The Conservatives plan to strengthen protections against foreign takeovers of British companies, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said, in answer to a question about Chinese investment in the U.K.“We certainly don’t believe that the current provisions which are in place are robust enough,” Gove said at a press conference. He said he’s undertaken to “strengthen” a unit in his department that examines foreign takeovers, and “strengthen protections in the future.”Speaking alongside him, Boris Johnson agreed, before saying the country must strike a “balance” between “continuing to be open to investment from China” and making sure the U.K. doesn’t do anything “that prejudices our critical national infrastructure, our security, or do anything that would compromise our ability to cooperate with five-eyes security partners.”“Those are the parameters,” Johnson said. “I am very, very far from a Sinophobe. I want to have good relations with China, but there are clear difficulties and clear boundaries that we have to set.”U.K.’s No-Deal Preparations to Continue (12 p.m.)Boris Johnson confirmed the U.K. will continue to make preparations for a disorderly exit from the European Union. “Of course the preparations will remain extant,” he said. “There’s no reason to dismantle them.”He described the preparations which he put in place prior to the Oct. 31 deadline as being “thoroughly useful” in achieving the deal made with the EU, as it convinced Brussels the U.K. was “in earnest” about leaving.Johnson said he is confident of completing a deal with the EU by the end of 2020 and “sees no reason” to extend that deadline, meaning the U.K. crashing out without a deal is still a possibility.State Aid Plan Compatible With EU: Johnson (11:50 a.m.)Taking questions from the press after his speech, Boris Johnson said that “of course” the U.K.’s new state aid rules (see 11:35 a.m.) would be compatible with those of the European Union, dismissing the idea that they could endanger a new free trade deal with the bloc.“Were there to be any issues arising, then as you know, under any big free trade deal, there’s a joint committee to arbitrate on whether some unfair subsidy or dispensation has been made,” Johnson said. “But it would be a committee of sovereign equals.”Johnson later said he believed in competition and in a “level playing field.”Tories Vow to Change Public Procurement (11:40 a.m)The Tories vowed to break away from EU state aid rules that the party said have a “chilling effect” on government support for industry, because of the need to wait for “months or years” for decisions on whether measures by member states are permissible or not.Existing rules “mean that the U.K. government cannot take steps to quickly and effectively help companies that are in danger,” the Conservative Party said in the statement. New rules will be developed in consultation with British businesses, it said.The Tories promised a new state aid system that sets out clear principles when the government will intervene, based on the U.K.’s needs. Ministers will have “more discretion” over decisions, which they will be able to take within “days.” A new government body would be set up to manage the system, the party said.On public procurement, the Tories pledged to ditch “absurdly complex” EU rules with their “pointless tendering requirements.” It also promised “simpler and cheaper” regulations that are “geared towards supporting local business and promoting British business.” The new system will be in place by Jan. 2021.Tories Announce State Aid Plans (11:35 a.m.)The Conservatives unveiled a package of measures that they described as “immediate steps to realize the benefits of Brexit,” including a pledge to overhaul the country’s state aid system to make it “faster and easier for the government to intervene to protect jobs when an industry is in trouble.”A Tory government will also change public procurement policy to support local businesses and promote a “buy British” approach for public bodies that purchase food, in an effort to back farmers, the party said in an email.“People voted to take back control -- and we want to deliver that change,” Johnson said in a statement. “One of the crucial ways we will do that is by improving our rules so that we can back British businesses and unleash their true potential.”Stuart Tells Labour Voters to Back Johnson (11:30 a.m.)Gisela Stuart, the former Labour MP who helped run the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum, urged traditional Labour voters to back the Conservatives in what she called the Dec. 12 “Brexit election.”“Voting for Brexit this time does not make me a Tory now or in the future,” Stuart said as she stood alongside Johnson and Michael Gove. “Rather, it is the best option.”Labour Step Up Pressure Over Johnson Comments (10:40 a.m.)Labour criticized Prime Minister Boris Johnson over past remarks he made about single mothers in a column from the 1990s (See 10 a.m.)“Boris Johnson’s refusal to apologize for his hateful comments about single mothers, their children and working class men is an absolute disgrace,” Labour’s education spokeswoman, Angela Rayner, who has herself been a single mother, said in a statement. “He tried to deny what he wrote, but the evidence is there in black and white for us all to see, proving once again that he’s a liar as well as a sexist.”Johnson Signals to Trump to Stay Quiet (10:15 a.m.)Ahead of Donald Trump’s visit to the U.K. next week, Boris Johnson said the two allies “traditionally” do not get involved in each others’ domestic politics -- an apparent signal to the U.S. president not to say anything that could potentially undermine the Conservative Party’s election campaign.“We have very close relationships with the United States at every level of government, but what we don’t do traditionally -- as loving allies and friends -- is get involved in each other’s election campaigns,” Johnson told LBC radio.The comment comes amid Tory party fears of an intervention by the president in the run-up to the Dec. 12 vote. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is using Johnson’s links to the president and pursuit of a post-Brexit U.S. trade as a central attack line in the campaign, especially on the potential dangers to Britain’s state-run National Health Service.Johnson pointed out that former President Barack Obama’s intervention in the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign didn’t help the government’s argument for staying in the European Union. Obama’s comments were “not entirely conducive to the good of that cause,” he said.Johnson Under Fire for Controversial Comments (10 a.m.)Boris Johnson said the quotation of comments from his newspaper columns about Muslims, black people and single mothers were a “distortion” of his true views. In a 1995 article republished this week, he blamed single mothers for “producing a generation of ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate children.”“These are 25 year old quotations culled from articles written before I was even in politics,” Johnson said in response to an angry call from a single mother to a phone-in on LBC. “Almost invariably when you look at these articles what the actual piece is saying the opposite of what is claimed.” Johnson also refused to say how many children he has and whether he is involved in all of their lives.The description of single mothers was not the first time Johnson’s comments have attracted condemnation. He has previously come under fire for referring to black people as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles,” while last year he used the terms “bank robber” and “letterbox” to describe Muslim women who wear burqas.Johnson also refused to say whether Jacob Rees-Mogg would still be in his cabinet if he wins the election after the leader of the House of Commons suggested people could have survived the Grenfell Tower fire if they’d shown “common sense” to escape. “I’m not going to get into measuring up the curtains type conversations,” Johnson said.Johnson Defends Tory Plans on NHS (9:40 a.m.)During his Q&A appearance on LBC radio, Boris Johnson was repeatedly challenged on his Conservative Party’s plans for the National Health Service. He acknowledged that a pledge to add 50,000 nurses actually includes persuading 19,000 to stay in the profession -- a discrepancy that opposition parties have said shows the Tories are misleading voters.“I do understand the controversy about this,” Johnson said, referring to the 19,000 figure. “The risk is that they will leave the profession and we’re putting in the funds to ensure they will stay.”Britain’s beloved state-run NHS is a key battleground in the election campaign after Labour accused Johnson of using it as a bargaining chip in talks with the U.S. on a post-Brexit trade deal. The prime minister reiterated on Friday that’s not the case, calling it “Bermuda Triangle stuff” from Corbyn’s party.Johnson was also on the back foot over his widely disputed plan to build 40 new hospitals, with opposition parties arguing the real number is only six. The prime minister was forced to acknowledge that some voters will not regard hospital refurbishments and upgrades as new hospitals. He also said the Conservative manifesto does not include a plan to resolve the crisis in social care because the precise details have not been “thrashed out” -- despite it being a key pledge in his first speech as prime minister.Johnson: Working on ‘About a Dozen’ Trade Deals (9:15 a.m.)Boris Johnson could not give a figure for how many trade deals the U.K. has ready ahead of its departure from the EU. “I can’t give the answer to how many deals are actually formalized,” he said in a phone-in with listeners on LBC radio. “There are a number that are virtually ready to go.”“I imagine we have about a dozen we’re currently working on,” he said, naming China, India, New Zealand and Australia as examples.If his Conservative Party wins a working majority, the U.K. will leave the EU on Jan. 31, Johnson said. A trade deal will also be agreed with the bloc by the end of 2020, he said: “I see no reason to go beyond that deadline,” he told listeners.Williamson Denies Tory Threat to Channel 4 (9 a.m.)Education Secretary Gavin Williamson denied the Conservative Party is threatening to review Channel 4’s broadcasting license following its decision not to allow Cabinet minister Michael Gove to sub in for Boris Johnson in a leaders’ debate on climate change on Thursday.Speaking on BBC radio, Williamson said the party has raised a complaint with the broadcasting regulator Ofcom. The row came after Johnson declined to appear in the debate, sending Gove in his place. Channel 4 refused to allow Gove, who appeared at the venue with his own television crew, to take part -- on the basis that the invitation was to the leaders of the political parties.“The Conservative Party isn’t threatening Channel 4, we’re raising a complaint with Ofcom which is perfectly legitimate,” Williamson said. “Frankly they reduced the quality of the debate that happened yesterday by refusing to let Michael Gove go on.” The Telegraph cited a source in the Tory party it didn’t identify as saying Channel 4’s public broadcasting license is under threat.McDonnell: Johnson ‘Running Scared’ (Earlier)Labour economy spokesman John McDonnell said Boris Johnson is “running scared” from scrutiny after the prime minister refused to attend a leaders debate on climate change on Thursday evening. He has also refused to be interviewed by Andrew Neil, who has the reputation of being one of the BBC’s most forensic interviewers.“The reason he is doing it is because he thinks like, you know, his Bullingdon Club friends, that they’re above the rest of us,” McDonnell said. “Because he knows that Andrew Neil will take him apart. He’s running scared. But even if he does it now, he’s played you because he’s pushing it later and later beyond the postal vote returns.”The Conservatives wrote to OfCom, the media regulator, on Thursday evening to complain that Channel 4, the host of the climate debate, had replaced Johnson with a melting ice sculpture during the debate.Labour is not changing its strategy, McDonnell said, denying reports that the party is switching its focus to leave voting areas after polling showed that it was set to lose seats in its north of England hearltlands.Earlier:The Tories Secretly Fear Trump Could Wreck Johnson’s ElectionU.K. Consumer Confidence Lowest Heading Into Election Since 2010Johnson Warns Against Complacency Over Lead: U.K. Campaign TrailTories Riled After Iceblock Replaces U.K. PM in Climate Debate&#92;--With assistance from Alex Morales, Stuart Biggs, Eddie Spence and Kitty Donaldson.To contact the reporters on this story: Greg Ritchie in London at gritchie10@bloomberg.net;Jessica Shankleman in London at jshankleman@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Thomas PennyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnson-warns-against-complacency-over-090218476.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-27	2019-11-27 16:37:31	DE	Deere & Company	Deere's Dour Outlook Tests Faith in Manufacturing Rebound	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Deere & Co. results show the trouble with reading the economic tea leaves.The maker of tractors and construction equipment slumped on Wednesday after announcing a depressed outlook for fiscal 2020 that caught investors off guard. Deere expects net income to be no higher than $3.1 billion next year, a decline relative to 2019 and well below the $3.46 billion analysts had been modeling. Here was investors’ response:The root of the disappointment is Deere’s expectation that global agricultural and turf equipment sales will slump 5% to 10% next year. Heading into earnings, there was optimism that Deere might even see growth in that division, should the prospect of a trade deal and the Trump administration’s plans to pump financial support into the farming industry incentivize growers to finally swap out aging equipment. Indeed, data released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed that capital spending excluding aircraft increased in October by the most since the start of the year, adding credence to the idea that the slowdown in industrial growth is bottoming out.With the trade war still lingering in the background, though, it appears Deere CEO John May isn’t banking on much of anything. That seems the prudent path to take. For one, May only just ascended to the CEO role this month and is likely disinclined to set goals he can’t guarantee in such an uncertain environment (3M Co.’s Michael Roman, who’s cut guidance an absurd number of times in his short tenure, should probably take note). But even CEOs who have been around for a while would have trouble predicting how their customers will act six to nine months down the road. This industrial downturn has been different from others in that it’s not a function of supply-and-demand dynamics but of political uncertainty. Manufacturing data can naturally be lumpy given the volatile timing of big projects, or in the case of this year, the General Motors Co. labor strike. But the unpredictable nature of trade negotiations makes the trajectory of any recovery particularly difficult to predict.The tariffs that China and the U.S. have levied against each other have made inventory management something more akin to an Olympic sport as companies try to get ahead of the levies but also guard against getting stuck with a bunch of unwanted goods. That challenge was reflected in Deere’s outlook. Looking at the broader market, Deere expects demand for agricultural equipment to drop 5% in the U.S. and Canada, while the European, South American and Asian markets are seen remaining flat. That’s not as severe as Deere’s forecast for its own business, a dynamic which Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann says likely reflects an expectation that dealers are still sitting on too much inventory and will work through that before placing new orders. An upwardly revised GDP figure released Wednesday of 2.1% for the third quarter also reflected inventory accumulation.   Point being, no one really knows anything, and everyone is afraid of moving in the wrong direction. One reason Deere’s lackluster guidance hit its stock particularly hard is that the forecast wasn’t accompanied by much detail on restructuring that the company had previously indicated would be forthcoming. The company will implement a voluntary separation program for some employees that should save about $150 million annually when combined with 2019 cost-cutting efforts. If the outlook is really as bad as Deere claims, though, you would think we would see something more substantive on cost cuts. But to get aggressive with restructuring, Deere also has to be confident that this market isn’t going to turn around on a dime if there is in fact a legitimate trade deal, lest it end up short-staffed. The Trump administration is quickly running out of ways to describe the trade talks and proximity to a “phase-one” agreement. One day we were down to the “short strokes,” the next we’re in the rather morbid sounding “final throes.” But while investors are more than happy to price in those words as a done deal, CEOs are thinking differently. Deere’s downbeat guidance follows similar outlooks from Caterpillar Inc. and Emerson Electric Co. that in certain lights could be construed as conservative. Or they might just be accurate.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-11-27	2019-11-27 14:41:02	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Outlook Disappoints as Trade War Keeps Farmers Frugal	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Deere & Co. delivered a more cautious outlook than expected for the year ahead as simmering U.S.-China trade tensions and difficult growing conditions keep North American farmers from replacing large equipment, the company’s top moneymaker. The shares tumbled to a six-week low.Demand for machinery has taken a back seat as trade concerns have farmers worrying about who will buy their products, while financial-services results have come under pressure due to operating-lease losses. Construction equipment purchases are also set to decline.Giving his first guidance for fiscal 2020, newly appointed Chief Executive Officer John May projected net income in a range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion. That compares with the $3.46 billion average analyst estimate.The outlook “appears overly conservative,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Chris Ciolino. “It’s a case of a new CEO setting a low bar and taking a very cautious approach given some of the uncertainties facing farmers.”Shares, which had rallied in the past six months, fell as much as 5.3% to $167.25, the lowest since Oct. 10.Global sales of agriculture and turf equipment are forecast to fall 5% to 10% for fiscal 2020, driven by lower demand for large equipment in North America. Construction and forestry equipment sales are anticipated to slide 10% to 15%. Last quarter, Deere announced cost cuts and said it would lower output compared with retail demand to manage growing inventories.For its fiscal fourth quarter, the top tractor maker reported better-than-expected sales and earnings that were broadly in line with estimates. Adjusted earnings of $2.14 a share compares with $2.30 a year ago and an average analyst estimate of $2.13. Sales rose 4.3% to $8.7 billion.There are positives. A deal between the U.S. and China could provide a stimulus for North American agriculture. Moreover, U.S. government payments, so-called bailout money paid to farmers to compensate for the harm from the trade war, should reach growers in Deere’s first quarter, which could improve demand.“Farm fundamentals should still be positive, with pent up replacement demand both in North American and South American large agriculture, and significant government payments helping support farm income,” analysts at Jefferies LLC including Stephen Volkmann said in a Nov. 25 report.CEO May said the longer term outlook remains healthy. Executives will discuss the financial results on a conference call at 10 a.m. New York time(Updates shares in fifth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Michael Hirtzer.To contact the reporter on this story: Lydia Mulvany in Chicago at lmulvany2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-outlook-dissappoints-trade-war-120337813.html?.tsrc=rss

The company posted a net profit of $722 million for its fiscal fourth quarter to Oct. 28, or $2.27 a share, down from $785 million, or $2.42 a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 5% to $9.896 billion. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of $2.13 and sales of $8.467 billion. Sales at the company's agriculture and turf division rose 3% to $5.756 billion. Sales at its construction and forestry division rose 8% to $2.947 billion, and sales at its financial services division fell 66% to $261 million. The company is expecting agriculture and turf sales to fall 5% to 10% in 2020, while construction and forestry sales are expected to 10% to 15%. Financial services are expected to be hit by higher provisions for loan losses, less-favorable financing spreads and higher costs.

2019-11-21	2019-11-21 19:47:32	DE	Deere & Company	7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week	Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.For the first time in several weeks, corporate earnings reports look disappointing. So far, investors have mostly shrugged off the bad news, but with a full slate of earnings next week, it's not guaranteed they will continue to do so.Indeed, it's not yet clear the market will look past this week's misses. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stock fell for a second straight day on Wednesday after its second consecutive earnings miss. Recent growth favorite Pinduoduo (NYSE:PDD) plunged 22% and might have cast a shadow on growth stocks and Chinese names; JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) both weakened in response.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFrom a broad market perspective, tough reports from Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Macy's (NYSE:M) seem offset by another sizzling quarter from Target (NYSE:TGT) and raised guidance from TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX). But the reports seem to confirm the ever-widening divide between the haves and have-nots of retail. And there are many more of the latter on U.S. exchanges, at least for now.Whether earnings drove the pressure or not (and there were external factors, including the impeachment inquiry and stalling progress on the trade front), the S&P 500 did decline, if modestly, on both Tuesday and Wednesday. The mixed reports this week, combined with major indices still near all-time highs, mean a surprisingly full earnings calendar ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday looks even more important.  * 7 Marijuana Penny Stocks That Have Ridiculous Possibilities Indeed, there are earnings reports next week that could move entire sectors, if not quite the entire market. And the news won't be limited to retail. Next week might be a short week, but investors still need to pay close attention to these key earnings reports. Palo Alto Networks (PANW)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Monday, Nov. 25, after market closeThe entire cybersecurity sector will be closely watching the fiscal first-quarter report from Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) on Monday afternoon. The sector has rallied nicely of late, with the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (NYSE:HACK) bouncing 15% from its early October lows, while PANW has gained over 25% since mid-August.Heading into next week's report, both PANW stock and the exchange-traded fund are facing resistance that has held multiple times this year. A big report from Palo Alto could lead to a breakout in its stock, and bring peers along for the ride.Anything less, however, and recent optimism could reverse. The simple bull case for cybersecurity stocks on the whole, not just PANW, might look much less attractive. And the relatively sideways trading that has marked both Palo Alto Networks' stock and the HACK ETF would return. Best Buy (BBY)Source: BobNoah / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 26, before market openBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) stock could use a big third-quarter report on Tuesday morning. Shares have had a lid on them going back to early 2018. As with PANW, a move through resistance could lead to a breakout. That's true fundamentally as well: with BBY trading at a reasonable 12x forward earnings, more positive growth expectations could lead to both increased earnings and a higher multiple.So an impressive report on Tuesday morning could drive momentum behind BBY stock. The most optimistic scenario is something akin to what Target has delivered in proving it's a legitimate, permanent competitor to retailer leaders Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).But investors with no position in BBY stock still should keep an eye on commentary from Best Buy management on Tuesday morning's conference call. Best Buy is a bellwether in consumer electronics and, more broadly, in the high-dollar items for which confident consumers will spend up.So Best Buy's outlook will be an important indicator ahead of a holiday shopping season that could disappoint. Notably, there are six fewer days between Black Friday and Christmas this year, a potential headwind for a period that accounts for 20% of retail spending.  * 7 Companies Using Artificial Intelligence to Outperform the Market Meanwhile, economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, has slowed in recent quarters. The presidential election looms. It's possible that a retail sector that needs a big holiday season may get something less than it expects. If Best Buy management predicts that will be the case, investors across retail probably should believe them and react accordingly. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 26, before market openDick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) needs a strong third-quarter report on Tuesday morning. DKS stock actually has done rather well in recent years: shares touched a two-year high earlier this month. But those highs are colored by a plunge in the stock back in 2017; DKS stock still trades about 35% below late 2016 highs.A simply solid earnings report can keep the gains going. Anything better can lead to a nice pop. DKS, too, has faced repeated resistance in recent months. With 28% of the float sold short, better-than-expected results can drive a short squeeze, adding fuel to the rally. Of course, that short interest and the rising share price also leaves substantial downside if earnings disappoint, as investors in Kohl's stock learned this week.DKS earnings may also move other stocks. Key supplier Under Armour (NYSE:UA, NYSE:UAA) plunged after earnings, and Dick's management no doubt will be asked about its holiday plans for that struggling brand. More broadly, the retail stocks stuck in the middle between Amazon/Walmart/Target and the ever-increasing number of smaller, nimble, niche players need some good news. A big report from Dick's could help not only the likes of Under Armour and Nike (NYSE:NKE), but other mid-sized retail stocks looking for any help they can get. VMWare (VMW)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 26, after market closeCloud software play VMWare (NYSE:VMW) faces a key earnings report on Tuesday afternoon. Second-quarter earnings beat expectations, but guidance for this quarter looked a bit soft. And dual acquisitions of Pivotal Software (NYSE:PVTL) and Carbon Black further spooked the market. VMW stock fell to an eight-month low not long after the report.But VMW stock has rallied nicely since, gaining nearly 30%. And so the pressure is on the Q3 release. A big report cements VMWare's role in the cloud ecosystem and likely keeps the rally going. But as August trading shows, any weakness can be punished.  * 10 Stocks to Buy for Your 40's and Beyond Wall Street could play a role as well. The average price target sits only modestly above current levels. A big report likely leads to a round of higher target prices and upgrades. Those upgrades would help not only VMW, but Dell Technologies (NASDAQ:DELL), which owns over 80% of the company. HP Inc. (HPQ)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 26, after market closeIt's not hyperbole to say that fourth-quarter earnings from HP (NYSE:HPQ) will impact the very future of the company. HP this week turned down a buyout offer from Xerox (NYSE:XRX). On Thursday, Xerox said it would consider a hostile takeover instead.With the backing of Carl Icahn and the potential to increase the bid to $26, as one analyst estimated, XRX is a real threat despite being significantly smaller than HP. In that context, the fourth quarter report is enormously important. It's unlikely that HP management will comment on the actual offer. But earnings will have much to say.HPQ stock already stumbled to a two-year low in October after delivering disappointing profit guidance for fiscal 2020. A weak quarter and, in particular, any change in that outlook would make HPQ shareholders much more interested in the mostly cash Xerox offer. It certainly opens the door for Xerox to raise its bid, and undercuts the ability of HP's board and management to argue that a premium to the current share price still undervalues the company.If HP wants to stay independent, it needs to prove to its shareholders it can drive value on its own. Tuesday's report would be a good place to start. Box (BOX)Source: Allmy / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 26, after market closeEnterprise cloud provider Box (NYSE:BOX) also needs to prove it can create value on its own. As I detailed at the beginning of this year, the thesis behind BOX stock has been an argument over whether the company would be bought out by a competitor or run out by all of them.Lately, investors have leaned toward the latter outlook. In August, BOX touched its lowest levels in almost three years. A strong second-quarter report drove a nice bounce, but gains have faded heading into Tuesday's Q3 release.A second straight beat could drive big gains. At less than four times revenue, BOX is relatively cheap by the standards of growth plays in tech. Profit margins remain thin, but Box has room to grow its bottom line nicely if the top line cooperates.  * 10 High-Yield Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy Another quarter of evidence that Box can compete with giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) would jump start takeover speculation, and likely lead to a second consecutive post-earnings rally. A miss, however, negates the optimism created by the Q2 report, and potentially means BOX heads back to August lows around $12. Deere (DE)Source: mark stephens photography / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Nov. 27, before market openSomewhat quietly, Deere (NYSE:DE) stock touched an all-time high earlier this month. And from a broad standpoint, there's still an attractive bull case here.Deere has managed to drive growth in an environment that hardly seems positive. Farm income has remained stagnant, the trade war has disrupted operations, and the strong dollar has pressured international sales. Yet Deere still is creating earnings and revenue growth. It's not difficult to wonder what the company would be capable of with some level of cooperation from external factors.That said, external factors seem likely to stay negative for the time being. And DE stock does look a bit risky ahead of Wednesday morning's release. Shares trade just above the average Wall Street price target, and have pulled back about 3.5% in recent sessions. Given Deere's cyclical nature, sentiment as much as the numbers themselves could determine how the market reacts to Q3.The good news is that Deere has a nice setup here. The modest pullback potentially reined in expectations. And Street estimates don't expect much from the third quarter: EPS is actually projected to decline 7% year-over-year.There's room for Deere to deliver a solid beat-and-raise quarter followed by higher analyst targets. And if the market is willing to stay patient during trade uncertainty and ahead of the looming election, DE stock is cheap enough to rally nicely off that type of report.As of this writing, Vince Martin is long call options of Dell Technologies and long put options in VMWare.

2019-11-20	2019-11-20 23:15:44	DE	Deere & Company	Trump’s 2020 Campaign Collides With Trade War at Apple Plant	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Donald Trump’s effort to tout U.S. economic growth collided with his trade war on Wednesday when he toured an Apple Inc. factory in Texas, where Tim Cook had the chance to plead in-person to keep Macs and iPhones free from tariffs.Trump’s visit to the Austin factory, where Apple contractor Flex Ltd. assembles some of the company’s laptops, was intended to highlight the growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs since his inauguration. Trump has made U.S. economic growth the centerpiece of his campaign for re-election in 2020.But the stop also highlighted the impact of Trump’s trade war with Beijing. The administration is currently considering whether to exempt Apple goods from a 15% tariff that took effect Sept. 1, covering about $110 billion in Chinese imports including the Apple Watch, AirPods and parts for the iPhone.“When you build in the United States you don’t have to worry about tariffs,” Trump told reporters at the plant. In response to a question, Trump said he’s “looking at” exempting Apple from U.S. tariffs entirely, saying that the company’s South Korea-based competitor Samsung Electronics Co. may otherwise enjoy an unfair advantage in the U.S.“I said some day we’re going to see Apple building plants in our country, not in China, and that’s what’s happening,” Trump said. “It’s all happening. It’s all the American dream.”In reality, this is not happening: Apple still has most of its devices assembled outside the U.S., and the company relies heavily on China-based manufacturing partners.Cultivated RelationshipCook, Apple’s CEO, has cultivated a personal relationship with both Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, who is a White House senior adviser. He’s dined twice with Trump at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf resort, attended a state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron and even traveled with Ivanka Trump to visit schools in Idaho. But that rapport will be tested if Trump can’t reach what he calls a “phase-one” trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping that would roll back U.S. tariffs.A round of tariffs set to take effect in December would be even more painful for Apple, including a 15% levy on the iPhone itself.Apple announced Wednesday that it had begun construction on a $1 billion, 3-million-square-foot campus in Austin. “Building the Mac Pro, Apple’s most powerful device ever, in Austin is both a point of pride and a testament to the enduring power of American ingenuity,” Cook said in a statement that didn’t mention Trump’s visit.The statement emphasized Apple’s U.S. footprint, saying the company relies on 9,000 suppliers in all 50 states and that it would contribute $350 billion to the domestic economy by 2023, including $30 billion in capital expenditures.Trump and Cook toured the plant largely out of sight of reporters accompanying the president. At one point, Cook and factory workers demonstrated for the president how the Mac Pro is assembled.A factory worker showed Trump a silver-colored plate for the Mac Pro that said “Assembled in the USA.”“That’s what we want,” Trump responded.Apple TariffsWhite House spokesman Judd Deere said the factory was “made possible through the president’s pro-growth and pro-business economic policies.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, two key figures on trade, accompanied Trump, as did senior advisers Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.“We’re building the Mac Pro — Apple’s most powerful computer ever — right here in Austin because we believe in the power of American innovation,” Cook said in a statement distributed by the White House.In its appeal for a waiver, Apple claims it cannot identify a manufacturing location outside China able to meet U.S. demand for the products or components that would be subject to tariffs.Apple previously received tariff waivers on 10 of 15 requested items in September. Soon afterward, the company announced it would assemble its new Mac Pro in Austin, Texas, rather than China. Apple said at the time that the decision was “made possible” by the exclusions, which included components for the Mac Pro.Cook’s LeverageThe sequence of events showed that Cook has some leverage on Trump. The president said in August that Cook personally appealed to him by arguing that tariffs would help Apple’s foreign competition.“I have a lot of respect for Tim Cook. And Tim was talking to me about tariffs. And, you know, one of the things — and he made a good case — is that Samsung is their number-one competitor, and Samsung is not paying tariffs because they’re based in South Korea,” Trump told reporters in August.Trump laid out his economic argument for re-election last week in a speech at the Economic Club of New York, highlighting his tax cuts and deregulation as key catalysts for economic growth. The U.S. added about 443,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2017, the month Trump took office, though factories have shed about 41,000 positions in the last two months.Apple had planned to move Mac Pro assembly to China after a number of problems plagued the Austin facility, including trouble retaining skilled labor. The factory produced a previous version of the computer starting in 2013.While Cook has said his company supports 2.4 million jobs in the U.S., only a small fraction are for final assembly. Earlier this decade, the company assembled a small amount of iMacs at a facility in Elk Grove, California, but it currently does not assemble any product in the U.S. outside of Texas. Apple has offices in San Diego, San Francisco, New York, Austin, Denver, Seattle, Florida, and Boston.In December 2018, the company announced plans to invest $1 billion in its existing Austin campus so that it could employ as many as 15,000 workers, according to the White House.(Updates with additional details of trip beginning in 12th paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Mark Gurman and Mark Niquette.To contact the reporter on this story: Jordan Fabian in Washington at jfabian6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Joshua GalluFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-2020-campaign-collide-trade-090000100.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-17	2019-11-17 21:34:18	DE	Deere & Company	Trump to Tour Apple’s Austin Manufacturing Plant on Wednesday	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. President Donald Trump is scheduled to tour an Apple Inc. manufacturing plant in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday, the White House said Sunday.The president plans to visit the plant along with Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, according to a tweet by spokesman Judd Deere. The Austin American-Statesman newspaper reported that Trump will travel with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other administration officials.The company announced in September that its new Mac Pro computer will be assembled in Texas after it received exclusions from the Trump administration from tariffs on certain parts imported from China.The visit also comes at a time the U.S. and China are close to finalizing the first phase of a highly-anticipated trade deal.It’s not the first time Cook and Trump have spent time together. They’ve dined at the president’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, twice in the past two years, most recently in August. Cook also attended a state dinner hosted by Trump in 2018 for French President Emmanuel Macron.Trump said after the pair met in August that Cook made a “good case” about the difficulty in competing with South Korean rival Samsung Electronics Co. if Apple products are subject to import tariffs.A month later, the Trump administration announced it had agreed to Apple’s request for tariff waivers on 10 of 15 Chinese components -- a shift from a stance announced by Trump in July that the company’s requests would be denied and that it should make the parts in the U.S.After gaining the tariff relief, Apple announced it would assemble the new Mac Pro computer at the Austin plant, which has produced the previous Mac Pro since 2013. There had been reports the company planned to shift production to China.The Trump administration then said in September it denied Apple’s request for relief from 25% tariffs on other Mac Pro components, including optional wheels, a circuit board for managing input and output ports, power adapter, charging cable and a cooling system for the computer’s processor.The company is also seeking exclusions from Trump’s tariffs that went into effect Sept. 1 on the Apple Watch, iMac, parts for the iPhone and other components imported from China.Last month, Trump criticized Cook for a design change to the iPhone -- the loss of the home button.Apple’s presence in the Texas capital is the biggest after its headquarters in Cupertino, California, the Austin American-Statesman said, and the company has said it will invest $1 billion in Austin to build an office park capable of holding 15,000 additional employees.To contact the reporter on this story: Hailey Waller in New York at hwaller@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Ludden at jludden@bloomberg.net, Ros Krasny, Mark NiquetteFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tour-apple-austin-manufacturing-213418822.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-11	2019-11-11 09:00:00	DE	Deere & Company	Trump’s Road to Impeachment Paved by All the President’s Yes Men	(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump’s effort to get Ukraine to investigate a top Democratic rival went largely unchecked by some of his closest advisers -- setting in motion the impeachment inquiry now engulfing his presidency.Transcripts released by House impeachment investigators last week offer no evidence that Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney or Secretary of State Michael Pompeo tried to stop Trump from his bid earlier this year for a Ukrainian probe of former Vice President Joe Biden.The Ukraine episode, depicted in testimony from current and former U.S. officials, illustrates the peril that lies in Trump’s preference for advisers who let him follow his instincts in making policy. And it puts a new light on recent comments from former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who said last month that he warned the president not to replace him with a yes man or he’d risk being impeached. Trump disputed Kelly’s statement.Events surrounding the July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump requested an investigation of Biden and his son Hunter, will get a full public hearing as House Democrats accelerate their impeachment inquiry.Three State Department officials -- William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine; Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of State responsible for Ukraine -- are set to testify in separate sessions on Wednesday and Friday. They may shed light not only on the president’s decisions, but the actions by his most senior advisers.Mulvaney and Pompeo last year replaced two men who were more likely to raise objections to Trump’s unconventional and transactional approach to governing: Kelly and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said the president “has assembled an incredible team at the White House and across the federal government to help him accomplish undeniable successes,” which included “restoring the nation’s standing in the world.”The State Department declined to comment.Trump has repeatedly said he did nothing wrong related to Ukraine and refers to the call with Zelenskiy as “perfect.”National Security Adviser John Bolton, who was forced out in September, was said to have cut short discussions about demanding investigations from Ukraine as the price of an Oval Office meeting with Trump and Zelenskiy. Bolton also raised concerns about Trump’s use of his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to play a role in directing the U.S. relationship with Ukraine.Bolton, whose lawyer says he won’t testify before the House unless a judge orders him to do so, told colleagues Giuliani is “a hand grenade that is going to blow everybody up,” according to testimony by Fiona Hill, Trump’s former Russia adviser.It is not clear, however, what steps Bolton took to counter Giuliani’s efforts.According to transcripts of the closed-door testimony to the House, Mulvaney carried out Trump’s orders on Ukraine. He put a hold on nearly $400 million in aid critical to Ukraine’s defense against Russia. No evidence has emerged that he opposed Trump’s demands.National Security Council aide Alexander Vindman testified that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said in a July 10 call that Mulvaney insisted Ukraine would have to provide “deliverables” to get a meeting with Trump. Sondland, according to Vindman, said that meant conducting investigations sought by Trump.“He was talking about the 2016 elections and an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma,” Vindman said in testimony released Friday.Burisma Holdings is a Ukrainian energy firm. Hunter Biden sat on its board and received substantial compensation -- an arrangement that Trump claims is corrupt, though no evidence of wrongdoing has emerged.In testimony released last week, Pompeo was portrayed as a passive figure by several top State Department officials. Sondland, who was told by Trump to listen to Giuliani on Ukraine, testified that he discussed Giuliani’s role with Pompeo.“Pompeo rolled his eyes and said: Yes, it’s something we have to deal with,” Sondland said.Sondland also testified that although State Department officials were concerned about Giuliani’s activities, “my speculation is yes, that they hit a brick wall when it came to getting rid of Mr. Giuliani.”Pompeo’s approach contrasts with that of Tillerson. Two years earlier, Trump repeatedly sought to enlist Tillerson to intervene in a criminal case against a Turkish gold trader who was a client of Giuliani’s, Bloomberg News reported. The trader, Reza Zarrab, would later testify that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan knew of and approved of a plan to launder money for Iran to evade U.S. sanctions. Tillerson refused to intervene in the case and complained to Kelly.After the Ukraine episode become public, Kelly blamed a breakdown in White House staff leadership.Someone has to tell Trump “that you either have the authority or you don’t, or Mr. President, don’t do it,” Kelly said on Oct. 26 at an event hosted by the Washington Examiner. “Whatever you do, don’t hire a ‘yes man,’” Kelly said he warned Trump. “Because if you do, I believe you will be impeached.”In response, Trump said that if Kelly had said that, “I would have thrown him out of the office. He just wants to come back into the action like everybody else does.”Nikki Haley, Trump’s former U.N. ambassador, told CBS that Kelly and Tillerson undermined the president during their tenure.“Kelly and Tillerson confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren’t being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country,” she said in the interview that aired Sunday.Haley said they pitched her for more than an hour on resisting the president. But she told CBS their actions were dangerous, offensive and against the Constitution.As part of the impeachment inquiry, House Democrats also are examining potential obstruction of justice by Trump detailed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.In multiple cases, Mueller wrote in his report, Trump’s staff rejected the president’s orders. He said that former White House Counsel Don McGahn, who left the administration last year, refused Trump’s demand to have Mueller removed -- and then refused to write a memo saying Trump had never told him to do it.Tillerson has said that Trump often asked him to do things that were illegal.“I would have to say to him, ‘Mr. President, I understand what you want to do but you can’t do it that way. It violates the law,’” Tillerson said at an event in Houston last December.Shortly afterward, Trump said of Tillerson on Twitter, “He was dumb as a rock and I couldn’t get rid of him fast enough.”Pompeo has yet to give a detailed account of his role. He has publicly bristled at questions about the Ukraine matter, speaking in generalities about wanting to reduce corruption in Ukraine and only confirming well after the fact that he listened in on Trump’s July call with Zelenskiy.The House interview transcripts show Pompeo remaining neutral when Ukraine matters are discussed.Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Pompeo, testified that the secretary didn’t react when he resigned over the affair. Taylor testified Pompeo didn’t respond when he sent a cable warning against a quid pro quo tying military aid for Ukraine to investigations the ambassador saw as designed to aid Trump’s re-election campaign rather than national security.“Although I received no specific response, I heard that soon thereafter, the secretary carried the cable with him to a meeting at the White House focused on security assistance for Ukraine,” Taylor testified. It’s not clear what Pompeo did behind the scenes.Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the top Republican on Capitol Hill, has said he lobbied both Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper to release the Ukraine aid, and neither gave him a reason why it was being held up.Mulvaney, at a press conference on Oct. 17, confirmed that aid was held up in part to get Ukraine to launch investigations sought by Trump. After a backlash from the president’s allies and foes alike, Mulvaney backtracked, saying the media had misreported his comments.Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who is the longest-serving senator, said having a compliant staff doesn’t absolve Trump.“He can tell himself no,” Leahy said. “When I was a prosecutor somebody said about an armed robbery, ‘Well, it’s not my fault they never should have given me that gun.’ Come on, you’re the guy that held the gun, held up the store!”&#92;--With assistance from Nick Wadhams, Jordan Fabian, Billy House and Justin Sink.To contact the reporter on this story: Steven T.

2019-11-07	2019-11-07 03:47:27	DE	Deere & Company	Trump-Xi Trade Summit May Slip to December, Be Outside U.S.	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may not be able to sign a partial trade deal until December, and two U.S. locations have been ruled out for their highly anticipated meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter.The two sides have been trying to negotiate a limited trade deal that would entail the U.S. dropping some tariffs on Chinese imports in exchange for Beijing resuming purchases of American farm goods and other products.The U.S.-China trade war that Trump began has been a drag on both nation’s economies, and the leaders had initially expected to take a step toward resolving it ahead of the 2020 U.S. elections at an international summit in Chile this month. The summit was canceled because of protests in the capital, Santiago.U.S. locations for a Trump-Xi meeting that had been proposed by the White House, including Iowa and Alaska, have been ruled out, the person said. Locations in Asia and Europe are now being considered instead, the person said, asking not to be identified because the discussions aren’t public.Stocks in Asia were mixed Thursday and futures on the S&P 500 were flat. Equities in Japan edged up, while Hong Kong slipped and China and South Korean stocks were little changed.“Negotiations are continuing and progress is being made on the text of the phase-one agreement,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said. “We will let you know when we have an announcement on a signing location.”Reuters reported earlier that the signing might be delayed and likely wouldn’t occur in the U.S.Trump administration officials in recent days have expressed optimism that phase one of a comprehensive trade deal might come together this month, helping boost equity markets to records this week.“I think we’re in good shape, we’re making good progress, and there’s no natural reason why it couldn’t be” signed this month, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Bloomberg Television in an interview Sunday in Bangkok. “But whether it will slip a little bit, who knows, it’s always possible.”(Updates with Asian markets in fifth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Justin Sink and Sophie Caronello.To contact the reporter on this story: Saleha Mohsin in Washington at smohsin2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Brendan Murray, Sarah McGregorFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-xi-trade-summit-may-195155909.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-31	2019-10-31 18:22:32	DE	Deere & Company	China Doubts Long-Term Trade Deal Possible With Trump	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Chinese officials are casting doubts about reaching a comprehensive long-term trade deal with the U.S. even as the two sides get close to signing a “phase one” agreement.In private conversations with visitors to Beijing and other interlocutors in recent weeks, Chinese officials have warned they won’t budge on the thorniest issues, according to people familiar with the matter. They remain concerned about President Donald Trump’s impulsive nature and the risk he may back out of even the limited deal both sides say they want to sign in the coming weeks.Chinese policy makers concluded a key political gathering in Beijing on Thursday. In meetings ahead of that plenum some officials have relayed low expectations that future negotiations could result in anything meaningful -- unless the U.S. is willing to roll back more of the tariffs. In some cases, they’ve urged American visitors to carry that very message back to Washington, the people said.Chilean President Sebastian Pinera threw up another hurdle when he announced Wednesday that the country had canceled the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit Nov. 16-17 -- where Trump and China’s Xi Jinping hoped to meet -- because of social unrest in the country.U.S. stocks were little changed and bond yields retreated on concern about a protracted trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Earlier, a report showed a gauge of the outlook for China’s manufacturing sector dropped to the lowest level since February. On Wednesday, a government report in Washington showed U.S. growth slowed to a 1.9% annual rate, the weakest since the end of 2018.In a tweet on Thursday, Trump said the search is ongoing for a new location for Xi and him to sign the deal, which he said would be “about 60% of total deal.”That first step, according to the Trump administration, is meant to lead to a more comprehensive agreement involving more substantial economic reforms than those contained in the proposed initial phase. But Chinese officials are skeptical, saying that would require the U.S. to withdraw tariffs in place on some $360 billion in imports from China -- something many don’t see Trump being ready to do.The people familiar with China’s position said the tariffs don’t all have to be removed immediately, but they must be part of the next stage. China also wants Trump to cancel a new wave of import taxes due to take effect Dec. 15 on American consumer favorites such as smartphones and toys as part of the phase one deal, the people said.Beijing is open and willing to continue talks after an initial phase, but both sides recognize that it will be very difficult to reach an agreement on the deep structural reforms the U.S. is pushing for, said one Chinese official familiar with the talks.China has stated for months that a final deal must include the removal of all punitive tariffs, and has balked at reforms in areas such as state-run enterprises that could jeopardize the Communist Party’s grip on power. It’s politically unfeasible for Xi to accept any deal that would keep the punitive tariffs: Nationalists in the party have pressured him through state-run media editorials to avoid signing an “unequal treaty” reminiscent of those China signed with colonial powers.Tariff PressureSo far, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and his team, which declined to comment, have been adamant that the duties on $250 billion in Chinese goods -- imposed early in the trade war -- be maintained over the long term as a way to enforce any commitments China makes.The questions over the future of negotiations reflect a change in U.S. strategy. After ramping up tariffs and pressure on China over the summer and saying he would settle only for an all-encompassing agreement, Trump in early October shifted to the step-by-step approach.The first phase, which negotiators are still trying to nail down, is expected to include a resumption of Chinese purchases of U.S. farm goods and other products such as aircraft.It’s also expected to include Chinese commitments to protect American intellectual property and an agreement by both sides not to manipulate their currencies. In return, Trump agreed not to go ahead with an Oct. 15 tariff increase and aides have raised the possibility of canceling the Dec. 15 levies.But missing from the deal now taking shape are many of the deeper economic reforms such as a changes to the regime of government subsidies Chinese companies benefit from that the Trump administration – and American businesses – have been seeking, raising questions over whether the economic cost of Trump’s trade assault will have been worth it.Trump has sought to preempt criticism that he’s getting little from China by arguing that the tougher issues will be dealt with in future phases. “Phase two will start negotiations almost immediately after we’ve concluded phase one,” he told reporters this month.White House spokesman Judd Deere said Thursday, after this story was first published, that the president “wants real structural changes that yield actual, verifiable, and enforceable results” that lead to fairer trade with China.Modelling Global GDP Impact of Trade WarYet the move to a phased approach reflects China’s resistance to many U.S. demands and a concession by the White House to abandon its stance that nothing is agreed until all the thorny issues are resolved.“Even if they do get a phase one, a phase two is going to be substantially more difficult because all the really difficult issues are being deferred,” said Eswar Prasad, who once led the International Monetary Fund’s China team and is now at Cornell University.During recent conversations with senior Chinese policy makers, Prasad said the common theme they expressed was skepticism. “They are quite pessimistic,” he said. “They fear that any deal that they negotiate with Trump could blow up in their face.”The differences were evident even as Trump announced the “substantial phase one deal” with China’s lead negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, and promised a broader thaw in relations as part of what he dubbed a “love-fest.”Behind closed doors though, the mood was not quite as fulsome. According to people close to the talks, the sides were still debating how to apportion issues between phases and what to announce just minutes before reporters were let in for the announcement.‘Positive Direction’Trump declared before the press that there could be as many as three phases to a deal while Liu declined to discuss details.“We very much agree that to get the China-U.S. economic relationship right, it’s something that is good for China, for the United States, and for the whole world and we are making a lot of progress toward a positive direction,” Liu told reporters.China’s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a fax seeking comment on the trade talks. But a former official says there could still be a long road ahead.“If the U.S. demands are too much, such as insisting on the so-called structural changes that will alter China’s economic model, then the complete deal can’t be finished during Trump’s first term,” said Zhou Xiaoming, a former Ministry of Commerce official. “Other than that, China wants to have a deal as quickly as possible” though a complete deal would include the removal of all punitive tariffs, he said.That’s far from what the Trump administration is prepared to offer. “It’s not obvious that there is a real meeting of minds,” Prasad said.(Adds White House spokesman’s comment in 18th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Miao Han and Zoe Schneeweiss.To contact the reporters on this story: Shawn Donnan in Washington at sdonnan@bloomberg.net;Jenny Leonard in Washington at jleonard67@bloomberg.net;Steven Yang in Beijing at kyang74@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Kennedy at skennedy4@bloomberg.net, Brendan Murray, Margaret CollinsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-doubts-long-term-trade-090452844.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-30	2019-10-30 09:30:02	DE	Deere & Company	Low Rates and Low Inflation? Not Always on Main Street	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For those in finance and finance-related industries, it’s easy to get lured into sweeping generalizations about the state of the American economy. I can’t begin to estimate how many times I’ve heard some iteration of “the U.S. consumer remains strong,” or “stubbornly low inflation,” or “it’s a great time to be a borrower with rock-bottom interest rates.”So I give a lot of credit to Bloomberg News’s Christopher Maloney and Adam Tempkin for shattering that boilerplate with an article this week about the boom in online installment loans. Provocatively titled “America’s Middle Class Is Getting Hooked on Debt With 100% Rates,” it undercuts much of Wall Street’s assumptions about life across the country.Are all American consumers really that strong? Perhaps not, judging by how subprime borrowers owe some $50 billion on installment products. Is inflation frustratingly low? Maybe by historical averages, but in the 10 years through 2018, crucial budget items for middle-class households like home prices, medical care and college tuition have soared at a much faster pace than average incomes, potentially driving people to alternative credit providers. And as for those ultra-low interest rates so often bandied about?Enter the online installment loan, aimed in part at a fast expanding group of ‘near-prime’ borrowers -- those with bad, but not terrible, credit -- with limited access to traditional banking options.Ranging anywhere from $100 to $10,000 or more, they quickly became so popular that many alternative credit providers soon began generating the bulk of their revenue from installment rather than payday loans.…For subprime lender Enova International Inc., outstanding installment loans averaged $2,123 in the second quarter, versus $420 for short-term products, according to a recent regulatory filing.Larger loans have allowed many installment lenders to charge interest rates well in the triple digits. In many states, Enova’s NetCredit platform offers annual percentage rates between 34% and 155%.That number — 155% — is stunningly high. Granted, it’s not as if online installment loans are necessarily the first type of debt incurred by Americans, nor are they a particularly large share of obligations. Total household debt reached a record $13.86 trillion in the second quarter, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. More than two-thirds of that is mortgages, while loans for college and automobiles are consuming ever-larger shares of balance sheets.Still, triple-digit interest costs are unthinkable for individuals, corporations or governments with pristine credit. The Bankrate.com 30-year fixed mortgage lending rate fell earlier this month to 3.68%, not far from the all-time low of 3.32% in September 2016. Deere & Co. set a record in September for the lowest-yielding 30-year investment-grade corporate debt, at 2.877%. Even though the yield on the longest-dated U.S. Treasuries dropped to an unprecedented low in late August, President Donald Trump is imploring the Fed to emulate Europe and Japan and drop interest rates below zero.For those relying on installment loans, the concept of being paid to borrow money surely sounds like an alternate reality. California has actually taken measures to cap the interest rate on loans between $2,500 and $10,000 — to 36% plus the fed funds rate. Compared with an annual percentage rate of more than 100%, I guess that’s a borrower-friendly move.It’s always risky to draw broad conclusions about household credit trends. The sevenfold increase in online installment loan volume since 2014, for instance, can mean two things, depending on your worldview. For those with a gloomy take on the U.S. economy, it’s a sign of how the working class has been forced to take on onerous debt to keep up with their higher cost of living. For the more optimistic onlookers, it indicates that individuals with marginal credit scores are confident enough in their financial position to borrow, even if they’re still locked out from traditional banks. In the words of Jonathan Walker, who heads Elevate Credit Inc.’s Center for the New Middle Class, “there has been a lot of innovation to meet the consumer where they are.”Similarly, the New York Fed’s data has a mix of good and bad economic news. On the bright side, 95.6% of households were current on their debt payments in the second quarter, the largest share since 2006. However, those considered “severely derogatory” on payments made up almost half of all delinquencies, the largest share ever. My conclusion was that in the current economy, you either have the money to pay back what you owe or you don’t.But even that might be too simplistic. Looking out over the coming years, some analysts suggest FICO credit scores from Fair Isaac Corp. have been artificially boosted over the past decade and overstate how many borrowers could pay back what they owe in an economic downturn. Online installment loans are among the debt most vulnerable to inflated scores. So are credit cards — and card issuers ramped up the percentage of loans they expect will never be repaid in the first quarter to a seven-year high of 3.82%. The so-called charge-off rate has since come down to 3.33%.Perhaps some credit is due to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who is widely expected on Wednesday to announce the central bank’s third interest-rate cut since July. He has reiterated at every opportunity that he and other officials are acting as they see fit to sustain the economic expansion, with a focus on funneling the benefits of a strong labor market and rising wage growth to people who have missed out thus far. They’ve kept the U.S. economy chugging along.And yet it feels as if the economy remains at a crossroads. Conference Board data released on Tuesday showed that U.S. consumers are as confident about their current situation as they have been in the past 19 years, while their outlook for the future is the most dour since January.Layer that cautious macro view on top of the more micro elements of household debt balances, including the surge in online installment loans, and an image begins to emerge of a precarious situation for a swath of Americans. It’s a picture of the economy that Wall Street too often blurs out.To contact the author of this story: Brian Chappatta at bchappatta1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2019-10-17	2019-10-17 19:08:09	DE	Deere & Company	Trump Vowed to Save Coal, Now Miners Are Getting Laid Off	(Bloomberg) -- The clearest sign yet that America’s Coal County is headed for widespread job cuts: The amount of coal being produced per U.S. miner is at the lowest level in eight years.Productivity has slid 11% this year alone. The last time it was this low was in 2011, when coal companies ended up cutting almost half their workers in a downturn that lasted more than four years.It underscores the intense pressure facing U.S. coal producers. For years, they relied on exports and metallurgical coal used for steel making to offset shriveling demand from U.S. utilities. Now even those markets are suffering as the global economy slows, liquefied natural gas becomes cheap and plentiful in Asia and President Donald Trump’s trade war churns away. The bottom line: U.S. production is expected to slide 10% this year, and jobs are at risk.“It’s highly likely there will be more layoffs,” said Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America union. “I don’t think there’s any question.”The looming downturn comes as Trump, who vowed to rescue the coal industry by easing environmental regulations, begins his re-election campaign. Winning a second term will hinge in part on mining strongholds he carried in 2016, including West Virginia and Pennsylvania.“The president is committed to all Americans, including our great hardworking coal miners,&quot; White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email. Cutbacks are already underway. On Monday, Peabody Energy Corp. said it plans to close an Illinois mine and lay off about 225 workers. Blackhawk Mining LLC idled four West Virginia mines last week and fired about 340 people. And in September, Murray Energy Corp. shut mines in West Virginia.“Most coal-mining companies will have to reassess production,” said Mike Dudas, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners.The number of U.S. coal jobs bottomed out at about 48,800 in 2016 as Arch Coal Inc., Peabody and other big miners worked their way through bankruptcy, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Then, as exports picked up and Trump began his push to roll back environmental regulations, hiring followed suit. The industry added about 4,500 jobs through last month.Now the market has turned. Lower production means U.S. coal workers will each produce an average of about 12,700 tons this year, based on an analysis of production estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s the second-lowest production rate in two decades.“People are going to have to get laid off,” said Andrew Cosgrove, a mining analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “They’re going to have to close mines.”The moves reflect the confluence of woes pummeling the industry. Electricity producers are shunning the fuel in favor of cheaper natural gas, wind and solar. Global prices for coal shipped to power plants have plunged by more than one-third in the past year in both Europe and Asia. Met coal prices fell last month to the lowest since January 2017, and there’s little sign of a recovery.“There are few positive catalysts that will lift met coal prices over the next few months,” Lucas Pipes, an analyst with B. Riley FBR, said in a research note Thursday.Weak demand in South America and Europe, coupled with port restrictions in China, led to an oversupply of steelmaking coal, and Pipes reduced his earnings estimates on several U.S. suppliers including Peabody and Arch.“People are going to start to hunker down,” said Dudas of Vertical Research. “They won’t ship product into a market that doesn’t need it.”(Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder and majority stakeholder of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, has committed $500 million to launch Beyond Carbon, a campaign aimed at closing the remaining coal-powered plants in the U.S. by 2030 and slowing the construction of new gas plants.)(Adds White House statement in sixth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Jennifer A.

2019-10-12	2019-10-12 00:13:58	DE	Deere & Company	Trump Touts U.S.-China Phase One Trade Deal, Delays Tariffs	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. The U.S. and China agreed on the outlines of a partial trade accord Friday that President Donald Trump said he and his counterpart Xi Jinping could sign as soon as next month.As part of the deal, China would significantly step up purchases of U.S. agricultural commodities, agree to certain intellectual-property measures and concessions related to financial services and currency, Trump said Friday at the White House. In exchange, the U.S. will delay a tariff increase due next week as the deal is finalized, though new levies scheduled for December haven’t yet been called off.The agreement marks the largest breakthrough in the 18-month trade war that has hurt the economies of both nations. Importantly, Trump said the deal was the first phase of a broader agreement. The president indicated he could sign a deal with Xi at an upcoming November summit in Chile.While the limited agreement may resolve some short-term issues, several of the thorniest disputes remain outstanding. U.S. goals in the trade war center around accusations of intellectual-property theft, forced technology transfer and complaints about Chinese industrial subsidies.Xi told Trump in a letter -- which the White House distributed on Friday -- that it’s important the countries work together to address each others’ concerns. “I hope the two sides will act in the principle and direction you and I have agreed to, and work to advance China-U.S. relations based on coordination, cooperation and stability,” the letter said.Chinese state news agency Xinhua said negotiators made efforts toward a final agreement, but stopped short of calling Friday’s outcome a deal. The Editor-in-Chief of China’s most prominent state-run newspaper Global Times, Hu Xijin, noted on Twitter that official reports from China didn’t mention Trump’s goal of signing the deal next month, which indicates Beijing wants to keep expectations low.Phase TwoThe Trump administration also said issues related to Huawei Technologies Co. aren’t part of Friday’s deal and will be a separate process. The Chinese telecommunications equipment maker, which was placed on an export blacklist in May, will be discussed in a second phase of the negotiations, the president told reporters later Friday.Equities advanced globally Friday amid growing conviction that the world’s two biggest economies would negotiate a trade truce, though U.S. stocks pared gains after Trump’s announcement near the close of trading. Trump tweeted earlier Friday that if the countries did reach an agreement, he would be able to sign it without a lengthy congressional approval process.Trump’s announcement drew a wary welcome from even Republicans on Capitol Hill.“After so much has been sacrificed, Americans will settle for nothing less than a full, enforceable and fair deal with China,” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said in a statement after the announcement. “Farmers in Iowa know far too well that the trade war has caused real financial pain in the heartland. But we need to know more about this deal and follow-through from China will be key.”On Thursday and earlier Friday, Liu and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer held the first senior-level discussions between Washington and Beijing since a previous agreement fell apart in May and tariffs were raised in the months after.What Our Economists Say“Past experience is that U.S.–China trade agreements aren’t worth the paper they are written on, and this one hasn’t even been written down. For now, though, indications on trade are a little more positive. If that persists, it could help put a floor under sliding global growth.”Tom Orlik and Yelena Shulyatyeva, Bloomberg EconomicsClick here for the full noteThe U.S. was threatening to increase tariffs on Tuesday on about $250 billion of Chinese imports to 30% from 25%. More duties on $160 billion of Chinese products were targeted for Dec. 15.The threat of those import taxes on U.S. consumers, falling around the holiday season, raised the prospect that the U.S. economy would slide toward a recession heading into Trump’s 2020 reelection bid. The American manufacturing industry, which Trump vowed in 2016 to revitalize, is already contracting in part because of the trade war.The Trump administration said that as part of the deal, China would scale its purchases of U.S. farm goods over two years to an annual total of $40 billion to $50 billion. Trump encouraged U.S. farmers to buy more land and Deere & Co. tractors in response.China in recent weeks had already discussed buying more U.S. products such as soybeans, pork and wheat. Some traders remained skeptical that buying soybeans from the U.S. represented a significant breakthrough in the overall trade talks, Bloomberg reported Friday.Earlier Friday, Trump indicated in a Twitter post that if the countries did reach an agreement, he would be able to sign it quickly.Senator Ronald Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee that has jurisdiction over trade policy, pushed back on Trump’s tweet in a statement Friday to Bloomberg News: “Donald Trump should know that any meaningful trade deal is only legitimate because of the authority granted to him by Congress, and that authority can be taken away,” he said.Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress holds power over international trade. For decades, it has legally delegated trade-negotiating authority to the executive branch. Lawmakers in recent months have grown increasingly wary of what they see as Trump’s abuse of that authority and discussed ways to claw it back, citing the president’s many unilateral tariff measures and a lack of transparency in negotiations.(Updates with remarks from Chinese officials in sixth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Jennifer Jacobs, Ye Xie, Isis Almeida, Scott Lanman, Sophie Caronello and Sarah McGregor.To contact the reporters on this story: Jenny Leonard in Washington at jleonard67@bloomberg.net;Saleha Mohsin in Washington at smohsin2@bloomberg.net;Josh Wingrove in Washington at jwingrove4@bloomberg.net;Shawn Donnan in Washington at sdonnan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Kevin WhitelawFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-china-said-reach-partial-190854141.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-10	2019-10-10 00:40:43	DE	Deere & Company	China-U.S. Set to Talk With Global Economy Facing Trade Crucible	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Chinese and American negotiators are set to start meeting again in Washington on Thursday in the latest round of their so-far fruitless talks to strike a trade deal. If no agreement is reached, the already slowing global economy will face another hurdle, with the U.S. set to raise tariffs on China on Oct. 15 and then on the European Union on Oct. 18.Both China and the U.S. have scheduled further tariff increases for December, and Europe is considering retaliation against any U.S. action. With close to $2 trillion in global trade flows at risk from greater protectionism, according to a Bloomberg analysis, those protectionist actions would depress trade, make businesses more cautious and further damage global demand.Investors are underlining what’s at stake: U.S. stock futures slid after a report in the South China Morning Post suggested Chinese negotiators led by Liu He could cut short their stay -- a report refuted by the White House.“We are not aware of a change in the Vice Premier’s travel plans at this time,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said late on Wednesday in Washington, referring to Liu.Chinese state-media had said Wednesday night that the schedule was still on track.ChinaChina’s economy would be slowing with or without the trade war. But that conflict, which over the last 18 months has broadened to other contentious areas such as technology, state subsidies, human rights, Taiwan and the Hong Kong protests, is also damaging to the economy, as it cuts demand for Chinese exports, damages business confidence and undermines investment.The tit-for-tat tariffs have driven down commerce, with Chinese exports down 9% in the first eight months of this year, and imports from the U.S. falling almost 28% for the same period. China’s total exports over the same timeframe have been basically unchanged, meaning it’s been able to find other countries to sell to, but its imports dropped 5%, with that fall in demand weighing on other nation’s economies.And the uncertainty is hitting Chinese companies, with manufacturers seeing their business contracting for the past five months, and new export orders contracting for 16 months.EuropeThe China-U.S. dispute is just one of the risks facing the global economy, with Brexit and the ongoing dispute between the U.S. and Europe over cars and industrial subsidies also posing a threat to trade flows. The U.S. will put tariffs on as much as $7.5 billion of Scotch whisky, French wine, cheese, planes and other European exports from next week. EU officials hope that won’t happen, but have also drafted retaliatory measures just in case.That threat and the possibility of a no-deal Brexit are some of the factors dragging down European growth, with a sharp slowdown in German services suggesting the pain from its industrial crisis is spreading, and manufacturing contracting across the Eurozone. That German outlook went from bad to worse in September, an unpleasant surprise that marks the latest dismal reading on Bloomberg’s Trade Tracker.The U.SThe global economic slowdown and trade policy are working against the world’s largest economy as well. Manufacturing has slipped into a recession, with factory output declining in the first two quarters of the year, and data last week indicate a further softening as companies tighten up capital spending budgets. At the same time, U.S. economic growth is above trend thanks to steady household spending and the lowest jobless rate in five decades.Meanwhile, supply-chain complications have emerged from the trade war, prompting companies to adapt and avoid tariffs. In the year through August, U.S. imports from China have declined 12.5%, or more than $43 billion, while purchases from Mexico -- the second-biggest supplier of goods to America -- posted the largest increase.(Updates with stock futures in 3rd paragraph.)To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: James Mayger in Beijing at jmayger@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeffrey Black at jblack25@bloomberg.net, Vince Golle, Sarah McGregorFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-u-set-talk-global-233841210.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-30	2019-09-30 11:00:09	DE	Deere & Company	One Bond Market Quietly Set Records in Turbulent September	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- This past month has been one for the history books —  and not necessarily in a good way in many corners of the financial markets.All of this happened over the past four weeks:The rate for general collateral repurchase agreements in the more than $2 trillion repo market reached a record 10%, forcing the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to intervene and prompting a round of soul-searching (and head-scratching) on Wall Street. WeWork’s mounting issues shook the market for initial public offerings. Peloton Interactive Inc. fell as much as 14.6% in its first day of trading, the third-worst “unicorn” IPO debut since 2008. SmileDirectClub Inc. became the first U.S. firm since at least 2008 to raise more than $1 billion and price its IPO above range yet drop in opening trades. Hollywood entertainment company Endeavor Group Holdings Inc. pulled its IPO entirely. Oil prices surged on Sept. 16 by the most on record after an attack on Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq processing facility. Momentum stocks crashed the most since 2009, relative to value stocks. Benchmark 10- and 30-year U.S. Treasury yields soared by almost 50 basis points in less than two weeks to start the month. The only comparable moves in the past several years happened during the so-called Taper Tantrum in 2013 and after the presidential election in November 2016.Add it all up, and it would seem like a shaky time for companies to tap the bond markets. Indeed, as Bloomberg News reported last week, at least four junk-bond deals have been scrapped this month in a sign of waning appetite for investing in businesses with excessive debt or sectors more sensitive to an economic downturn. Yet these September storm clouds missed the U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market entirely. Just looking at high-grade debt sales from this past month, you’d think there was nothing but sunny skies for financial markets.A whopping 127 investment-grade bond deals cleared the market in September. That easily topped September 2017’s 110 offerings to become the busiest month ever, according to Bloomberg News’s Michael Gambale, who went through 20 years of records. And there’s still one more day to pile on. As it stood at the end of last week, the total monthly volume of about $155 billion fell short of the $177 billion from May 2016 but would still finish as the third highest of all time and the most debt ever issued in September.Now, this wasn’t entirely a shock. Investment-grade companies like Apple Inc., Deere & Co. and Walt Disney Co. borrowed almost $75 billion in the first week of the month, a record since at least 1972. But that was soon after 30-year Treasury yields touched an all-time low of 1.9%, making bond sales way too tempting to pass up. Within two weeks, the yield  was approaching 2.4% — still low, to be sure, but a sharp enough increase to saddle some traders with nearly double-digit losses.(1)Clearly, corporate treasurers pressed on unabated. Notably, the impetus to borrow was mostly to refinance debt at a lower cost and extend maturities rather than financing a large merger or acquisition. In other words, companies saw a chance to lock in savings or create a more optimal capital structure and moved forward regardless of the conditions outside the primary market for investment-grade bonds.What’s equally impressive is that in the face of this borrowing binge, corporate bonds largely held their value. Yield spreads remain below their one-year average. Yes, the market snapped a nine-month winning streak, but it declined by only about 0.8%, compared with a 1% drop for U.S. Treasuries. Investors added more than $1 billion to investment-grade funds in the week ended Sept. 25 after pouring in $2.83 billion during the prior period, suggesting the small pullback hasn’t scared them away.High-yield funds, by contrast, suffered outflows in the most recent weekly data as yield spreads widened to a two-week high. It followed an inflow of $3.3 billion, the highest since February. As I wrote earlier this month, investors could have used this large wave of new bonds hitting the market to clean up their portfolios, subbing out junk debt for higher-quality securities. Perhaps that shift is beginning. But it’s hard to give up such high-yielding bonds when momentum is on your side — the speculative-grade market is one of the few in fixed income with a positive total return in September.The incredible run in investment-grade corporate bonds, both in terms of borrowing and investing, suggests that high-quality American companies are the sweet spot in a global debt market still starved for yield and uneasy about the fate of the world economy. It’s telling, for instance, that bonds from the small share of triple-A rated U.S. companies have returned almost 15% in 2019, better than any other rating category and nearly double the gains for Treasuries. And while the line is getting blurred between triple-B and double-B securities, it’s the investment-grade portion that has delivered bigger profits to investors this year.September has always been a popular month for corporate borrowing, so even with benchmark yields settling back into a range, it’s unlikely that companies will flood the market to the same extent in the fourth quarter. That doesn’t mean the party has to end for bond buyers, though. If investment-grade debt could remain so unflappable over the past month, that means it’ll require a serious shock to knock this market off track.(1) The ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch 30-Year U.S. Treasury Index had a total return of -8.83% from Sept. 3 to Sept. 13.To contact the author of this story: Brian Chappatta at bchappatta1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2019-09-15	2019-09-15 12:20:22	DE	Deere & Company	Pompeo Blames Iran for Drone Attack on Saudi Oil Industry	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo blamed Iran for a series of brazen attacks on a massive Saudi Aramco oil facility, saying there was no evidence the drones originated in Yemen as Tehran-backed rebels there claimed.Iran denied responsibility for the raids Saturday, which forced Saudi Arabia to slash its daily oil output in half.Pompeo tweeted after the White House confirmed that President Donald Trump offered support for Saudi Arabia’s self-defense in a call on Saturday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.Iran launched an “unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply,” Pompeo said on Twitter after at least one Republican lawmaker urged the U.S. to respond in kind with a strike on Iranian oil facilities. He gave no evidence to back up that allegation. The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi and U.S. officials are investigating the possibility that cruise missiles were launched from Iraq, which is much closer than Yemen, and is home to a host of Iran-backed Shiite missiles. Pompeo said the U.S. will work with allies to ensure the energy market remains well supplied, echoing comments from the White House. He also called on all nations to “publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran’s attacks.”Saudi Arabia, which is locked in multiple proxy wars with Iran in the Middle East trying to contain its widening influence, hasn’t blamed anyone for the assault on the oil facility. On Sunday, it was racing to restore oil production after state energy producer Saudi Aramco lost about 5.7 million barrels per day of output in the raids on the world’s biggest crude-processing facility and the kingdom’s second-biggest oil field.The attack intensified the volatility in the Persian Gulf region, which has been destabilized by a showdown between the U.S. and Iran over the 2015 nuclear deal. Frictions have mounted in the Gulf ever since Trump quit the deal last year and began reimposing harsh sanctions on Iran to try to force it to renegotiate a deal that would more broadly limit its nuclear and military ambitions.Iran has responded by rolling back some of its obligations under the accord, as the agreement allows parties to do when others pull away from their commitments. It’s also been accused of carrying out a number of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf region, charges it has denied.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi rejected the latest U.S. allegations, saying such “blind and fruitless accusations and statements are unfathomable and meaningless.” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted, “Having failed at ‘max pressure,’ @SecPompeo’s turning to ‘max deceit.’”Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the strikes. A Saudi-led coalition backed by the U.S. has been fighting for more than four years to try to vanquish the Houthis and restore Yemen’s President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to power. But the Houthis have proven more tenacious than the Saudis expected, withstanding four years of withering air attacks and fighting off better-armed forces with a disciplined insurgency. They’ve stepped up their drone and missile attacks on enemy forces and Saudi territory, and as the war has dragged on, thousands of civilians have died, millions have gone hungry, and al-Qaeda and Islamic State have mounted a resurgence.The U.S. “strongly condemns today’s attack on critical energy infrastructure,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an emailed statement that was also posted on Twitter. The U.S. government “is monitoring the situation and remains committed to ensuring global oil markets are stable.”France, which has been working with Iran to try to salvage its nuclear deal with world powers after the U.S. pulled out last year, condemned the attacks and expressed “total solidarity” with the kingdom.“Such actions can’t but aggravate the tensions and the risk of conflict in the region,” the French Foreign Ministry said. “It’s imperative they stop,” it added, without assigning blamed.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a confidant of Trump, earlier urged a decisive U.S. response against Iranian targets.“It is now time for the U.S. to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment,” Graham of South Carolina said on Twitter. “Iran will not stop their misbehavior until the consequences become more real, like attacking their refineries.”(Updates with Zarif comments in sixth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Jordan Fabian.To contact the reporters on this story: Maria Jose Valero in New York at mvalero3@bloomberg.net;Nadeem Hamid in Washington at nhamid3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Ludden at jludden@bloomberg.net, Amy Teibel, Sara MarleyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pompeo-says-no-evidence-drone-201559563.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-12	2019-09-12 00:15:58	DE	Deere & Company	Trump Rules Out Unilateral Move on Cutting Capital Gains Tax	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump has decided against making an end-run around Congress to cut the tax on capital gains by indexing gains to inflation, the White House said on Wednesday evening.The decision was announced after a meeting earlier in the day between Trump and his economic advisers, where they discussed whether to move ahead with the tax break.“President Trump was thoroughly briefed on the complex economic, legal and regulatory issues, and concluded that at this time he does not feel enough of the benefits will go to the middle class,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.Some conservatives who have urged Trump to move forward with the plan said that despite the White House’s statement, the proposal is not completely off the table.The idea isn’t “dead,” said Ryan Ellis, a conservative tax lobbyist who is pushing for the change. In August, Trump reversed his position several times on whether he was considering the tax change.It’s “not like there is some other tax cut on the table,” added Ellis, who is the president of the Center for a Free Economy.Trump last month floated the idea of indexing capital gains to inflation or cutting payroll taxes as a way to jolt the U.S. economy, which has shown warning signs of a slowdown. But he later said that cutting capital gains taxes would be seen as “somewhat elitist” because it would benefit the wealthy.Most of the benefits would go to high-income households, with the top 1% receiving 86% of the benefit, according to estimates in 2018 by the Penn Wharton Budget Model. The policy could reduce tax revenue by $102 billion over a decade, the model found.The idea of cutting the tax on investments contrasts sharply with proposals from Democratic candidates vying to challenge the president next year that are largely aimed at more heavily taxing the wealthy.As 2020 re-election campaign gets underway, Trump has repeatedly blamed the Federal Reserve for suppressing the U.S. economy and has said his trade war with China has hurt the stock market’s performance. But cutting the capital gains tax affects few middle-class taxpayers and would do little to spur economic growth.Indexing capital gains would slash tax bills for investors when selling assets such as stock or real estate by adjusting the original purchase price so no tax is paid on appreciation tied to inflation.Trump has said he could allow indexing of capital gains without congressional approval, and that he’d only need a letter from the attorney general saying he had the authority.“We’ve been talking about indexing for a long time,” Trump said Aug. 20. “And many people like indexing and it could be done very simply.”But a day later, Trump indicated he was disinclined to make the move.“I’m not looking at doing indexing. And I haven’t been seriously looking at it,” he said. “It’s not something I love.”Revamping capital gains taxes through a rule or executive order likely would face legal challenges, a concern that reportedly prompted former President George H.W. Bush’s administration to drop a similar plan.To contact the reporters on this story: Jordan Fabian in Washington at jfabian6@bloomberg.net;Laura Davison in Washington at ldavison4@bloomberg.net;Saleha Mohsin in Washington at smohsin2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, John Harney, Joshua GalluFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-rules-unilateral-move-cutting-001558884.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-10	2019-09-10 09:00:18	DE	Deere & Company	Bond Bonanza Gives Traders a Chance to Tidy Up	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.S. bond market is having a September to remember as far as debt sales are concerned. Investors ought to use this borrowing binge to their advantage.Investment-grade companies issued some $74 billion of debt last week, a record for any comparable period since at least 1972, and it looks as if an additional $35 billion is on the way in the coming days. More than $11 billion of asset-backed securities and commercial- and residential-mortgage debt is being pitched to investors, Bloomberg News’s Adam Tempkin reported. The leveraged-loan market has 12 bank meetings lined up, and a high-yield deal or two seems likely.Much of the focus of this borrowing spree has been on the companies themselves, and rightly so. After all, it’s not every day that a company like Deere & Co. can set a record for the lowest-yielding 30-year investment-grade corporate debt, or Apple Inc. issues long bonds despite holding more than $200 billion of cash and investment securities. As I’ve written before, companies’ decision-making is fairly simple: They see low yields, and they sell bonds. However, this should also be a time for investors to get introspective. Even with the wide swing in benchmark U.S. yields, spreads in corporate credit markets have remained remarkably steady. Since the start of August, yields have declined about 50 basis points on the 30-year Treasury and 40 points on the 10-year. Yet during that same period, the average investment-grade spread is up only 10 basis points. It’s roughly the same in the high-yield market, where spreads are below their 2019 average. Leveraged-loan prices have barely budged in recent weeks.In other words, there’s still time to clean up bond portfolios heading into the final months of 2019. I imagine it can be hard for investors to deviate from their strategies, considering the staggering total-return figures across debt markets this year. But looking at the gains in the context of recent history starts to paint a clearer picture:U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds: 13.7% (on pace for highest since 2009) U.S. high-yield bonds: 11.3% (highest since 2016) U.S. Treasuries: 8.4% (highest since 2011) U.S. leveraged loans: 6.4% (highest since 2016) U.S. mortgage-backed securities: 5.5% (highest since 2014) U.S. asset-backed securities: 4.3% (highest since 2011)Clearly, speculative-grade securities aren’t flying quite as high as they might initially appear. By contrast, the fact that the asset-backed securities index, stuffed with triple-A rated obligations, is quietly having its best year in recent memory indicates investors’ preference for higher-quality bonds.Of course, the blistering rally in investment-grade corporate bonds can’t be separated from the huge increase in negative-yielding debt worldwide. Its proliferation has created a conundrum for investors in Europe and Japan because even 10-year Treasuries yield less than zero after hedging for currency risk. But in both regions, the yield turns positive by picking up an average U.S. corporate bond. Tetsuo Ishihara, a U.S. macro strategist at Mizuho Securities USA who has his finger on the pulse of the Japanese markets, said in a recent report that he had heard “retail consensus in Japan is that the US 30y is heading to 0%” over the next several years. As a result, “US IG is also a target for both retail and wholesale.”Back in the U.S., some big money managers are advocating the “up in quality” trade (or, at least, voicing concerns about riskier securities). In a Financial Times Q&A about negative-yielding debt — with questions like “Is there a bubble in the bond market?” and “Will there be a damaging crash?” — JPMorgan Asset Management’s Bob Michele stressed that “Investors should improve the credit quality of their holdings and concentrate primarily on positive yielding investment grade rated bonds.” BlackRock Inc.’s Rick Rieder said the riskiest areas and those offering the least value are “loan markets, especially in sectors where credit quality and covenants are weak.” Daniel Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co., answered the same question by pointing to parts of the credit markets with deteriorating fundamentals and investor protections.None of this is to say that riskier debt will deliver imminent losses. In fact, high-quality sovereign debt was the big loser on Monday, with yields rising on Treasuries and German bunds ahead of a potentially hawkish European Central Bank meeting and amid speculation that Germany is considering a “shadow budget” to bolster public investments, providing a much-needed fiscal boost to its economy.The slow-but-steady economic growth since the financial crisis, combined with ever-accommodating central banks, has made reaching for yield the obvious trade. Sure, some energy companies crashed and burned along the way, and retailers have floundered, with discount merchandise chain Fred’s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday and Forever 21 Inc. perhaps up next. Yet by and large, companies have endured during the longest expansion on record, aided by low interest rates. Fixed-income investors have been rewarded handsomely along the way. The reasons to believe that trend can’t last are beginning to pile up. There’s the yield curve, of course, which has been inverted for just about all of the past three months. But notably, as Shawn Donnan wrote for Bloomberg Businessweek, recession is becoming a reality in at least some corners of America, like manufacturing and agriculture. U.S. consumers have been a resilient part of the recovery, but as Komal Sri-Kumar noted in a Bloomberg Opinion column last week, their spending habits are hardly a leading indicator. And their outlook for the economy is slumping.Bond investors, who clearly fear nothing more than a liquidity crunch during a rush to the exits, probably shouldn’t wait to see whether recession fears were overblown or warranted. This month’s supply offers a convenient opportunity for them to tidy up their holdings and position for a time when making money in fixed income isn’t quite so easy. To contact the author of this story: Brian Chappatta at bchappatta1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2019-09-09	2019-09-09 15:42:06	DE	Deere & Company	Failed Afghan Talks Underscore Trump’s Foreign Policy Setbacks	(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump took the presidency vowing to bring his deal-making savvy to American foreign policy, yet his love for grand gestures and personal diplomacy has fallen short with North Korea, China and the Mideast.Now Afghanistan can be added to the list. In a series of tweets on Saturday night, the president dispatched with a secret plan to host Taliban and Afghan leaders at his Camp David retreat this weekend ahead of the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. He wanted to talk directly with Taliban negotiators, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said Sunday on CBS, one of five TV interviews.“I want to look them in the eye,” the president said, according to his top diplomat. That would be reminiscent of his approach to China’s Xi Jinping and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, but with just over a year before the 2020 elections, Trump’s personal brand of diplomacy has few successes to point to.“So far, his foreign policy bluster has produced little,” said James Dorsey, senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “North Korea is not backing off nuclear weapons, Iran is proving resilient and defiant, and the ‘Deal of the Century’ looks more like a stillborn baby.”The White House rejects that assessment, saying that major foreign policy achievements have historically taken more than just months to pull together.“The president isn’t afraid to try and tackle hard problems whereas most politicians run away from them,” said Judd Deere, a White House deputy press secretary.The Afghanistan move capped a tough week. On Friday, the president’s envoy to North Korea talks said negotiations have been stalled for months. On Thursday, Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt announced his intention to depart; the vaunted Israeli-Palestinian peace plan he’s been working on has yet to be unveiled. The U.S.-China trade war drags on.Pompeo defended the president’s setbacks as signs of strength, the early price to pay for taking on intractable issues.“It’s going to take more than words,” Pompeo said. “He walked away in Hanoi from North Korea, they wouldn’t make a deal that made sense for America. He’ll do that with the Iranians. When the Chinese moved away from a trade agreement they promised they would make, he broke off those conversations too.”If the president wants to rack up some wins, here’s where he’ll have to shift the momentum.Afghanistan Trump campaigned on a vow to pull U.S. troops from intractable conflicts, a description exemplified by the Afghan war, where American forces have been mired for almost 18 years. But while Trump raised U.S. troops levels in Afghanistan early in his term to about 14,000, the Taliban forces are now at their strongest levels since being ousted from power a generation ago. Even many Republicans fear that a withdrawal could give the fundamentalist group a pathway to power, or allow al-Qaeda or Islamic State to regroup.U.S. strategy “appears to be let’s get the best deal that we can, making perfectly clear that we’re getting out irrespective of what precisely that deal looks like,” Richard Fontaine, the chief executive officer of the Center for a New American Security, said at an event in Washington on Monday.For now, the administration says, talks are over and the U.S. envoy brokering the would-be deal, Zalmay Khalilzad, has been recalled to Washington. Pompeo said the administration will keep working hard to forge an agreement, but Trump may have to decide if he starts a draw-down without winning any Taliban concessions.North KoreaAfter a year of heightening tensions over North Korean missile and nuclear tests in 2017, Trump made a historic gamble to meet Kim Jong Un in Singapore. With a short, vague agreement in hand, the two leaders went on to have two more meetings. They met in Vietnam in February, and in June, Trump stepped across the border into North Korea for a brief time, the first American president to do so. Since then? Nothing.Trump’s special envoy for North Korea talks, Stephen Biegun, said Friday he’s ready to engage, “but we cannot do this by ourselves.” Since the last Trump-Kim meeting, North Korea has ignored U.S. entreaties to negotiate and has instead conducted a wave of short-range missile tests banned by the United Nations, while complaining about U.S.-South Korea military exercises. With the two sides unable to reach an agreement on what “denuclearization” even means, analysts say Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile production has continued.Middle East PeaceA day before his inauguration, Trump tasked his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, with producing the “deal of the century”: peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Kushner labored in secret, shuttling across the Mideast with the president’s former top lawyer at the Trump Organization, Jason Greenblatt.On Thursday, with the peace plan yet to come, Greenblatt said he intends to step aside in the near future, although he’s expected to stay at the White House at least until the plan is revealed. Over two years, Trump made a series of concessions that bolstered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s agenda -- including moving the American embassy to Jerusalem, and recognizing Israeli sovereignty of the Golan Heights -- while doing nothing to lure Palestinians to the table. The administration said a peace plan is still forthcoming, but Palestinians have already ruled out talks with Trump’s team.IranMore than a year after Trump quit the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, the Islamic Republic is feeling the pain of ever-tightening sanctions. But that hasn’t been enough to force them back to the negotiating table, as Trump says he wants, and the U.S. has won little support for its “maximum pressure” campaign.American allies have been so alarmed at the administration’s approach -- even as they decry Iranian behavior in the Middle East -- that they’ve largely declined to join a U.S.-led initiative to strengthen security in the waters of the Persian Gulf, a bottleneck for global oil supplies. When Trump did reach out to allies -- saying he’d back French President Emmanuel Macron’s proposal to extend a “letter of credit” to Iran, secured by oil -- his aides quickly walked those comments back.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Trump could still meet on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly gathering in New York later this month, but Iranian leaders have said they aren’t interested in a “photo op,” a veiled reference to the president’s three meetings with Kim.ChinaTrade wars are “easy to win,” Trump has said, but so far winning has been scarce when it comes to China. Expectations are low for a round of trade talks expected to take place in early October. That’s left the latest round of U.S. and Chinese tariffs in place, with the U.S. poised to raise various levies on Oct. 1 and on Dec. 15, when China plans additional tariffs as well.With a stalemate continuing, Trump’s aides have argued he has the power to force American companies to leave China, as he suggested in August. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund estimates that the current and upcoming tariffs will shave about 0.8% off global gross domestic product growth in 2020.VenezuelaU.S. efforts to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro early this year appeared to have momentum, with more than 50 nations recognizing National Assembly leader Juan Guaido and, initially, cutting contacts with Maduro’s regime. But that momentum has stalled. Venezuelans have suffered under brutal inflation and a scarcity of basic goods and medicine, despite living in a country with the world’s biggest oil reserves. Maduro has maintained the military’s support and efforts to rally the often-divided opposition in the streets have fizzled.(Adds analyst’s comments in Afghanistan section)&#92;--With assistance from David Wainer.To contact the reporters on this story: Nick Wadhams in Washington at nwadhams@bloomberg.net;Glen Carey in Washington at gcarey8@bloomberg.net;Jennifer Jacobs in Washington at jjacobs68@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net, Ros KrasnyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/failed-afghan-talks-underscore-trumps-080000728.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-05	2019-09-05 13:01:39	DE	Deere & Company	5 Industrial Stocks to Buy Now For 2025, Says RBC Capital	Are you ready for a new industrial revolution? According to RBC Capital, artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous transportation and cloud technology could completely transform the industrial marketplace within the next 5-10 years. As a result, the firm has just put together a report of some of the most promising industrial stocks taking advantage of these critical trends. These are the stocks that RBC believes will be leading the way come 2025.“Our call to action is this: with the pace of change accelerating, Industrials stakeholders must place increased focus beyond the next few quarters and into the years ahead” wrote the firm on September 5. With this in mind, let’s leave behind the current market turmoil and take a closer look at a few of the top industrial stock picks highlighted by RBC Capital’s latest 2025 report: 1&#92;. General Motors Company (GM)In 2016, GM began preparing for the future of mobility by acquiring Cruise Automation, a self- driving vehicle startup. At the time, Cruise was developing hardware and software that would allow a vehicle to drive autonomously on the highway, and had been working on technology that would allow a vehicle to be fully autonomous. While Cruise is the company’s highest profile initiative, GM has looked to AI for other areas of their business as well. For instance, with IBM (IBM) they rolled out AI to their OnStar program, which gives them the capability of identifying information about the car and its surroundings. As an example, when fuel is low, the AI can route the vehicle to a nearby station and signal to the pump to activate and pay for the fuel.What’s more, RBC Capital believes the robo-taxi opportunity will grow exponentially through 2050. “GM is an automotive leader in the robo-taxi opportunity. This opportunity allows them to shift from selling units to miles. Selling miles could be a larger TAM [total addressable market] with higher profit, and reduced cyclicality. These factors could lead to a re-rating” cheers RBC Capital analyst Joseph Spak. In fact, this five-star analyst currently has a buy rating on GM with a $52 price target (37% upside potential). The Street also has a bullish Strong Buy consensus on GM right now: 2&#92;. Albemarle Corp (ALB)If you are looking to play the electric vehicle trend but from a slightly different angle, then Albemarle is a great stock to consider. This chemicals giant is the 1 global producer of lithium which will be used heavily in electric vehicle (EV) batteries for at least the next decade. RBC Capital’s Arun Viswanathan singles out Albemarle as one of the companies best positioning and reinvesting to win in 2025. He has a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $83 (35% upside potential).Demand for lithium-ion batteries is growing at an exciting rate, says Viswanathan, driven by the global demand for electric vehicles, mobile devices and grid storage. “We believe lithium batteries will play a key role in advancing EVs, autonomous driving and reducing air pollution” he tells investors. And as the EV industry evolves, battery requirements will also need to evolve to address great safety needs and range specifications. Auto OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), suppliers and technology companies are going to need to collaborate in order to make autonomous vehicles a reality. These ambitious projects require the work of the collective minds and expertise to be completed says Viswanathan. And that’s where Albemarle comes in: “This is why we like companies such as Albemarle, which embraces the opportunity to build mutually beneficial relationships with business partners and local communities. As the next generation of autonomous driving and AI capabilities are developed, we would expect the chemical companies such as ALB and the coatings companies to have a higher degree of collaboration and exchange of ideas” the analyst writes. The stock has a Moderate Buy Street consensus, based on the last three-months of ratings. 3&#92;. Xylem Inc (XYL)Smart water networks represent the biggest growth opportunity within the global water sector, says RBC Capital. Global water infrastructure is currently under strain from aging equipment, and there’s an urgent need for investment and improved management. The solution to this dilemma is known as smart water networks. Using connected devices, the Internet of Things and IT, municipalities can improve monitoring and diagnostics, optimize investments and ensure better infrastructure care. “No water company has advanced smart water networks and solutions more capably or aggressively than Xylem, in our view” comments RBC’s Deane Dray. This top-rated analyst recently reiterated his XYL buy rating with an $83 price target (10% upside potential).Indeed, Xylem has stated that nearly 50% of its revenues are now either smart or smart-enabled, thanks to its landmark acquisition of Sensus and disruptive Advanced Infrastructure Analytics (AIA) platform. Looking ahead management expects organic revenue growth for AIA to outpace the rest of its portfolio by at least 2x over the long-term, implying a double-digit pace of growth.For instance, its new specialized buoys in the water off of JFK and LGA airports are equipped with water test equipment to detect jet fuel spills and de- icing chemicals. Another example: A private utility in Singapore was experiencing leaks and breaks and was unable to determine the cause. Using Xylem’s high sample rate pressure sensors and analytics, the utility was able to discover and fix the problem, generating significant savings. Overall, the Street has a Moderate Buy consensus on XYL.  4&#92;. Aptiv PLC (APTV)Next comes Aptiv- a global auto parts company based in Ireland. “We continue to believe Aptiv is a leader and key enabler of autonomous driving” enthuses RBC's Joseph Spak. The company snapped up self-driving specialist Ottomatika (a Carnegie Mellon spin-off and winner of the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge) in 2015. In 2017, GM also splashed out on nuTonomy, a leading developer of autonomous driving software solutions- further strengthening its position in the global autonomous mobility market. While the autonomous mobility on-demand opportunity is still in its early days, Aptiv expects initial driverless tests to occur by the end of 2020, with increased scale as hardware becomes automotive grade in 2025. Management has indicated they believe Aptiv’s autonomous driving revenue will be $500mm by 2025. At scale, the company expects 70%-80% of its autonomous mobility revenue to come from recurring revenue streams.As a result, Spak concludes: “The company has positioned the portfolio to be a key supplier for the signal and power architecture needed in vehicles of the future, autonomous driving and connectivity. Aptiv is also adopting new business models and is one of the first companies to show real- world monetization of their autonomous vehicle investment.”In a July 31 report aptly titled ‘The Cream Rises to the Top’ the analyst reiterated his buy rating on Aptiv while ramping up the price target from $88 to $97 (15% upside potential). Analysts rate the stock Moderate Buy, according to the Street consensus.  5&#92;. Deere & Company (DE)Recent UN estimates indicate one in nine people experienced chronic hunger in 2018 with the total global population continuing to grow. To help meet rising food requirements while coping with limited natural resources, the firm believes smart farming will become increasingly important. “We expect the trend toward “smart farming” -- including AI/machine learning -- to accelerate as farmers search for ways to maximize productivity/yield, improve crop quality, and reduce costs/improve machine uptime in the face of relatively low commodity prices and stressed natural resources (land/water)” writes the firm’s Seth Weber. This can include everything from using drones to spray crops, to generating crop insights from advanced data analysis.He continues: “We see Deere as well positioned for this trend.” Indeed, Weber currently has a buy rating on DE with a $175 price target (15% upside potential). In particular, the analyst expects that farming machinery, like cars, will become increasingly autonomous. This should reduce the need for farm workers, while improving productivity. So far GPS guidance and assisted steering have been widely available in tractors, but self-driving systems have remained elusive. As Weber notes, John Deere built its first autonomous navigation system in the 1990s with NASA, and much more recently unveiled an autonomous tractor at the CES 2019 conference.However, regulatory hurdles and gaining comfort with unmanned equipment are potential challenges- so watch this space.

2019-08-29	2019-08-29 15:24:44	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Appoints New CEO, With Allen Staying on as Chairman	(Bloomberg) -- Deere & Co. is promoting John May to lead the tractor-making giant through a tough agricultural environment, with outgoing Chief Executive Officer Samuel Allen, 66, to stay on as chairman.The Moline, Illinois-based company is splitting up the CEO and chairman roles for now as it grapples with American farmers balking at equipment purchases amid a yearlong trade war with China and weather that has disrupted planting.May was recently “put into the training ground to be promoted,” said Stephens Inc. analyst Ashish Gupta, serving as president and chief operating officer since April. He also headed China operations earlier in his career. May will join the board immediately and take over as CEO on Nov. 4. Gupta said he expected May to assume the chairman role next year.The promotion was a “widely expected, traditional transition plan,” Gupta said. “Sam Allen has been long-serving, and John May has been in front of Wall Street,” having done meet-and-greets with analysts.Deere has historically promoted from within, and former chief executive officers have been internal operating managers who assume chief operating officer roles ahead of time. May previously rain the company’s agriculture division, as well as its precision agriculture business.“I wouldn’t anticipate any surprise, and we’re not seeing that in the share price movement,” Chris Ciolino, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence said. Deere shares were little changed after the announcement. They gained as much as 2.7% earlier Thursday.The company is engaging in a fresh cost-cutting drive to defend margins amid rising trade tensions and crop prices near multi-year lows.Steps include boosting organizational efficiency through a footprint assessment. The company is also looking to make investments “with the most opportunity for differentiation,” including precision agriculture, it said earlier this month.(Adds analyst comments in third, fourth paragprahs.)To contact the reporter on this story: Lydia Mulvany in Chicago at lmulvany2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-appoints-ceo-allen-staying-152444968.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-26	2019-08-26 18:06:06	DE	Deere & Company	10 Companies Using AI to Grow	According to Fortune Business Insights, the global AI (artificial intelligence) market in 2018 was $21 billion. It's expected to grow 33% annually between 2019 and 2026 to $203 billion. The companies that are using the technology to grow are the stocks you want to own in the future. These stocks to buy are companies that participate in some of the areas seeing an increase in demand for AI. Areas that include: 5G technology, connected devices, cloud-based services and applications, autonomous driving, machine learning, fintech, etc. The uses of AI are unlimited.   * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects The companies that are willing to take risks and lean on this technology are the ones whose stocks will be rewarded. Retailers, providers of customer service, and other customer-facing businesses can benefit from the use of AI. It's not just for business-to-business. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere are the 10 AI stocks to buy that I see winning the race.  AI Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN)Source: mirtmirt / Shutterstock.com If I only could mention one company that's using AI to rule the world, I would go with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) every time. It is always on the leading edge when it comes to figuring out what its customers want and then giving it to them. Fast Company recently discussed Amazon's machine learning system Rekognition, which it sells to advertising and marketing companies, but it also sells Rekognition to police forces, immigration services, and others looking to keep an eye on the bad guys. The ACLU recently tested the system and found that it was wrong about 20% of the time confusing California state legislators for those who have been arrested in the past and are in a public database. &quot;Amazon is setting us on a path where armed government agents could make split second judgements based on a flawed algorithm's cold testimony,&quot; stated Evan Greer, the deputy director of the digital rights advocacy group, Fight for the Future. &quot;Innocent people could be detained, deported, or falsely imprisoned because a computer decided they looked afraid when being questioned by authorities.&quot;This is the downside of AI. However, somehow, I think Jeff Bezos will figure out how to make Rekognition do good rather than evil. Why? It's better for shareholders. Deere (DE)Source: mark stephens photography / Shutterstock.com Farmers haven't been doing too well in the last two years. It's a big reason why Deere & Co. (NYSE:DE) is only up 4.8%, including dividends, year to date through Aug. 21, about one-quarter the performance of the U.S. total market. On the one hand, the challenge presented to farmers of feeding a world that's expected to be 10-billion strong by 2050, is an exciting one. However, it's also a daunting one. After all, there are already food shortages. What's going to happen when the world's population hits double digits? Sheer chaos, that's what. However, starting in 2013, Deere began to plot a vision of the future farm where all the machinery would be autonomously operated with the farmer monitoring everything from his home. Since then, it has evolved to include AI, computer vision, and machine learning. Agriculture is surprisingly well-suited to technology despite its low-tech reputation. &quot;It's very clear that we need to be on the vanguard of these technologies - there's a lot of economic upside and profitability as well as sustainability that can be unlocked for farmers through them,&quot; John Stone, SVP of John Deere's Intelligent Solutions Group, told Forbes recently.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More Deere acquired Silicon Valley-based Blue River in 2017 to up its tech-savviness. Since then, it has been able to take AI to the next level. Ultimately, it hopes to save its customers enough money using AI that they can plow into newer Deere equipment. It's looking at the big picture. Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) pedigree as a machine learning and AI company that just happens to sell ads gives it a significant advantage over its peers in the cloud infrastructure game. Google's search engine was created to manage public information better. Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were merely interested in creating algorithms to fine-tune the data. At its core, Google is about data analytics. In 2014, it acquired DeepMind Technologies in the UK, and that pushed it further into AI and machine learning. &quot;Managers at Google Cloud want to use the corporate pedigree, and undisputed AI leadership, to help companies build new business models using data analytics and AI. You can see how that might appeal to large enterprises struggling to stay one step ahead of the next Amazon.com,&quot; Forbes Senior Contributor Jon Markman stated in May.

Since then, it has lost about 15% of its value despite excellent second-quarter earnings. As a result, former General Electric (NYSE:GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, who became a Twilio director June 20, jumped into the market and bought over a million dollars of TWLO stock. Twilio, for those unaware, is a cloud-based communications company whose platform allows developers to embed voice, messaging, and video directly into software applications. It brings together voice, video, SMS, MMS, and real-time IP communications all under a single platform. Most importantly, it's all pay-as-you-go.  In the second quarter, Twilio's revenue rose 86% to $275 million with a profit of 3 cents, 200% higher than its year-ago loss of 3 cents.

2019-08-25	2019-08-25 11:09:30	DE	Deere & Company	3 Major Casualties of China’s New Tariffs	The US-China trade tensions have taken a turn for the worse in recent days. On Friday, China announced new tariffs on $75 billion worth of imported American goods, and a resumption of the 5% tariff on automotive parts. The new tariffs, to set between 5% and 10% and come into effect in steps on September 1 and December 15, include levies on electronics and machinery. President Trump responded in his customary fashion, by Tweet, saying in part, “Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME and making your products in the USA.” He added that the trade situation represents an opportunity for the US.Investors don’t seem to agree. Markets reacted to China’s and Trump’s announcements by plunging. Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones averages fell 2.4% in Friday’s trading, and the tech-heavy NASDAQ slipped 3%. The losses were widespread, and not confined to any one sector of the market. Major companies with large exposure to the China trade were especially hard-hit. Here we take a look at three of those casualties. Apple, Inc. (AAPL)The world’s second largest publicly traded company lost 4.62% in the Friday market rout, falling over $9.80 per share. That Apple would prove particularly sensitive to shifts in the ‘trade war’ is no surprise; the Chinese market is Apple’s second largest, accounting for more than 18% of the company’s total revenues. The tit-for-tat tariff actions taken by the US and China have threatened the trade in electronics – and Apple’s supply chain. In response, the company is considering a drastic measure: the shift of 15% to 30% of its production from China to other areas of Southeast Asia. That Apple would consider such a drastic move underlines the risks of the trade war for the high-tech sector.Pointing out that nearly all of Apple’s flagship product line, the iPhone, is assembled in China, 4-star analyst Daniel Ives, from Wedbush, described Friday’s trade-war ramp-up as “a gut punch to Cupertino.” Even with that, however, Ives still sees Apple as a stock worth buying, and his $245 price target on AAPL shares suggest an upside of 20%.Despite the beating it took on Friday, AAPL retains its Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. The stock has received 16 buys, 10 holds, and 1 sell in the past three months, with 6 of those buy ratings coming in just the last three weeks. Apple stock is trading for $202, and the average price target o $226 gives it an 11% upside potential. Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT)Caterpillar was hurting before this latest iteration of the trade conflict. The company is a major manufacturer and supplier of heavy construction and excavation equipment, with customers around the world. The general slowdown in the global economy has been eating into Cat’s sales, including in China, and the escalation in the tariff fight has made a difficult situation worse.The deterioration of Caterpillar’s position is made clear by the company’s losses in Friday’s trading: CAT stock fell 3.25%. The Friday losses come after CAT slipped more than 12% in August, following a 10.25% EPS reported for the second quarter.Cat hasn’t got an easy way out of its difficulties, either. According to 4-star analyst Jerry Revich, of Goldman Sachs, the construction industry is seeing rising inventories of trucks and construction machines; he predicts that there will have to be production cuts on the manufacturing end next year. In line with that, he gives CAT a Hold rating and a $130 price target.Stephens analyst Ashish Gupta agrees, saying, “For Caterpillar, excess dealer inventory means lower reported sales in coming quarters.” He goes on to add that, “The U.S. China trade war and Chinese impact on global commodity markets are reasons to avoid the stock right now. China accounts for a huge portion of global metals and energy consumption. A slowing Chinese economy has large ripple effects for the entire resource industry—a key consumer of Caterpillar products.” Ashish rates CAT as a Sell, with a low $100 price target.CAT is the lowest rated of the stocks in this list, with a Hold from the analyst consensus. The consensus rating is based on 7 buys, 5 holds, and 4 sells set in the past three months. The stocks’ share price of $114 and average price target of $136 still give it an upside potential of 19%. Deere & Company (DE)Like Caterpillar, Deere is a major manufacturer of heavy machinery; in this case, farm and agricultural equipment. And also like Caterpillar, Deere has been suffering as worldwide economic conditions have slowed down. And in a final similarity, Deere reported disappointing EPS in its most recent quarter, missing the forecast by 3.32%.China’s largest import from the US is agricultural products, especially soybeans. As the Chinese government cracks down on trade, with retaliatory measures, US farmers are watching their prospects for a profitable year go up in smoke. And that leads them to cut back on sales and maintenance of their heavy equipment, dealing a double punch to Deere in its domestic market. At the same time, the company is facing direct headwinds from the new Chinese tariffs. Deere stock lost 5.37% in Friday's market retreat. Rising factory production costs and bad weather, which would have been news stories in a normal year, have simply dealt additional blows to an already vulnerable company.At the same time, even with this perfect storm working against it, DE shares are getting upbeat reviews from Wall Street’s analysts. Writing from Credit Suisse, 4-star analyst Jamie Cook says of the quarterly report, “…expectations were sufficiently low heading into the print reflecting macro/trade war uncertainty, commodity prices and unfavorable weather which delayed planting,” and reiterates his belief that the company will beat the headwinds in the long run. He raises his price target on Deere to $197 (up 12%), suggesting an upside of 34%.From BMO Capital, Joel Tiss acknowledges slowing North American sales and a flat early-order program, but points out, “…the overall sales value was higher because of better take rates of innovative technologies and bigger machines.” Like Cook, Tiss gives Deere a Buy rating. His $175 implies a 19% upside potential.Deere is another stock with a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, this one based on 9 buys and 4 holds. The stock is selling for $147, has a $167 average price target, and an upside potential of 14%.Visit TipRanks’ Analysts’ Top Stocks tool, and find out which stocks are trending now Wall Street’s top market watchers.Disclosure: This author is long on AAPL.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-major-casualties-china-tariffs-110405708.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-08-23	2019-08-23 20:16:41	DE	Deere & Company	Soybeans Sink as China Hikes Tariffs on American Farm Products	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. The news just turned gloomier for U.S. farmers.China announced on Friday that it will impose additional tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. goods in retaliation for President Donald Trump’s latest planned levies on Chinese imports. The measures include an added 5% tariff on soybeans and 10% on American pork as of Sept. 1. Corn and cotton products were also on the list.November soybean futures in Chicago erased early gains and closed down 1.4%, extending losses after Trump said he’ll announce a response to the latest Chinese tariffs Friday afternoon. Cotton and hog futures both slumped, as did shares in crop handler Andersons Inc. and tractor maker Deere & Co.Corn also declined, although with China no longer a big player in U.S. corn, traders are more focused on Midwest crop development than the trade war.“This escalation will affect us not because of the increasing tariff on our sales, which have been at a virtual standstill for months, but through time,” Davie Stephens, president of the American Soybean Association, said in an emailed statement. “The longevity of this situation means worsening circumstances for soy growers who still have unsold product from this past season and new crops in the ground this season.”China, the world’s top soy importer, has already had a 25% tariff on the U.S. crop and has curbed purchases of American farm products for months as trade tensions simmer between the nations.“As far as supply and demand, it means nothing because buyers weren’t buying anyways,” said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at INTL FCStone. “It’s more about making headlines than it is actually changing the amount of soybeans that flow between the U.S. and China.”Tensions have been increasing in the American farm community in recent weeks. Farmers leveled criticism at Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue at a fair in Minnesota earlier this month over Trump’s yearlong trade war with China, which has eroded demand for agricultural products and pressured already low prices. Top Trump administration officials also met this week to consider options for quelling a backlash in the Midwest over recent biofuel policy moves.The spat between the U.S. and China has spurred added demand for South American soybeans. Export prices at Brazil’s Paranagua port are widening versus U.S. Gulf supply, Commodity3 data show.U.S. farmers will begin harvesting this year’s soybean crops starting in September. Stockpiles were expected to balloon to an all-time high in the season that ends this month as American export demand dims.The trade-war escalations are going to keep some U.S. supplies out of export markets, said Ken Eriksen, senior vice president at Agribusiness Intelligence IHS Markit.“The seesaw, back-and-forth action of the last few weeks, this is just more damaging to seeing soybean exports, pork exports and beef exports to continue going to China,” he said.&#92;--With assistance from Michael Hirtzer.To contact the reporters on this story: Megan Durisin in London at mdurisin1@bloomberg.net;Ashley Robinson in Winnipeg (Non BLP Loc) at arobinson193@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, James Attwood, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soybeans-sink-two-week-low-123417946.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-08-23	2019-08-23 18:46:28	DE	Deere & Company	Trump Orders Biofuel Boost in Bid to Temper Farm State Anger	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump, seeking to tamp down political fallout in U.S. farm states essential to his re-election, has ordered federal agencies to shift course on relieving some oil refineries of requirements to use biofuel such as corn-based ethanol.Trump and top cabinet leaders decided late Thursday they wouldn’t make changes to just-issued waivers that allow small refineries to ignore the mandates, but agreed to start boosting biofuel-blending quotas to make up for expected exemptions beginning in 2021. The outcome was described by four people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named before a formal announcement could be made.The decision was reached after a flurry of White House meetings this week on the issue, which divides two of Trump’s top political constituencies: rural Americans and the oil industry. With the move, Trump is largely siding with farmers, ethanol producers and political leaders in Iowa that have accused the president of turning his back on the industry.But the administration’s shift risks blowback in Pennsylvania and other battleground states, where blue-collar refinery workers have held rallies to push for relief from U.S. biofuel quotas they say are too expensive. The largest coalition of U.S. building trades unions on Thursday warned Trump that changing course on exemptions would betray the president’s “campaign promise to protect every manufacturing job.” Encouraging E15“President Trump is committed to ensuring our country not only continues to be the agricultural envy of the world, but also remains energy independent and secure,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said.Iowa-based biodiesel producer Renewable Energy Group Inc. climbed as much as 4.5% on the news, and traded up 5.5% to $11.64 at 1:50 p.m. in New York. Pacific Ethanol Inc. and Green Plains Inc. briefly gained before resuming losses as the U.S.-China trade war showed signs of deepening with the latter announcing plans to levy additional tariffs on American-made goods and Trump promising to respond.Administration officials agreed to the broad contours of a renewable fuel plan, including further moves to encourage the use of E15 gasoline containing 15% ethanol, beyond the 10% variety common across the U.S. E15 could be dispensed alongside conventional ethanol blends at filling stations, under the drafted changes.EPA’s PlanUnder the tentative plan, the Environmental Protection Agency also will give a 500-million-gallon boost to the amount of conventional renewable fuel, such as ethanol, that must be used in 2020. A separate quota for biodiesel, typically made from soybeans, would get a 250 million gallon increase.Additionally, the administration will enhance a program meant to expand U.S. fueling infrastructure and get more ethanol into the system. The EPA will adopt an Agriculture Department assessment of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with renewable fuel, and will expand environmental credits encouraging automakers to produce “flex-fuel” vehicles that can run on high-ethanol gasoline. Iowa BacklashThe EPA has drawn intense criticism for its Aug. 9 decision to exempt 31 refineries from 2018 biofuel-blending requirements. Although federal law authorizes the waivers for small refineries facing an economic hardship, the number of those exemptions has surged during the Trump administration, and biofuel producers say they are being handed out too freely.The backlash has been most severe in Iowa, the nation’s top producer of ethanol and the corn used in its manufacture. It is also critical for Trump’s re-election; the state twice voted for Barack Obama before voting to send Trump to the White House in 2016.Trump’s Democratic challengers have seized on the issue, with frontrunner Joe Biden accusing the president of lying to farmers and abandoning a campaign promise to “unleash ethanol.” However, EPA officials and oil industry leaders say the waivers haven’t harmed domestic ethanol demand and blame a glut of the product for suppressing prices. Trump’s trade war with China has exacerbated the industry’s economic challenges. As with U.S.-grown agricultural products, including soybeans, ethanol faces retaliatory tariffs in China. Latest BlowAgainst the backdrop of tariffs, the exemptions delivered another blow to the U.S. Midwest, where guaranteed domestic ethanol demand helps provide a floor of support for corn farmers and buttresses swings in commodity prices. Ethanol refining accounts for about 40% of U.S. corn consumption.American “agriculture has a problem if ethanol doesn’t do well,” Green Plains Inc. chief executive officer Todd Becker said in a telephone interview on Thursday. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company created a political action committee last month, and Becker told analysts in May that Green Plains plans to “engage” 2020 U.S. presidential candidates on ethanol policies. Becker said he “can’t fault” Trump for getting tough on China, but the combination of the trade war and small refinery exemptions was causing too much pain. “You don’t fight China and then give out SREs,” Becker said. “Farmers are furious now.”Biofuel QuotasAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue had urged the White House to rescind some of the recently issued waivers -- at least those for refineries tied to “big” oil companies -- according to an Aug. 20 memo obtained by Bloomberg.EPA officials successfully argued that would be illegal.Instead, Trump directed the agency to increase biofuel quotas to make up for the exemptions, a so-called “reallocation” that will effectively boost the burden for larger refineries that are not eligible to win waivers. The EPA will start incorporating expected exemptions into annual biofuel quotas beginning with 2021.Oil industry leaders blasted the tentative agreement on Friday, saying it would do little for U.S. farmers while hurting domestic refiners.“Reallocation would be a major hit to fuel manufacturers in Pennsylvania and Ohio -- and refinery workers across the country -- with zero benefit to ethanol,” said Derrick Morgan, a senior vice president with the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. “Those celebrating will ultimately be foreign biofuel producers whose biodiesel is being imported to help meet mandates.” ‘Arbitrary’ PolicyThe EPA typically sets each year’s biofuel blending requirements by Nov. 30 of the preceding year, except for biodiesel quotas, which are set two years in advance. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, there’s a specific mandate for biodiesel, but the soybean-based product can also be used to satisfy an implied 15 billion gallon quota for conventional renewable fuel.Frank Macchiarola, a vice president at the American Petroleum Institute, called the drafted plan a “rushed, arbitrary policy.”“We hope the administration walks back from the brink of a disastrous political decision that punishes American drivers,” Macchiarola said. “Bad policy is bad politics.”Although the tentative plan was meant to assuage biofuel allies, it’s not clear it was having the intended effect Friday, amid industry skepticism the EPA will follow through on the agreement. Iowa officials are preparing to visit Washington for a formal rollout of the policy changes.Biodiesel industry advocates say they can produce more fuel -- and the Trump administration needs to take that into account.“With a level playing field in biodiesel trade in 2018, domestic producers increased output by several hundred million gallons,” said National Biodiesel Board spokesman Paul Winters. “We can continue to do so -- as long as EPA stops using RFS waivers to destroy demand and put biodiesel producers out of business.” (Updates with more details on tentative plan from ninth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Jennifer Jacobs.To contact the reporters on this story: Jennifer A.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, and chairman of the Business Roundtable, for driving these changes. He has been discussing the need for a more inclusive form of capitalism, both in public speeches and in his letters to shareholders, for some time.But turning this aircraft carrier around won’t be easy, in large part because of the group's own history. Indeed, the Roundtable has spent most of the past four decades advocating against the interests of those exact stakeholders. To cite some of the more notable examples:&#92;-- It fought the rise of labor unions and pro-union legislation;&#92;-- Helped to defeat antitrust bills;&#92;-- Prevented the formation of the Consumer Protection Agency;&#92;-- Opposed corporate governance changes to make boards of directors and CEOs more accountable to stockholders;&#92;-- Fought proper accounting of stock options given as compensation to executives and insiders;&#92;-- Opposed increases in the national minimum wage (it now favors increases);&#92;-- Lobbied to prevent restrictions on executive compensation;&#92;-- Fought legislation that would create cleaner energy and address climate change;&#92;-- Pushed for corporate income-tax cuts;&#92;-- Supported anti-consumer Supreme Court decisions, including the fiction that corporations are legal people, and that campaign donations equal speech.   The Roundtable might respond that this is all in the past. Let’s hope so. But the organization has an even greater challenge: Scan the list of 181 signatories to the recent memo and it's a Who’s Who of corporate behavior that has burdened and disadvantaged the very stakeholders they will now champion.Consider a few of the signatories:&#92;-- Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.:  Two of the most valuable companies in the world are famously effective at using various tax dodges to avoid paying their fair share. I can recall when the Internal Revenue Service went after maneuvers that serve no valid business purpose other than tax avoidance. Consider that what isn't paid in tax by those who avoid them must be made up for by those who do -- mostly average Americans who also happen to be customers of these companies.The share of federal tax revenue paid by corporations has dropped by two-thirds in the past seven decades -- from 32% in 1952 to 10% in 2013; and corporate income tax as a share of gross domestic product has fallen from about 6% in 1946 to about 1.5% today.&#92;-- Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and American Express Co.: Show good faith -- working with card-issuing banks as needed -- by simplifying the incomprehensible small print in the cardholder agreement and spell out in clear language the terms and penalties for late payment. Second, do the same for mandatory arbitration clauses that take away the right of customers to seek redress in public courts.&#92;-- Ameriprise Financial Inc., Morgan Stanley and Principal Financial Group Inc: The brokers and insurers on the list have been zealous opponents of the fiduciary rule. Instead, they prefer a less stringent rule that allows them to sell products that are better for them than for their customers. Until those firms -- and Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan are in this group -- embrace a higher duty of care, their gestures toward stakeholders are hollow. Oh, and they should drop the requirement that customers agree to mandatory arbitration clauses as one of the conditions for opening a brokerage account.&#92;-- Coca Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc.: For years these companies have been helping the American public achieve record levels of diabetes and obesity by selling health-damaging sugary drinks. They should acknowledge and warn customers of the consequences of consuming too much of their products, and accept the same kinds of taxes and health warnings now affixed to cigarettes.&#92;-- Deere & Co.: The maker of farm machinery has led the fight against customers, insisting that they not make repairs to the equipment they own, and denying them access to parts and instructions. Repairs can only be made by Deere service technicians in what has come to be known as a “repair monopoly.” Apple, by the way, does the same thing.&#92;-- Walmart Inc. and McDonald's Corp.: Both were steadfast opponents of increases in minimum wages for years. Although both now offer higher minimum pay, it was only after a tightening labor market forced them to increase wages. But this wasn't a case of corporate altruism -- their stores were messy and employees were sullen, and pay increases were part of plans to keep ill-treated customers from defecting. (McDonald's is not a signatory to the Roundtable memo).For the Roundtable commitment to be meaningful, the signatories are going to have to alter their behavior in ways large and small, and maybe even in ways that aren't always optimal for maximizing short-term profits. Still, we should be encouraged. But the proof will be in the follow through and the actual actions of the Roundtable members.(Corrects to clarify section on credit-card companies to indicate the role of banks in setting terms for customers.   )(1) In “The Shareholder Value Myth,” Lynn Stout explained how the entire theory is based on a misreading of a 1919 court case -- Dodge vs. Ford – at the time, both privately held, non-public companies.To contact the author of this story: Barry Ritholtz at britholtz3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Barry Ritholtz is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2019-08-16	2019-08-16 16:12:57	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Eyes Cost Cuts to Defend Margins Squeezed by Farm Pain	(Bloomberg) -- Deere & Co. isn’t selling as many tractors these days, with trade wars raging and crop prices near multi-year lows. Since many of its farmer customers aren’t buying, the company is now looking for ways to save.The Moline, Illinois-based company said Friday it’s conducting a thorough assessment of its cost structure and taking actions to be more “nimble and efficient.”Steps include boosting organizational efficiency through a footprint assessment. The company is also looking to make investments “with the most opportunity for differentiation,” including precision agriculture. It’s aiming for a 15% structural operating profit by 2022.Executives said the company had already taken some measures in the third quarter, and was contemplating some for the fourth. All in all, these total just $25 million. More details will come in the fourth quarter call, executives said.The reductions could be more long-term structural changes to adjust to current market dynamics, which could take years, said Chris Ciolino, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Operating profit in the company’s biggest money-making segment, agriculture machinery, fell 24% from a year ago. Higher production costs was one of the culprits, along with lower shipment volumes. Deere is also forecasting slightly higher costs as a percentage of net sales for its equipment operations -- about 77% compared with 76% previously.&#92;--With assistance from Karen Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Lydia Mulvany in Chicago at lmulvany2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-turns-costs-agriculture-operating-121758392.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-16	2019-08-16 15:37:01	DE	Deere & Company	Deere Gains as Savings Vow, Forecast Ease Investors’ Alarm	(Bloomberg) -- Deere & Co.’s shares jumped after it pledged to lower its costs and offered an outlook cut that was less than some investors feared as it fights to overcome a disruptive trade war and a slowing global economy.The world’s top tractor maker gained the most in seven months, climbing as much as 5.1% after announcing earnings Friday to recover some of the losses earlier in the week. While quarterly earnings trailed the average estimate, its guidance and a vow to boost efficiency may have comforted investors buffeted by a tumultuous two weeks in agriculture markets.American growers are resisting major purchases as the U.S.-China trade war stretches into a second year and after a season when wild weather batters their crops. An escalation in trade tensions led to China halting purchases of American farm products, while corn prices tanked Monday when the U.S. government came out with acreage and yield numbers that exceeded estimates.“There’s been so much negative sentiment with the erosion of the trade environment and then the disastrous WASDE report,” said Chris Ciolino, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “People were bracing for more doom and gloom.”With production costs in some segments rising, the Moline, Illinois based company said it’s “initiating a series of actions to make the organization more structurally efficient and profitable.”For fiscal 2019, equipment sales are now projected to rise about 4%, with net income forecast at $3.2 billion, Deere said in a statement. Three months ago, it predicted 5% equipment sales growth and $3.3 billion profit.While Deere remains positive on general economic conditions, it lowered guidance for construction and forestry and now expects fiscal 2019 economic growth in the U.S. to be in line with 2018, downgrading a previous forecast for acceleration.On a net basis, quarterly profit slipped to $899 million from $910 million a year ago. Sales fell 3%.“We view Deere’s 3Q results and outlook as more resilient than feared,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts said in a note to clients.(Adds comment in the third paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Karen Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Lydia Mulvany in Chicago at lmulvany2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net, Reg GaleFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deere-cuts-guidance-trade-war-105940365.html?.tsrc=rss

Moline, Ill.-based Deere said it had net income of $899 million, or $2.81 a share, in the quarter to July 28, compared with $910 million, or $2.78 a share, in the year-earlier period.

Allen said in a statement. &quot;Concerns about export-market access, near-term demand for commodities such as soybeans, and overall crop conditions, have caused many farmers to postpone major equipment purchases. At the same time, general economic conditions remain positive and are contributing to strong results for Deere's construction and forestry business.&quot; The company is expecting company equipment sales to rise about 4% in fiscal 2019. Net sales and revenues are expected to rise about 5%, while net income is expected to come to about $3.2 billion.

2019-08-12	2019-08-12 20:01:33	DE	Deere & Company	5 Top Stock Trades for Tuesday: ROKU, PINS, NFLX, MCD	It was a tough day on Wall Street, with investors hitting the exits on trade worries, concerns over Hong Kong, and as bond prices again rally. The markets are often volatile in August, and 2019 is proving to be no exception. Here are a few top stock trades to watch. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: RokuAt one point, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock was up 8% on Monday. The move adds to Roku's three-day gain, with shares up more than 30% since reporting earnings last week.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMonday's move was inspired by the analysts at Nomura, who upped their price target to $150 per share. Despite the big move, shares are hardly overbought -- at least technically speaking via the RSI indicator (blue circle).  * 7 Stocks Under $7 to Invest in Now A move into the upper $130s or lower $140s is still possible, with a Fibonacci extension near the latter. If the overall selling pressure in the market is too great, though, Roku may not be immune. In that case, see if prior short-term channel resistance (black line) can act as support on a pullback. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: PinterestPinterest (NYSE:PINS) outperformed the market on Monday, but did so in a very strange way.In midday trading, shares suddenly spiked higher, surging to $36 before retreating and giving up almost all of its 6% intraday gain. $34 remains a tough level for the stock, even after its strong earnings report last week.That said, it continues to hold $32 and its 8-day moving average. However, like other stocks, support may give way should overall market selling pressure pick up. Keep an eye on $32 support, and $31.50 just below that. Breakout traders may consider going long PINS on a close over $34. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: NetflixNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock held up okay on Monday, but its chart still looks concerning. Below, the $305 to $310 level is a concern. It will put the August lows near $297 on the table. A close below that opens up NFLX to a decline down the $270 to $275 area.On a rally, see if NFLX stock can reclaim its 20-day moving average. If it can, its 200-day is the next upside target. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: DeereDeere (NYSE:DE) stock is looking ugly. Shares rallied into former support at $155 as well as its 200-day moving average before tumbling more than 4% on Monday. The company reports earnings on Friday, adding more volatility into the stock.At this point, DE stock either needs to reclaim the $155/200-day moving average area or pull back to range support near $135. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: McDonald'sMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD) stock may be a flight-to-safety name, but shares are under pressure on a day where the stock market is in decline as well.The selling pressure comes as shares run into channel resistance. Now I'm looking for a test of channel support. That would put MCD in play somewhere near $213. As much as I'd hate to see MCD break channel support, a dip to $210 and the 50-day moving average would also be attractive.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-08-10	2019-08-10 10:00:00	DE	Deere & Company	Facebook, Twitter Pressed to Help Prevent Domestic Terrorism	(Bloomberg) -- Social media companies came under fire again last week after another mass shooting was linked to a hate-filled manifesto posted online.For years, Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. largely reacted to horrific events after the fact. Now they’re now being asked by politicians to take a more proactive approach to prevent domestic terrorism. But while the companies certainly want to make their platforms safe and not be seen as nests for violence or hatred, the proposals from politicians wouldn’t be easy to achieve and could even backfire on some of the proponents.The attacker in El Paso, Texas, who killed 22 in a rampage at a Walmart Inc. store last Saturday, posted a racist screed on message site 8chan minutes before the attack began, laced with words and phrases President Donald Trump has used in reference to immigrants and the media.On Monday, the president ordered federal officials to work with social media companies to identify people who may perpetrate mass shootings before they can act. He asked tech companies to find “red flags” in social media postings that would help deter shooters before they strike and the FBI has put out a call for a contract on social media monitoring technology to parse public user postings to predict threats.On Friday, the White House called a meeting with tech companies to discuss violent online extremism. The group “focused on how technology can be leveraged to identify potential threats, to provide help to individuals exhibiting potentially violent behavior, and to combat domestic terror,” according to White House spokesman Judd Deere.The requests are complicated to put in place. FBI monitoring would go against Facebook’s and Twitter’s rules that bar the use of data from their sites for government surveillance. And efforts to take down posts that espouse the anti-immigrant and anti-minority sentiment often expressed by mass shooters could also end up capturing posts from politicians, including Trump himself. Social media companies are already accused by Trump and other politicians of harboring anti-conservative bias.Still, the companies may be able to come up with strategies for thwarting future attacks if they look at the online forums popular with people with extreme views that have been linked to violent events and collaborate about what they find. The proclivity for mass murder might be near-impossible to predict in an individual, especially when combined with other factors like easy access to guns. But Facebook and others have already built up systems to counter Islamic terrorist content. Here’s a look at how they could apply similar tactics to domestic white nationalists, without FBI surveillance:1&#92;. HashingFacebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Twitter, Microsoft Corp. and others are part of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, which shares information about terrorist threats. If one of the companies discovers terrorist content, it can put a unique identifier of the image or video, called a “hash,” into a database, which helps every other company quickly find it on their own sites and take it down. Both Facebook and Twitter said the systems have helped them remove more than 90% of ISIS and al-Qaeda content before any users report it.After the attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March, the companies said they would expand the group’s mandate to include “violent extremism in all its forms.” But it’s unclear if the system is working yet.Facebook, Twitter and YouTube wouldn’t say specifically whether they shared hashes related to the El Paso shooting. Facebook said it used the system after the attack occurred to find and ban clips of the shooter’s manifesto and anything praising the attack, but only on the company’s own properties.2&#92;. Shared definitionsTech companies have agreed on definitions for certain kinds of illegal content, like that which exploits children. They have a system for categorizing the content by level of severity, and then can send a signal to their peers so other companies could also move to take it down. But there is no such standard set of rules for white supremacist content.“You can’t just say something is white supremacist unless you define really specifically what that is,” said Alex Stamos, a former Facebook security executive, now an adjunct professor at Stanford University. “That’s one of the real challenges of the system.”While companies can move quickly to share information about posts glorifying or depicting an attack so that they can be taken down, it’s difficult to do without catching legitimate news organizations in the mix as they report on the events.That shouldn’t be an excuse, said Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a senior adviser at the Counter Extremism Project.“This is the technology industry -- they solve enormous problems,” Farid said. “I don’t buy the argument that it’s too complicated.”3&#92;. Blocking links to 8chanBefore the El Paso attack, the killer posted a manifesto on 8chan. It was the third instance of white supremacist mass violence linked to the controversial message board this year. Hosting websites including Cloudflare Inc. have cut off 8chan as a customer. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter could sever direct links to that website.“If you’re Facebook or YouTube, there’s not a lot of things you can do to stop 8chan,” said Stamos, “but you can at least increase the gap between users of your site and of that site, so that there are fewer opportunities to lure people there.”Making the platform harder to find would make it more difficult to recruit people to extremist groups, according to Eshwar Chandrasekharan, a Ph.D. student in computer science at Georgia Tech. He has studied the effect of the message board Reddit banning some of its most hateful groups, and found the members didn’t recongregate elsewhere on the site.But, Stamos said, the companies are unlikely to take this step, out of concern regulators would consider it anticompetitive.4&#92;. Reconsidering encrypted messagingAfter years of scrutiny over how it handles user data, Facebook is changing the focus of its product development to encrypted messaging -- with content so private, not even the company can see it. If Facebook does that, it will be impossible to follow terrorists, human traffickers, illegal drug sales, and the radicalization of mass shooters.“Do not let them do this,” Farid said. “It will be incredibly dangerous.”To contact the reporter on this story: Sarah Frier in San Francisco at sfrier1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly Schuetz, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-twitter-pressed-help-prevent-100000235.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-08	2019-08-08 15:18:07	DE	Deere & Company	Trump Keeps Accidentally Igniting Dollar With His Trade War	(Bloomberg) -- No wonder he’s frustrated: Donald Trump’s intensifying battle with China and other major trading partners is morphing into a global currency war, and it will be hard for him to win both.The president once again bemoaned dollar strength on Thursday, saying in a tweet he wasn’t thrilled with it and calling on policy makers to slash interest rates. Yet the trade tensions he has stoked have supported the currency this year.They’ve boosted demand for the greenback by helping fuel a mammoth bond rally, as investors seek out the safest assets, particularly Treasuries. Foreign ownership of American government debt has swelled to record highs, pushing yields to the lowest since 2016 on 10-year notes, a benchmark for global borrowing.Trump has repeatedly nagged the Federal Reserve to cut borrowing costs while complaining that the dollar is too strong. Should the Fed cut rates further this year, the monetary easing may actually shore up the U.S. economy, supporting the greenback. That may only add to Trump’s frustration. Options traders this week boosted wagers on a weaker yuan versus the dollar.“Whether President Trump can win the trade war and the ‘FX war’ seems rather doubtful,” said Kit Juckes, a global strategist at Societe Generale SA in London. “If he wants a weaker dollar, he should want a stronger yuan and euro. Unfortunately for him, this trade rhetoric has had the opposite effect.”The dollar has strengthened about 2.5% against the euro and 2.4% versus the onshore yuan this year and is holding near its 2019 high on a trade-weighted basis. Trump’s latest threat of more tariffs on Chinese goods helped push the yuan past a psychological threshold of 7, the level defended by the authorities in the past.“The Fed’s high interest rate level, in comparison to other countries, is keeping the dollar high, making it more difficult for our great manufacturers like Caterpillar, Boeing, John Deere, our car companies, & others, to compete on a level playing field,” the president tweeted.Hours earlier, the yuan edged higher against the dollar after China’s central bank set the daily fixing stronger than analysts expected, providing some reassurance to traders rattled by a tumultuous week in markets.Options traders are paying more to bet on the dollar strengthening versus the yuan in the next three months, according to currency-options prices. Nordea Bank Abp raised its forecast for the dollar on Thursday, citing factors including the “escalated tariff war.”The question now is whether Beijing will allow that to happen, and what the Republican president may do in response.In the eyes of some analysts, further yuan weakness could raise the risk of currency intervention by the U.S. to weaken the dollar. It hasn’t taken that step since 2000, when it joined an international effort to support the euro.Intervention carried out for more than a few weeks could backfire and become supportive of the dollar, according to an analysis by UBS Group AG. For it to work, U.S. growth and carry advantages must both be blunted while the growth outlook in China and Europe improves, UBS said. That’s not a scenario economists expect.“The more likely outcome of the explicit currency war would be further extension of uncertainty, which ironically could prove to be dollar-positive if risk assets fear weaker growth and volatility pushes higher,” UBS strategists including Bhanu Baweja wrote in a note. It will also “shift rate differentials in the dollar’s favor, albeit with a lag” as other central banks respond with dovishness.Three central banks across Asia Pacific delivered surprise interest-rate decisions on Wednesday. New Zealand and India led with bigger-than-expected interest rate cuts, while Thailand’s 25-point reduction surprised all but two economists in a Bloomberg survey.Chris Chapman, a portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, is keeping most of his non-dollar exposure hedged despite the fact that the market is expecting at least two more Fed rate cuts in 2019. The issue here is that other central banks are cutting rates and easing policy. China looks set to step up stimulus to revive growth, while the European Central Bank has flagged fresh monetary action for as early as September.“The dollar could stay strong, as other central banks are also pursuing accommodative policy,” Chapman said. “The current market feels a little like there is a tug of war between what lower U.S. rates would do to the dollar versus the flight to safety flows.”(Updates with latest Trump tweet.)&#92;--With assistance from Michelle Jamrisko.To contact the reporter on this story: Anchalee Worrachate in London at aworrachate@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Samuel Potter at spotter33@bloomberg.net, Todd White, Mark TannenbaumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-keeps-accidentally-igniting-dollar-075104642.html?.tsrc=rss

The House Homeland Security committee is seeking to bring the site’s owner in for testimony over extremism on the platform.Trump said Monday that he had ordered federal officials to work with social media companies to identify people who may perpetrate mass shootings before they can act. The meeting set for Friday will include “senior administration officials along with representatives of a range of companies,” according to the statement. Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. declined to comment on the letter. Google didn’t respond to requests for comment.During a summit in July with conservative tech critics and trolls, Trump said he would seek another White House event with “representatives of the major social media platforms.”To contact the reporters on this story: Ben Brody in Washington at btenerellabr@bloomberg.net;Justin Sink in Washington at jsink1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-invites-tech-companies-155315016.html?.tsrc=rss

The plan could also include expanding health savings accounts, linking price transparency to quality measures, and additional insurance options, according to Dow Jones.President Donald Trump hasn’t signed off on the plans, which have yet to be finalized. A senior Trump adviser, Kellyanne Conway, has briefed House Republicans and may speak to Senate Republicans about the plans after the August recess.“President Trump has said we will protect people with pre-existing conditions, lower drug prices, end surprise medical bills, and make sure Americans get the highest quality of care they deserve,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement to Dow Jones.In rolling out the plan, possibly in the fall, Trump is expected to assure voters that the White House is prepared if courts strike down key elements of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.To contact the reporter on this story: Maria Jose Valero in New York at mvalero3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Polina Noskova at pnoskova@bloomberg.net, Ros Krasny, Steve GeimannFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-considers-september-roll-171732799.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-25	2019-07-25 14:50:04	DE	Deere & Company	4 Blue-Chip Stocks Under Pressure on Earnings	We are in the heart of the first-quarter earnings season, with results coming in hot and heavy. After solid numbers from the early reporters -- primarily in the technology and financial sectors -- we are starting to get statements from the industrials and other manufacturing names. And boy, the results aren't pretty, as many of the macroeconomic headwinds, including a global slowdown in manufacturing activity, hit these issues square in the jaw. Blue-chip stocks are not immune from the damage.Remember, expectations of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve are predicated on uneven economic growth. That is tied in large part to the trade tensions between the United States and China. And that is having a real impact on the bottom line of many of the largest companies listed on U.S. exchanges.  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season Here are four blue-chip stocks suffering declines:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Blue-Chip Stocks: Caterpillar (CAT)Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) shares are down hard, losing nearly 5% on Wednesday, testing below their 200-day and 50-day moving averages. This sets the stage for a possible drop back to the lows set in late May, which would be worth a loss of roughly 10% from here and would extend a long, slow downtrend pattern that's been in play since January 2018.The company reported earnings of $2.83 per share, missing estimates by 28 cents per share on a 3% rise in revenues. Management lowered forward guidance as well, looking for modest sales growth as trade tensions with China continue. Dealer inventories have also been a drag. Boeing (BA)Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell more than 3% on Wednesday to drop back below their 200-day moving average after topping near $380 on resistance going back to March. The company reported a large miss and announced a delay to its 777X program, adding to its woes on the 737 MAX program. The non-GAAP loss totaled $5.82 per share on a 35.1% drop in revenues. Management has continued to suspend full-year guidance.  * 7 Stocks to Buy This Summer Earnings Season What really tripped the stock up, however, was word the MAX grounding would impact cash flow beyond 2019. Watch for a decline back to the December low, which would be worth a loss of nearly 20% from here. Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are down more than 13% today after reporting disappointing numbers. A loss of $1.12 per share was 76 cents worse than expected despite a 58.7% rise in revenues. Gross margins fell 1.3% to 18.9%. While capex spending plans were reduced slightly, the company remains on track for the start of production on the Model Y and the opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory.What's troubling is that despite the company's aggressive growth efforts, its push downmarket hasn't quelled its cash burn rate or bolstered its profitability. That calls into question CEO Elon Musk's desire to be an increasingly mainstream company rather than a maker of high-end specialty sports sedans and SUVs. Deere (DE)While Deere (NYSE:DE) hasn't reported earnings this week, it's vulnerable to the selling pressure hitting Caterpillar as it bumps up against resistance from its late-April high. Watch for a possible drop to test support from the January-May, which would be worth a loss of roughly 8% from here, on worries the trade tensions with China continue to weigh on U.S. farm products and thus, agricultural equipment sales.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund The company last reported earnings on May 17. Earnings of $3.52 missed estimates by 11 cents on a 5.4% rise in revenues. The company will next report on Aug. 16 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.86 per share on revenues of $9.4 billion.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-11	2019-07-11 20:55:04	DE	Deere & Company	Trump Says He’ll Summon Companies After Social Media ‘Summit’	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he’d summon social media companies for a meeting at the White House to discuss conservative grievances about alleged political bias on their platforms, and that he had directed his administration to explore methods to protect online speech.“We will ask representatives of the major social media platforms to join me at the White House over the next month,” Trump told his audience at an event Thursday the White House billed as a “social media summit.”“Have a big meeting and a real conversation,” Trump said. He also said he would direct the administration to “explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free speech rights of all Americans.”“We’re fighting for you very hard,” the president said earlier, after he and other speakers at the event complained of suffering censorship by social media companies. “We’re going to be calling a big meeting of the companies for -- in a week or two. They have to be here.”While Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. and other internet platforms weren’t invited to Thursday’s event, several presidential fans, provocateurs, leaders of conservative groups, media figures, and lawmakers said they were going -- including some who’ve faced allegations of racism and antisemitism, trolling and conspiracy theories.“Some of you are extraordinary,” Trump told the audience. “Can’t say everybody. The crap you think of is unbelievable.”Later, he added: “Some of you guys are out there. I mean it’s genius, but it’s bad.”Representatives of Google, Facebook and Twitter declined to comment on the potential White House meeting.Bias ClaimsThe president said the “journalists” and “influencers” who attended the event are “fulfilling a vital role in our nation” by communicating “directly with our citizens without having to go through the fake news filter.” Trump has often said his @realDonaldTrump Twitter account, where he frequently announces official news, is vital for him to communicate directly with the American public.Despite claims that they face systematic bias by companies hosting social media platforms, Trump enjoys an audience of about 62 million followers at his personal Twitter account and more than 24 million at his official Facebook page. He said he and his summit audience reach a combined “half a billion followers.”“I know that we’ve been blocked,” Trump said, relating anecdotes about people telling him they were unable to follow his Twitter account.The event was billed as a way to “bring together digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today’s online environment,” according to a statement announcing the meeting. But the confirmed attendees were primarily conservative tech critics who echo Trump’s own complaints that social media systematically silences conservative voices.Trump said that when the conference concludes, he’ll speak on the 2020 U.S. Census. Trump will retreat from his effort to include a citizenship question in the decennial census after a defeat at the U.S. Supreme Court, and will seek the information through other means, an administration official said.The president has repeatedly accused large technology platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google of anti-conservative bias, with little evidence. Last month, he said the U.S. government should sue Facebook and Google for unspecified wrongdoing.In May, the administration posted a form urging people to report potential political censorship by the social media companies, which White House spokesman Judd Deere said on Wednesday got “thousands of responses.” The form is now defunct.“I don’t think there’s going to be serious policy matters discussed,” said Ethan Porter, a professor at George Washington University who has studied the political role of media in the Trump era. “It looks like a theatrical gathering at the White House -- a venting session for conservative media stars.”Senator Josh Hawley also spoke at the event. The Missouri Republican is pushing legislation that would require social media companies to certify they don’t engage in censorship based on politics or face revocation of liability protections for content their users post. Trump called his proposal “important.”QAnon, O’KeefeThe summit attracted figures like Bill Mitchell, a Twitter booster of Trump’s who has promoted the conspiracy theory known as QAnon; as well as the person behind a pro-Trump meme account known as @CarpeDonktum, whose work has attracted retweets from the president.Brent Bozell, who heads an organization devoted to exposing alleged liberal media bias and once compared President Barack Obama to “a skinny, ghetto crackhead,” was also expected, alongside another Twitter personality who has said the media was pushing a civil war.The conservative nonprofit Project Veritas, which uses undercover sting operations in attempts to expose wrongdoing, said founder James O’Keefe would be there. Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and frequent Google critic, is scheduled to attend, as is Republican Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida.Traditional Washington conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation will be represented. So will a fairly new one, the youth-focused group Turning Point USA, which has been accused of promoting baseless claims against liberals.The White House schedule initially listed the event as closed to the press, but a revised version said Trump’s remarks will be open to reporters. “The Fake News Media will also be there, but for a limited period,” Trump tweeted.Ben Garrison, a pro-Trump political cartoonist, tweeted Wednesday that his invitation had been rescinded after criticism that one of his works, which depicted Jewish financiers controlling U.S. foreign policy, was anti-Semitic. Garrison denied the accusation.Election ConnectionAccusing social media companies of shutting out conservative agendas could help Trump maintain ties to allies, some of whom have devoted media followings of their own, Porter said. Trump officially launched his re-election campaign last month, and it reported last week that he and the Republican National Committee had together raised $105 million in the second quarter and had $100 million in available cash.Nearly 65% of Republicans or those who lean Republican believe big tech companies support liberal views over conservative ones, and a full 85% think it’s at least somewhat likely the companies are intentionally censoring viewpoints, according to a Pew Research Center survey from last year.“There is a segment of the population that’s motivated to get out to vote based on what they’re against,” said Kevin Madden, a former spokesman for Republican Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign who has also worked with technology companies.Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a trade group that represents large technology companies, said in a statement that his members provide “the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history,” including conservatives.“Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,” Beckerman said.Pressure on the technology companies is increasing in Washington as Republicans in Congress dig into allegations of conservative bias, Democrats in the House conduct an antitrust inquiry and enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission divvy up oversight of Google, Facebook, Apple Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. Politicians from both parties are also exploring limiting liability protections that the companies enjoy for third-party content.Jesse Blumenthal, who directs tech policy for the network of groups funded by the libertarian Koch brothers, said that those on the right have long feared gatekeepers would keep conservative opinions from out of the public square.“That is not a new complaint,” said Blumenthal, who advocates for the government to stay out of speech issues. “What is new is, so what do you want the government to do about it?”The fight to remove the government from regulating speech resulted in the successful push to end the “fairness doctrine” that required television broadcasters give equal amounts of time to candidates seeking public office, Blumenthal said. Trump has mused about bringing the idea back for social media.&#92;--With assistance from Alyza Sebenius and Margaret Talev.To contact the reporter on this story: Ben Brody in Washington at btenerellabr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Justin BlumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-social-media-summit-brings-080000724.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-11	2019-07-11 13:36:45	DE	Deere & Company	White House Pulls the Plug on Proposed Drug-Rebate Overhaul	(Bloomberg) -- The White House abandoned a push to end rebates paid to middlemen who negotiate drug prices on behalf of health insurers, a move that could turn scrutiny back on how drugmakers themselves set prices.President Donald Trump has made lowering prescription-drug costs a top priority of his administration, and ending rebates was seen as a vital part of that effort.The reversal caused investors to recalibrate their expectations. After mostly languishing this year, shares of companies that operate large pharmacy-benefit managers rallied, with CVS Health Corp. rising 7% to $59.23 at 9:35 a.m. in New York, while UnitedHealth Group Inc. advanced 3% to $254.98.The president’s proposal would have prohibited drugmakers from paying rebates to PBMs in government programs such as Medicare. The move could have upended a complex system that influences tens of billions of dollars of pharmaceutical spending.“Based on careful analysis and thorough consideration, the President has decided to withdraw the rebate rule,” said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman. He said that the administration was encouraged by bipartisan discussion on legislation to control drug costs.Rebates had become a popular target of criticism in Washington after drug companies lobbied aggressively to cast them as the reason for high prices. Pharmacy-benefit managers negotiate drug discounts in the form of rebates, often keeping some of that money for themselves.The practice, critics said, gives drugmakers a reason to keep list prices high, distorts incentives for drug plans who are supposed to prioritize the interest of their clients and leaves consumers paying more out of pocket for prescription drugs.Substantial ShiftThe about-face represents a second dramatic turn this week for the Trump administration’s campaign to rein in rising pharmaceutical costs. On Monday, a federal judge ruled the Department of Health and Human Services overstepped its authority with its plan to force drugmakers to disclose list prices in advertisements.Pharmacy-benefit managers blame drug companies for soaring prices and have said that rebates help keep overall health costs down.“We’re pleased the administration recognized the impact the rebate rule would have on seniors,” said CVS spokesman T.J. Crawford, “and look forward to continuing to work with all stakeholders on lowering drug costs. Any solution should start with addressing drug prices.”The end of the rebate push is likely to swing discussion back toward the pricing practices of big drugmakers, and it could add momentum to other proposals that have been floated by the administration, such as tying drug costs to an index of international pharmaceutical prices. Trump last week said his administration is working on an executive order to tie drug prices in U.S. government health programs to the rates paid by other industrialized nations.The shift is “a substantial setback for drug manufacturers that could have seen a windfall” from the rebate overhaul, said Hunter Hammond, an analyst at Height Securities, in a note to clients.The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, often viewed as a barometer of investor sentiment about drug prices, was down 1.2% in New York.(Adds opening share prices in third paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Margaret Talev and Robert Langreth.To contact the reporter on this story: Anna Edney in Washington at aedney@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Drew Armstrong at darmstrong17@bloomberg.net, Timothy AnnettFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-pulls-plug-proposed-115115448.html?.tsrc=rss

Analyst Steven Fisher cut his rating to neutral from buy, but raised his stock price target to $167 from $158. Fisher said he now believes the stock &quot;fairly reflects the balance of near-term caution vs. the potential for a pick up in the large ag replacement cycle in 2020.&quot; The downgrade comes after the stock has soared 20.2% since closing at a 6 1/2-month low of $134.82 on May 17.

Analyst Steven Fisher cut his rating to neutral from buy, but raised his stock price target to $167 from $158. Fisher said he now believes the stock &quot;fairly reflects the balance of near-term caution vs. the potential for a pick up in the large ag replacement cycle in 2020.&quot; The downgrade comes after the stock has soared 20.2% since closing at a 6 1/2-month low of $134.82 on May 17.

2019-07-08	2019-07-08 20:06:25	DE	Deere & Company	Trump Touts Environmental Record After Rolling Back Protections	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump on Monday boasted the U.S. is ranked No. 1 for access to clean drinking water as he emphasized American environmental gains despite seeking to roll back rules meant to preserve them.“From day one, my administration has made it a top priority to ensure America has the cleanest air and water in the planet,” Trump said to conservative advocates assembled in the the East Room of the White House.Trump rattled off an array of achievements, including reductions in conventional air pollution, the cleanup of toxic Superfund sites and efforts to combat algae blooms in Florida.Trump’s address on “America’s environmental leadership” came as polls show voters increasingly concerned about global warming and unhappy with the president’s approach to the issue. Just 29% of voters in a Washington Post-ABC News telephone survey released Monday said they approved of the way Trump is handling climate change.As the effects of climate change become more apparent in the form of catastrophic hurricanes, floods, droughts and wildfires, Trump’s environmental agenda has focused chiefly on rewriting Obama-era rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions -- not imposing aggressive new mandates that would keep global warming in check.Environmental advocates called the episode surreal. “It must be opposite day at the White House,” quipped Dan Lashof, U.S. director of the World Resources Institute.Jill Tauber, vice president of litigation, climate and energy at Earthjustice, said it was “absurd for President Trump to claim any environmental credentials when his administration continues to drive a destructive pro-polluter agenda at the expense of the American people.”Democratic opponents have criticized the president’s record and are competing to outdo each other with proposals for throttling heat-warming carbon dioxide emissions. During two days of presidential debates last month, the candidates cast Trump as retreating from an urgent global fight to prevent the most catastrophic consequences of climate change. Almost all of the Democratic presidential candidates have pledged to rejoin the Paris climate accord -- or strengthen U.S. greenhouse-gas-cutting commitments. And Washington Governor Jay Inslee has made the issue the centerpiece of his bid for the White House.Critics cast Trump’s speech as a failed effort to rehab his image, with Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs at League of Conservation Voters, calling it “a made-for-TV moment from our made-for-TV president trying to make up for some bad poll numbers on his environmental record.”But Trump -- contrasting his record with his predecessor’s -- said he’s managed to protect the environment without destroying jobs.“A strong economy is vital to maintaining a healthy environment,” he said.Indeed, the U.S. has made strides cleaning up its air and water have since the 1970s, after a series of environmental disasters -- an oil spill off the California coast, toxic pollution emanating from New York’s Love Canal and Ohio’s Cuyahoga River bursting into flames -- spurred anti-pollution laws and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.Conventional criteria air pollution has dropped 73% from 1970 to 2017, even though the economy grew more than 260% in the same time. And while 40% of U.S. water systems failed to meet drinking water standards in 1970, more than 90% do today, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said Monday.Yet environmental advocates say those gains were driven by decades-old federal clean air and water laws that Trump is now undermining. The administration’s overhaul of former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan -- replacing sweeping power-plant pollution curbs for modest efficiency improvements at the sites -- was published in the government’s Federal Register on Monday.In fact, carbon dioxide emissions that drive climate change just increased, after generally falling since 2005. There was a 2.7% hike in greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion in 2018, the second-largest annual increase since 2000, according to a report from the Rhodium Group LLC. And economy wide, greenhouse gas emissions likely rose between 1.5% and 2.5% last year -- putting U.S. emissions at 10.7% to 11.6% below 2005 levels, a common benchmark.Trump’s environmental record is nothing to boast about, said Collin O’Mara, president of the National Wildlife Federation. “Actions speak louder than words -- and for the past 900 days this administration has repeatedly acted to allow more mercury, smog and carbon pollution into our air, more nutrient and sediment pollution into our waterways, and more destruction of essential wildlife habitat in our treasured natural places,” he said by email.Trump made revamping environmental regulation a signature issue on the campaign trail and rapidly moved to fulfill those promises once in the White House. He directed the Interior Department to resume selling coal on federal land, ending a moratorium imposed under Obama. His administration began easing limits on oil well releases of methane, a super-potent greenhouse gas. Trump promised the U.S. would abandon the Paris climate accord -- a global pact to cut emissions. And the Trump administration has proposed freezing vehicle emission and fuel economy standards at 2020 levels, preventing planned increases that had been set in motion under Obama.Under Trump, political appointees have overruled concerns from EPA experts, revamped scientific advisory panels and moved to discount the health benefits of cleaning up some air pollution.Trump administration officials and supporters emphasize that the U.S. can make environmental progress without the heavy hand of government. And they have asserted that the administration’s regulatory changes will unleash private sector innovation, allowing both the U.S. economy and environment to thrive.“President Trump has shown true leadership on the environment from day one,” said Mandy Gunasekara, a former deputy assistant administrator at the EPA. “He strategically focused his administrative resources toward addressing tangible environmental issues with practical solutions so all our nation’s citizens can enjoy access to the cleanest air and safest drinking water.”To contact the reporter on this story: Jennifer A.

2019-06-26	2019-06-26 06:16:35	DE	Deere & Company	2 Upgrades for Deere; What’s the Story?	The short answer: China, corn, and rain.After dropping 19% in the first two weeks of May, stock in Deere & Co. (DE) has been gaining on an unusual combination of factors. The resumption of trade talks between the US and China, a spike in the price of corn, and unseasonably poor weather in the rich farm belt of the Midwest have all come together and boosted a company that had been having trouble gaining traction. Deere is on an upward trajectory now, having gained 23% since May 17. The China FactorThis is the one that’s been getting all the headlines. The ongoing dispute between the US and China has seen both sides initiate protective tariffs and threaten more drastic actions, and global financial markets and trading networks have been feeling the pressure. That pressure has eased in recent days, however, as Presidents Trump and Xi have agreed to meet personally at the upcoming G20 summit.Both leaders are expressing optimism ahead of the meeting. President Trump has said, “I think we have a chance. I know that China wants to make a deal,” while Xi has added, “The key is to show consideration to each other’s legitimate concerns.” The upbeat talk from the Presidents has buoyed markets in recent sessions.In the last week Deere has gained from the happy talk on trade, but the stock’s run up began several weeks earlier. Shares in Deere have been on an upward trajectory since bottoming out on May 17. Here Comes the Rain AgainAnd now we get to corn and rain. The weather in the Midwest has been unusually cold this year. There are snow warnings in the Colorado Rockies, as low down as 9,000 feet, while heavy rains and cold snaps have delayed the planting season in the nation’s most productive farming regions. The delays have lowered forecasts for the 2019 harvests and tightened the worldwide crop supply. At the same time, demand remains high. The predictable result is higher agricultural prices.The most immediate gainer there is corn. Corn bottomed out on May 10 and has risen 31% since then to reach a five-year high. Wheat is also up, having gained 29% since May 10, although it has not reached record levels.Notice the dates – corn and wheat both started rising just seven days before the price of Deere’s stock started climbing. The rising prices assured farmers that they would not be financially ruined by the looming bad season, and they began making needed investments in equipment purchases and maintenance. Deere is a direct beneficiary of those investments, and the stock price reflects it.Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, agrees that Deere is gaining more from corn than easing trade tensions. He points out, “If you take a look at the chart, Deere started to break out in the middle of May. It stopped trading on tariff headlines, started trading on corn prices which are now going up.” This Deere is RunningWall Street’s analysts have taken note – a 23% gain in a lagging industrial stock is sure-fire attention-getter. Writing from Baird on June 16, Mircea Dobre sums up the support for DE shares: “Corn has rallied sharply breaking out of a five-year range as persistent wetness has raised supply concerns. Prices seem poised to move higher; this helps farm economics which should drive equipment demand.” In line with his optimistic comment, Dobre upgraded DE shares to a ‘Buy’ rating.To go along with his upbeat outlook, he also raised his price target by 35%, to $175. That may turn out to be too low, however, as DE’s price has already run up to $166. Dobre’s target gives the stock a 4.8% potential upside.Five-star analyst Stephen Volkmann, of Jefferies, has also upgraded DE, moving the stock from ‘Hold’ to ‘Buy.’ He cites the tighter crop supplies in the global market and consequent higher prices in support of his upgrade, saying, “Positive momentum in farmer net income support double-digit large equipment growth through 2020.”Elaborating on the improved outlook for farmers, Volkmann said in a June 24 note, “We believe farm fundamentals are finally turning. A tightened global crop supply demand balance and positive momentum in farmer net income support double-digit large equipment growth through 2020.” Volkmann’s price target, $190, indicates room for a 14% upside.Overall, Deere has a ‘Moderate Buy’ rating from the analyst consensus, based on 9 buys, 3 holds, and 1 sell assigned in the past three months. These ratings still partially reflect the more downbeat outlook that prevailed in the early part of May; the higher price targets and ratings upgrades that are now starting to come in have not had time to fully reflect in the aggregate ratings. The same effect is visible in the price target. The average PT of $163 still includes lower values assigned in past weeks; since then, the stock has risen fast and now trades for $166. If current trends hold, expect the price target to adjust as analysts reevaluate the stock.View DE Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-upgrades-deere-story-061635490.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-12	2019-06-12 10:40:20	DE	Deere & Company	As Solid as It Is, Looming Fears Will Hold Back Caterpillar Stock	Between 2016 and 2018, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) earnings more than tripled. Unsurprisingly, the stock price soared. Caterpillar stock started 2016 near $60; it started 2018 roughly one hundred points higher.Source: Anthony via FlickrThere were several factors at play in earnings growth. Easy comparisons helped, certainly. Revenue fell 18% year-over-year in 2016. That was the fourth straight year in which sales declined, a first for the company. Not even during the Great Depression did Caterpillar's top line stay negative for so long. Those four years of declines also led to a great deal of pent-up demand, which has benefited results over the last nine quarters.In addition, Caterpillar aggressively cut costs: its headcount shrunk by 20% between the end of 2013 and the end of 2017. Corporate tax reform boosted EPS. Almost everything has gone right of late - but that hardly seems reflected in Caterpillar shares.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Indeed, over the last eighteen months, Caterpillar stock now has declined over 20%. Yet earnings still are expected to grow, if at a slower rate. Caterpillar is guiding for adjusted EPS this year (excluding a one-time tax benefit) of $11.75-$12.75, 5-14% above 2018 levels. Investors don't seem to care: the CAT stock price touched a 2019 low just week, and now sits at a little over 10x the midpoint of that guidance range.The issue is that investors aren't looking at 2019, or 2016. They're looking at 2020 and beyond. To some investors, that might present an opportunity. To others, it explains why the CAT stock price continues to fall and may have further to go. The Cyclical CATAlong with John Deere (NYSE:DE), Caterpillar is one of the most widely-held cyclical stocks. That's been particularly true this decade. Back in 2012, the company generated nearly $66 billion in revenue. That year, the so-called commodity supercycle driven in part by Chinese growth peaked, and Caterpillar sold billions of dollars of equipment to miners worldwide. Commodity prices collapsed, demand dried up, and the overhang of barely used equipment pressured sales for years.Indeed, Caterpillar's Resource Industries segment saw revenue drop by over 70 percent between 2012 and 2016. Operating profit went from over $4 billion to a loss of $1 billion. That business now has recovered - but a $1.6 billion profit in 2018 obviously sits well below early-decade peaks.That volatility explains, at least in part, why Caterpillar stock looks so cheap at the moment. Investors always know Caterpillar is a cyclical play, but the roller-coaster ride of this decade remains fresh in their memories. In theory, a cyclical stock should see its earnings multiple expand at the bottom as was the case in 2016 when savvy investors started buying CAT stock ahead of its rebound.Of course, that also means multiples should contract at the top, and it's the fear that we indeed are at, or near, the top that explains why the CAT stock price sits at barely 10x 2019 earnings per share. The Cycle Weighs on Caterpillar StockTo be sure, there are some company-specific factors as well. Caterpillar cited a $70 million direct impact from tariffs just in the first quarter, and trade war fears no doubt have weighed on CAT. Like other American firms including Deere, 3M (NYSE:MMM), and even Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the company also cited market share struggles in the Chinese market.But China only accounts for roughly 10% of Caterpillar revenue. Potential market share issues in one region don't offset the fact that Caterpillar earnings have soared - or that the company seems to be performing exceedingly well everywhere else.CAT's cheap multiple is a function primarily of cyclical worries. To be sure, it's not alone. Banks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) look cheap. Homebuilders Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), too, trade at single-digit multiples, even after solid YTD rallies.Investors in these stocks, and in Caterpillar, are looking to ahead to looming trouble. That might be a trade war. It might just be the natural end of a U.S. economic expansion heading into its eleventh year. Caterpillar is a more global play. Over half of its sales come from outside North America, but the logic is the same. A slowdown is coming and investors don't want to own the stocks most likely to be affected. The Bet on CAT StockAnd so investors aren't really focused on 2019 results and they're not going to be. An extra dime or two in 2019 EPS doesn't matter much, if at all, if those earnings start declining in 2020 anyhow. UBS (NYSE:UBS) made that case last week, cutting its CAT stock price target to $115 while projecting a decrease in earnings next year.That's the problem for Caterpillar stock right now: there's not much Caterpillar can really do. It's cut costs so significantly of late that there's probably less room to react if sales do start turning negative. What growth it does muster in 2019 could well be overshadowed, or ignored, amid fears of what comes next. Moreso than other cyclicals, CAT is going to be held hostage to the broader sentiment toward the global economy.Of course, that's precisely what makes CAT so interesting, particularly near YTD lows. There is a nice case here for the stock. As Dana Blankenhorn pointed out last month, CAT is an attractive pick for income investors. The dividend already yields 3.3%, and Caterpillar management has promised further hikes going forward.Those hikes are presumably dependent on some degree of cooperation from the broader economy, but at least for now the dividend is well-covered.But even a 4% dividend isn't quite enough to turn bullish. An investor has to trust the global economy to go long CAT, even at these levels. And if an investor does see global macro worries as overdone, there are few better plays than Caterpillar stock.Another leg up in the global economy and particularly in demand for commodities like minerals, oil and natural gas would allow earnings to keep growing. CAT's earnings multiple likely would expand as well thanks to increased investor confidence. It's not unreasonable in that scenario to see Caterpillar stock clearing $200, something like 14-15x adjusted EPS of $14-$15. For what it's worth, the high Wall Street target price is exactly $200.It's not quite that simple but it's close. CAT is a bet on the global economy being better than feared. It's not a bet I'm quite willing to take but I can see why other investors might.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

What is worrying is that the move traces out a head-and-shoulders reversal pattern that traces a decline to the 24,000 level last seen in February, which would be worth a loss of roughly 5% from here.There's a lot to worry about these days, from Beijing's threat of a rare-earth metals export ban to the risk higher tariffs present to the global supply chain network.No wonder then that the bond market is sending its strongest recession warnings since 2007, with much of the U.S. Treasury yield curve &quot;inverting&quot; as long-term rates fall below short-term rates -- a sign that something is very wrong with the global economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever As a result, a number of mega-cap stocks are breaking lower.

Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.77 per share on revenues of $21.5 billion. When the company last reported on May 8, earnings of $1.61 beat estimates by 4 cents on a 2.6% rise in revenues. Nike (NKE)  Click to EnlargeNike (NYSE:NKE) shares are cutting down below their 200-day moving average, falling below the $80-a-share level for the first time since January and breaking into downtrend territory for the first time since December. The company is at the center of tariff concerns, with a group of shoe companies recently asking Trump not to raise import duties on footwear.  * 7 Stocks to Sell After Earnings Destroyed Their Long-Term Stories The company will next report results on June 20 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 67 cents per share on revenues of $10.2 billion. When the company last reported on March 21, earnings of 68 cents per share beat estimates by 3 cents on a 7% rise in revenues. Apple (AAPL)  Click to EnlargeApple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the world's most important technology company, is returning to levels seen in early March as analysts worry the deepening trade war will have a direct impact on its bottom line. Not only is the company vulnerable to U.S. imports on products coming in from China (with iPhone and laptops to be affected by the next round of tariffs) but sales to Chinese consumers are vulnerable to a nationalist boycott.The company will next report results on July 30 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.1 per share on revenues of $53.47 billion. When the company last reported on April 30, earnings of $2.46 beat estimates by 10 cents on a 5.1% decline in revenues. Caterpillar (CAT)  Click to EnlargeShares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) have returned to lows not seen since December, down more than 17% from their recent high. Farm and heavy equipment makers such as CAT and Deere (NYSE:DE) are at risk from lower sales into China (as the trade war hurts their export-oriented economy) as well as to U.S. farmers, as Beijing retaliates by buying less American foods.  * 7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy as the Boom Ends The company will next report results on July 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.12 per share on revenues of $14.54 billion. When the company last reported on April 24, earnings of $2.94 beat estimates by 8 cents on a 4.7% rise in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-21	2019-05-21 08:59:33	DE	Deere & Company	2 Stocks to be Wary Of (And One Defensive Play)	The trade war with China has reignited, and while the tech companies may be getting the headlines, export-oriented industrials have also felt immediate effects. China is an important market for heavy construction and agricultural equipment, and the imposition of protective tariffs has made a mark on the import-export trade.We’ll dive into TipRanks’ analyst database to look at two major industrial companies feeling the pain from China, as well as one strong defensive play to minimize the hurt on your portfolio. Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT – Research Report)Despite beating expectations in the China market earlier this year, Caterpillar now says it expects full-year China-sales results to come in flat at best. This is a serious setback, as Caterpillar makes 10% of its global sales to China. Combined with a drop in operating margin – reported at 18.5% last month, down from 19.7% one year ago – the company is facing a serious headwind in East Asia.Quoted in Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper, five-star analyst Stephen Volkmann (Track Record & Ratings) noted both points, saying, “Caterpillar has most exposure to China in their construction industry business and that business was just a bit disappointing on revenue and margins.”Caterpillar stock has had a difficult time gaining traction in recent years, as its share price peaked in January 2018 and has been on an uneven downward slope since then. With the end of Q2 2019, the company moved to placate shareholders, by boosting the dividend 20% to $1.03 per share ($4.12 annualized), which increased the yield to a respectable 3.37%. Shares gained $4 in the next session but are down $17 since.While CAT is facing headwinds, the outlook is not entirely gloomy. Oppenheimer’s Noah Kaye (Track Record & Ratings) set a ‘Hold’ on the stock, but his comments acknowledge that the company has extensive resources: “We got much of what we were looking for from CAT’s Investor Day last week. The company provided an updated view on its structurally improved cross-cycle margin and cash flow metrics… We believe CAT’s O&E model has successfully enabled the company to deliver stronger cash generation peak-to-trough and supported its strong balance sheet, enabling a more shareholder-friendly approach to capital allocation.”Overall, CAT retains a ‘Moderate Buy’ from the analyst consensus, including 9 buy, 3 hold, and 2 sell reviews. Shares sell for $122 as of May 20, and the average price target of $150 suggests a 22% upside potential.View CAT Price Target & Analyst Rating Detail Deere & Co. (DE – Research Report)Nothing runs like a Deere, but investors ran away from Deere shares after the May 17 Q2 earnings report. The manufacturer of agricultural equipment (from backyard riding mowers to giant agribusiness harvester combines, plus everything in between) missed the EPS forecast by 2%, reporting $3.52 against the expected $3.61. Despite the earnings miss, net equipment sales revenues came in just above the $10.12 billion expectation, at $10.3 billion.According to the company, however, investors should not expect to keep seeing revenue beats this year. Deere lowered guidance on 2019 net income from $3.6 billion to $3.3 billion. Company CEO Sam Allen said of the lower guidance, “Although the long-term fundamentals for our businesses remain favorable, softening conditions in the agricultural sector have led Deere to adopt a more cautious financial outlook for the year. The lower forecast is partly a result of actions we are taking to prudently manage field inventories, which will cause production levels to be below retail sales in the second half of the year.”DE shares dropped 7.5% after the earnings report.Wall Street’s analysts have also seen the weakness in DE, even those setting ‘buy’ ratings on the stock. From RBC Capital, Seth Weber (Track Record & Ratings) says of the lowered income guidance, “…the revision is not surprising in light of the U.S.-China trade tensions and bad weather.” He lowered his price target by 10%, to $175.Stanley Elliot (Track Record & Ratings), of Stifel, also notes the softness in the agribusiness sector. He says the lowered income projection is driven by “a cocktail of negative developments in terms of trade, late plantings and swine flu.” His price target, $171, suggests a 26% upside for the stock.Deere holds a ‘Moderate Buy’ rating on the analyst consensus, based on 5 buy, 4 hold, and 1 sell rating given in the past three months. The $155 average price target that indicates a 14% upside potential from the current share price of $135.View DE Price Target & Analyst Rating Detail Johnson & Johnson (JNJ – Research Report)Consumer health care companies, emphasizing the everyday items that everyone needs no matter the state of the economy, are among the stocks usually seen as ‘recession proof.’ This doesn’t mean that they won’t drop when the market drops; rather, it means that they’ll experience less volatility. You can expect these defensive stocks to outperform when the major indexes fall or make slow gains, but they’ll also tend to lag a bit when the markets see a sharp rise.Johnson & Johnson is a classic case. JNJ released its Q1 earnings, missing the EPS by 2 cents, on April 16. Since then, the stock has slipped, risen, and slipped again, and is flat overall. On a longer-term view, JNJ is up 7.3% year-to-date and 11.4% over the past 12 months. The S&P 500, for April, is down over 2%, and in the last 12 months is only up 4%.Outperforming market slips is not JNJ’s only defensive attribute. The stock pays out a regular dividend, currently 95 cents per quarter for a 2.75% annual yield. The company has made a policy of steady, if modest, dividend increases, dating back to the early 1990s.The analysts, of course, have taken note of JNJ’s dependability in delivering profits and rewarding shareholders. Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford (Track Record & Ratings), just after the earnings report, raised his price target to $147 (for a 6% upside), and said, “Growth was still much better than expected, which gives us more confidence in our estimates.”More recently, five-start analyst Joanne Wuensch (Track Record & Ratings) of BMO Capital, noted JNJ’s attraction in a down market. In her note on the stock, she said, “J&J's discipline to acquire and divest assets in its health care portfolio, its pristine balance sheet and its high dividend yield make the stock a strong defensive choice.” Her price target, $157, suggests an upside potential of 13%.JNJ maintains a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus rating, based on 6 buys and 5 holds given in the past three months. Shares sell for $138; the average price target of $148 indicates a modest upside potential of 7%.View JNJ Price Target & Analyst Rating Detail Enjoy Research Reports on the Stocks in this Article:Caterpillar, Inc.

Shares are up 32% for 2019 and have captured 20% since breaking out of PYPL stock's year-long, base-on-base pattern in late January. So, what next? I see more upside potential.I believe technically shares can match the gains of the prior bullish leg from April 2017's breakout near $45 to the high of 2018's year-long congestive base. Some investors refer to this type of continuation action as a mirror move or two-step pattern. And in this instance, should it play out that way, PayPal stock should rally towards $140-$150.There's no guarantees of course. And PYPL stock's weekly stochastics are currently overbought. Still, if price and volume matter most, Thursday's relative strength breakout on increased volume to fresh highs from a short two plus week flat base does look compelling.For like-minded investors I'd recommend buying PayPal stock above $115.39. This entry is 1.5% through the pattern high and about .5% north of Thursday's high of $114.66.The purchase obviously sacrifices a tiny bit of upside. But if we're correct about the PYPL's trajectory, it's well worth the cost as this strategy looks to avoid buying a false breakout after the broader market's quick snap back from its trade war panic.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-05-20	2019-05-20 13:58:00	DE	Deere & Company	Agco&apos;s stock falls after BofA Merrill turns bearish on concerns over farming equipment demand	Shares of Agco Corp.  slumped 2.6% in morning trade Monday, after Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Ross Gilardi turned bearish on the agricultural equipment company, saying its &quot;heavy&quot; outperformance over Deere & Co.  appears unsustainable given increased pressure on farm equipment demand. Gilardi cut his rating to underperform from neutral and slashed his stock price target to $64 from $75. Gilardi said Agco&apos;s stock outperformance has been based on Agco&apos;s relative lack of North America large agriculture exposure as the U.S.-China trade war drags on, continued strong performance of its European business and a heavy short position by investors in late 2018. Agco&apos;s stock is up 17.9% year to date, while Deere shares are down 10.5% and the S&P 500  is up 13.4%. &quot;We expect Agco to relinquish some of this outperformance as the rest of 2019 outlook feels more uncertain to us with rising competition in Brazil and likely US production cuts in 2H19,&quot; Gilardi wrote in a note to clients. On Friday, Deere&apos;s stock tumbled 7.7% after the company reported earnings that missed expectations as the U.S.-China trade war caused farmers to become more cautious about making purchases.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a1698a6c-88dc-3393-8869-f81db52ae668/agco%26apos%3Bs-stock-falls-after.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-17	2019-05-17 19:54:35	DE	Deere & Company	5 Top Stock Trades for Monday: TSLA, BIDU, IQ, DE, MU	Stocks did a good job bouncing off their morning lows, but how long can bulls keep that action up? The market would do a whole lot better if investors didn't have to worry about a tweet from the president sending a ripple through Chinese and U.S. trade negotiations, but that's the market we have right now. Let's look at some top stock trades to get started on next week. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: BaiduBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has one of the worst-looking charts out there among the names that I follow.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt made a really elongated wedge from 2015 to 2017. I was hoping the bulls would be able to keep the stock above the backside of this prior resistance mark, but so far, no cigar. Maybe they can salvage it next week, but it's looking pretty awful.Below all of its major weekly moving averages (and daily moving averages for that matter), as well as any meaningful support level and this one is simply a no-touch for traders. Shares are down more than 15% after reporting earnings.  * 6 Chinese Stocks That Could Pop On a Trade Deal Until we see some hints of a reversal (maybe near $115 to $120) or until BIDU can reclaim $130 and $140, this one is stuck in no man's land for the time being. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Tesla  Click to EnlargeWe've been sounding the alarm bell on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) since long-time range support near $245 to $250 gave way. It's been stuck in this nasty downtrend and is making new 52-week lows on Friday.Do bulls make a stand next week, perhaps near $210? Maybe. Or we might continue to see a flush. Wait for the move first, then react. Reclaiming channel support gives investors a level to shoot against while aiming for a retest of channel resistance. See how it trades on Monday and Tuesday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: iQiyi  Click to EnlargeDown more than 6% and it's clear that the market doesn't care about iQiyi's (NASDAQ:IQ) strong user growth or revenue growth. Profits are missing and that's worrying investors. It doesn't help that IQ is a Chinese stock too.The sign it was in trouble came once shares broke below $23, the gap-from level back in February. For those that needed an even more clear sign, the retest-and-fail earlier this month (purple arrow) showed that IQ's time was up.Below all of its major moving averages and with a trend pointed lower, IQ stock doesn't look good. Maybe it bottoms near $18 to $18.50. If it breaks this mark, there could be a long way down. Keep in mind this stock was below $15 back in December. For anything sustainable to get going on the long side, it needs to get above its 20-day moving average. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Deere  Click to EnlargeDown 7.25% on earnings and it's a tough day for Deere (NYSE:DE) too. Shares broke below range support at $155, as well as the 50-week moving average near $150. Now near $136, and DE may actually be setting up as a solid risk/reward long.Shares have only closed below $135 on a weekly basis once since December 2017. Should this level hold next week, it could be a good spot to nibble. There have been a few &quot;shoots&quot; below this mark -- some to the upper-$120s, some just into the $134s -- but by and large $135 has held. A close below could take DE to $125.Ideally, we see DE shoot below $135 before reversing higher and closing above this week's lows. Then we'll have a more measurable setup. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Micron  Click to EnlargeLast but not least, here's a good lesson in Micron (NASDAQ:MU). Shares are down 3.3% on Friday and have been hammered these past few weeks. Remember at the beginning of the month, we flagged the warning signs here. In hindsight, I should have been even more cautious.Shares were still OK despite that lower low (orange arrow) but then it notched a lower high as well. Once it broke $40.76 to the downside, that was the last-straw sign to bail. Now bouncing off $36, it's been an ugly ride. If trapped bulls are lucky, they'll get a bounce next week that they can unload into.  * 3 Chinese Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Haul Otherwise, use this one as a lesson. When the trend bends, it's no longer your friend.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-04-18	2019-04-18 16:04:40	DE	Deere & Company	4 Stocks Surging on China’s Turnaround	U.S. equities are pushing higher on Thursday in part thanks to some very solid manufacturing activity data out of China earlier in the week. Not only did Q1 GDP growth hold at 6.4%, but factory activity picked up nicely after months of stagnation thanks in part to stimulus efforts out of Beijing.Overall, industrial production increased by 8.5% in March from the year earlier. Retail sales were strong as well.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever All of this, along with ongoing hints of a looming U.S.-China trade agreement, is bolstering expectations that the multi-year slump in Chinese prospects is about to end. Thus, China-focused U.S stocks, especially in the industrial and heavy equipment areas, are perking up nicely. Here are four stocks to buy that are on the move:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Caterpillar (CAT)  Click to EnlargeCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) shares are pushing up and away from prior resistance at the late February highs to return to levels not seen since early October. This extends away from the 50-day moving average, which has crossed above the 200-day average for the first time since last summer.The company will next report results on April 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.95 per share on revenues of $13.4 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 28, earnings of $2.55 missed estimates by 44 cents on an 11.2% rise in revenues. Deere (DE)  Click to EnlargeShares of tractor maker Deere (NYSE:DE) are punching up and out of a four-month consolidation range with a test of the $170-a-share level, a high that was first established back in early 2018. A breakout here would result in an extension to new record highs.  * 7 Consumer Stocks to Buy and Hold for Years The company will next report results on May 17 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.57 per share on revenues of $10.2 billion. When the company last reported on Feb. 15, earnings of $1.54 per share missed estimates by 22 cents on a 16.2% rise in revenues. Terex (TEX)  Click to EnlargeShares of Terex (NYSE:TEX), maker of heavy lifting and material handling equipment, are challenging their 200-day moving average and look set for the first sustained push above that level since a previous rally that peaked in January 2018. Management recently issued strong forward guidance, targeting annual revenue growth of 45%.The company will next report results on May 27. Analysts are looking for earnings of 61 cents per share on revenues of $1.1 billion. When the company last reported on Feb. 25, earnings of 51 cents per share beat estimates by 4 cents on a 15.9% rise in revenues. CNH Industrial (CNHI)  Click to EnlargeShares of CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI), the Dutch maker of agricultural and construction equipment, look set to break up and out of a three-month consolidation range as CNHI's 50-day moving average is just beginning to cross up and over its 200-day average. This is the first such &quot;golden cross&quot; since 2016, so value buyers have been waiting a while to get back into this name.  * 7 Reasons the Stock Market Rally Isn't Over Yet The company will next report results on May 7 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 15 cents per share on revenues of $6.7 billion. When the company last reported on Feb. 7, earnings of 21 cents per share beat estimates by 6 cents on a 0.3% drop in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Adjusted per-share earnings came to $1.35, below the $1.76 FactSet consensus. Sales rose to $6.941 billion from $5.974 billion, ahead of the FactSet consensus of $6.853 billion. &quot;Although Deere has continued to make solid progress on a number of fronts and reported higher earnings for the quarter, our results were hurt by higher costs for raw materials and logistics as well by customer concerns over tariffs and trade policies,&quot; Chief Executive Samuel R. Allen said in a statement. &quot;These latter issues have weighed on market sentiment and caused farmers to become more cautious about making major purchases.&quot; The company is expecting those cost pressures to ease in 2019 and is hopeful for &quot;clarity around trade issues&quot;. The company is expecting equipment sales to rise about 7% in fiscal 2019. Shares fell 1.5% premarket and are down 2.6% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500  has gained 0.5%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6702a581-3240-3510-8bb7-639b98671bf9/deere-q1-profit-falls-short.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-02-14	2019-02-14 20:15:49	DE	Deere & Company	10 Hot Stocks Leading the Market’s Blitz Higher	A combination of factors is helping push U.S. equities to fresh highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising to levels not seen since early December on Wednesday.These include hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal (with President Trump reportedly pushing back a tariff deadline), optimism over a budget deal in Congress (hopefully avoiding another government shutdown) and ongoing ease with the Federal Reserve's newly dovish stance.The bulls are going from strength to strength, shifting the focus of their buying as the post-December uptrend matures and changes its nature. From a focus on beaten-down big-cap technology stocks, new areas are piquing the interest of value hunters in areas like energy, industrials and healthcare.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best ETFs You Can Buy With that in mind, here are 10 hot stocks to watch as they lead the market higher: Philips 66 (PSX)Energy stocks like Philips 66 (NYSE:PSX) are coming back to life as crude oil starts to stir, with shares breaking out of a two-month resistance range as the 20-day moving average extends a rise above the 50-day average. Shares were recently upgraded by analysts at Tudor Pickering.The company will next report results on May 10 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.1 per share on revenues of $24.7 billion. When the company last reported on Feb. 8, earnings of $4.87 beat estimates by $1.98 per share on revenues of nearly $29 billion. Hess (HES)Hess (NYSE:HES) is another energy stock to watch, with shares moving to challenge the 200-day moving average to cap what looks like an inverse head-and-shoulders reversal pattern that traces a move to back to the early October high near $75. The company, along with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) recently announced positive results from two offshore wells in Guyana.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever The company will next report results on May 1 before the bell. Analysts are looking for a loss of 21 cents per share on revenues of $1.59 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 30, a loss of 31 cents per share beat estimates by 7 cents on a 30.3% rise in revenues. AMD (AMD)AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shares are consolidating a recent breakout, with the 20-day moving average extending away from its 50-day and 200-day moving averages presaging a break of prior highs and a challenge of the September levels. This would be worth a gain of more than 50% from here. In its most recent quarter, despite weak guidance from management, investors focused on a 9% increase in revenues for its computing and graphics segment thanks to a ramp in its Ryzen processors.The company will next report results on April 30 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 2 cents per share on revenues of $1.25 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 29, earnings of 8 cents per share matched estimates on a 5.9% rise in revenues. Microsoft (MSFT)Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares look ready to emerge from a sloppy looking downward channel that started back in October with a break above a resistance line near $108. Such a break would set up a challenge of the early December high near $112, which would be worth a gain of 5% from here.  * 10 Stocks That Every 20-Year-Old Should Buy The company will next report results on April 25 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1 per share on revenues of $29.9 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 30, earnings of $1.10 beat estimates by a penny on a 12.3% rise in revenues. General Dynamics (GD)General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) shares are holding steady above their 20-day and 50-day moving averages, setting up a run at the prior highs near $185, which coincides with the 200-day moving average. Defense stocks have constantly been listed as hot stocks amid fresh tensions with Iran and steady budgetary support from the Trump White House and Congress.The company will next report results on May 1 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.45 per share on revenues of $9.3 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 30, earnings of $3.07 per share beat estimates by 8 cents on a 25.4% rise in revenues. Deere (DE)Deere (NYSE:DE) is strongly tied to the fate of U.S.-China trade negotiations, given its focus on heavy machinery as well as agriculture equipment used for U.S. food exports. As such, shares are consolidating near prior highs set in early 2018. Watch for an upside breakout following the release of confidence guidance from management.  * 7 Reasons to Own Coca-Cola Stock The company will next report results on Feb. 15 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.8 per share on revenues of $6.9 billion. When the company last reported on Nov. 21, earnings of $2.30 per share missed estimates by 15 cents on a 17.6% rise in revenues. DR Horton (DHI)DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) shares have climbed back up and over their 200-day moving average, setting the stage for a sustained move to test the prior high set in August. In its most recent post-earnings call, management noted that buyer traffic remained strong -- raising hopes for a strong spring selling season.The company will next report results on April 26 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 86 cents per share on revenues of $4 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 25, earnings of 76 cents per share missed estimates by a penny on a 5.6% rise in revenues. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shares are extending above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, looking ready for a run at the prior highs as worries about a baby powder lawsuit fade. The company recently unveiled a plan to buy robotics company Auris Health for roughly $3.4 billion.  * 7 Reasons Stock Buybacks Should Be Illegal The company will next report results on April 23 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.1 per share on revenues of $19.7 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 22, earnings of $1.97 per share beat estimates by 2 cents on a 1% rise in revenues. Under Armour (UAA)Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) shares have bounded above their 200-day moving average to close in on levels not seen since early December, capping a rise of 33% from its recent lows. While shares remain mired in a three-year-old sideways range, watch at the very least for a retest of prior channel highs near $24, which would be worth around a 10% gain from here.The company will next report results on May 14 before the bell. The company last reported results on Feb. 12, with earnings of 9 cents per share beating estimates by 5 cents on a 1.5% rise in revenues. The company remains in turnaround mode here at home, with revenues falling 6% in North America in the most recent quarter. But international growth remains a bright spot, up 24%. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Shares of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) are looking ready to emerge from a multi-month basing pattern going back to October, with the 20-day moving average extending a move above its 50-day moving average as the new uptrend gains momentum. The company was recently upgraded by Morgan Stanley analysts citing expectations that the company is likely to see an earnings boost from higher copper prices.  * 7 Athletic Stocks That Could Run Higher The company will next report results on April 23 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 10 cents per share on revenues of $3.8 billion.

2019-02-14	2019-02-14 14:22:48	DE	Deere & Company	Beware the Risks Facing Deere Stock	Yesterday analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded the shares of global agricultural equipment giant Deere (NYSE:DE) on concerns that the market wasn't looking at DE stock correctly.Namely, the analysts pointed out that Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has been the poster child for the U.S.-China trade war, and that CAT stock has consequently been hit. But Deere has been viewed as less vulnerable to the conflict, and DE stock has consequently weathered the trade war much better. But the analysts argued that this discrepancy makes no sense, and that DE is just as vulnerable as Caterpillar to the U.S.-China trade war.This note resonated with me for two reasons. First of all, DE stock has performed much better than CAT stock, yet both have broad exposure to the trade war. Secondly, and more importantly, the valuation discrepancy between DE stock and CAT stock is nearing levels that have boded badly for DE stock in the past.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Should You Buy, Sell, Or Hold These 7 Medical Cannabis Stocks? As a result, I think the Bank of America analysts are right. Deere is a great company. But DE stock is out over its skis. The technicals, valuation, and sentiment of DE stock are hitting ceilings.Overall, DE stock is maxing out. Deere stock may not fall sharply. But it will likely trade sideways for the foreseeable future. Deere Has Plenty of Trade-War ExposureOver the past year, Deere stock is up 3%, while Caterpillar stock is down over 10%. Meanwhile, so far in 2019, as of yesterday, DE stock had risen nearly 10%, while Caterpillar stock was up less than 5%.Given those metrics, one would reasonably assume that Caterpillar has far more exposure to trade-war headwinds than DE. But that's not entirely true.China, the world's largest soybean importer, used to buy most of its soybeans from the U.S. But as the U.S.-China trade war heated up in 2018, China started relying more heavily on soybeans imported from Argentina and Brazil. Indeed, China didn't buy any soybeans from the U.S. during a six-month stretch in 2018That boycott caused the U.S. to accumulate record soybean inventories. China is slowly starting to buy U.S. soybeans again. But it's not buying enough of them to meaningfully dent the record inventory levels. Thus, heading into the spring planting season, U.S. farmers have way too many soybeans. That means they aren't incentivized to plant that many soybeans this season, and that could ultimately prove to be a major demand headwind for DE.In other words, there will not be adequate demand for Deere's farming equipment this year unless China buys a ton more soybeans. That's anything but certain. Consequently, DE stock can be badly hurt by a continuation of the trade war, and those risks don't seem to be priced into Deere stock. DE Stock Is Maxed OutFrom almost every standpoint, DE stock looks like it is getting ready to reach a ceiling soon.On the valuation front, CAT stock historically has almost always had a larger trailing price-sales multiple than Deere stock. Every once in a while, DE stock rallies when CAT stock doesn't, causing DE's sales multiple to surpass CAT's sales multiple. That rarely happens (it's only occurred once in the past five years), but when it does, it's a leading indicator that DE stock is topping out.Now DE's sales multiple is just a fraction below CAT's sales multiple. As a result, the relative valuation of DE stock looks close to a high pointOn the technical front, DE is nearing the top end of its 52-week trading range. The stock has tested these $160-plus highs multiple times over the past year, but it's never stayed at those levels very long. The Relative Strength Index of Deere stock is also nearing overbought territory, and the stock is about as far above its 50-day moving average as it's been in the past year.On the sentiment front, analysts have grown increasingly skeptical about DE stock as it has risen over the past few months. Back in December and January, the consensus, sell-side rating on the stock was &quot;buy.&quot; In February, though, a bunch of &quot;buy&quot; ratings have shifted to &quot;hold&quot; ratings, and now most analysts have &quot;hold&quot; ratings on DE stock.Overall, it simply looks like Deere stock is getting close to a high point. The Bottom Line on DE StockDeere is a great company. But in light of the underappreciated and misunderstood trade-war risks that DE is facing, DE stock has hit levels which simply aren't supported by the fundamentals. As a result, DE looks like it's about to hit a ceiling.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The stock was trading at $165.18 at that time. However, any decrease to a price target is bad news for a stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt is also worth noting that the note from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst also includes a lower earnings per share estimate for 2019. This has him expecting earnings per share of $11.25 for the year. Wall Street is looking for DE to report earnings per share of $12.84 in 2019.&quot;If the tariffs aren't lifted, and China continues to shun U.S. soybean imports, U.S. farmers will face rising uncertainty into spring planting as U.S. soybean inventories are already soaring,&quot; Gilardi says in a note obtained by CNBC. &quot;In our view, this is a real risk to farm equipment demand in the second half of 2019.&quot;  * 9 U.S. Stocks That Are Coming to Life Again While Deere stock has been performing well lately, several analysts are expecting it to drop down. This is based on trends between DE stock and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) stock over the last decade.

He has worked in nearly every part of our company during his 31-year tenure. He has helped many business leaders, including me, figure out where the business needs improvement and what to focus on first. Pat has also coached and developed many of our financial leaders in the company, inspiring them to be the best that they can be.”

2019-01-08	2019-01-08 16:56:48	DE	Deere & Company	The Four Key Questions to Consider Before Buying Caterpillar Stock	"At this point, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) looks almost absurdly cheap. Caterpillar earnings doubled in 2017, and are guided up close to 70% this year. Yet Caterpillar stock trades at just 11x EPS guidance, and the CAT stock price actually has declined 19% over the past year.

But CAT is a cyclical stock, which means investors need to consider much more than just one- and two-year growth periods. After all, Caterpillar earnings are rising 200%+ over two years but they had declined 60% over the previous four.

Revenue dropped each year over that period. It was the first time ever (including during the Great Depression) that Caterpillar sales had fallen for four consecutive years.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index 



In theory, a cyclical stock like Caterpillar stock should be cheap at the top of the cycle. And the weakness in broad markets, along with an inverted yield curve, strongly suggests that the U.S. and global economies indeed are near a top.

If that's the case, the CAT stock price isn't nearly as cheap as it looks. But there are other factors to consider when it comes to Caterpillar stock. Three other key questions will help determine whether the market was right in selling off CAT or if the decline from January highs has created a buying opportunity.

### 1&#92;. Where Are We In the Cycle?

Again, the most important question for the CAT stock price is understanding where we are in the cycle. In theory, a cyclical like CAT or John Deere (NYSE:DE) should see its earnings multiple contract at the top of the cycle and expand at the bottom. That same phenomenon helps explain why chip stock Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) trades at less than 4x earnings.

Indeed, even when the CAT stock price hit multi-year lows in early 2016, the stock still traded at a high-teen multiple to what investors believed were depressed earnings.

Now, investors see something closer to a peak coming in 2019 or 2020 or worse if the economy turns. Few stocks have more political risk than CAT, as I wrote last month. And so the compressed multiple makes some sense.

Of course, that multiple only makes sense if the cycle actually is turning. And for all the worries in the market right now, there isn't a lot of evidence that turn is coming yet. In fact, Caterpillar posted a blowout Q3, with operating profit growth of 41%. YTD, revenue in Asia has risen 36% - with particular strength in China

For investors who believe the recent market sell-off is overdone, Caterpillar stock at least has to be given a long look.

### 2&#92;. Can Margins Go Any Higher?

From a cyclical standpoint, however, there is a concern in Caterpillar's numbers. Operating margins are at a peak. In fact, they're higher now than in 2012, when Caterpillar benefited from the so-called &quot;commodity supercycle&quot;.

For a cyclical stock, that's not necessarily good news. Peak margins generally aren't sustainable. Indeed, adjusted margins are 16.6% over the past four quarters, according to the company's Q3 presentation. They were just 7.2% in 2016 - and averaged 11% over the past six years.

If those margins settle back in even the 13-14% range, earnings drop over 10%, and the CAT stock price looks closer to 13-14x earnings. That's not far from the stock's historical rang, and in that context Caterpillar stock isn't all that cheap.

That said, it's possible that margins can at least stay around current levels. Caterpillar took billions of dollars in cost out of the business over the past couple of years. Those costs have risen of late - Caterpillar has added flexible workers of late - but been leveraged by revenue growth.

As such, margins probably should be higher than even the salad days of 2011 and 2012. The question is how much higher and for how long.

### 3&#92;. Will Cost Cuts Have a Cost?

That said, one interesting question is whether those cost cuts will have an impact at some point. Caterpillar's workforce dropped 20% between the end of 2013 and the end of 2017.

It's risen 7% over the past year, as sales have rebounded. But Caterpillar still is making the same amount of revenue on the back of roughly 15% fewer workers.

Is that, itself, sustainable?

I've long worried it might not be but performance over the past seven quarters would seem to suggest otherwise. It's possible if not likely at this point that Caterpillar simply is leaner. But even that means that there's likely little room left for improvement and not much the company itself can do to move margins much higher.

### 4&#92;. Is Caterpillar Stock the Best Cyclical Play?

Overall, it does look from here like the CAT stock price is a bit too cheap. Even assuming the ~$12 EPS this year is benefiting from cyclical help, recent cost cuts look sustainable at this point. Tax reform has helped net profit as well. It's not hard to model 'mid-cycle' EPS of $9-10, with a mid-teen multiple suggesting the CAT stock price should be in the $140 range, up ~10% or so from current levels.

The biggest issue, though, is whether Caterpillar stock is the best cyclical stock for investors who believe the sell-off has gone too far. As David Schawel pointed out on Twitter this week, cyclical stocks never have been as cheap on a relative basis as they are right now.

Construction industry stocks have been hammered, and several look cheap, including homebuilders like Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and distributors like GMS (NYSE:GMS) and Beacon Roofing Supply (NASDAQ:BECN). CAT is a bit of a China play at this point - and there's no shortage of value stocks with exposure to that market.

A 2.7% dividend yield does help the case for Caterpillar stock, admittedly. Cyclical risk probably isn't quite as large here. Still, there are a number of good, cheap cyclicals out there. Caterpillar stock is one of them. But I'm skeptical it's the best or necessarily the cheapest.

As of this writing, Vince Martin is long shares of GMS Inc. He has no positions in any other securities mentioned.

A global policy shift away from food aid toward local production - championed at the start of the decade by the World Food Programme among others - has sparked a green revolution, increasing Africa's potential as a market, said Jacques Taylor, managing director of John Deere Ltd Sub-Saharan Africa.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tractor-maker-deere-aims-ride-104928447.html?.tsrc=rss
