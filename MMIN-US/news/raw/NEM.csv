Bulls were very much pressing their bets ahead of the holiday weekend. Sometimes their antics are on full display when you look at the S&P; other times, you have to dig a bit deeper. In today’s article on breakout stocks to buy, I’ll highlight the areas that saw inflows this week and are catching my eye. Then, I’ll divulge three of my favorite stocks to trade. Semiconductors have been one of the growth engines for the tech sector over the past year. The growth fallout had them on the ropes, but they made a comeback this week that helped the Nasdaq return to an uptrend. Small-caps also woke up. The Russell 2000 Index outperformed the S&P 500 and is now sitting soundly on top of its 50-day moving average. Finally, momentum stocks are starting to rise from the ashes. 7 Best Stocks for Upcoming Grads to Buy and Hold Forever Together, these developments point to an improvement in market health and should give buyers the confidence to increase exposure. Here are three stocks to consider:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) Let’s take a closer look at each setup. Breakout Stocks to Buy: Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Two weeks ago, I wouldn’t have touched TTWO. Its price chart was sinking, and better setups beckoned in Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA). But the response to its quarterly report changed everything. And, it leads the list of breakout stocks to buy. Price and volume surged, pushing TTWO from the lower end to the upper end of its three-month trading range in a single bound. Since then, we’ve carved out a clean high base formation. Day-by-day, we’re chewing through overhead supply while digesting the large gains. At the same time, overbought pressures are easing. Look for a break above $188.50 to signal the next up leg is beginning. Then, pull the trigger on bullish trades. With implied volatility in the tank following earnings, I like buying call verticals here. The Trade: Buy the August $190/$200 bull call spread for $3.00 You’re risking $3 to make $7. Snowflake (SNOW) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Snowflake’s price chart has been decisively bearish all year long – until now. With this week’s strength, the once high-flying software company is now above its 50-day moving average. I didn’t find its earnings announcement all that interesting. But the market has spoken, and it’s a message I can’t ignore. Yesterday’s high-volume rally engulfed the prior five trading sessions. It also blasted through a resistance zone that was impenetrable for more than two months. This is actually the first breach of a ceiling we’ve seen since SNOW stock topped last December. I suspect many bears are running scared, given the change in character. 7 Best Stocks for Upcoming Grads to Buy and Hold Forever Since the trend reversal is still in its infancy, I prefer higher probability cash flow trades over shooting for the moon with an aggressive bet. If you think SNOW can stay above $200 for the next month, enter the following spread. The Trade: Sell the July $200/$195 bull put for 65 cents. You’re risking $4.35 to make 65 cents. However, the loss will be far less if you exit on a break of $200. Breakout Stocks to Buy: Newmont Mining (NEM) Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade The final entry in our breakout stocks is in an area that’s no stranger to strength this year – gold stocks. Inflation worries are carrying precious metals higher and gold miners have been big beneficiaries. After making a new 52-week high, NEM has been coiling quietly in a narrow range. Volume remains subdued. This signals we’re seeing garden variety profit-taking and not some mass exodus. The pause is allowing the 20-day moving average to play catch-up and overbought pressures to ease. Now is the time to prep trades for the next breakout. I like using $75 as the trigger point. The Trade: Buy the August $75/$80 bull call vertical for around $1.40. The spread cost will be slightly higher if you wait for NEM to take out resistance first.

2021-05-19	2021-05-19 13:26:00	NEM	Newmont Corporation	White Gold Corp. Outlines Additional Significant Gold Anomalies at the Betty Property, Yukon, Canada	"TORONTO, May 19, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- White Gold Corp. (TSX.V: WGO, OTC: WHGOF, FRA: 29W) (the “Company”) is pleased to announce significant soil geochemistry results from 2020 soil sampling at its Betty property. The property is strategically located contiguous to and 15km northeast of Western Copper and Gold Corporation’s (TSX: WRN, NYSE: WRN) Casino deposit (14.5 Moz gold & 7.1 Blbs copper (Measured & Indicated) and 6.6 Moz gold and 3.3 Blb copper (Inferred), and 40km east of Newmont Corporation’s (NYSE: NEM, TSX: NGT) Coffee Gold deposit which host gold resources of 2.17 Moz Indicated & 0.50 Moz Inferred (Figure 1). The Betty property consists of 860 claims totalling 17,127 hectares that cover the strike extension of the east-trending dextral strike-slip Coffee Creek Fault which exerts important structural controls on mineralization at the Coffee deposit. This work formed part of the Company’s 2020 exploration program backed by strategic partners Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (TSX: AEM, NYSE: AEM) and Kinross Gold Corp (TSX: K, NYSE: KGC) on its extensive 420,000 hectare land package in the prolific White Gold District, Yukon, Canada. Highlights Include: The Betty property is located on the eastern extension of the Coffee Creek Fault, which hosts Newmont’s Coffee deposit containing gold resources of 2.17 Moz Indicated and 0.50 Moz Inferred.The Betty property hosts multiple targets with potential for several mineral deposit types including orogenic gold and precious and base metal veins.2020 exploration work included ground magnetic surveys and 2,030 infill soil geochemistry samples in several areas which has further enhanced several anomalies on the property that will be further evaluated this coming season.2021 follow up exploration to include first ever diamond drilling.The Company also announces its participation in several upcoming virtual conferences and invites interested parties to register to learn more about the Company’s unique district-scale gold exploration opportunity with significant defined resources, recent discoveries and new discovery potential in the prolific White Gold District, Yukon, Canada. “We are very pleased with these additional results from our Betty property. These results in addition to the previous work performed, and the property’s close proximity to large gold and copper deposits are very encouraging. We are very excited to diamond drill test these targets this year and further demonstrate the expansiveness of gold mineralization in the White Gold District, and the effectiveness of our exploration methodologies” stated David D’Onofrio, CEO of the Company. Figures accompanying this news release can be found at: http://whitegoldcorp.ca/investors/exploration-highlights/ Betty Property The Betty property covers an area measuring 15km north-south by up to 18km east-west. Equipment and materials can be staged from the Casino airstrip or from the Britannia Creek barge landing, located near the northwest corner of the property. The property hosts several early-stage exploration targets including the Betty Ford, Betty White, Betty Grable, Betty Black and Mascot targets. The Betty property located approximately 65km southeast of the Company’s flagship Golden Saddle and Arc Deposits, which have a combined mineral resource of 1,139,900 ounces Indicated at 2.28 g/t gold and 402,100 ounces Inferred at 1.39 g/t gold. Geology The Betty property is underlain primarily by Late Devonian metasedimentary rocks of the Snowcap Assemblage which have been intruded by the Middle Cretaceous Dawson Range granodiorite and diorite in the southern portion of the property. The Snowcap Assemblage rocks consist of a folded package of quartzite(s), biotite gneiss/schist, quartz feldspar gneiss, augen gneiss, and minor marble and hornblende gneiss. The units form an open, east-west trending, isoclinal antiform with units on the southern limb having a gentle dip to the south and units on the northern limb having a moderate to steep dip to the north. The structural and geological framework of the Betty and Hayes property located immediately to the east is characterized by 4 major fault arrays: 1) WNW-trending Yukon River Shear Zone (YRSZ); 2) E-W trending Coffee Creek fault; 3) NW-trending Big Creek fault; and 4) NE-trending Dip Creek fault. The Coffee Creek and Big Creek fault systems are highly prospective structures that, respectfully, control orogenic gold at Newmont's Coffee Gold deposit and porphyry and epithermal gold mineralization at Triumph Gold Corp.’s (TSX.V: TIG) Nucleus and Revenue deposits to the southeast. Furthermore, the YRSZ constitutes a major crustal break within the Yukon-Tanana terrane, while the Dip Creek fault develops southeast of the Casino Cu-Au-Mo porphyry deposit transecting the Dawson Range in a NE-orientation. A new detailed structural interpretation of the Betty – Hayes properties is currently ongoing and is expected to significantly enhance the understanding of property- and target-scale structural controls on mineralization. 2020 Exploration Program The 2020 Betty exploration program included ground magnetics and VLF-EM surveys totaling 343 line kilometres on two separate grids, and infill soil geochemistry sampling on six separate grids at 25m spacings on 100m spaced survey lines (Figure 2 & 3). At total of 2,030 infill soil samples were collected where previous soil sampling had been at 50m sample spacings on 100m spaced survey lines. The areas infilled covered areas ranging from 400m x 600m to 3100m (east-west) x 2400m (north – south). A summary of the soil sampling results on the Betty property is provided below, as well as brief descriptions of the Betty Ford, Betty White and Mascot targets. Betty Ford Target The Betty Ford zone occurs approximately 700m to the south of the Betty White target and is associated with an east-west trending 300m x 200m gold in soil anomaly along a steep north facing slope. Work to date indicates the anomaly, which has gold in soil values of up to 461 ppb, is associated with fractured, quartz-sericite-pyrite altered, micaceous quartzite. RAB drilling in 2018 intersected near-surface mineralization grading 0.94 g/t Au over 24.39m in hole BETFRDRAB-001, and 1.08 g/t Au over 50.29m in hole BETFRDRAB-002. A second area of anomalous soil geochemistry at Betty Ford, which remains to be drill tested, lies 250m to the ENE and exhibits lower gold values but strong lead and silver values (up to 853 ppm Pb and 28 ppm Ag). Betty White Target The Betty White target consists of a > 800m long, NE trending Au, As, and Sb soil anomaly across a north facing hillside above Sunshine Creek. The zone is currently interpreted as a NE trending fault/shear zone and gold mineralization at surface has been partially outlined over 400m of the trend from GT Probe sampling, and limited rotary air blast (RAB) drilling. The mineralization is hosted within a E-NE striking, gently south dipping (~20°) package of biotite schist-gneiss, quartzite, minor hornblende gneiss, and cross-cutting, mafic feldspar porphyry dikes, and is associated with a 125m wide zone of strong sericite +/- carbonate alteration containing disseminated to fracture-controlled pyrite and arsenopyrite. The strongest gold mineralization occurs over a 25m wide interval within the broader alteration halo and is associated with strong silicification, increased sulphide content, increased folding and crenulation of the rock units, and mm-scale quartz veinlets and brecciation. Results from 2018 RAB drilling by the Company include 0.47 g/t Au over 22.86m in hole BETWHTRAB-019 and 1.80 g/t Au over 4.57m in hole BETWHTRAB-021. Mascot Target The Mascot target area is located in the southern portion of the property and is hosted within Dawson Range intrusive rocks. Several sub-zones including the Page, Boop, Rubble and Davis zones have been defined through soil geochemistry over a 3km trend, with two distinct multi-element suites. The Davis zone is defined by Au-As-Ag-Pb-Zn +/- Sb, while the Rubble and Page are defined by Au-As-Bi-Sb. The Boop appears to have an overlap between these two signatures. The mineralization appears to be related to narrow (<5m) fault/fracture zones with narrow selvages of quartz-sericite-carbonate alteration within the granodiorite. Mineralization typically consists of disseminated to massive sulphides (pyrite > arsenopyrite ± sphalerite ± galena ± chalcopyrite) along cm-scale veinlets with the strongest mineralization associated with silicification. The Mascot area saw significant reverse circulation (RC) drilling in 2012 by Ethos Gold Corp.

2021-04-29	2021-04-29 16:50:58	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Newmont Earnings And Revenue Miss Estimates In 1Q; Shares Plunge 3%	"Newmont Corporation (NGT) shares fell more than 3% Thursday after the world’s largest gold miner reported lower revenue and profit than expected in its first quarter. Newmont’s revenue came in at $2.87 billion for the quarter ended March 31, an increase of 11% from $2.58 billion in the prior-year quarter. The rise is mainly due to higher average realized prices for metals, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Revenue missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.86%. Meanwhile, adjusted net income was $594 million or $0.74 per share in 1Q 2021, an improvement from $326 million or $0.40 per diluted share in 1Q 2020. However, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.75 per share. The average realized price of gold jumped 10% to $1,751 per ounce in the quarter. Production fell 1.4% to 1.46 million ounces due to the sale of its Red Lake mine and Covid-related disruptions at its Cerro Negro mine. Newmont President and CEO Tom Palmer said, ""In the first quarter we delivered a solid financial performance with $1.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $442 million in free cash flow, putting Newmont on track to achieve our full-year guidance with improving production expected in the second half of the year. We remain confident in the strength of our business as we invest in our world-class portfolio, strengthening the balance sheet and sustaining our quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share."" (See Newmont Mining stock analysis on TipRanks.) Two days ago, J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Glick maintained a Buy rating on the stock but lowered its price target to $75.00 (C$92.21) for a 20.7% upside potential. Glick said in a research note that gold stocks have come under pressure from rising real yields and falling gold prices since the start of the year. Overall, the consensus on the Street is that NGT is a Strong Buy based on 7 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of C$87.99 implies an upside potential of about 15% from current levels.

2021-04-29	2021-04-29 16:28:51	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Copper Boom Is Just Beginning for the CEO of Biggest Gold Miner	(Bloomberg) -- Copper may be flirting with record highs but the metal is far from peaking as the energy transition revs up, according to Newmont Corp. Chief Executive Officer Tom Palmer.Futures hit $10,000 a metric ton on Thursday for the first time since 2011 as mines struggle to keep up with surging demand. Newmont, the world’s largest gold producer, is increasing exposure to copper through several “mega projects,” Palmer said on an earnings call. Even if just one materializes, copper will account for 15-20% of the company’s total output by the end of the decade, he said.“I’m pretty excited about having good exposure to copper at that time when the world is going through the energy transition,” Palmer said on an interview with Bloomberg TV following the earnings call. “Copper’s got a pretty good story in front of it. I think its day in the sun is more towards the end of this decade.”The copper push doesn’t mean Palmer has a downbeat view on gold. He sees bullion prices holding their current “very healthy levels” or even moving higher given fiscal and monetary stimulus. India should remain one of the key sources of demand after the country recovers from the Covid-19 tragedy, Palmer said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/copper-boom-just-beginning-ceo-162851510.html?.tsrc=rss

The pushback by the Tahltan First Nation carries extra weight due to the group's outsized influence in its territory, in contrast to similar groups who oppose mining elsewhere.

The Transaction is a testament to the years of diligent, professional work by the entire GT Gold team. My fellow directors and I would like to express our thanks and appreciation to all who have been involved in successfully advancing the Tatogga project to this stage from discovery to sale in just over four years. The Transaction is not only a great outcome for our shareholders, but also one that we believe will benefit all our rightsholders and stakeholders in the coming years.” Transaction Summary The Transaction will be implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) and will require the approval of: (i) 66 2/3% of the votes cast by the holders of GT Gold’s common shares; and (ii) a simple majority of the votes cast by holders of GT Gold common shares after excluding votes from certain shareholders, including Newmont, as required under MI 61-101, at a special meeting of GT Gold shareholders to be held to consider the Transaction.

2021-02-18	2021-02-18 16:28:45	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Top Gold Miners Face Metal’s Fading Rally After Bumper Quarter	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s two biggest gold producers got a lift from elevated precious-metals prices at the end of last year, but with bullion in retreat miners may have to work harder to keep investor interest.Newmont Corp., the world’s largest gold producer, said this week it’s enriching dividend payouts, while Barrick Gold Corp., the No. 2 supplier, is giving shareholders some proceeds from selling off mines. Both reported better-than-expected earnings on Thursday, helped by lower costs and higher metals prices.Gold averaged about 26% higher in last year’s fourth quarter than the same period in 2019, boosted by pandemic-induced haven buying, low interest rates and stimulus spending. The rally has sputtered this year on a resilient dollar and optimism of prospects for a global economic recovery. That’s weighing on share prices in the industry, with a Bloomberg Intelligence gauge of senior miners posting its worst January since 2013.Newmont shares slipped 5.5% this year after surging 38% in 2020. Barrick has fallen 10%, after last year’s 23% jump.Newmont reported adjusted earnings of $1.06 a share for the fourth quarter, beating the 95-cent average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The Denver-based company boosted its regular quarterly dividend by 38% to 55 cents per share, reinforcing a framework announced last October to give investors “clarity” on distributions amid elevated gold prices.“You’re going to continue to see Newmont meet their promises in terms of meeting guidance and having that consistency in terms of returning cash to shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer Tom Palmer said in a phone interview.Barrick, the most profitable major bullion producer in the past year, delivered a sixth straight earnings beat, with adjusted per-share earnings of 35 cents topping the 31-cent average estimate of analysts. The Toronto-based company said Thursday it plans to give investors a capital distribution of 42 cents a share as part of the $1.5 billion in proceeds from selling assets including its stake in Australia’s Kalgoorlie mine in 2019.“It’s a deserved return back to shareholders who have had challenging times at Barrick in the past,” CEO Mark Bristow said in a phone interview. “At the same time, we haven’t touched the strength of our balance sheet.”If gold prices stay above $1,700 an ounce, Barrick will continue building up its cash, according to Bristow, who said he is “wary” while managing the company’s financial position at the “top of the market”.“You should carry some insurance on your balance sheet,” Bristow said, adding that he’s anticipating more mergers and acquisitions ahead for the industry. “We’ve been very clear that we want to participate in that consolidation, particularly when it comes to high quality assets.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-gold-miners-face-metal-162845530.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-18	2021-02-18 11:24:31	NEM	Newmont Corporation	J.P. Morgan Says These 3 Gold Stocks Could Surge 40% (Or More)	Let’s talk about gold. The precious metal is the traditional safe haven investment, backed by its use – starting 5,000 years ago – as a reliable store of value. Investors looking to protect their portfolio and secure their wealth traditionally bought heavily into gold, and the price of gold has sometimes been used as a proxy (albeit an inverse one) for general economic health. In a recent report, investment firm J.P. Morgan took a long look at the state of the gold industry – specifically, the gold mining industry. Analyst Tyler Langton points out an underlying paradox in two basic facts about gold mines. “Over time, in a commodity business, the lowest cost producers with the longest life assets tend to be the relative winners… Gold mines, when compared to base metals, typically have much shorter mines (sic) lives, and the gold miners have to focus on replacing reserves to maintain levels of production,” Langton noted. At first glance, Langton’s paradox may seem to point away from heavy investments in gold mines. After all, these are high-risk commodity producers. But current times are actually pretty good for gold miners. Prices are elevated compared to recent years; the metal is running just under $1,800 per ounce now, but it peaked above $2,000 in August of last year, at the height of the corona shutdowns, and it was as low as $1,200 just 18 months ago. The current high prices bode well for producers. Langton states his belief that there is support for current prices, with gold and gold mines being seen as a hedge against ‘macro uncertainty.’ He believes that the main sources of support will be found in “real interest rates remaining lower for longer and COVID-19 related stimulus measures continuing to expand central bank balance sheets.” With this in the background, Langton and his colleagues have begun selecting the gold mining stocks they see as winners in the current environment. Unsurprisingly, they like the companies that show discipline on M&A activity, a focus on free cash flow, and solid returns to shareholders. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up the details on several of their recent picks. Are they as good as gold? The analysts seem to think so; all are Buy-rated and potentially offer significant upside. Let’s dig in. Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC) First up, Kinross Gold, is a mid-cap company– valued at $8.6 billion – with active mining operations in the US, Brazil, West Africa, and Russia. Taken together, these operations have proven and probable gold reserves of 29.9 million ounces. The company is guiding toward 2.4 million ounces in total production for 2021, rising to 2.9 million ounces by 2023. The company’s profitability can be seen by cost of sales per ounce, at $790, and the all-in sustaining cost, at $1,025 per ounce. With gold currently selling at $1,782 on the commodity exchanges, Kinross’s near-term success is clear. Two sets of statistics highlight Kinross’ profitability. First, the company’s recent record of quarterly results shows steadily rising revenues and earnings. Aside from a dip in 1Q20, at the start of the corona crisis, Kinross’ revenues have been gaining steadily since the start of 2019 – and even in 2020, every quarter showed a year-over-year increase. After 7 years without dividend payments, Kinross used its strong performance in recent months to restore the company dividend. Payments are still made irregularly, but since announcing in September 2020 that the dividend would be reinstated, two payments have been made and a third has been announced for March of this year. Each payment has been for 3 cents per share, which translates to a modest yield of 1.6%. The key point here is not strength of the yield, but rather, the confidence that management has displayed in the near- to mid-term by restarted dividend payments. Based on current production projections, the payments are expected to continue until 2023. Tyler Langton, in his notes on Kinross, comes to a bullish conclusion: “Given its expected growth projects and pipeline of additional projects, we think Kinross will be able to maintain average annual production of 2.5mm oz. over the next decade. The company has an attractive cost profile, and we expect costs to decrease over the next several years. The company should also generate attractive strong levels of FCF at current gold prices, and we expect Kinross to direct this cash toward internal growth projects and its dividend.” In line with these comments, he selects Kinross as JPM’s ‘top pick in the gold sector,’ and rates the stock as Overweight (i.e., a Buy). His $11 price target suggests a 61% upside potential in the coming year. (To watch Langton’s track record, click here) Kinross gets a Strong Buy recommendation from the analyst consensus, based on a 6 to 2 split between the Buy and Hold reviews. Wall Street’s analysts have set an average price target of $11.25, slightly more bullish than Langton’s, and implying a one-year upside of 64% from the current trading price of $6.85. (See KGC stock analysis on TipRanks) SSR Mining, Inc. (SSRM) Moving up north to Canada, we now take a look at Vancouver-based SSR Mining. This is another mid-cap mining company, producing gold and silver in quantity through four active mines in Canada, the US, Argentina, and Turkey. The Canadian, US, and Turkish operations produce primarily gold, while the Puna operation is Argentina’s largest silver mine. Although SSR missed on both the top- and bottom-line estimates in its latest quarterly report, for the 2020 full-year production numbers, the company met the previously set guidance. Gold production for the year hit 643,000 ounces, with 31% of that total coming in the fourth quarter. Silver production at the Puna mine reached 5.6 million ounces, beating the guidance figures. Fourth quarter production was 39% of the total. Last November, the company announced that it will be initiating a dividend policy starting in 1Q21. The ‘base dividend’ will be set at 5 cents per share, or a 1% yield; as with KGC above, the key point is not whether the dividend is high or low, but that management is starting to pay it out – a sign of confidence in the future. Langton bases his assessment of SSRM on its strong free cash flow forecast, writing, “At current gold forward prices, we estimate that SSR will generate close to $400mm of FCF in 2021 and around $500mm per year from 2022-2024. Furthermore, starting from a 2021 base, we forecast that SSR would generate cumulative FCF from 2021- 2025 of US$2.3bn, or roughly 59% of its current market cap…” In line with his comments, Langton puts an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock, along with a $24 price target that indicates a 60% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Langton’s track record, click here) There are 8 recent reviews on SSRM shares – and every single one of them is a Buy, making the Strong Buy analyst consensus rating here unanimous. The stock is selling for $15.25, and its robust $28.78 average price target suggests a high 89% one-year upside. (See SSRM stock analysis on TipRanks) Newmont Mining (NEM) Last on the list, Newmont, is the world’s largest gold miner, boasting a $45.78 billion market cap, and active production in a variety of metals, including gold, silver, copper, zinc, and lead. The company has assets – both operations and prospects – in North and South America, Africa, and Australia, and is the only gold miner listed on the S&P 500. With that last detail in mind, it’s worth noting that NEM shares are up 29% in the last 12 months – more than the S&P’s gain of 16% over the same period. In 3Q20, the company showed $3.12 billion in revenue. While this missed the forecast, it did improve on the prior year’s Q3 by 5.4%. The Q3 results were also a company record, with a free cash flow of $1.3 billion. Results below expectations were a common pattern for the company’s 2020 performance in Q1 and Q2, as well. The corona crisis depressed results, but even the depressed results were up year-over-year. Newmont has an active capital return program for shareholders. Since the beginning of 2019, the company has used both dividends and share repurchases to return capital to stakeholders, to the tune of $2.7 billion. This past January, Newmont announced a $1 billion continuation of the share repurchases. Looking ahead to 2021, the company has also announced a new dividend framework, setting the base payment at $1 per share annualized, and reiterated its commitment to capital return. JPM’s Michael Glick led the note on Newmont, starting out by acknowledging the company’s strong production: “We are forecasting NEM’s attributable gold production to remain relatively steady over the 2021-2025 time frame at around 6.5-6.7mm oz…” Of the company’s mid-term production prospects Glick went on to say, “In terms of production, the ongoing expansion at Tanami should deliver incremental production and lower cash costs starting in 2023. Additionally, we expect Newmont to approve its Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides projects this year, which should bring on incremental production for the company after the projects’ roughly three-year development time-line.” Glick likes Newmont’s FCF and production numbers, using them to back his Overweight (Buy) rating. His $83 price target implies an upside of 46% for the months ahead. (To watch Glick’s track record, click here) Newmont, for all its strength, still gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. This is based on 8 reviews, including 5 Buys and 3 Holds. The average price target is $74.97, suggesting room for 31% growth from the current trading price of $56.99.

There has been increasing pressure from investors and environmental groups on the mining industry to tackle issues such as climate change and pollution.  Newmont, which also aims a 30% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, said it would implement a new energy and climate investment standard to ensure that the targets are embedded into investment decisions related to fleet vehicles, production equipment and onsite renewable power generation.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-miner-newmont-targets-net-153028871.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-11-12	2020-11-12 14:30:00	NEM	Newmont Corporation	World’s Top Gold Miner Sets New Targets to Cut Carbon Emissions	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s largest gold miner has just set new targets to cut emissions by 2030 and said it wants to go carbon neutral two decades later.But while Newmont Corp.’s plan is more ambitious than that of other mining companies including BHP Group and Barrick Gold Corp., it doesn’t fully address the elephant in the room for the global industry: the so-called Scope 3 emissions, which are generated by its supply chain and customer use.The Greenwood Village, Colorado-based company plans to cut emissions from its operations and power generation 30% by 2030 from 2018 levels, with the target for Scope 3 set at 15%, according to a statement. It also wants to go carbon neutral by 2050, but provides little detail on how that will be achieved.“We recognize that there are many aspects of Scope 3 emissions that are beyond our control, but I think that still requires us to work with our suppliers, work with our joint venture partners to find pathways to achieving net zero within that time frame,” Chief Executive Officer Tom Palmer said in a telephone interview. “For us, setting that goal, that ambition, that aspiration by 2050 very much puts the onus on us to work with those different stakeholders.”Miners and other natural-resource producers are coming under pressure from climate-focused investors to set decarbonization targets. Most of the plans published target cuts of up to 30% by 2030, far below what’s needed to reach the Paris Agreement goals, according to a January study by McKinsey & Co.BHP Group, the world’s biggest miner, set out new targets to lower emissions from its own operations by almost a third by 2030 and to zero by 2050, but has faced criticism for not setting targets for absolute cuts in its supply chain. Barrick has committed to reducing emissions by at least 10% by 2030.For ESG data on Newmont, click here.Newmont said the 2030 reductions target will be embedded into investment decisions for projects such as fleet vehicles, production equipment, onsite renewable power generation and energy efficiency, according to the statement. About 88% of the firm’s energy use for mining and milling is generated from carbon-based fuels, and progress will be reported using The Climate-Related Financial Disclosures guidelines, with the first report expected next year.“When you talk about an aspiration at 2050, we don’t have the pathways to fully get there yet,” Palmer said. “But we’re miners and we’re in the business of exploration and we’re a business that is about science. And when good leaders and good mining companies put their minds to it and explore different ways to do things, we can encourage the technology and innovation that is going to help us get there.”“I’m confident that we can work together and I’m confident that if we do work together we will find those pathways.”The mining industry alone accounts for 4% to 7% of emissions globally, with the bulk of that coming from their suppliers and customers, McKinsey said. The firm said that staying on track to keep temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius would require all sectors to cut emissions by at least 50% by 2050 from 2010 levels. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees would require at least 85%.“Mining companies’ published emission targets tend to be more modest than that,” McKinsey said. “Any serious effort to implement Paris Agreement goals would require a major contribution from the entire value chain.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-top-gold-miner-sets-143000766.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-06	2020-11-06 19:45:09	NEM	Newmont Corporation	3 Gold Stocks Offering Glittering Value	"It’s been a great year to be involved with gold. For example, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD), is higher by 24.5%. However, it’s an even better time to embrace gold stocks. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) proves as much with year-to-date gain of almost 32%.
Those data points underscore the double-edged sword that is investing in gold stocks. When the yellow metal is performing well, as it is this year, miners are great places to be, often overshooting bullion’s gains. Conversely, when gold is flat or declines, gold stocks can slump in dramatic fashion.
Obviously, these are good days for gold stocks and there are sound fundamentals shoring up that case. For example, miners have strong balance sheets, are rewarding investors with buybacks and dividends and much, if not all, of the group will be cash flow positive at some point next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
7 Augmented Reality Stocks To Buy Now For The Future
With those fine traits to consider, here’s a trio of gold stocks that have the potential continue minting gains for investors.
AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE:AU)
Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM)
Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD)

AngloGold Ashanti (AU)

Sharing is caring and South African miner AngloGold Ashanti is a believer in that sentiment and that’s a big part of the thesis here. AU stock started November on a strong note, posting its best intraday performance in three months after the company said its free cash flow rose to $339 million during the September quarter.
Twenty percent of that capital is being deployed into a doubling of the dividend while the miner is also moving its payout schedule to twice annually from once a year. The payout increase is obviously notable, but investors should latch onto here is that it’s being fund with free cash, meaning AU stock won’t be burdened by the newly higher dividend.
Speaking of cash, AngloGold is looking to repatriate a combined $489 million currently held in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania.
For those that need more to like with this gold stock, AngloGold is undervalued relative to some of its global peers and its debt burden resides at its lowest levels in a decade. In other words, AU stock offers the alluring combination of dividend growth and declining liabilities.

Newmont (NEM)

Speaking of gold stocks and dividend growth, Colorado-based Newmont twice boosted its payout this year. Under any circumstances, two payout hikes in a year is impressive, but it’s even more impressive when considering how many S&P 500 slashed or suspended payouts this year.
As is the case with rival AngloGold, Newmont is a pristine balance sheet story. Last year, the company generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow, all of which was returned to investors via buybacks and dividends. In the third quarter, the miner generated $1.6 billion in cash from continuing operations and $1.3 billion in free cash flow.
Translation: In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is serving as an excuse for so many companies in myriad industries, Newmont just delivered its best ever set of quarterly numbers.
7 Augmented Reality Stocks To Buy Now For The Future
NEM stock yields 2.47%, which implies room for growth and is well above what investors grab on the S&P 500 or 10-year Treasuries. Its two dividend hikes this year were 79% and 60%, respectively, and it has $4.8 billion in consolidated cash.
At $1.60 annually, Newmont has the highest dividend among gold stocks and by the end of this year, the miner will have returned $2.5 billion to investors via dividends and share repurchases.

Barrick Gold (GOLD)

Like its aforementioned peers, Barrick Gold is a strong balance sheet story. So strong in fact that its credit rating was recently upgraded to Baa1 from Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service.
“Barrick’s liquidity is excellent, which provides significant flexibility to maneuver through gold price volatility,” said Moody’s. “Barrick has $8.7 billion in liquidity sources over the next twelve months with no meaningful uses during this period. Sources consist of cash of $3.7 billion at June 2020, an undrawn $3 billion revolver (expires in January 2025) and expected positive free cash flow generation of about $2 billion at a $1,700/oz gold price sensitivity for the remainder of 2020 and $1,400/oz for 2021.”
Barrick is adept at managing costs, a crucial consideration for investors mulling gold stocks. In the second quarter, it cost the company just $716 to produce an ounce of gold. Mining costs vary from quarter to quarter, but even if Barrick’s inputs rise to the $800 per ounce area, it’d still be highly profitable even if gold prices dramatically decline.
The Canadian miner could produce as much as 5 million ounces of bullion this year, a number that could increase once Covid-19 is put to rest.

2020-10-16	2020-10-16 19:29:39	NEM	Newmont Corporation	3 Flashy Precious Metals Stocks to Show Off Now	"Most investors typically value precious metals as safe havens in times of an economic downturn. Due to the novel coronavirus-led market slowdown, several investors have turned to precious metals in protecting their investments.
For example, gold prices have risen over 27% in the past year compared to 19% growth in the S&P 500 index.
However, these companies tend to different sensitivities based on their businesses. The demand for industrial metals tends to fluctuate with the global economy. Hence, the current recession has slowed down demand for companies focusing on the production of industrial metals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
7 Value Stocks To Buy in an Overvalued Market
On the flip side, the value of precious metals is inversely linked to the economy. The evidence is that in the first half of the year, gold and silver prices shot up to multiyear highs.
Let’s look at three of the best precious metals stock to buy:
Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD)
Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM)
Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM)

Precious Metals To Buy: Barrick Gold (GOLD)
Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com
	
Barrick Gold is one of the more established and diversified gold miners. It is primarily involved in the production and sale of precious metals, mainly copper and gold.
Additionally, it is also involved in related activities such as mine development and exploration. The Canada-based company has 16 operating sites in 13 countries. A 12-month return relative to the S&P is over 47% for GOLD stock.
The company is on track to meet its production targets for the year, despite the crippling effects. Gold production is at 2.4 million ounces, roughly at the mid-point of its 5-million-ounce guidance for the year. Adjusted net earnings per share were at 23 cents, which is up 44% sequentially. Moreover, the quarterly dividend increased by 14% during the quarter.
The balance sheet position is relatively strong, with low debt and a robust cash position. Moreover, it has $3 billion in free cash flows with no significant maturities until 2033. Therefore, GOLD is one of the hottest precious metals stocks going in the sector today.

Newmont Corporation (NEM)

Newmont is the world’s largest gold producer with the industry’s best asset portfolio. Its diversified product base includes precious metals such as gold, copper, silver, zinc and lead.
The U.S.-based gold miner has its operational bases in the United States, Australia, Peru, Ghana and Suriname. Despite the impact of Covid-19, the 12-month return relative to the S&P is roughly 50% for NEM stock.
The second quarter was rough on the company mainly due to five of its operations being closed for maintenance. As a result, attributable gold production was down roughly 21% year-over-year to 1.3 million ounces.
However, the average realized price improved substantially by 31%. With gold prices above $2000 per ounce, third-quarter results should be significantly better with higher margins. Nevertheless, Adjusted EPS was down 12% sequentially.
7 Value Stocks To Buy in an Overvalued Market
Newmont aims to cut costs and becoming a leaner company in the future. Hence, capital expenditures declined by $48 million to $280 million. Additionally, the company has generated roughly $1 billion in free cash flows in the first half of the year.
It is also the industry leader in terms of dividend yield at 1.45%, paying an annual dividend of $1 per share.

Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM)

Wheaton Precious Metals is one of the largest precious metal’s royalties and streaming companies in the world.  It currently has streaming agreements with nine development stage projects and 20 mines. It is one of the best-performing stocks in the sector as WPM stock’s 12-month return is roughly 95%.
The company had a stellar second quarter despite the struggles of many of its competitors in the sector. Revenues were up 30.9% over the prior-year period, pushing net income to $105.8 million. It had posted a net loss of $124.7 million in the same period last year. Its mining partners produced 156,188 gold-equivalent ounces in the second quarter, a 5.5% increase from last year.
The company’s balance sheet position is healthy, with a net debt-equity ratio of only 0.09. In the second quarter alone, it reduced its debt by $80 million.
Additionally, its free cash flow of $151.8 million is more than enough to cover its dividend costs. Wheaton has a dividend payout ratio of 0.48, which is significantly better than its competitors mentioned in the article.

2020-10-08	2020-10-08 07:42:51	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Barrick CEO Says Gold Industry Still Needs to Consolidate	(Bloomberg) -- Barrick Gold Corp.’s top executive says the gold industry needs more consolidation so it can increase exploration to boost depleting reserves, lure more generalist investors and improve efficiencies.The flurry of deals that characterized the sector in the past two years will likely continue, with miners in Australia already “stamping their mark” on the industry, Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said in a virtual South African mining conference. Mergers and acquisitions are likely to dominate the sector in Africa, and are needed in Canada, where the world’s second-largest gold miner is based.“The industry still needs further consolidation,” Bristow said Wednesday. “Canada still needs more work on consolidation.”While there was a rush for deals after Barrick’s 2018 mega-merger with Randgold Resources Ltd. and Newmont Corp.’s subsequent acquisition of Goldcorp Inc., purchases have slowed as gold’s rally to an all-time high this year pushed up the price of assets.Gold mining deals worth about $14 billion have been completed, or agreed, so far this year, compared with about $26 billion in 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Bristow cautioned producers against merely “rearranging the deck chairs” through deals. Gold miners must invest in finding new deposits to replace reserves, he said.For its part, Barrick remains interested in acquiring more so-called tier-1 assets, including Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s Grasberg mine in Indonesia, Bristow said.“Barrick as you know is completely, single-mindedly focused on tier-1 assets, and so it’s going to be of interest to us because there aren’t many tier-1 assets left that we don’t own or own part of,” he said.Tier-1 gold assets are generally considered to have output of at least 500,000 ounces a year and long-term costs at the lower end of industry averages.(Updates with value of deals in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/barrick-ceo-says-gold-mining-174634864.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-28	2020-09-28 21:00:08	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Rio Needs More Than a Safe Pair Of Hands	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Rio Tinto Group may choose to play it safe in its next choice of chief executive officer. With Jean-Sebastien Jacques heading for the exit after the destruction of a sacred Aboriginal site, Australian politicians are also piling on pressure for a local to be given the role. The mining giant should resist the temptation of an old-school solution.Jacques’s successor will certainly have to rebuild Rio’s credibility after the spectacular failure at Juukan Gorge. Repairing frayed community and government relations will be among the first tasks. It won’t be enough to pick a veteran technocrat for CEO, though, as miners did after the mistakes of the last boom. He or she won’t be able to repeat the trick that saw French-born J-S, as he is widely known, hand back billions to shareholders. The new boss will have to show Rio understands the iron ore business, which accounts for more than 90% of earnings and where prices are softening. Longer-term reconstruction will also involve resolving large, troublesome projects in Guinea and Mongolia, and positioning the company for greener growth. A steady hand on the tiller, while necessary, won’t be sufficient.Jacques, who took the top job in 2016 at 44, did plenty of things right. Rio has distributed $38 billion in cash returns since that year, including 2020’s interim dividend, and the shares have doubled. He extricated Rio from the Freeport-McMoRan Inc.-operated Grasberg mine in Indonesia. And he sold out of coal at a laudable price, well before peers began to rush for the door — even if the environmental, social and governance halo that came with both of those departures didn’t last.The outgoing CEO has also left plenty of problems for his replacement, well beyond the public relations disaster in Western Australia. A unit he set up to invest in green-economy materials has yet to make its mark. Mongolia, where Jacques’s role in settling a previous dispute was key to his elevation, remains a technical, financial and political  headache. The future of the giant Simandou iron ore mine in Guinea is also unclear. Least defensible of all, he stopped short of putting the miner on a decisively carbon-light track, failing to set targets for lower emissions beyond the company’s own operations.To make matters worse, his premature departure could hardly have been messier. As a result, a tainted CEO remains in place temporarily, while the chairman and board who will pick his replacement are badly sullied, too. They underestimated the problem and initially backed the forceful Jacques. They also failed to adequately prepare for his succession.Yet while the Anglo-Australian miner has suffered a reputational hit, its core operation is still producing impressive margins. It’s an enviable position that gives the company room to do more than bask in the iron ore price, even if investors are wary of radical moves — its shares rose after Jacques’s departure, on relief that big investments are off the table for now.One option to signal  willingness to change is to pick an outsider, preferably one with operational expertise to appease investors, but also enough familiarity with Rio to grapple with the culture and its problems.  That could be rail freight operator Aurizon Holdings Ltd.’s Andrew Harding, a former Rio iron ore boss passed over for the top job in 2016, if his Pilbara record holds up after Juukan Gorge. Otherwise, gold miner Newmont Corp.’s Tom Palmer, who previously worked in iron ore, or Newcrest Mining Ltd.’s Sandeep Biswas. Better yet, Rio could pick a female leader. Worthy candidates include Zoe Yujnovich, a one-time boss of Rio’s Canadian iron ore venture, before she left for Royal Dutch Shell Plc in 2014.Outsiders can be slow to bring on board, though, and Rio cannot afford to wait six or 12 months. Insiders, then, come into view.The new chief will have to rebuild bridges. Besides Western Australia, this matters in Mongolia, where Rio is in arbitration over tax payments. In Guinea, there is an election on the horizon. That may point to Mongolian-born Bold Baatar, who has been involved with the Oyu Tolgoi operation and is now in charge of Simandou, as part of energy and minerals. Former bankers make deal-wary shareholders uneasy, though. That suggests instead aluminum boss Alf Barrios, who has led a turnaround and proved he can tune in to clients’ green demands. China, a key consumer of Rio’s iron ore and other metals, has just promised to be carbon neutral by 2060, a warning worth heeding. Change isn’t easy, as BP Plc has shown. Adapting to the zero-emissions reality will be less dramatic for Rio, but no less necessary.One person can’t fix all these things, of course. A final step will be to refresh Rio’s underwhelming board, particularly with ESG and community relations experience, given mining in the Pilbara won’t be the same in the next decade and beyond.  There’s room here for that extra Australian voice that Canberra is demanding, perhaps in the chairman’s spot. Jacques’s abrupt departure has offered the world’s second-largest miner a chance to course-correct. Rio would be foolish not to take it. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-09-17	2020-09-17 04:01:00	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Newmont CEO Sees Gold ‘Elevated,’ While Keeping Plans Grounded	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest gold producer sees the price of the precious metal remaining “elevated” as governments continue pandemic stimulus spending, but don’t expect that to change Newmont Corp.’s focus on fiscal “discipline” any time soon.Gold skyrocketed to record heights above $2,000 an ounce in August, helping lift miners’ cash flow, stock prices and likely the hopes of shareholders expecting higher returns. Spot gold has since dipped a bit, but the haven metal is still trading in record territory above $1,900.“There are a lot of signals that point to gold staying at these elevated levels -- with I think a lot of volatility around it -- for some time to come,” Newmont Chief Executive Officer Tom Palmer said by phone.Despite the high prices and cash flow those generate for miners, Palmer plans to stay focused on such things as improving margins, investing in existing projects that make money at lower prices, and ensuring that balance sheets are well maintained.“At Newmont, when we talk about discipline, it’s about continuing to run our business profitably at the bottom of the price cycle, at $1,200,” Palmer said. Investors want the gold industry to remain disciplined and “actually achieve the margins that we’re seeing at the moment.”Palmer said he believes issues around capital allocation along with environmental, social and governance will be the two hot topics of discussion at the Denver Gold Group’s annual Americas conference, which begins Sunday.At the same time, he said the Greenwood Village, Colorado-based company is discussing further shareholder returns.“We lifted our dividend by 79% earlier this year, and we have the leading dividend in the industry at $1 a share” on an annual basis, Palmer said.“As we now look at the strength of our balance sheet, the discipline we have in running our business and our sustainable portfolio,” he said, “we are actively debating and assessing opportunities for further shareholder returns.”There has been speculation that Palmer, 53, might be a candidate to run Rio Tinto Group after CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques was forced out last week over the destruction of ancient Aboriginal heritage sites. Palmer spent almost two decades at Rio, including a stint as chief operating officer of the company’s iron ore business.Is Palmer interested in the job?“I’m already very privileged to be leading one of the world’s great mining companies,” he said. “I have an exceptional team and look very much forward to working with that team to deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders, and that’s my focus.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newmont-ceo-sees-gold-elevated-183308180.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-21	2020-08-21 12:27:02	NEM	Newmont Corporation	9 Top Stocks to Buy for a Weakened Dollar	At first glance, investors have reason for optimism regarding the nightmare that is the novel coronavirus. First, new daily infections appear to be declining significantly. Just as importantly, major economic data -- such as the national unemployment rate -- have surprisingly ticked lower. This may lull us into complacency when it comes to selecting top stocks to buy.However, investors should remain vigilant for paradigm-shifting developments. While I don't think these forward events are necessarily all doom and gloom, they will probably be enough to warrant serious strategy changes. Whatever were the top stocks to buy prior to this pandemic may not play out so profitably in the new normal.Specifically, the Federal Reserve has little choice but to adopt a dovish monetary policy. Yes, unemployment is down. But the number of permanent job losses remains uncomfortably elevated. If we don't get relief soon, many small businesses could wind up closing their doors forever.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis isn't an empty threat. Earlier in this pandemic, economic experts estimated that more than 100,000 small businesses had already permanently closed. With Congress deciding it's more important to go on vacation than to help the American people, we could see substantial turmoil ahead. Therefore, the Fed will adopt an accommodative stance, which may benefit these top stocks to buy:  * Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM)  * Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW)  * Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM)  * Ford (NYSE:F)  * Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT)  * 3M (NYSE:MMM)  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  * Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX)  * Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)Finally, we're not quite out of the woods with the coronavirus. Yes, cases are down, but medical experts warn that mass-scale testing has also declined. Sadly, this begs for an even greater wave to hit us in the winter, resulting in deeper economic pain. At least with these hot stocks to gain off dollar weakness, you won't be caught off guard. Top Stocks: Newmont Corporation (NEM)Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock If the greenback goes on a weakening spree, there's one asset that shines above the rest. Of course, I'm talking about gold. As a safe haven, gold provides confidence as the universal store of value. However, physical precious metals can be cumbersome, to say the least. Therefore, investors may want to consider blue-chip mining companies like Newmont Corporation.According to its website, Newmont &quot;has the largest gold reserve base in the industry.&quot; With gold prices moving higher based off economic uncertainty and social unrest, NEM stock is in an enviable position. In addition, Newmont generated nearly $2.4 billion in the quarter ended June 30, up almost 5% against the year-ago quarter.I expect shares to represent one of the top stocks to buy for the rest of this year and over the next several years. No matter who is put in charge come November, the next presidential administration will have a doggedly difficult journey. Under these conditions, physical gold is your best bet in my opinion. Next to that are shares of NEM stock. Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW)Source: Shutterstock While gold is an obvious play if the U.S. dollar weakens, you shouldn't ignore other precious metals - they're called precious for a reason. For this simple fact, investors should consider adding Sibanye Stillwater to their list of top stocks to buy.Sibanye offers a trifecta of bullishness for metals bugs, as the company is the &quot;world's largest primary producer of platinum, the second largest primary producer of palladium and the third largest producer of gold (on a gold-equivalent basis)…&quot; Of these, I'm particularly interested in palladium and platinum.For one thing, palladium is incredibly rare. Useful as an automotive catalyst, we may see a shift from industrial to monetary demand. With a price tag of over $2,200 at time of writing, palladium is still the most expensive precious metal among the four major ones. However, with Russia owning most of the palladium supply, SBSW stock is well positioned thanks to Sibanye's more favorable location in South Africa.Second, platinum is no slouch either in the rarity department. But the metal also has significant demand from industrial and medical industries. These sectors will be relevant no matter what the state of the global economy, potentially insulating SBSW stock. Top Stocks: Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com While precious metals clearly have significant upside in a weakened dollar environment, don't ignore other vital commodities. Over the last several years, lithium has gained significant attention due to its use as a power source for advanced electrical technologies. And among the top stocks in this sector is Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile.Currently, SQM stock enjoys two longer-term tailwinds. First, the present economic malaise almost guarantees a dovish, accommodative policy. That translates to an inflationary setup for the U.S. dollar, which is positive for commodities. Second, the electric vehicle revolution means lithium will only rise in demand. Indeed, with so many EV competitors out there, it's difficult to know which one will be the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).With SQM stock, you don't have to play any guessing games. They all need lithium.Further, Sociedad enjoys advantages over other lithium miners because of its geopolitically favorable geography. For the most part, we're on good terms with Chile. Therefore, you should keep SQM on your list of top stocks to buy now and for the foreseeable future. Ford (F)Source: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com For decades Ford has suffered a perception problem. Though the iconic automaker has made a push recently to improve reliability and quality, it's hard to magically erase a culture of mediocrity. Don't get me wrong -- I know people who swear by Ford's modern cars. But the ghosts of the past have haunted the company and by extension, F stock.But with Ford's pivot to electric vehicles, specifically its Mustang Mach-E SUV, I believe the company has the chance to make things right. So much so that I went ahead and bought some F stock on the cheap. Although I don't like American cars at all, I recognize the potential upside.First, with EVs, they are inherently more reliable than combustion-engine cars because of fewer moving parts. So, throw the reliability stigma out the window. Second, Tesla overwhelmingly dominates the EV market. But people eventually want variety -- we couldn't imagine a world where only one manufacturer produces combustion cars.To this end, I think the Mach-E is very attractive. And I wouldn't worry about criticisms that Ford is doing away with its classic two-door pony cars. Nobody buys those things anymore.Finally, a weakened dollar makes our exports more attractive to foreign buyers. This generation's Ford should finally capture the magic abroad. Top Stocks: Caterpillar (CAT)Source: aapsky / Shutterstock.com Amid the drama of this pandemic, it's easy to forget about &quot;boring&quot; names like Caterpillar. While it may not generate headlines during this period, CAT stock has been a high-flier since its March doldrums. Should the dollar weaken considerably from here on out, I expect Caterpillar to maintain its position as one of the top stocks to buy.Historically, Caterpillar has performed relatively well when the Federal Reserve has implemented dovish monetary policies. When the greenback is weaker against other major currencies, American exports are comparatively cheaper. And for CAT stock, this is brilliant news as the underlying company generates more than half its sales from international markets.Should President Donald Trump win reelection, this would be an even bigger signal to trust Caterpillar. In the historic 2016 presidential campaign, Trump routinely talked up the industrial equipment manufacturer. Either way, whoever wins the White House must start rebuilding the economy, which should be a positive for CAT. 3M (MMM)Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com In previous years when we had a strong dollar, this negatively affected applied science and industrial firms like 3M. Logically, if the situation reverses, we should see some positive trading action for MMM stock. Of course, nothing is ever that cut and dry in the markets. However, it does provide one reason among several to consider 3M.First, the rather ho-hum company suddenly surged to relevance because of the pandemic. When the virus first struck us, people panicked and hoarded N95 face masks. Perhaps this alone isn't a good enough reason to buy MMM stock considering its other vulnerabilities. However, this crisis is unlike any other we've suffered in modern American history in that everyone has been impacted in some way.This is not a lesson we'll soon forget. Therefore, people may buy 3M-branded protective equipment, just in case.Further, 3M products are popular overseas so this action could be repeated across several countries. And with a weaker dollar, that should add up to some hefty sales, making 3M one of the underappreciated top stocks to buy. Top Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT)Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com Logically, a weakened dollar translates to a favorable environment for American exporters. And one of the top stocks to buy in this space for reliability and consistency is Microsoft. Admittedly, it doesn't quite have the cachet of other elite consumer electronic firms. However, that could be changing because of the pandemic.As I've argued before, Microsoft products are very practical. And that comes into play significantly in the workplace. With so many people forced to shift their operations remotely, Microsoft's dominance in business applications should help lift MSFT stock. In addition, the company has a substantial presence globally. Therefore, with the greenback falling against other currencies, we could see a favorable impact.Finally, I like MSFT stock for its strong position in video games. As you probably know, the company is scheduled to release its latest Xbox console for the holiday season this year. Though competition is very stiff in this arena, Microsoft more than holds its own. Combined with its myriad other businesses, such as cloud computing and hardware, you'll want to keep close tabs on MSFT. Becton Dickinson (BDX)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com A longstanding American medical equipment company, Becton Dickinson offers pertinent exposure to the broader healthcare market. Unfortunately, the novel coronavirus took some of the shine off BDX stock, with investors piling into biotechnology firms as a speculative bet on a vaccine. Still, once some of that corona-fever fades out, Becton Dickinson should swing higher.For starters, the company has enjoyed significant growth in the past three years over its core businesses of medication delivery solutions, medication management, pharmaceutical systems and diabetes care.Second, Becton Dickinson generates approximately 43% of its revenue from international markets. In prior years when the U.S. dollar was rising against other currencies, the company incurred negative exchange rate impacts. As well, BDX stock has been flat in at least some of those years featuring currency headwinds.Intriguingly, though, BDX shares jumped substantially higher in 2017 when the U.S. dollar index plummeted. If the greenback continues its bearish trend -- and especially if Trump wins reelection -- BDX could be one of the surprising top stocks in the healthcare space. Top Stocks: Intel (INTC)Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.com Want to go a little crazy? If underlying economic conditions continue to drive the greenback down, you should consider throwing some speculative money at Intel. Of course, INTC stock has suffered all kinds of volatility following Intel's disclosure of delays to its next-generation chips until 2022. That was a huge disaster, which subsequently saw Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jump to record highs.Given the catastrophe to its longtime rival, this is a massive opportunity for AMD. However, one also has to wonder about its equity performance potential from here on out. For those seeking an undervalued opportunity, INTC stock seems a not unreasonable bet.For instance, while the fallout has been ugly for Intel, INTC shares have bounced off a support level that's been in place since late 2017. If the situation was truly untenable for Intel, you'd expect a much steeper selloff.Also, the company has a renowned brand and significant market share across relevant tech sectors. It may take more than a production delay -- no matter how significant -- to take down this beast.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies. Over the past several years, he has delivered unique, critical insights for the investment markets, as well as various other industries including legal, construction management, and healthcare. As of this writing, he is long gold and F stock.

Newmont Goldcorp's sales decreased to $2.37 billion, a 8.37% change since Q1. In Q1, Newmont Goldcorp earned $457.00 million, and total sales reached $2.58 billion.Why ROCE Is Significant Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Newmont Goldcorp's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. In Q2, Newmont Goldcorp posted an ROCE of 0.02%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on NEMReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.In Newmont Goldcorp's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions.Q2 Earnings Insight Newmont Goldcorp reported Q2 earnings per share at $0.32/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $0.33/share.See more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Newmont: Q2 Earnings Insights  * Earnings Scheduled For July 30, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Canadian-based gold stocks account for roughly 44% of the ETF, while the U.S (18%) and Australia (14%) check in at numbers two and three.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI like the diversity from a risk standpoint. A portfolio of different stocks across multiple countries will have lower volatility than buying an individual name. Fundamental Focus on Gold StocksEric Fry of Fry's Investment Report wrote an in-depth analysis of the gold market in a recent research report. The main focus was on the unrelenting money printing being enacted both in the U.S. and worldwide.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short List Mr. Fry notes that the U.S dollar is at two-year lows and U.S debt to GDP stands at a rather astounding 123%. Given this backdrop it is difficult not to be bullish on the yellow metal. Plus the money printing and monetary easing continues unabated. The fundamentals certainly support higher gold prices and higher gold stocks. Technical TakeSource: Source: The Thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Gold stocks have gone from overbought to oversold in a matter of days. GDX stock reached the lowest readings on MACD since the novel coronavirus crisis lows before firming. Momentum has also gotten to extremes of pessimism but has turned higher. Bollinger Band Percent B traded at a negative number but has since moved back into positive territory. The last two times the indicators were this oversold marked major intermediate-term lows.GDX stock is still trading above the 50-day moving average at $37.99. There is major downside support at the $39 area which held twice. The price action yesterday was encouraging as both gold and gold stocks regained some traction. A move back to fill in the gap at $42.50 now seems likely. Comparative ContrastSource: Source: StockCharts.com Normally GDX stock and gold tend to be highly correlated which makes intuitive sense. Since reaching the highs in early August, however, that correlation has broken down considerably. Gold stocks are now under-performing physical gold by nearly 4% over the past 20 days. Look for that relationship to begin to converge with gold stocks outperforming gold over the coming weeks.I noted earlier I like the lower risk aspect of using an ETF versus an individual stock. I also like lowering my risk by using option spreads instead of buying GDX stock at current levels. A preferred way to position to be a buyer on further weakness is by selling an out-of-the money bull put spread.Sell GDX December $33/$30 put spread for 65 cents net credit.Maximum gain on the trade is $65 per spread with maximum risk of $235 per spread. Return on risk is 27.66% 0r 101% annualized. The short $33 strike price provides a 18.77% downside cushion to the $40.63 closing price of GDX stock.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-07-29	2020-07-29 01:50:37	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Gold Miners Get a Shot at Redemption	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Gold’s record run to almost $2,000 an ounce has burnished cash flows and driven a surge in shares of bullion producers. The rally provides a renewed test of discipline for Barrick Gold Corp. and peers after a similar climb a decade ago prompted a spate of inflated deals and overly optimistic investments that wasted billions.The 2020 redux isn’t being fueled by traditional demand: The China Gold Association says consumption in the world’s biggest buyer plunged by more than a third in the first half. Instead, it’s a combination of low bond yields, pandemic worries and institutional investor appetite. Silver has also rallied, breaking through $24 an ounce this week to its highest since 2013. Precious metals aren’t always predictable, but Covid’s stubborn resistance means the general picture is unlikely to change soon.For gold-mining companies, this is becoming a test of memories. With costs contained even after pandemic-related closures, virtually all are churning out impressive cash: In the first three months, Toronto-based Barrick alone generated $438 million in free cash flow based on a realized price of not far off $1,600, compared to $146 million a year earlier. Valuations look better too, especially for the sector’s largest players.That’s a temptation to expand for those like Barrick Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow who are facing constrained production growth and a metal price that’s likely to be supported for some time yet. Recall, though, just how bad things got around 10 years ago, when prices last glittered this brightly. In 2017, chastising the industry, the hedge fund of longtime gold bull John Paulson put the gold mining sector’s cumulative impairments since 2010 at $85 billion. According to the same presentation, 80% of the value of the top eight deals was impaired. Enough to give today’s executive pause.The starting gun for this wave of gold deals has already been fired. That began with some operational logic and a dash of hubris, when Barrick announced plans to tie up with Africa-focused Randgold Resources Ltd. in 2018, only to bid unsuccessfully for Newmont Mining Corp. months later, when the target was buying Goldcorp Inc. More significant for what comes next, however, is that premiums were non-existent or modest; Barrick and Newmont never did combine, and ended up agreeing a more sensible joint venture in Nevada.For an industry trying to woo back generalist investors and regain credibility, Chris LaFemina of Jefferies points out, the model is still pre-merger Randgold: a high dividend, net cash, no value-destroying share issues. Shiny prices haven’t changed that yet.This year it is China’s bullion miners that have driven much of the action, in search of market clout and increased relevance. Shandong Gold Mining Co. agreed to buy Canada’s TMAC Resources Inc. in May, a deal now facing some local opposition, and has also battled Russia’s Nord Gold SE for West Africa-focused Cardinal Resources Ltd. No less acquisitive, Zijin Mining Group Co. agreed last month to buy Canada-headquartered Guyana Goldfields Inc. for $240 million. Expect that to continue.Paying out the 2020 windfall in dividends may be no bad thing, given how fast gold can turn. Investors will cheer. Still, if prices stay high, diggers can capitalize on the current excitement by encouraging a little more risk to tackle the problem of stagnant production. It’s true that there were as many terrible greenfield projects in the past boom as there were bad M&A deals, but there is an extra incentive to bet on the yellow metal: Extra supply doesn’t tend to erode the gold price.Miners will need to invest $37 billion by 2025 to keep output at 2019 levels, Wood Mackenzie Ltd. estimates. Not all of those projects will be in top destinations, or easy to extract. Gold at $2,000 might just make a return to mining’s buccaneering roots attractive enough. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-07-28	2020-07-28 18:15:22	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Unusually Large Newmont Option Trades Suggest Gold Prices Could Be Headed Even Higher	Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM) shares are up 83.2% in the past year, but at least one larger option trader is betting on more upside from the gold mining giant as gold prices hit new highs.The Newmont Trades: On Tuesday morning, Benzinga Pro subscribers received three option alerts related to unusually large Newmont trades.  * At 10:18 a.m., a trader bought 710 Newmont call options with a $50 strike price expiring in March 2021 near the ask price at $20.801. The trade represented a more than $1.4 million bullish bet.  * At 10:27 a.m., a trader sold 300 Newmont call options with a $65 strike price expiring on Friday at the bid price of $4.451. The trade represented a $133,530 bearish bet.  * At 11:07 a.m., a trader bought 1,000 Newmont call options with a $70 strike price expiring on Aug. 21 at the ask price of $2.285. The trade represented a $228,500 bullish bet.Why It's Important: Even traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader.Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock.Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there's no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively large size of a couple of Tuesday's Newmont option trades, they could certainly be institutional hedging.More Gold Upside Ahead? Gold prices hit new record highs on Monday due to investor concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China and the potential for long-term inflation associated with massive stimulus spending programs.Gold was trading at around $1,950/oz on Tuesday morning, and Barry Dawes, executive chairman at Martin Place Securities, told CNBC he's expecting gold prices will reach $3,500 within the next two years.Rising gold prices are excellent news for gold mining stocks like Newmont. During the previous financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, the price of gold didn't peak until about two years after the market bottomed.  NEM Chart by TradingView new TradingView.widget( { &quot;width&quot;: 680, &quot;height&quot;: 423, &quot;symbol&quot;: &quot;NYSE:NEM&quot;, &quot;interval&quot;: &quot;D&quot;, &quot;timezone&quot;: &quot;Etc/UTC&quot;, &quot;theme&quot;: &quot;light&quot;, &quot;style&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;locale&quot;: &quot;en&quot;, &quot;toolbar_bg&quot;: &quot;f1f3f6&quot;, &quot;enable_publishing&quot;: false, &quot;allow_symbol_change&quot;: true, &quot;container_id&quot;: &quot;tradingview_ea061&quot; } ); Benzinga's Take: In theory, the higher gold prices go, the wider Newmont's margins will be. The $1.4 million March 2021 calls purchased on Tuesday have a break-even price of $70.80, only about 3.1% upside from Tuesday's levels.Related Links:Here's How Much Investing ,000 In The GLD Gold Fund In 2010 Would Be Worth TodayHow To Read And Trade An Option AlertSee more from Benzinga  * The Auto Industry Is Recovering 'Faster Than Expected,' Analyst Says  * Rocket Companies Targets .8B IPO As Roadshow Kicks Off  * Here's How Much Investing ,000 In Pfizer Stock Back In 2010 Would Be Worth Today(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-06-24	2020-06-24 06:49:06	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Gold Poised to Challenge $1,800 as Virus Resurgence Fans Demand	(Bloomberg) -- Gold is on the cusp of challenging the hard-to-crack $1,800 an ounce mark, potentially opening the way for a move toward its record price, as a resurgence in coronavirus cases risks impeding the recovery of the global economy and fans demand for haven assets.Futures have rallied to within 1% of the level last seen at the end of 2011, the year bullion notched its all-time high, as newly diagnosed cases of Covid-19 and other indicators of the pandemic’s spread soared in hot spots across the U.S. This is driving city and state officials to consider slowing or reversing reopening plans. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious-disease doctor, warned on Tuesday that he’s seeing a “disturbing surge” in cases.Bullion has jumped this year as the Federal Reserve and other central banks lowered interest rates, while governments worldwide pumped in trillions in stimulus to rescue economies hurt by the pandemic. Aided by concerns of currency debasement and a potential jump in inflation, investors are turning to gold as a store of wealth. With real U.S. interest rates negative, banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. now forecast it’ll hit a record $2,000 in 12 months.“The rise in Covid-19 cases has been at the heart of the recent uptick in gold futures,” said Vivek Dhar, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, who’s tracking real yields. “A sustained decline in U.S. 10-year real yields will provide support for gold futures. That is because as yields fall, gold looks more attractive relative to interest-bearing securities.”Gold for August delivery rose as much as 0.6% to $1,791.80 an ounce on the Comex, the highest level since 2012, and traded at $1,785.20 at 7:28 a.m. in London. Futures peaked at $1,923.70 in September 2011.Investors continue to be drawn to the traditional haven. Holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded funds have soared to a record, increasing almost 600 tons this year.Miners are also benefiting from the rally. Shares of Newmont Corp., the world’s largest gold company, are up 36% this year, while Australian producer Evolution Mining Ltd. has surged 48%.Among other main precious metals, spot silver fell 0.4%, platinum declined 0.2% and palladium dropped 0.4%.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-poised-challenge-1-800-003404294.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-06-24	2020-06-24 05:47:27	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Gold nears eight-year high as investors seek havens	Gold climbed towards its highest level in almost eight years on Wednesday as investors looked for a safe place to park their cash at a time of rock-bottom bond yields and expectations for a rise in inflation.  Analysts said the rally reinforced the impression that investors are suffering more bouts of nerves over the outlook for global trade and coronavirus, with caution also evident in stock markets. Concern that government bond yields will struggle to keep pace with inflation in the coming months has also boosted demand for the precious metal, which has gained about 16 per cent in price this year.  “Gold has been moving in lockstep with real [inflation adjusted] bond yields for quite some time even though we would caution to call this causation,” said Carsten Menke, an analyst at Julius Baer.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ffca4321-c586-3ce2-a86e-47c057f84287/gold-nears-eight-year-high-as.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-22	2020-05-22 14:33:31	NEM	Newmont Corporation	3 Top Trades As We Head Into the Last Week of May	Each week I try to identify a key theme that defined the movement in stock prices over the past 5 days. But unlike many investors, my searching isn't based on news, it's based on price.The charts tell the tale, if investors are keen to listen. This week's exercise revealed clear rotation going on beneath the market's surface, and directed me to these top trades for your consideration.The first part of the shift was money flowing out of leaders and into laggards. Large-caps have long been leading the market recovery, while small-caps have lagged.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut not this week! The switcheroo saw little guys pick up the torch and lead their bigger brethren to victory. As of Thursday's close, the S&P 500 was only up 3% but the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM), which represents small-caps, was up 7.3%.The second shift is partially related to the first. Stocks benefiting from the novel coronavirus saw profit-taking while economically sensitive equities (like small-caps) surged. That's a welcome development that points to risk appetite continuing its return.  * 7 Excellent Penny Stocks Ready to Roar Here's the silver lining. If you've been waiting for a dip before buying companies outperforming during the Covid-19 crisis, then here's your chance. These three stocks have attractive setups that make them top trades for the week:  * Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  * Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS)  * Newmont Mining(NYSE:NEM)Let's take a closer look at their respective pullbacks and build trades to profit. 3 Top Trades for the Week Ahead: Netflix (NFLX)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Netflix is the type of no-brainer stock that should leave investors who didn't buy during the March crash kicking themselves. NFLX was bound to do well during a time when content-hungry consumers were ordered to stay home.Netflix was one of the first stocks to recover and has since gone on to record highs. This week's rotation saw profit-taking strike the streaming king even as the rest of the market rallied.The pullback tested the rising 20-day moving average and held on Thursday. But even if the stock dips further, I think you have to view the weakness as a golden opportunity to get in on one of the top trades in the market at lower prices. Since it's always wise to have a plan in case you're wrong, I suggest watching $400 or the 50-day moving average as your line in the sand. If we push below that, then I'd change my bullish tune.Its higher price tag makes NFLX stock a great candidate for bull put spreads. We can create a wide profit zone in case the retreat continues before buyers emerge.The Trade: Sell the June $395/$300 bull put spread for around 90 cents. Citrix Systems (CTXS)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Citrix Systems has been among those tech stocks seriously benefiting from the work from home trend. Its share price was up 40% year-to-date before the recent drop.This week's selling did inflict damage to the overall trend by jamming shares below the 50-day moving average. It's the deepest retreat we've seen in CTXS since March, so I suspect some would-be buyers are hesitant.The reason I don't mind putting money to work here is twofold. First, we can wait for the stock to return above the 50-day before pulling the trigger. That will invalidate the breakdown and return CTXS stock to a healthy status.Second, the underlying themes driving CTXS haven't changed this week. And that makes me believe this is a simple correction, rather than the beginning of a trend-ending sell-off. We can deploy a strategy that gives the stock some room to flounder and still profit.  * 7 Excellent Penny Stocks Ready to Roar The Trade: Sell the June $125/$120 bull put spread for 70 cents. CTXS options aren't that liquid, so you must use limit orders. Newmont Mining (NEM)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Gold and gold stocks have been on fire this year. Economic upheaval and the printing of trillions of dollars is breathing new life into the bullish thesis for owning precious metal related products. And the Vaneck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) has more than doubled from March lows.As one of the largest players in the space, Newmont Mining has been riding the rising tide. It even came within a whisper of all-time highs, which is incredible given that the sector fund (GDX) is still 50% off its peak.NEM stock's leadership makes it a top trade pick if you're looking for exposure to the yellow metal. Buying an outperforming stock in an outperforming sector means you're betting on the strongest possible candidate.This week's rotation saw profit-taking strike and is creating a classic buy-the-dip opportunity. Every pullback this year has been a great chance to buy, and I see no reason why we should view this one differently. If you want to increase your odds of success, I like selling naked puts. You're essentially getting paid for your willingness to acquire the stock.The Trade: Sell the June $60 put for around $1.45.For a free trial to the best trading community on the planet and Tyler's current home, click here!

2020-05-22	2020-05-22 13:35:22	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Newmont Mining Should Ride Higher With Gold Prices	"Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) has been on fire, and why shouldn't it? While gold prices have been quiet lately, they won't stay that way forever. The backdrop for the yellow metal is bullish. Therefore, the backdrop for NEM stock is bullish, too.Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock But let's not pretend that the company hasn't already seen a big boost. Once the dust settled in March, gold prices rebounded with a vengeance. NEM did as well, as did Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD), another company we are bullish on.Although Newmont stock has dipped slightly from the new highs it made earlier this year, shares are still up 100% from the March lows. For 2020, Newmont is up 46%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Gold as a HedgeWhen the novel coronavirus sucker punched the global economy, central banks had to act quickly. They needed a coordinated effort to stave off a global depression and buy us some time until we had more resources. Governments, economies, hospitals and people needed more time, ventilators and information, among other things.  * 7 Excellent Penny Stocks Ready to Roar This forced the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and the rest to fire up the printing presses. They slashed interest rates, made cash appear overnight, stepped into credit markets and kickstarted what Paul Tudor Jones called the ""Great Monetary Inflation.""Known on the Street as PTJ, the legendary trader expanded on the topic, saying this is ""an unprecedented expansion of every form of money unlike anything the developed world has ever seen.""As a result, he scoped out gold, Treasuries, and even bitcoin. I personally prefer crypto assets to the yellow metal, but it doesn't hurt to have some exposure to the latter in one's portfolio. Tudor Jones even said bitcoin reminds him of gold in the 1970s.One of his reasons for betting on bitcoin is that it's the ""fastest horse"" in the group -- and we know that to be true with its volatility. But the point is still the same: global central banks will drive up the prices of others assets, gold included. NEM Stock as a BuyNewmont Mining reported earnings earlier this month. Despite coming into the print at its year-to-date high, NEM stock barely flinched despite missing on earnings and revenue expectations.However, the misses were minimal and growth expectations remain strong. Earnings of 40 cents per share missed by 2 cents, while revenue of $2.58 billion exploded higher by 43.3%, although missed estimates by $80 million.For the year, analysts expect Newmont to earn $2.29 per share. In that scenario, that's up more than 73% year-over-year. Those estimates are also up over the last seven, 30 and 90 days, where they stood at $2.25 per share, $2.11 per share, and $1.92 per share, respectively.  Click to EnlargeA company with growing earnings expectations in 2020? That puts NEM stock in a category with few participants. In 2021, consensus estimates call for another year of robust earnings growth, at 37%. Revenue growth estimates in those two years stand at 13.4% and 7%, respectively.However, there is a hiccup in there. Management expects Q2 (the upcoming quarter) to be its highest cost and lowest production quarter. So there could be a dip over the next few months. If that's the case, investors may be wise to nibble some NEM stock.That's after management maintained its long-term outlook. They also said expenses should improve through 2024, alongside stable production. Risks and AlternativesThere are many reasons to be bullish on gold, and thus bullish on gold stocks. However, that doesn't mean it comes without risk.Gold prices and gold stocks were hit in March, when an unprecedented decline and increase in volatility hit equity markets. This put pressure on precious metals, cryptocurrencies and fixed income, too. Investors were forced to sell assets -- high quality or low -- in order to meet their obligations.So NEM stock, GOLD stock, and gold prices are not immune to this price action should it arise again.Additionally, gold may not trade in the manner that investors expect. While gold seems like a no-brainer here -- with investors needing just one difficult trait called patience -- it's possible that it doesn't behave the way we expect.For those that can't decide between which gold stocks to buy, they can also consider owning the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX). The top holding in this case is NEM stock, followed by Barrick Gold. Between the two, they make up roughly 30% on the fund.At the end of the day, though, NEM stock should continue higher. It's got great growth prospects.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-05-22	2020-05-22 13:09:04	NEM	Newmont Corporation	The Bull Run in the Gold Miners ETF Is Just Getting Started	"The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:GLD) is on a hot streak so far this year. The related gold mining stocks and funds such as the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) are enjoying even greater gains. The GLD ETF is up 13.5% year-to-date, and 35% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the GDX gold mining ETF has posted huge returns. It's up 22% year-to-date, and 75% since last May.Source: Shutterstock Naturally, some traders are thinking about taking profits here. It's been a big move, after all. But don't miss the forest for the trees. Gold traders are used to the bear market that had been running in precious metals since 2012. Thus, their inclination has been to sell every advance.But the trend has changed. Gold is in a new expansion phase, and investors should be strapped in for the ride. In fact, precious metals were already in an uptrend even prior to 2020. And now, the novel coronavirus has greatly accelerated that dynamic.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips GDX and Gold Mining Stocks: It's 2008 All Over AgainEven as the financial crisis was already well under way, in 2008, the price of gold soared to an all-time high of $1,000 an ounce. To many investors, that record-high price probably seemed like an ideal opportunity to sell. When other things are plunging, the first instinct might be to sell the asset that has appreciated. But even at $1,000 an ounce, it was as actually a great time to buy. Gold's price nearly doubled over the following three years and rose to $1,900 an ounce in 2011.  * 7 Excellent Penny Stocks Ready to Roar Today's gold market feels eerily similar to the 2008 version. The price of gold just hit a seven-year high of $1,747 an ounce and is setting up for what I believe will be a rapid double over the next couple of years.This rally is causing a huge ripple effect in gold mining stocks like GDX. In fact, almost all of my gold stock recommendations have doubled already. But I think they're just getting warmed up. The current economic crisis has created a perfect situation for the gold mining industry. Even in Recession, Gold Miners Can Grow EarningsOne key point to consider is that almost every stock market sector will being delivering negative earnings growth over the next several quarters. One sector that will not be following this downtrend is the gold mining sector. It will be producing strong year-over-year growth - perhaps even the strongest growth of any major sector.To give one example of how this is already playing out, look at mining giant Newmont Mining's (NYSE:NEM) earnings report from earlier this month. Newmont reported that revenues soared 43%, EBITDA surged 63%, and adjusted net income nearly doubled.Gold miners enjoy tremendous margin expansion as the price of gold soars. Newmont proved that out with income surging far more than revenues, and we're seeing similar trends out of other miners this earnings season.The low price of oil offers another huge tailwind for the mining firms. Investors complained that mining stocks didn't capitalize as much on the 2003-2011 gold price boom as they would have expected. However, earnings growth was capped because there was huge commodity price inflation at the same time. Remember that oil shot up to as much as $147 a barrel during that period. Other things you need to build mines, like steel, also surged in price. Thus, while miners could sell gold for far higher prices, they lost much of those gains to inflation.This time around, other commodities are dirt cheap. For example, diesel fuel for mining trucks is near 20-year lows. Steel prices have dropped. There's no labor inflation either; after nearly a decade of low gold and silver prices, there is no shortage of capable geologists willing to work for reasonable wages. Gold Mining Stocks VerdictLong story short, this could be the start a golden age for precious metals miners and GDX. In many ways, this resembles 2008. The ingredients are there to set off a major run in the price of gold. Don't look at $1,700 an ounce as expensive -- it could be just the beginning of a major multiyear move to far higher price levels.Meanwhile, gold miners are ideally positioned heading into this surge. Few have hedged their production heavily, leaving more upside as prices surge. Cost inflation is minimal. And the aggressive monetary stimulus being used to fight the coronavirus recession should provide a sustained flight-to-safety trade along with a demand for inflation hedges.As we get past the virus and start to consider the long-term economic impacts, there will be more concern about inflation. The amount of central bank stimulus put into the economy is unprecedented, and it will boost asset prices. Gold mining stocks should be one of the biggest beneficiaries in coming months and years.P.S. Where Did All the Gold Go? Billionaires like ""Bond King"" Jeffrey Gundlach… Ray Dalio… Stanley Druckenmiller… and Paul Tudor Jones are bullish on the yellow metal…78-year-old billionaire investor Sam Zell just bought gold for the first time in his life!

That goes double for investors, as they try to figure out what stocks and assets are worth owning at this stage of the game. With gold always a fixture, are gold stocks worth owning at this point?Source: Shutterstock That answer really depends on the situation.Overall, I am bullish on gold, but there are doubts. With so many other investors watching the yellow metal and seemingly bullish on it as well, it's a bit concerning. Anytime there is too much focus on one asset or stock is exactly when it seems to disappoint the majority.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips It All Starts With GoldBefore we talk about gold stocks, we have to talk about gold. Because you can't be bullish or bearish on the group without having an opinion on the metal first. It's like judging energy producers without having studying oil. The commodity drives the miners' business, so we better have a thesis on the yellow metal.  * 20 Stocks to Buy If You're Still Betting on America to Thrive Under the current circumstances, how can we not like gold? First, gold is viewed as a safe haven, along with bonds. But with bonds paying so little in the way of interest -- 10-year Treasury bonds yield just 0.65% -- gold may start to get more attention.Rather than simply speculate on safe-haven plays, there's another reason to like gold. The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and global central banks around the world are resorting to stimulus to offset economic setbacks from the coronavirus.When central banks print money, it devalues the currencies' worth. Thus, it makes assets like gold more valuable. It won't happen overnight, but as the Fed and others look to stimulate, it seems like gold will have to be an eventual beneficiary. One of Wall Street's most famed traders agrees too -- well, sort of.Paul Tudor Jones recently warmed up to bitcoin, saying the currency reminds him of gold a few decades ago. He said:It has happened globally with such speed that even a market veteran like myself was left speechless…We are witnessing the Great Monetary Inflation -- an unprecedented expansion of every form of money unlike anything the developed world has ever seen.He considered gold, Treasuries, and certain stocks. In the end he settled on bitcoin, which he referred to as the ""fastest horse"" in the group. How to Play Gold Stocks  Click to EnlargeInvestors have essentially three takeaways with gold.First, they can be bullish on the yellow metal, believing it will act as a safe haven in our current environment and as a store of value as central banks pump out cash. Second, they can bearish, believing that those are not worthy catalysts or that too many eyes are on the metal.Finally, they can be without opinion, opting to pass on a position in gold in favor of assets they understand better.For those that are bullish, they can consider owning physical gold. They can also consider buying the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD). Beyond that, they might consider owning gold stocks too.I like both Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) and Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM). Both stocks have had explosive moves off the lows. While they seem to be losing some momentum, I think it's simply some consolidation after a powerful move. We're seeing similar consolidation (on a less-powerful move) in actual gold prices.Those who don't like single-stock exposure can consider the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX). Incidentally, Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold are the top two holdings in the ETF, with a 15.5% and 14.8% weighting, respectively.Keep in mind, if volatility really picks up, safe-havens may temporarily be out of favor. Bonds, gold and other assets all felt the pressure when stocks were tanking in March. It was likely that investors had to sell others assets (like these) to meet margin calls and raise liquidity.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-05-08	2020-05-08 15:28:15	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Why You Can Now Trust Newmont and Gold Miners	For years, precious metals mining companies like Newmont (NYSE:NEM) and Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) floundered in relative obscurity. Following the bubble bursting in the commodities sector early last decade, miners found themselves out of favor with the broader market cycle. Simply, with enthusiasm returning to equities following the Great Recession, NEM stock appeared anachronistic to Wall Street.Source: Shutterstock As you know, the novel coronavirus changed everything.Despite extreme volatility in March when the U.S. was gripped in pandemic fever, NEM stock found its footing in April. Moreover, shares are carrying that robust momentum into May, suggesting further upside. Although I'm more of a cryptocurrency fan than a goldbug, you don't want to ignore what the tape is broadcasting.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYou don't need to look far to understand that Newmont, Barrick and other major gold stocks have significant upside potential. In the latest jobless claims report, the Department of Labor revealed that nearly 3.2 million workers filed for initial unemployment benefits. Over the last seven weeks, more than 33 million Americans made jobless claims.By all indications, the current numbers that we're seeing today understate the economic damage that Covid-19 has inflicted. Millions of the recently jobless have likely attempted to seek benefits via their states' antiquated communications channels, only to be rebuffed through backlogs and disconnects.Additionally, as the unemployment line breaks dubious records, the prospects of job losses hitting higher-earning positions have clouded an otherwise optimistic look in the equities market. Most investors don't like uncertainty, which is why NEM stock has jumped higher.  * 10 Key Stocks to Watch Over the Next Few Months In my view, some modest exposure to gold makes sense as no one really knows what lies ahead. NEM Stock Is No FlukeAdmittedly, while the narrative for gold makes sense, the sector does have a negative reputation. During gold's last heyday, a deluge of conspiracy theories suckered in unsuspecting buyers. When the metals didn't quite pan out as the conspiracists claimed, many left the gold market with bitter feelings.In reality, they were simply too early to the game. No matter how fundamentally solid an investment is, market cycles more often than not can make or break it. It's the reason why you don't go sailing during a typhoon, even if you have a world-class boat.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Matt McCall Research Team If you look at a 20-year chart of gold prices, you'll notice that the 2000's decade was characterized by an expansionary phase. Relative to other assets, gold was severely undervalued. Not surprisingly, NEM stock enjoyed a sizable move up as the underlying asset skyrocketed.But as gold prices went parabolic, investors lost their appetite for pushing the yellow metal higher. Naturally, gold came crashing down and entered into a consolidation phase. This is a period of largely sideways trading as the market flushes out the weak hands. And because the 2000's-era gold rush was so dramatic, the following consolidation phase was particularly long.Today, I believe we're transitioning back toward an expansionary phase, which obviously augurs well for NEM stock.Again, fears over the economy are beginning to grip several investors. Further, the gold market is one of the few sectors that make intuitive sense.Recently, the disconnect between the stock market and the labor market have left many folks confused. Part of the reason for this misalignment is that investors have nowhere to park their money in a subterranean interest-rate environment.But fears that the disconnect could unravel has certainly bolstered gold prices. Lack of Trust Is Positive for GoldWhat I would recommend to readers is to not read too much into the granularity. Instead, it's vital to recognize the bigger picture. Fear is at an all-time high and the &quot;absurdity&quot; that they see in the stock market is only fueling that anxiety.Never mind whether the actions of the stock market is absurd or not -- that's not the point. So long as most investors believe this to be the case, this collective understanding is what will drive gold higher. That's why you don't want to ignore NEM stock.The past is the past. We're dealing with a completely new context right now.At the same time, don't go overboard. Use gold as a protective hedge against the present uncertainty. But do keep the powder keg dry for truly transformative investments, such as bitcoin and the cryptocurrency complex.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-04-26	2020-04-26 22:05:44	NEM	Newmont Corporation	7 Best-Performing Stocks Of 2020: Buy, Sell Or Hold?	The S&P 500 has rallied hard off its March lows, but the index remains down 12.9% year-to-date overall. The near-term economic outlook amid the COVID-19 shutdown is still unclear, creating a lot of uncertainty on Wall Street. The International Monetary Fund recently cut its 2020 global economic growth forecast to negative 3%.Fortunately for investors, a number of stocks have bucked the bearish trend and gained ground this year. Some of those stocks will maintain that bullish momentum as the economic downturn drags on, while others will prove to be overbought and regress.Here's what Bank of America analysts have to say about the seven best-performing S&P 500 stocks of 2020 (excluding buyouts).Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: REGN) - Hold Regeneron is a biopharmaceutical company focused on treating eye disorders, hypercholesterolemia, cancer and other conditions. Regeneron shares have been on fire in 2020 for two main reasons. First, the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings in February. Second, Regeneron is reportedly working with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop a treatment for COVID-19. Analyst Geoff Meacham recently said fading Eylea revenue plus an unproven early drug pipeline suggests limited near-term upside after a year-to-date gain of 45%.Bank of America has a Neutral rating and $575 price target for REGN stock.Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM) - Buy Gold is one of the few investments that has performed well in 2020 as investors worry about the long-term impact that the $2.3-trillion stimulus package will have on the dollar. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) is up 12.9% year-to-date, and Newmont is up 42.6%. The company recently withdrew its 2020 guidance after COVID-19 forced shutdowns of mines in Yanacocha, Musselwhite, Eleonore and Cerro Negro. Analyst Michael Jalonen recently said he is bullish on Newmont despite the temporary closures and the stock has some of the strongest fundamentals within the gold space.Bank of America has a Buy rating and $73 price target for NEM stock.Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTXS) - Hold Citrix is a software platform that enables access to enterprise solutions from a variety of connections and locations. Analyst Nikolay Beliov recently said Citrix's cloud transition creates near-term uncertainty in earnings and free cash flow despite an overall solid fourth quarter. Following the stock's 36.7% year-to-date gain, Beliov said there is limited upside for Citrix from current levels. In fact, Citrix ranked dead last among 37 companies in Bank of America's recent screen of fundamentals within the server and enterprise software group.Bank of America has a Neutral rating and $160 price target for CTXS stock.NortonLifeLock Inc (NASDAQ: NLOK) - Sell Norton LifeLock provides online security and risk management software and services, and the stock has rallied 35% so far in 2020. Beliov says the company has aggressive long-term targets and the market is significantly overvaluing the stock. Beliov says it's surprising to see the price action in the stock in 2020 given the company has lost 1.1 million direct subscribers over the past three years. In addition, average revenue per user has dropped substantially and growth has stagnated.Bank of America has an Underperform rating and $14 price target for NLOK stock.Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) - Buy Netflix's negative price action after its blowout first-quarter earnings report was a classic case of sell the news after its stock got a bit ahead of itself with a 30.2% year-to-date gain. Netflix reported 15.77 million global net subscriber additions in the first quarter, well ahead of consensus analyst expectations of 8.2 million. Netflix got a huge subscriber boost due to stay-at-home measures around the world. Following Netflix's biggest subscriber beat in history, analyst Nat Schindler said COVID-19 measures have helped Netflix take a major leap forward in penetration.Bank of America has a Buy rating and $525 price target for NFLX stock.Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) - Sell Southwestern Energy is one of the largest U.S. natural gas producers. WTI crude oil prices recently plummeted into negative territory due to concerns over national storage capacity approaching 100%. The potential for U.S. oil production to grind to a total halt in the near-term means less natural gas is being produced, which is bullish for gas prices. In fact, in the past five trading days alone, the United States Oil Fund LP (NYSE: USO) crashed 43.5%, while the United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (NYSE: UNG) gained 17.6%. Analyst Doug Leggate says he is concerned about the long-term outlook for natural gas prices and he believes Southwestern's valuation has gotten too rich.Bank of America has an Underperform rating and $1.20 price target for SWN stock.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) - Buy Nearly all of Amazon.com's businesses have benefited from the COVID-19 lockdown, including its e-commerce sales, its cloud services business and its streaming video platforms. In fact, Amazon has already announced it is hiring 175,000 new employees in 2020 to help support its business, especially its Whole Foods delivery services. Bank of America analyst Justin Post recently said Amazon's heavy logistics investments in recent years have set the segment up to be a significant contributor to future revenue growth. Post says Amazon's scale, market share and margins are unrivaled in the high-growth e-commerce space. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $2,480 price target for AMZN stock.Related Links:12 Short Squeeze Candidates To Watch 9 Worst-Performing Stocks Of 2020: Buy, Sell Or Hold?A Newmont gold mine in Nevada.

2020-04-17	2020-04-17 06:18:42	NEM	Newmont Corporation	The Global Airline Shutdown Has a Surprise Victim: Gold Miners	(Bloomberg) -- The collapse in commercial air travel amid global coronavirus restrictions has an unexpected casualty -- gold miners looking to transport their metal to refineries.Producers typically rely on regular airline services to ferry mined metal -- called dore -- from remote operations to the specialist plants that separate out the precious metals and craft them into bars or coins.That’s becoming more difficult with a large swathe of global aircraft grounded, including about two-thirds of the passenger jet fleet, according to Cirium, an airline industry data provider.“Where we’ve had to be doing more work is getting dore -- the metal -- to market,” said Tom Palmer, chief executive officer of Newmont Mining Corp., the world’s biggest gold producer. “Typically dore travels on commercial airliners, so it’s been about finding alternative paths to get that dore to refineries around the world.”Read more: Parking Two-Thirds of World’s Planes Is Becoming a Big ProblemNewmont is competing to secure slots for its shipments on the small number of remaining commercial flights, Palmer said in a Thursday interview. “The other work is around identifying how we can charter aircraft -- how we work with some other companies to team up and share a charter load.”A shutdown of the airline industry has made transporting gold in all forms more difficult, the World Gold Council’s chief market strategist John Reade said last month. Difficulties in moving metal between trading hubs, and linking those markets with vaults and refineries has impacted prices, widening the spread between New York futures and London spot prices.Read more: Gold Giant Newmont Says Metal Could Top $2,000 on StimulusGreenwood Village, Colorado-based Newmont, which produces more than 6 million ounces of gold a year, has also contended with disruptions at refineries, including closures earlier this month in Switzerland. It has an agreement with Australia’s Perth Mint to potentially accept mined metal from operations the facility doesn’t typically service, including the Merian asset in Suriname, about 10,000 miles (16,000 kilometers) away, according to Palmer.“We now have an avenue, if we need to use it, for our dore from Peru, or Suriname, or Ghana, to go to the Perth Mint to be processed, rather than the U.S. or Europe,” he said. “You have got to get your thinking caps on.”The company has shuttered some operations in Canada, Argentina, Mexico and Peru as a result of coronavirus curbs, and has been coordinating with suppliers including Caterpillar Inc. and explosives maker Orica Ltd. to minimize supply chain delays, Palmer said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-airline-shutdown-surprise-victim-061842852.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-16	2020-04-16 13:54:14	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Gold Giant Newmont Says Metal Could Top $2,000 on Stimulus	(Bloomberg) -- Gold could top $2,000 an ounce and will remain elevated over the next five years as the global economy contends with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the head of Newmont Corp., the world’s top miner of the precious metal.“The level of stimulus globally that’s going into the economy certainly underpins higher gold prices for the longer term, and I don’t think that stimulus has stopped yet,” Chief Executive Officer Tom Palmer said Thursday in a phone interview from Perth. “You could certainly see scenarios that have it pushing north of $2,000.”Spot bullion is trading around $1,725 -- close to a more than seven-year high -- and is forecast by numerous banks to extend gains as the impact of the virus pushes economies toward recession and prompts action from central banks. Those factors are adding to what was already a strong outlook, with rising demand among middle-class consumers in China and India and signs of supply constraints, Palmer said.Read more: Gold Digs In Near Seven-Year High as IMF Warns, ETFs Swell AgainThe metal is likely to trade in a range between $1,500 to $1,750 over the next two to five years “as the world adjusts to and accommodates the stimulus that’s coming,” he said. “You certainly might see that spike out of that from time to time.”The scale of global monetary stimulus is a key factor that’s spurring investors to diversify into gold, Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone said in a note Wednesday. “The foundation for higher prices has rarely been stronger.”Newmont rose 1.6% to $59.17 at 9:47 a.m. in New York, bringing its gain this year to 36%.While higher prices will strengthen Newmont’s ability to increase investor returns, the producer is also weighing the potential impact of any renewed coronavirus outbreak in the northern hemisphere winter. Newmont has shuttered some operations in Canada, Argentina, Mexico and Peru in recent weeks to comply with travel curbs or to protect local communities.“We’re looking to have conversations with people around capital allocation and where best that additional cash might go,” Palmer said. “At this point in time, I would be wanting us to see how the world comes through and out the other side of this pandemic, and would probably look to carry a little bit more cash than you otherwise would.”Read more: Newmont’s New CEO Plans to Dispense More Discipline Than CashThe company, which last year completed its mega-merger with Goldcorp Inc. and forged a Nevada joint venture top competitor Barrick Gold Corp. after fending off a hostile takeover approach, will also be cautious on pursuing options for further acquisitions, even if rivals become distressed as a result of the virus impact.“If if we saw an opportunity come along that fits our filter then we’d certainly have a look at it, but it’s not something that we’re getting distracted by and it’s certainly not something we’re distracting our teams with,” Palmer said.Australian-born Palmer, promoted in October to lead Greenwood Village, Colorado-based Newmont, has been working from his native country -- where his mother and adult children live -- for about the past four weeks, flying back from his home in the U.S. before travel curbs tightened.“It doesn’t really matter whether I’m sitting in the dining room in Denver or the dining room in Perth -- it just means I’m working some funny hours,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-giant-newmont-says-metal-080723888.html?.tsrc=rss

Gold, the original hard cash, is the tradition safe play, the place where investors can park their money and see it hold its value. With gold on the way up, stock investors will naturally be looking for a way to buy in – and they can do this while sticking to the stock markets.In the hope of coming across some hidden gems, we turned to TipRanks’ database. With the investing platform’s help, we were able to zero in on three precious metal stocks getting nods of approval from the analyst community, enough so to have a 'Strong Buy' consensus rating bestowed upon them. Let's take a closer look.Barrick Gold Corporation (GOLD)We’ll start with number two, the world’s second largest gold mining company, Barrick. This company, based in Toronto, taps into Canada’s well-known expertise in mining and resource extraction and channels it into gold and copper mines, with operations in 15 countries. In 2019, Barrick saw a 21% year-over-year increase in its gold output, reaching 5.5 million ounces, and also pulled 432 million pounds of copper out of the ground.Barrick finished up 2019 with a solid quarterly performance. The 17-cent EPS beat the forecast, while the $2.88 billion in quarterly revenue represented 51% year-over-year growth. Looking ahead, analysts project Q1 EPS at 19 cents – a sharp contrast to last the year-ago figure of 11 cents.Barrick’s strong and stable position in the gold mining industry have attracted Wall Street’s attention. Writing from Deutsche Bank, analyst Chris Terry put a Buy rating on the stock, with a $25 price target that suggests an upside of 25%. (To watch Terry’s track record, click here)Supporting his contention, Terry stated, “Barrick is one of the largest gold companies globally and we believe the company is well positioned to benefit from a rising gold-price environment, and one of the first companies asset allocators looking for gold exposure will be drawn towards [...] We anticipate ~10% FCF yield in 2020 on our revised gold forecasts,a very attractive yield, particularly when compared to falling interest rates. In addition we expect the company to continue to progressively increase its dividend over the next few quarters given the strength of its balance sheet.&quot;Also bullish is UBS’ Daniel Major, who wrote of GOLD, “We expect gold prices will remain well supported given low interest rates and negative GDP revisions... We think Barrick's and the gold price selloff were a function of rebalancing around global stock market moves. We expect Barrick to re-rate higher once the sharp moves in global equity markets begin to stabilize… Barrick will remain shareholder friendly with a focus on dividend growth…”In line with this optimistic view, Major upgrades his stance on GOLD, from Neutral to Buy. His price target, set at $22, implies an upside of 10%. (To watch Major’s track record, click here)Overall, GOLD shares have a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 6 Buys and 1 Hold rating. The stock sells for a low price of $20.16, and the $22.60 average price target is indicative of a 12% upside potential for the stock this year. (See Barrick stock analysis on TipRanks)B2Gold Corporation (BTG)Next on our list is Canada-based gold producer, B2Gold. The company controls five mines, with its operations widely dispersed in Africa, Central America, and the Philippines. Success in both attracting investors and resource exploration have allowed the company to expand in recent years, and pushed BTG shares to a 37.5% gain in 2019.B2Gold had a solid finish to 2019. In Q4, the company produced 980,219 ounces of gold, beating the high end of its own forward guidance and generating $1.15 billion in revenue. That top-line number represented 10% year-over-year growth.Looking ahead, the company has guided toward just over 1 million ounces of gold production for 2020, and stands by that even in the current climate. For now, B2Gold is able to maintain production at all five of its active sites despite the COVID-19 pandemic.5-star analyst Ovais Habib, covering B2Gold for Scotiabank, sees reason for optimism in this stock. He maintains his Buy rating along with a price target of C$6.25, or $4.40 in US currency. This implies a substantial 21% upside potential for the shares in 2020. To watch Habib’s track record, click here)Backing his bullish stance on B2Gold, Habib says, “BTO continues gold production and gold shipments and the company benefits from ample onsite stockpiles and high levels of onsite supplies/spares/consumables. Financially, BTO remains well positioned with cash of $140M and $200M drawn on the $600M credit facility…”Habib adds, summing up B2Gold's position, “The company remains focused on the organic pipeline... BTO has many promising exploration targets to follow up. Mines continue to run and the company has been taking advantage of lower fuel prices…”B2Gold has a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, with 7 Buys set in recent weeks. Shares are priced at a discount – selling for just C$4.87 or US$3.43, even qualifies as a penny stock – but the average price target of C$6.97 (US$4.91) implies an impressive upside potential of 35%. (See B2Gold stock analysis on TipRanks)Newmont Mining (NEM)Last on our list is Newmont, which with a $38 billion market cap is the world’s largest gold mining company. Newmont boasted $1.4 billion in free cash flow for 2019, produced 6.3 million ounces of gold, and controls some 100.2 million ounces in recoverable gold mineral reserves. Taken together, it’s no wonder that NEM shares have managed a net gain while the broader markets have slumped.Looking ahead, the company guides toward 6.4 million ounces of gold production in 2020, and sets an annual range of 6.2 million to 6.7 million ounces annually through 2024. Sometimes, it’s just plain good to sit on a gold mine. Or several of them.Of additional interest to investors, Newmont made headlines in January when it agreed to a $10 billion deal to acquire Goldcorp. The move will create the world’s largest gold producer by output. Also in the news, Newmont in March closed out a senior note offering which brought in $1 billion in funding. The notes are due in 2030, and will be used to refinance current debt at lower interest rates; the company is effectively reducing its interest rates from 3.5% and 3.7% down to 2.25%.Raymond James analyst Brian MacArthur provides coverage of this stock. He lowers his price target from $58 to $56, mainly due to concerns over the COVID-19 impact on operations, but keeps his Buy rating on the shares. His new price target implies an upside of 12%. (To watch MacArthur’s track record, click here)MacArthur writes, “the company expects that some production could be deferred into 2021, potentially impacting costs in 2020 if some operations are on care and maintenance for an extended period… Newmont is not currently experiencing significant delays in the shipping of concentrate or transportation and refining of ore, but expects that delays may occur in the coming days and weeks if certain government-required shutdowns and border restrictions occur.”All in all, Newmont’s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 7 Buys and 2 Holds from recent reviews. The stock is selling for $47.15, and the $52.64 average price target suggests it has room for modest 5% upside growth in the coming 12 months.

2020-03-17	2020-03-17 21:25:00	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Top Metal Miners Curb Operations as Governments Fight Virus	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s top metal producers are limiting their operations as governments take steps to contain the coronavirus, dimming the supply outlook.Peru, the world’s second-largest copper miner and third-biggest silver producer, declared a state of emergency for 15 days, closing its borders and ordering a nationwide lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus. As a result, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and Newmont Corp. are curbing their operations in the country.The impact of the pandemic goes far beyond Peru. In Canada, Vale SA said it’s putting its Voisey’s Bay mine under temporary care and maintenance in a move that’s seen trimming the company’s copper output. In Mongolia, Rio Tinto Group’s multi-billion project to develop an underground mine at the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold site has also been slowed.The global pandemic that has killed more than 7,400 has forced governments to limit the movement of people to contain the coronavirus, disrupting supply chains and economic activity. Companies including metal producers have curbed their operations to critical activities, while cutting non-essential travel of its office employees to protect their workers against the disease. Below are the impact on their operations:Freeport-McMoran said its Cerro Verde mine, which produced 1 billion pounds of copper last year, will be under care and maintenance for 15 days beginning March 16 after the Peruvian government declared a national emergencyNewmont said coronavirus-related government restrictions in Peru will require the company to safely cut down its mining operations at Yanacocha while gold production from leach pads and managing critical safety and environmental activities will continue.Vale said copper concentrate output from its Voisey’s Bay operations in Canada will be “reduced proportionally to the period of mine stoppage.” Production at the site reached 25,000 metric tons last year. The shutdown will also impact an expansion project to convert the mine to underground operations, it said.Vale is also reconsidering the timing of its planned Mozambique coal processing plants stoppage as a result of the outbreak.Pan American Silver said it suspended operations at its four mines in Peru in accordance with government mandates to prevent the spread of the coronavirusRio Tinto Group’s delayed $5.3 billion copper mine project in Mongolia faces a further slowdown due to the impact of restrictions imposed in the nation to respond to the coronavirus outbreak.(Adds Pan American Silver suspending Peru operations in 11th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-metal-producers-curb-operations-170918259.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-16	2020-03-16 18:59:46	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Where and When to Shovel GDX into Your Portfolio	Gold sank like a rock last week. But it was the Vaneck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) where panic selling was fully embraced. Let's examine what's happening off and on the price chart and determine whether GDX stock is a more worthwhile buy, sell, or hold-off proposition for your portfolio in today's market.Source: Shutterstock Some gold investors might be asking the question, 'what just happened?' And the answer isn't entirely clear, other than the listed and highly-liquid SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:GLD) tumbled 3.05% Friday to cap off a weekly decline of just over 9%. In total, the selling pressure was the fiercest for the hard asset since September 2011.The aggressive selling in gold comes on the heels of the precious metal narrowly hitting seven-year highs out the gate last Monday. But the metal's status as a safe haven was quickly compromised by a couple drivers to varying degrees.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA surprise rate cut by the Federal Reserve and other stimulus packages to combat the COVID-19 economic fallout may have found some gold investors attempting to rotate unsuccessfully into U.S. debt markets during the week. Gold investors may also be guilty of rotating prematurely into equities during the week as well.  * 7 Drowning Energy Stocks to Avoid for Now Undoubtedly, Friday's massive oversold rally in the broader averages and better-than-expected March consumer sentiment report also played a hand in gold's fast price collapse. Lastly, analysts point to forced selling in the metal to cover losses in other risk assets, as well as a way for gold investors to simply raise cash in a crisis that's still far from finished. Recovery TBDBut as bad as it was for straight-up gold investors, on the back of those same drivers, it was gold mining companies and GDX which fared even worse. Bottom-line, with the smallest businesses to largest household names from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Disney (NYSE:DIS), or Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) taking costly preventative measures, it would be nearsighted to believe mining companies will prove immune to similar actions and economic hardships. Right?Others appear to see the connection in a big way. Industry giants and heavily-weighted ETF constituents Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX), Franco-Nevada Corp (NYSE:FNV) and Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) fell 7% to 21% on the week. Still and maybe somewhat ironically, diversification fared even less well as GDX investors saw shares plummet nearly 15% Friday and 41% for the five-day period. GDX Monthly Price Chart  Source: Charts by TradingViewThe good news is, if you're thinking the panic selling in GDX may be a bit too extreme, the monthly price chart is trying to promote that belief. With shares of GDX indicated to fall again out the gate Monday, prices in the ETF will be challenging a key area of technical support from $16 - $17.The technical zone is backed by the instrument's 76% retracement level of its five-year cycle low-to-high, as well as lateral and angular support lines formed over the last couple years. It's an interesting spot to consider picking up stock in the gold mining ETF. That being said, I'd suggest holding off on any purchases within the framework of a falling knife.A failure to hold price support could lead to a continued quick plunge towards $13 and the 2015 low in GDX. As much, today's recommendation is for investors to monitor shares for a flattening of the monthly stochastics or a bullish crossover on the weekly time frame. Should that play out and $16 level hold on the price chart, then taking out the shovel and buying stock in a less risky safe haven makes appreciably more sense.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2020-02-24	2020-02-24 12:30:24	NEM	Newmont Corporation	With Gold Up, Miners Face Payouts Versus Production Dilemma	(Bloomberg) -- As gold prices rise, miners have been boosting shareholder payouts in the face of a decline in global output. That’s worrying some investors concerned about the longterm growth prospects of an industry built on a depleting resource.The value of gold, a haven commodity, is driven more by global economics than supply and demand. It’s soaring toward $1,700 an ounce now on fear the coronavirus will harm growth. Any unexpected event -- from a surprising cure for the virus to a positive trade deal -- could drop the value significantly. High prices put more gold scrap on the market, low ones boost hoarding and, if miner output remains static, so should profits.Increasingly, investors are split between their wish for higher dividends in the short run and the need to assure company stability over the long term. Finding the “best of both worlds” in allocating the rising cash pile is key for the future of the industry, according to Josh Wolfson, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.“Miners in general are exposed to significant external factors that are out of their control,” said Simon Jaeger, a portfolio manager at Flossbach von Storch AG, a top-10 investor in both Newmont Corp. and Barrick Gold Corp. “It’s certainly a reason for not paying too much in dividends,” he said. “You want to have the cash buffer on your balance sheet in order to be financially flexible when prices get worse.”Gold prices are currently at a seven-year high as concerns mount that the coronavirus outbreak in Asia will derail global growth. In a sign that the virus is already starting to dent the world’s largest economy, business activity in the U.S. shrank in February for the first time since 2013.On Monday, spot gold was up 2.3% to $1,680.38 an ounce at 7:25 a.m. in New York.Gold producers are “gushing cash,” said John Hathaway, senior portfolio manager at Sprott Asset Management, in support of the higher dividends. “They are in a position to raise their dividend,” he said. “And there will be boardroom pressure and shareholder pressure to do that.”The industry has been blasted in the past for underspending on production, overspending on acquisitions and piling up debt. Now, though, after years of fat-trimming, miners and their investors are well-positioned to gain from the higher prices. That’s allowed companies including Barrick and Newmont to boost free-cash flow and, to varying degrees, reward shareholders.Earlier this month, though, Mark Bristow, Barrick’s chief executive officer, sent a warning shot across the bow of the industry. Even if all current projects work out, he said, gold supply will still fall 30% globally by 2029. While sinking supply would be bullish for bullion prices, margins and revenues could be hit if companies are forced to mine lower-grade or hard-to-access deposits.The divide between whether to push profits or new production has become more focused this year.Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. offers a case in point of how closely investors are watching the issue. Despite boosting its dividend 14% and forecasting rising production through 2022, Agnico’s shares were punished after it cut its 2020 output guidance earlier this month. In an interview after the results, CEO Sean Boyd argued that dividend increases are important not just as a way of sharing the benefits of higher gold prices, but also because it demonstrates a company’s ability to maintain capital discipline.Success in the changing shareholder landscape is “going to be from the better gold-mining businesses being able to attract new generalist money,” Boyd said by telephone.‘Endless Pit’Steve Land, portfolio manager for the Franklin Gold and Precious Metals Fund, believes the next step for miners is to show the sector is “not just this endless pit of having to pour more and more money in all the time.” The trend toward higher dividends is a way of rebuilding trust and confidence, according to Land. These companies can also take the time to assess future projects, he said, but should be “in no rush to push things forward.”Newmont, meanwhile, seems to be seeking to meet a “best of both worlds” scenario.In January, Newmont said it planned to hike its dividend by 79% to $1 per share annually, effective in April, while maintaining production for the next five years. On Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Nancy Buese said the U.S.-based miner was considering “other shareholder friendly actions” it might take.One key consideration “will be to determine our appropriate level of dividend on a go-forward and sustainable basis,” she said.Barrick, meanwhile, announced a 40% dividend hike to 7 cents a share earlier this month. As it sells assets and tackles its debt, the Canada-based miner is hoping to attract generalist investors to its stock. But it also lowered its five-year production guidance and is reevaluating its portfolio mix.Generally, it appears the high-dividend strategy is helping lift gold equities. A Bloomberg Intelligence index of senior gold producers lagged the performance of gold futures for most of the past decade. But in the past 12 months, the gold group is killing it, rising 57% compared with 24% for gold.“If a company has genuine productive opportunities to invest capital in their business at high return, that is always going to be preferable versus paying a dividend,” said RBC’s Wolfson by phone. “But companies which can demonstrate overall discipline by allocating capital effectively -- plus paying out cash flow to shareholders -- I think will ultimately accomplish the best of both worlds.”&#92;--With assistance from Maria Elena Vizcaino and Yvonne Yue Li.To contact the reporters on this story: Justina Vasquez in New York at jvasquez57@bloomberg.net;Danielle Bochove in Toronto at dbochove1@bloomberg.net;Steven Frank in Toronto at sfrank9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Reg Gale, Joe RyanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-surging-miners-face-payouts-133000410.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-20	2020-02-20 16:24:47	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Newmont Soars on Profit Beat With Rising Gold Providing Tailwind	(Bloomberg) -- Newmont Corp. climbed after the world’s largest gold miner reported earnings that beat analysts’ expectations, helped by a tailwind from higher bullion prices.Miners have been sharing the windfall from stronger prices with investors in the form of higher dividends. Newmont led the pack in January with its promise of a 79% hike to $1 per share annually. The increase will take effect later in the year.Newmont is considering “other shareholder friendly actions” it might take in the future, Chief Financial Officer Nancy Buese said Thursday on the fourth-quarter earnings call. A key such action “will be to determine our appropriate level of dividend on a go forward and sustainable basis,” she said.Newmont rose as much as 6.1%, the most intraday in almost a year, while an index of senior gold miners gained as much as 1.1%. Newmont was trading up 4.2% as of 10:58 a.m. in New York, increasing its gains in the past 12 months to 36%.Adjusted fourth-quarter earnings were 50 cents a share on revenue of $2.97 billion, the Greenwood Village, Colorado-based miner said in its earnings statement. That beat analysts’ estimates for 46 cents and sales of $2.93 billion.The company’s production and cost guidance over the next five years was unchanged, solidifying its lead over rival Barrick Gold Corp.Spot gold averaged about $1,483 an ounce in the fourth quarter, 21% more than a year earlier.

2020-01-16	2020-01-16 22:00:40	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Gold’s Rally Helps Miners Delay the Inevitable	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Peak gold production is looking a little more distant. Global supply of the yellow metal has been inexorably approaching its high-water mark, as ore is extracted faster than new discoveries are made. Mines have been aging fast. A sustained price rally can change that picture, as investors rekindle their enthusiasm for large-scale exploration and technological innovation. Bullion miners’ margins will benefit.Gold is coming out of a long period in the investor wilderness. Last year marked the biggest annual gain in prices since 2010. It broke through $1,570 last week — the highest in almost seven years. Gold prices are driven by factors that aren’t always predictable, but there’s certainly scope to go higher, with interest rates low and geopolitical tensions simmering. Holdings of gold in exchange-traded funds, popular with retail investors, are near 2012’s lofty levels. Central banks remain buyers too.This isn’t a repeat of 2011, when gold cracked a gravity-defying $1,900 per ounce — at least, not yet. The all-time high remains some way off, despite a handful of analysts already pointing to $2,000 gold. But the impact of higher prices is already trickling down. All-in sustaining cash costs remained at around $934 per ounce for the largest producers in the third quarter of 2019, according to Bloomberg estimates. The industry measure, though rising, makes for healthy margins. Barrick Gold Corp., for example, reported third-quarter free cash flow of $502 million, compared to $55 million in the previous three months.Last year’s flurry of M&A speaks to that exuberance: from Barrick Gold’s merger with Randgold Resources Ltd., completed that January, to Goldcorp Inc.’s union with Newmont Corp., plus a string of opportunistic offers among smaller companies, and imaginative deals like Barrick’s Nevada joint venture with Newmont. Overall, 2019 marked a return to levels last seen during the boom.There’s more to come, especially among smaller players. Diverging levels of bullishness, after years of homogenous forecasts, will create opportunities for miners to expand portfolios.But the deal spike tells a supply story too, and those numbers are grim even after miners pair up, with reserves down steadily for much of the past decade. The average life of a gold mine shrank to 11 years by 2018 from 16 in 2012, according to consulting company Wood Mackenzie Ltd. Back in 2015, as prices fell toward $1,000 an ounce, the World Gold Council warned that the industry was nearing “peak gold,” after which output would begin to decline. That’s still a threat.Tie-ups are no panacea. The trouble is there’s no short-term link between gold prices and supply. Sure, marginal projects become viable, but that’s a transient boost. Also, the lag effect means mines commissioned in boom years will still take years to come into production. Meanwhile, the scars of the 2011 excesses will make miners reluctant to change their assumptions for the long-term gold price, which are largely still at or below $1,300.The good news is that this works both ways. Higher supply, through exploration or innovation, also won’t depress prices.That should increase enthusiasm for exploration. Budgets have shrunk and success rates have been decreasing, even if gold continues to command the lion’s share of the mining sector’s exploration outlays. So far, spending has increased largely on existing projects rather than new finds. Splashy budgets don’t guarantee success, but the supply numbers will have to rise. There are already signs of long-awaited projects accelerating, such as Polyus PJSC’s Sukhoi Log in Siberia. Then there is investment in technology. This isn’t only to automate and electrify fleets, but to upgrade exploration and processing techniques. For gold, processing improvements could make even complex, refractory ore — resistant to more common extraction methods — attractive. Barclays Plc estimated in December that innovation could add 10% of incremental supply growth through 2025. Cost per ounce may come down 4%. That’s a target worth aiming for. To contact the author of this story: Clara Ferreira Marques at cferreirama@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

Today we'll share four ways to bank on the yellow metal's resurgence.With stocks booming in the fourth quarter, demand for precious metals has ebbed. The logic makes sense. When the risk-on switch flipped, the pull of equities and higher profit-giving assets outweighed that of metals. The potent combination of a trade war resolution and bullish seasonality provided all the excuse needed to jam stocks higher into year-end.But here's the curious thing: Gold and gold stocks are seeing massive inflows too. Shares of the world's top gold miners are breaching resistance are returning to uptrending status. We've scoured the industry and found four of the best stocks to buy if you think gold's new bull market has legs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks to Beat the Market in 2020 Take a look. Barrick Gold (GOLD)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) shares rally ahead came just in time for Christmas. The jump completed a multi-month rounded bottom pattern and signaled its intermediate-term uptrend is back on track. GOLD stock is now perched above a rising 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving average.The next two upside targets are resistance zones at $19 and $20.Ever since its mid-November earnings report, volume patterns have weighed heavily in favor of bulls with accumulation days multiplying and distribution days all but disappearing.Implied volatility is low at the 13th percentile of its one-year range. This suggests long premium plays are a smart move.The Trade: Buy the February $18/$21 bull call spread for 90 cents. Newmont Mining (NEM)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade This week's breakout pushed Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) shares to a three-year high. Blasting above a resistance zone that has kept a lid on price advances for years is a big deal and underscores just how powerful the demand for gold stocks has become.NEM stock is rallying above a rising 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving average. The momentum increase during this week's advance suggests any weakness that crops up in the near-term is a buying opportunity.Newmont shares have become overbought in the short run, so it wouldn't surprise me if some consolidation is in order. Wait for a down day or two, then deploy bull trades.  * 7 Top-Tier Dividend Stocks for 2020 The Trade: Buy the February $42/$45 after a pullback emerges. Franco-Nevada (FNV)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade While its predecessors are flirting with multi-month and multi-year highs, Franco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV) just broke out to an all-time high. The past four-month consolidation pattern took on the form of a cup-and-handle with resistance at the psychologically significant $100 level.Tuesday's rally finally eclipsed the pivotal zone, and this morning's jump signals follow-through. Unfortunately, the strength is fading fast at the time of this writing, so a re-test of $100 over the coming days could be in store. As long as we don't fall back below the 20-day moving average near $98.50, the breakout is still worth betting one.The lower implied volatility favors long calls or call spreads.The Trade: Buy the February $100/$105 bull call spread for around $2.50. Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM)Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) had one of the clearest breakout setups heading into this week. For months, $28.50 had been an area where rallies went to die. Until this week.Monday and Tuesday scored huge upside that finally felled resistance. This morning's strength is adding to the gains with a push toward the 52-week high of $30.90.The momentum surge is reflected by the 20-day moving average distancing itself from the 50-day. While some backing-and-filling could be in order following three outsized up days, weakness was born to be bought.Once again, implied volatility is depressed favoring long premium plays.The Trade: Buy the February $30/$32 bull call spread for around 72 cents.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-20	2019-12-20 01:00:00	NEM	Newmont Corporation	From Barrick to Freeport: Top Mining Chiefs Look Ahead to 2020	(Bloomberg) -- Merger mania swept the gold-mining industry in 2019 with more than $33 billion worth of deals being inked. While trade fears lit a fire under bullion prices, they created headwinds for base-metals miners.What’s ahead in 2020? In our fourth annual mining executive year-ender, we asked the heads of some of the biggest producers for their outlooks. Based on interviews with miners including Barrick Gold Corp., Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and Newmont Goldcorp Corp., readers should expect a big focus on environmental, social and governance issues -- and more consolidation.Mark Bristow, Barrick“Gold has never, since the Bretton Woods agreement, been in such a good place.”MARKET:Negative interest rates and looming global gold-production declines support $1,400-$1,500/oz pricesSECTOR:More mining consolidation is still needed, especially in the gold sectorESG:Industry oversold because of ESG concernsMiners need to be more accountable and highlight “responsible development”“Just look out your window. If you took away everything that was mined you would just have a heap of rubble. And we, the mining industry, are very unloved”HIS COMPANY:The priority is replacing and adding resources to ensure the company’s future beyond 10 yearsOnce that’s done, more generalists will come into the stockBarrick can also look at long-term dividends once a 10-year plan is in place“My objective is to get to a proper dividend policy”“I think there’s a place for share buybacks,” but they’re challenging in the gold industry because bullion producers already trade at a premiumHeaded for zero net debt in 2020, Barrick has plenty of cash to support ambitionsFreeport is on its radar -- but Barrick has no plans to rush into anything and would “never” go hostileREAD MORE: Barrick CEO Says He Has Plenty of Financial Firepower for DealsRichard Adkerson, Freeport“We went to war together, we won the war, and now we’re moving forward.”MARKET:U.S. tariffs on China knocked copper back since June 2018, with Brexit and weak U.S. manufacturing acting as additional headwindsDespite this, prices have been resilient and inventories of the key metal aren’t growingHigher prices are likely if trade tensions are resolvedSECTOR:Production has been constrained; higher copper prices are required for new mines to be builtResource nationalism remains a challengeDisruptions around income disparity, such as those that triggered Chile’s recent protests, are on the riseM&A is likely in the sector longer-term, but requires clarity on copper priceInstitutional memory of poor deals in the past remains an impedimentESG:ESG concerns are an industry challenge; “the public discourse is rising”“Those sorts of issues are many times more challenging than the really challenging technical issues we face”HIS COMPANY:After tough years in Indonesia, which he likened to a “war,” Freeport is focused on the transition to underground operations at the Grasberg depositWithin two years, cash flow should double and production surgeOnce that happens, the miner expects to use cash to cut debt and boost shareholder returns through dividends or stock buybacksThe Lone Star project in Arizona will produce first copper in 2020Adkerson has no plans to retireREAD MORE: Freeport CEO Says Now’s Not the Time for Miner to Consider DealsTom Palmer, Newmont“We’re starting to see increasing expectations for transparency on (ESG) performance, not just at the portfolio level but going right down to the site level.”MARKET:Geopolitical instability and declining global gold reserves may support “robust” gold prices over the medium termLike Barrick and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., Newmont assumes $1,200/oz gold for planning purposesSECTOR:Palmer expects more consolidation of single-asset gold producers in 2020Gold mega-mergers, like those in the first half of 2019, are unlikelyESG:The biggest challenge in 2020 for the gold-mining industry is likely to be ESGSo far, Palmer doesn’t think ESG ratings correlate with stock liquidity, but that’s the direction things are moving“It’s a topic of conversation at just about every meeting we have”HIS COMPANY:Having merged with Goldcorp and completed a JV with Barrick in Nevada, and then sold $1.4 billion in assets, the focus for 2020 is delivering value on the remaining portfolio“Those two transactions really set Newmont up for the next several decades”No pressure to do M&A, but company will remain “opportunistic and selective” if the right buying opportunity appearsInvesting in the project pipeline and keeping a strong balance sheet are top prioritiesIf the gold price stays elevated, Newmont is more likely to use dividends than buybacks to reward shareholders in 2020; this month’s buyback was a “unique opportunity”JV with Barrick in Nevada should have been done years agoClive Newall First Quantum“The days of great big diesel trucks thundering around mines are going to be over very shortly.”MARKET:First Quantum’s president says the physical copper market has been strongHe expects prices to hold in the $2.50-$3.00/lb range for 2020SECTOR:Pent-up demand, and cash, could spark mergers in the sectorMajors are awash with cash and “China Inc. is becoming more interested”It just takes one deal to start a rush: “Nobody wants to be first out of the gate”ESG:Everyone in the industry is grappling with decarbonization issues, including water shortages“Victoria Falls has dried up to almost a trickle. It’s impacting the industry wherever you operate pretty much, and we’re all having to adjust accordingly”HIS COMPANY:Deleveraging is the focus for next 2-3 years“We want to reduce our debt by at least $2 billion before we think about doing anything else”The miner won’t do large acquisitions and will only sell minority stakes in assetsTakeover talk is just “scuttlebutt,” but if there’s an offer, the company will resistREAD MORE: First Quantum Says No Takeover Bid from Rio Tinto or JiangxiSean Boyd, Agnico“I think what investors want to see is just continued conservatism in how companies are calculating reserves, which really drives the mine plans, which really drives the prospects for the business.”MARKET:Gold has been in a bull market since 2015Retracement of the price since September is healthy; fundamentals are strongThe $1,480/oz range for gold is impressive given the record high stock marketBoyd expects gold to breach $1,550/oz next year and to test new high around $2,000/oz in 2-3 yearsSECTOR:The greatest challenge for the industry is replenishing reservesGrowth is tough, but “to grow in a way where you’re actually improving the quality of your underlying business is extremely difficult”Investors want the industry to use a conservative gold price in 2020 to count reservesMore consolidation is needed and likely“It’s extremely difficult to get capital to fund smaller and mid-tier businesses”ESG:Agnico launched an advocacy campaign to articulate the benefits of mining“We see a bit of a vacuum in the Canadian mining space. The country used to be in a leadership position”Advocacy is important, post-federal election, to help shape resource policyHIS COMPANY:Despite the recent wave of mergers, Agnico is under no pressure to do dealsNot looking over shoulder for takeovers; the miner trades at a premium and it’s tough for competitors to argue they can run the assets betterAgnico just hiked its dividend; has debt coming due in AprilWith Nunavut mines built, the focus will be on generating free cash flow to reinvest in the business, pay down debt and hike dividends“We’re going to do all of those things”Don Lindsay, Teck“One of best cures for low commodity prices is, of course, low commodity prices. Coal prices have been low for a few months now.”MARKETS:ZincNegative sentiment is “overwhelming the fundamentals”“We know that a number of people are losing money now at these prices”Given China’s crackdown on polluters, the market is overestimating how much zinc concentrate will be turned into refined metal“We think that the market is going to be much tighter than people expect”Lindsay expects stable or higher prices, but “group sentiment” could prove him wrongCopperCopper fundamentals are also good but the price is unlikely to hit $3.50/lb “anytime soon”A $2.80-$3/lb range is most likely for 2020Metallurgical coalPrices should start to pick up given marginal producers can’t access capital and “are starting to shut down”“Unbelievable” strength in China steel production and falling inventories should provide price support into next yearSECTORInvestors don’t feel they have to own mining shares yet; that’s unlikely to change in 2020 given most expect weak growthESG:Good ESG ratings don’t seem to boost valuations, but a bad rating can make investors shun a stock completelyTeck’s ratings are good but it has to keep improving: “The bar keeps getting raised”HIS COMPANY:Teck has plenty of liquidity and no significant debt due until 2035; announced stock buybacks will continueLindsay is encouraged by the sales process for Zafranal, but wouldn’t comment furtherOn M&A: “We’re not looking to buy anything, that’s for sure, and we haven’t started any process on selling any of the other satellite projects yet”Next asset to shed would be San Nicolas in Mexico, but not until prefeasibility is done in six monthsCanadian federal government has to make a decision on the Frontier oil-sands project by the end of FebruaryTo contact the reporter on this story: Danielle Bochove in Toronto at dbochove1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven Frank, Joe RichterFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newmont-teck-top-mining-ceos-141530285.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-02	2019-12-02 18:57:22	NEM	Newmont Corporation	China’s Zijin Wins Over Canadian Miner With a Rare Cash Offer	(Bloomberg) -- Cash is king and will be hard to top by a rival bidder, according to the head of Continental Gold Inc. which agreed to a C$1.37 billion ($1 billion) takeover offer from China’s largest listed producer of mined gold.Continental’s shares rose as much as 11% in Toronto on Monday after the offer from Fujian-based Zijin Mining Group Co. was announced. That’s in contrast to Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd., whose shares plunged 17% on Nov. 25 after it made an all-stock $3.7 billion takeover bid for Detour Gold Corp.“Cash bids are very rare in the gold mining space and we delivered one,” Ari Sussman, chief executive officer of Toronto-based Continental, said in a phone interview on Monday. Only a handful of gold miners would be able to pull it off, he said.The deal is the latest in a flurry of consolidation in the mining industry. Barrick Gold Corp. took over Randgold Resources Ltd. and Newmont Mining Corp. acquired Goldcorp Inc. last year and smaller miners are hurrying to keep up and stay in the game.Speculation has long-brewed that Continental was a takeover target. Sussman said he started shopping the company after Newmont’s acquisition of Goldcorp in January, figuring that Newmont, which owns 18.4% of Continental, would have its hands full with Goldcorp and be looking to get rid of non-core assets.Zijin will pay C$5.50 a share for Continental and said Newmont was supportive, according to a statement. The deal will give Zinjin control of Continental’s Buritica gold project in Colombia, which is currently being developed. Continental share were trading at C$5.36 at 1:55 p.m. in Toronto, up almost 10%.“There were obviously multiple levels of interest” for Continental, Sussman said. In terms of possible rival bid, he thinks “Anything is possible but it’s tough to beat the bid number.”The takevover by a foreign company will need Canadian government approval and relations between the two countries have been tense of late with China holding two Canadians in prison and Canada holding the CFO of Huawei Technologies Co. on an extradition order from the U.S.Last year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government blocked a proposed C$1.2 billion ($934 million) takeover of construction firm Aecon Group Inc. by a unit of China Communications Construction Co. citing security concerns associated with Chinese investment.It “would be very far-fetched” to have any pushback for this deal, Sussman said. “Maybe that question would have been more valid if our asset was in Canada,” he added. “This is more China coming to Colombia as governments are supportive of each other.”Steven Butler, an analyst at GMP Securities Ltd., said the value of the deal was less than hoped for but he doesn’t see a superior offer for Continental forthcoming “given the geopolitical risk associated with Colombia, the potential working capital-funding risk and the all-cash nature of the deal.” Sussman thinks it’s a good time to sell as risks build heading into production.“Look at the laundry list of companies which have gone into production in last five years and look at the challenges they faced,” he said. “We thought this would be the right time, for someone with deep pockets, to take over our excellent team.”To contact the reporter on this story: Aoyon Ashraf in Toronto at aashraf7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brad Olesen at bolesen3@bloomberg.net, ;David Scanlan at dscanlan@bloomberg.net, Jacqueline ThorpeFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-zijin-wins-over-canadian-185722931.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-02	2019-12-02 12:48:37	NEM	Newmont Corporation	China’s Zijin to Buy Canada’s Continental Gold for $1 Billion	(Bloomberg) -- Zijin Mining Group Co. agreed to buy Continental Gold Inc. in a deal worth C$1.37 billion ($1 billion), marking the second takeover in as many weeks of a Canadian gold miner.Zijin will pay C$5.50 a share in cash for Continental and said major shareholder Newmont Goldcorp Corp. was supportive, according to a statement on Monday. The offer reflects a 29% premium to the share price from the past 20 days.The company, China’s biggest listed producer of mined gold, has been making deals across the world in recent years as it looks to bolster its exposure to gold and copper. The acquisition would give Zijin control of the Buritica gold project in Colombia, which is currently being developed. Output at Zijin Mountain, China’s top gold mine which the producer is named for, is dropping because of depleting resources. The deal comes just a week after Canada’s Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. agreed to buy Detour Gold Corp. for $3.7 billion, furthering an M&A spree that’s swept the gold mining industry.There’s been constant speculation about gold mining acquisitions after huge deals rocked the industry in the last year: Newmont Mining Corp.’s acquisition of Goldcorp Inc. and Barrick Gold Corp.’s takeover of Randgold Resources Ltd. The two combinations created companies that dwarf the rest of the industry and mean that smaller miners feel the need to consolidate if they’re going to stay relevant to shareholders.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Liezel HillFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-zijin-buy-canada-continental-124837188.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-17	2019-11-17 09:29:59	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Saracen Said to Near $750 Million Deal in Barrick Mine Stake	(Bloomberg) -- Saracen Mineral Holdings Ltd. is nearing a deal for Barrick Gold Corp.’s share of the Kalgoorlie Super Pit gold mine in Western Australia, according to people familiar with the matter.Perth-based Saracen prevailed over a number of other bidders with an offer that values the 50% stake in the mine at about $750 million, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential matters. Talks could still fall apart and there is no guarantee a deal will be reached, the people said.Spokespeople for Barrick and Saracen couldn’t be immediately reached for a comment.Buying Barrick’s share in the giant operation in Western Australia will give Saracen exposure to an asset that was the country’s third-largest producing gold operation last year, according to industry researcher Surbiton Associates Pty. The site includes a 3.5-kilometer (2-mile) long open pit, an underground mine and processing facilities.Barrick and its key rival Newmont Goldcorp Corp. are in the process of offloading unwanted mines after major acquisitions since 2018 that have reshaped the gold sector. Newmont, which holds the remaining 50% of the Kalgoorlie Super Pit, previously targeted $1.5 billion from asset sales, though has more recently cautioned that it is under no pressure to sell.An earlier attempt by Barrick to sell its Kalgoorlie stake ended in 2017 when Shandong Tyan Home Co. said tighter controls in China on outbound investment meant it could no longer proceed with a proposed $1.3 billion deal.Since then, the Kalgoorlie asset has experienced operational challenges, including rock falls in the open pit in 2018 that have crimped production. Output declined by a third in the nine months to Sept. 30 as costs rose 40%, Newmont said in a Nov. 5 filing.The site is regarded as holding potential for further development of an underground mine and there are plans to continue gold processing into the 2030s.

2019-11-14	2019-11-14 17:19:52	NEM	Newmont Corporation	7 Silver and Gold Stocks to Buy That Offer Contrarian Upside	At first glance, the case for gold stocks to buy appears incredibly challenged right now. One of the biggest impediments to a rising equities market has been the U.S.-China trade war. Recently, though, both sides appear willing to negotiate. Even President Donald Trump, no stranger to angry rhetoric, appeared optimistic for a substantive trade deal.Wall Street has given Trump the benefit of the doubt, significantly hurting the case for gold stocks to buy. Both the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average, along with the benchmark S&P 500 have charged to all-time highs. In sharp contrast, gold prices, which have looked so strong this year due to rising fear and uncertainty, have slid downward this month.But before you get too complacent, Yahoo Finance contributor Rick Newman brought up an excellent question: Why is the Street giving any credibility to Trump? As Newman bluntly put it, &quot;There is, in fact, no trade deal with China.&quot; Further, he provides his readers with a warning from the not-so-distant past:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;Last December, after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump said, 'It's an incredible deal. It goes down, certainly, if it happens, it goes down as one of the largest deals ever made.' If you're wondering what deal that was, well, yes -- there was no deal.&quot;Thus, I don't think the thesis for gold stocks to buy is dead. And even if a trade deal materializes, I recently presented my argument for why big banks are in trouble. Namely, the economy is nowhere near as healthy as advertised.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 This pressured environment dramatically raises the profile for gold miners. Additionally, don't ignore the potential for silver stocks to buy. Newmont Goldcorp (NEM)Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock Under any economic condition, I believe some exposure to gold and precious metals is prudent. Going 100% into any asset class is simply asking for trouble. That said, I understand the inconveniences involved with buying physical bullion. Thus, if you're not into gold-based exchange-traded funds like SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:GLD), then Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM) and NEM stock could be right for you.With a market capitalization of $30.3 billion, NEM stock is at time of writing the biggest name among publicly traded gold stocks. And while such stability typically means that Newmont won't rise as dramatically during a gold rush, you're likely not to lose your shirt with this investment. No matter what, both gold and silver stocks are known for volatility; thus, having a safety net makes sense.Thanks to its January 2019 acquisition of Goldcorp, NEM stock offers fundamental robustness. With stronger margins and higher growth trajectories, NEM is well positioned to advantage the fear trade. That might very well come if this trade war negotiation turns out to be another head-fake. Sibanye Gold (SBGL)Source: Shutterstock One of the biggest gold stocks to buy, Sibanye Gold (NYSE:SBGL), is notable today for moving against the grain. While the spot price for the underlying yellow metal has steadily declined since the beginning of September, SBGL stock has veritably skyrocketed. Is there something in the water in South Africa where Sibanye is headquartered?We all know that Africa has very valuable natural and precious resources. Among those resources isn't just gold, but also platinum and palladium. The latter metal has enjoyed a robust performance in the markets. Currently, palladium is worth more than gold, even with a sharp drop in price. Since Sibanye is the second-largest producer of the precious metal, SBGL stock has enjoyed outsized gains.  * 7 Under-the-Radar Retail Stocks to Buy Now Not only that, management has been very active in the mergers and acquisitions scene. Consolidating more companies under its umbrella, SBGL stock has a very robust growth pathway over the long run. Franco-Nevada (FNV)Source: Shutterstock Among the best performing gold stocks to buy, what most impresses me about Franco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV) is its resiliency. Several mining companies, especially the ultra-speculative silver stocks, fell sharply following the 2011 precious metals rally and subsequent collapse. While FNV stock certainly felt the heat, it didn't fold like many of its peers.A major reason why this is involves fiscal stability. Prior to the 2011 run up, many sector players got gold fever, believing prices would rise indefinitely. Unfortunately, these organizations were not prepared for the coming bearish phase, taking risks they normally wouldn't have.However, Franco-Nevada has kept its financials relatively clean. For instance, its balance sheet has very manageable debt levels compared to its cash holdings. In other words, management hasn't stretched itself, which is a positive attribute in this environment. You just never know what's going to happen next. Thus, FNV stock gives you a balanced approach between upside potential and stability. Sandstorm Gold (SAND)Source: Shutterstock A lesser-known entity among gold stocks to buy, Sandstorm Gold (NYSEAMERICAN:SAND) could eventually turn out to be a front runner. Although the low SAND stock price makes it riskier compared to its larger brethren, what investors will appreciate is the underlying company's business model.Featuring a portfolio of royalty assets, Sandstorm doesn't actually operate mining projects. Instead, it invests in companies that have a need for capital. In return, Sandstorm receives a share of the spoils. For those who are concerned about the volatility in metal prices, SAND stock may offer an ideal platform. Thanks to the royalty model, it's much easier to predict cash flows for the company.  * These 7 Stocks to Buy Were Big Winners This Earnings Season That said, don't jump aboard SAND stock assuming that it has no risks. Primarily, Sandstorm has a substantial stake in the Hod Maden mine in Turkey. If this pans out, SAND is due for a massive upswing. But it's also important to consider that Turkey isn't exactly a geopolitically stable area. First Majestic Silver (AG)Source: Shutterstock While gold stocks get most of the coverage in the precious metals sector, investors shouldn't ignore silver stocks. Generally speaking, the cheaper of the pair share a strong correlation with each other: As one moves higher, so too does the other. With that in mind, those interested in mining companies should consider First Majestic Silver (NYSE:AG) and AG stock.One of the attributes about First Majestic that I found appealing is its geographic positioning. The company has 100% ownership of six mines in Mexico. Aside from being a neighboring country, Mexico has free trade agreements with multiple developed economies. More importantly for potential buyers of AG stock, Mexico features relative political and financial stability.And because the U.S. and Mexico are such close partners, the latter is truly disincentivized from acting irrationally.That said, AG stock isn't without risks. Typical of smaller silver stocks, First Majestic historically has suffered middling profitability margins, though these metrics have recently improved. Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM)Source: Shutterstock Like gold stocks, silver mining investments are wild, even more so than those companies producing the yellow metal. Because silver has both industrial and monetary components, as well as a thinner market, the supply-demand picture is unpredictable. However, Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) takes much of the guesswork out with its streaming business model.Like Sandstorm Gold, Wheaton Precious Metals doesn't own mining projects. Instead, it provides necessary capital for miners. Therefore, an investment in WPM stock provides broader coverage to the silver mining industry than would be possible through a traditional business model. And because of the pre-negotiated contracts, it's much easier to predict Wheaton's financial trajectory.  * 7 Earnings Losers That Were Hit Hard This Season Interestingly, WPM stock has held up reasonably well following the precious metals' fallout earlier this decade. Now, it appears the tide is shifting favorably for both gold and silver stocks to buy. Don't be surprised if WPM enjoys outsized performance. Pan American Silver (PAAS)Source: Shutterstock Relative to gold stocks, the silver miners have a reputation for being high-risk, high-reward investments. However, those that value hard results with the possibility of outstanding gains should consider Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS). While silver prices have slipped badly in November, PAAS stock is up over 4% since the beginning of the month.Why? The Street took a very positive view on the company's third-quarter earnings results. Revenue came in at over $352 million, representing a year-over-year lift of nearly 88%. Moreover, Pan American delivered net income of $37.7 million, which translates to earnings per share of 18 cents. In the year-ago quarter, EPS was a loss of 6 cents.Following the results, PAAS stock benefitted from a robust session the next day.I wouldn't be surprised if we saw further gains down the road.

Gold prices have fallen to their lowest level in three months, hurt by rising global interest rates and the recent strength in the U.S. dollar.  Gold was down $9.45, to $1,459 an ounce Friday, leaving it almost $100, or 6%, below its high in early September of $1,552.  The drop in gold prices has hit gold mining shares with the exchange-traded fund (GDX) down 15 cents to $26.34 Friday.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/7aeeda0a-592d-340f-8ef4-8c36297d99da/gold-prices-fall-to-their.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-11-07	2019-11-07 14:26:16	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Barrick's Dividend Boost Looks Like a Harbinger for the Gold Industry	(Bloomberg) -- Bullion giant Barrick Gold Corp. pleasantly surprised the market by raising its dividend 25%. Will the move portend a new era of largess from the normally tightfisted gold miners?There are certainly reasons for investors to be hopeful. Producers have been striving to cut costs and consolidate operations, while the price of gold has climbed over 20% in the past year to hover around $1,500 an ounce. Barrick’s move Wednesday was echoed a few hours later when Canadian rival Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. raised its quarterly payout 50%. B2Gold Corp. preceded both by announcing its first-ever dividend a day earlier.“The companies are positioned to start to pay dividends and give more back to shareholders,” Joe Foster, a portfolio manager and strategist at VanEck, said by phone Wednesday. “It happens to coincide with the rising gold price, so you’re getting to see more aggressive moves on the dividends front than we would have seen if gold was $100 or $200 lower.”Gold miners trimmed costs following the sharp decline of the metal’s price toward the start of the decade. Barrick and B2Gold are both expecting costs this year to come in at or below the lower end of company guidance.Barrick rose Wednesday in New York trading, ending the day up 2.2%. The shares were down 0.4% at 9:24 a.m. pre-market on Thursday as gold prices fell. Kirkland Lake gained 2.8% in Toronto Wednesday, while B2Gold climbed 4%.Not all producers have embraced increased payouts this earnings season. On Tuesday Newmont Goldcorp Corp., the world’s largest gold producer, held its dividend steady as it grapples with integrating problematic assets acquired in its mega-merger with Goldcorp Inc.In an interview after assuming the role of chief executive officer Oct. 1, Newmont’s Tom Palmer used a common phrase in the gold industry: capital allocation discipline. For Palmer, that means the first focus will be paying down debt, then funding projects, and finally increasing dividends.A disciplined approach should continue to translate to shareholder returns, says Stephen Walker, RBC Capital Markets’ head of global mining research.“Shareholders have been asking companies to be more disciplined,” Walker said by phone Wednesday. “The ability to return a portion of excess capital to shareholders” is evidence of their improved cost performance, he said.(Updates with shares in fifth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Justina Vasquez in New York at jvasquez57@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven Frank, Joe RichterFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/barricks-dividend-boost-looks-harbinger-142616560.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-05	2019-11-05 17:13:42	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Newmont Sags Most in 9 Months After Cutting Gold-Output Forecast	(Bloomberg) -- Newmont Goldcorp Corp. fell the most since January as prices of the metal slid and the miner reduced its full-year production forecast amid glitches at assets acquired in its merger with Goldcorp Inc.Shares of the world’s largest gold-mining company fell 4.7% to $37.06 at 11:28 a.m. in New York. The stock dropped as much as 5.8%, the most intraday since Jan. 14. Bullion prices also weighed on shares, with the metal heading for its biggest loss in more than a month.Production is expected to be 6.3 million ounces in 2019, Newmont said in its third-quarter earnings statement on Tuesday. The miner had said last month it expects output of 6.5 million ounces. The outlook was affected by snags at Goldcorp assets, including blockades at the Penasquito mine in Mexico and a conveyor fire at Musselwhite in Canada.The projection may fuel investor concerns over the mega-merger. Chief Executive Officer Tom Palmer took the helm last month, inheriting a company saddled by growing pains as it integrates Goldcorp assets. Those challenges dragged Newmont’s adjusted second-quarter profit to just about half of what analysts were expecting.For the third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 36 cents a share, missing the average analyst estimate of 37 cents.“We are cautious on Newmont due to headwinds from asset integration of the underperforming Goldcorp assets, which we believe will outweigh positive news flow from potential synergies,” CIBC analysts including Anita Soni said in a note.&#92;--With assistance from Vinicy Chan.To contact the reporters on this story: Laura Millan Lombrana in Santiago at lmillan4@bloomberg.net;Aoyon Ashraf in Toronto at aashraf7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Joe RichterFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newmont-cuts-2019-gold-output-131241600.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-02	2019-10-02 23:00:00	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Newmont’s New CEO Plans to Dispense More Discipline Than Cash	(Bloomberg) -- Tom Palmer took the helm at the world’s largest gold miner shortly after bullion had its longest streak of quarterly gains since 2011. Now investors are looking to partake of that windfall.But before shareholders get their piece of the pie, the new chief executive officer at Newmont Goldcorp Corp. will have to face the challenge of melding the assets from the recently completed mega-merger with Goldcorp Inc.Newmont’s shares have trailed its peers, even with gold’s meteoric rise that took the metal to a six-year high of $1,557.11 an ounce last month. The stock’s rally this year is just less than a third of the pace of gains posted by its closest rival Barrick Gold Corp., which also sealed a massive merger deal.“Tom has to bring in the Goldcorp assets and get them up operating to a level that they expected,” Joe Foster, a portfolio manager and strategist at VanEck, said in a telephone interview. With “gold prices at $1,500, this company is going to be generating a lot of cash. I hope shareholders would see the benefits of that, with higher share prices and increasing dividends.”Palmer, 52, inherited the baton from Gary Goldberg for a company saddled by growing pains as it integrates Goldcorp assets, including Red Lake -- the project with the highest production cost in Newmont’s portfolio. Those challenges dragged Newmont’s adjusted second-quarter profit to just about half of what analysts were expecting.“Our focus is to deliver value from our Goldcorp assets through proven methodologies,” Palmer said in a phone interview on Tuesday, his first day on the job. “Newmont has proved itself to be a successful turnaround story, so we’re going to extract value from our existing portfolio based upon that track record.”Newmont has cut costs by more than a third from their peak in 2013 through early 2016, helping the company navigate through the bear market in gold and putting it in a better position to reap the gains from the ensuing rally in bullion prices.“Essentially the portfolio is ready,” John Bridges, a New York-based research analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said by phone. “All he has to do is to work through the cost-cutting at their existing operations and use the release of that cash to advance their various projects,” he said of Palmer, who spent two decades at Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-largest mining company, before joining Newmont.Foster of VanEck, the fourth-largest Newmont shareholder, is confident Palmer will be a good CEO. “It’s going to be a smooth transition,” Foster said. The portfolio manager is hopeful the company will deliver “not just a token dividend but something substantial with a yield of 2% to 4%.”In his first interview since assuming the role of CEO, Palmer said the priority for excess cash will be to maintain capital allocation discipline. That means the first focus will be paying down debt, then funding projects, and finally increasing dividends.Palmer has also been easing back from a plan to sell off assets any time soon. While the company said it would try to sell Red Lake, a mine in Canada, the new CEO has previously said he’s in “no rush” to proceed with the divestment of as much $1.5 billion in assets announced earlier in the year. On Tuesday, he said he plans to maintain flexibility in future M&A.Palmer may pursue tag-on acquisitions to optimize the portfolio or acquisitions adjacent to land they want to develop, JPMorgan’s Bridges said.The new CEO has seen the cycles turn. Born in Broken Hill, an inland mining city in New South Wales, Australia, Palmer’s parents, grandparents and great grandparents all worked in the mining industry, according to a Newmont presentation. His daughter, a mining engineer, is set to join the industry next year.Palmer was named Newmont’s chief operating officer in May 2016. Since the Goldcorp merger, he has played a central role in leading the Goldcorp integration, Newmont said last month, as well as the establishment of a joint venture with Barrick in Nevada.“Global uncertainty has made even the generalist investors wanting to have some gold exposure,” Bridges said. “They’re not gold specialists, they just want companies that give them gold exposure and don’t keep them up at night.”&#92;--With assistance from Aoyon Ashraf.To contact the reporters on this story: Vinicy Chan in New York at vchan91@bloomberg.net;Steven Frank in Toronto at sfrank9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newmont-ceo-plans-dispense-more-163938058.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-17	2019-09-17 23:00:00	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Pricey Gold Doesn’t Mean Fancy Food for Miners Meeting in Denver	(Bloomberg) -- Bullion may be trading near a six-year high, but gold-mining executives keen to show they’re conscientious on costs were munching on potato salad instead of oysters at this week’s industry gathering in Denver.As the chief executive officer of Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., Sean Boyd, put it: “A general theme of this conference has been the need to maintain discipline.”That sentiment was echoed in presentations, interviews and the general coffee-time chatter at the gold industry’s largest U.S. gathering of the year. There was little buzz when it came to deals, and most mining executives stressed they were making business decisions based on a gold price of $1,200 an ounce, even as the metal traded above $1,500.“The message to the mines isn’t ‘It’s open season now,”’ for ramping up output at all cost, Boyd said in a presentation at the Denver Gold Forum on Tuesday.Gold producers are putting into practice hard lessons learned during the metal’s last bull surge. Prices in the spot market reached a record $1,921.17 in 2011, but quickly started to collapse from the euphoria as gains in the equity market and economic growth meant the metal fell out of favor as a haven. By the end of 2015, prices had tumbled about 45%.In the meantime, mining companies started ramping up production during the rally, at times taking on high-capital projects. The subsequent price slump dismayed investors who have only been lured back after cost cutting, debt reduction and boosts in productivity.No PressureNow that bullion is back in favor, many miners are playing it safe. CEOs including Sebastien de Montessus of Endeavour Mining Corp. and Paul Rollinson of Kinross Gold Corp. emphasized they didn’t feel pressure to get into big-time mergers and acquisitions. Most executives speaking during presentations and interviews emphasized plans for organic growth and optimizing existing assets.Barrick Gold Corp. CEO Mark Bristow also said there wasn’t much deal chatter at the conference, while saying that consolidation would be good for the industry.To be sure, there does seem to be some deal interest when it comes to Chinese producers. China Gold International Resources Corp., the overseas arm of state-owned China National Gold Group, is on the hunt for acquisitions to replenish its pipeline, Jerry Xie, executive vice president, said in an interview. The company is comfortable making purchases with a price tag at roughly $1 billion to $2 billion, Xie said.Prudence PervadesThat seemed to be a rare exception. Even when it comes to selling, producers are cautious.Newmont Goldcorp Corp.’s incoming CEO Tom Palmer said he’s ready to sit tight on investments even if that means not reaching a previously announced goal of as much as $1.5 billion in asset sales after the company’s merger with Goldcorp.“We’re in no rush to sell anything,” Palmer said in an interview Tuesday at the Denver Gold Forum.In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Palmer said there hasn’t been much discussion of M&A at the conference. That runs counter to what some analysts were expecting before the conference. Newmont’s mega-merger with Goldcorp, along with Barrick’s purchase of Randgold Resources Ltd., helped drive M&A in the sector to $18.2 billion in 2019, the highest level in eight years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Now companies are turning their focus to “managing their businesses,” Palmer said.To contact the reporters on this story: Vinicy Chan in New York at vchan91@bloomberg.net;Millie Munshi in Denver at mmunshi@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Joe Richter, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pricey-gold-doesn-t-mean-230000094.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-09-17	2019-09-17 17:17:23	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Newmont’s Incoming CEO Says No ‘Fire Sale’ Coming for Assets	(Bloomberg) -- Newmont Goldcorp Corp. is ready to sit tight on asset sales, even if that means not reaching a previously announced goal of as much as $1.5 billion in divestments.That’s according to Tom Palmer, the company’s incoming chief executive officer. The world’s largest gold producer will be focusing on optimizing its current assets and is happy overall with its portfolio, other than a previously announced sale of Red Lake in Canada, he said.“We’re in no rush to sell anything,” Palmer said in an interview Tuesday at the Denver Gold Forum. “There will be no fire sale in Newmont Goldcorp.”That’s a change of tone. Outgoing CEO Gary Goldberg said earlier this month Newmont was still planning to divest up to $1.5 billion in assets following its $10 billion acquisition of rival Goldcorp in April, taking advantage of higher gold prices.On Tuesday, Palmer said the company was forging ahead with its planned sale of Red Lake, a former Goldcorp asset, and has fielded interest from about a dozen parties. He also said any additional sales would only come after careful study, and Newmont was ready to do more work to understand what value can be “extracted” from the assets.‘No Pressure’“There are assets that we are looking to optimize, and we’ll spend two to even three years to understand them,” he said. “There’s absolutely no pressure to sell assets to generate cash.”Newmont’s seeming step back from divestments fits an overall cautious tone at the Denver conference. Even with gold prices trading above $1,500 an ounce and reaching a six-year high earlier this month, in presentations and interviews mining executives have expressed a desire to be disciplined when it comes to deal making. Many, including Palmer, also stressed they’re still working to ensure their businesses can be profitable based on the assumption of a $1,200 gold price.Kalgoorlie SaleIn an interview with Bloomberg Television, Palmer said there hasn’t been much discussion of mergers and acquisitions at the Denver Gold Forum. That runs counter to what some analysts were expecting before the conference. Newmont’s mega-merger with Goldcorp along with Barrick Gold Corp.’s purchase of Randgold Resources Ltd. helped drive M&A in the sector to $18.2 billion in 2019, the highest level in eight years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Now companies are turning their focus to “managing their businesses,” Palmer said.Palmer said Newmont, which owns 50% of the Kalgoorlie Super Pit in Australia, wasn’t aware how much progress Barrick had made in its planned sale of its half of the mine.“We support them in terms of we’ll provide information as we’re the manager of the operation, but we’re not privy to the process they’re running,” Palmer said of Barrick’s planned sale.‘Compelling Value’Newmont would consider buying Barrick’s stake, and it would also be open to selling its half, as Barrick CEO Mark Bristow has suggested might make sense.“If we can get the other half at a right price, we’ll always be interested in buying,” Palmer said. “If someone comes to us with a compelling value, we’ll consider that,” he said of Kalgoorlie.“But apart from that, we are focused on optimizing and realizing its value,” and the company is also “happy” to work with a new partner, as they’ve done with Barrick, he said.Palmer will succeed Goldberg as CEO on Oct. 1. as part of a previously announced succession plan.‘Growing Our Margins’Palmer has played a central role in leading the Newmont-Goldcorp integration and the establishment of the joint venture with Barrick in Nevada, Newmont said in a statement last week. Palmer has a strong mining pedigree, but is less of a public figure than Barrick’s Bristow, whose colorful quotes have regularly established him as part of the news cycle. He and Bristow will need to cooperate as they implement a sweeping joint venture in Nevada.In terms of his mandate as CEO, Palmer said his first priority is “safety of our people.”“Second one for me, it’d be growing our margins, making sure we’re operating on our technical and financial discipline,” he said. “Third one is growing our reserves and resources through our exploration programs. Fourth, optimizing our project pipeline. The fifth one is to maintain our capital allocation discipline. If we are generating additional free cash because of gold prices, we may start paying down debts.”(Updates with comments from Palmer starting in third paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Vinicy Chan in New York at vchan91@bloomberg.net;Millie Munshi in Denver at mmunshi@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven Frank, Joe RichterFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newmont-incoming-ceo-says-no-171723429.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-16	2019-09-16 21:00:01	NEM	Newmont Corporation	China Gold Is Hunting for Deals Worth as Much as $2 Billion	(Bloomberg) -- China Gold International Resources Corp., the overseas arm of state-owned China National Gold Group, is on the hunt for acquisitions to replenish its pipeline as deal-making in the sector heats up thanks to a jump in the metal’s price.“We need more pipeline, especially in gold production,” Jerry Xie, executive vice president, said in an interview on the sidelines of the Denver Gold Forum on Monday. “We’re currently looking for acquisition opportunities quite aggressively. We’re doing this on behalf of our parent company, not just for ourselves.”The miner, listed both in Canada and Hong Kong, is targeting companies with assets in operational stages that have ramp-up plans. The company is comfortable making purchases with a price tag at roughly $1 billion to $2 billion, Xie said.The company is open to studying potential acquisitions of single-asset companies with mines near production, he said. It is also interested in possible asset sales that may come from Barrick Gold Corp. and Newmont Goldcorp Corp., which both have plans to divest after recent mega-mergers.Gold is near a six-year high, and industry shares are up about 60% in the past 12 months.

2019-09-15	2019-09-15 21:00:00	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Gold’s Potent Mix of Low Reserves, High Prices Seen Driving M&A	(Bloomberg) -- Executives headed to the Denver Gold Forum a year ago were hit with a startling bit of news as they stepped off their planes: A merger made public that afternoon was set to create the world’s biggest gold company.Now, a year after Barrick Gold Corp. agreed to buy Randgold Resources Ltd., and in the wake of a second huge megamerger, executives are once again traveling to the Denver meeting, which opens Sunday. Only this time, the industry will be watching to see if mid-tier miners concerned about losing out to larger rivals are ready to jump into the M&A game.Gold is near a six-year high, and industry shares are up about 60% in the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the amount of gold reserves still buried in mines is down by more than half from a 2011 peak. It’s a potent mix that may push miners toward consolidation over expansion for growth.“M&A can trigger a game of musical chairs,” said Matthew Hind, global co-head of metals and mining investment banking for Credit Suisse Group AG. “When one transaction happens and is well-received, there is a tendency for others to want to try and find their partner, nobody wants to miss out.”Acquisitions of gold producers have already jumped to $18.2 billion this year, the highest level in eight years, driven by the Barrick-Randgold merger and Newmont’s $10 billion purchase of Goldcorp Inc. this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, the long-term outlook for gold prices remains bullish, with Citigroup Inc. seeing potential for a record above $2,000 an ounce in the next two years.“There will be depletion in gold reserves,” Newmont Chief Executive Officer Gary Goldberg said in a telephone interview. “At the same time, you have demand growing in India and China. So from a supply-demand standpoint, you’ll see good opportunity.”A year ago, executives heading to the Denver Gold Forum were facing a much different situation. Bullion had slipped more than 7% in the year leading up to the meeting, and an expanding global economy diminished demand for the metal as a haven. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index of 30 companies was down about 22%.Much of the discussion at this year’s meeting is likely to center on mergers and acquisitions. Credit Suisse’s Hind, for one, said he sees consolidation becoming a major industry factor in the next 12 to 18 months, with the mid-tier miners starting to play catch-up.Among gold producers, Canada’s Guyana Goldfields Inc. is exploring options including a potential sale of its business, Bloomberg News has reported last month. China National Gold Group Corp., the country’s second-largest gold miner, is also studying a bid for a stake in Canada’s Iamgold Corp., people with knowledge of the matter said in June.New Gold Inc., Pretium Resources Inc., TMAC Resources Inc. and Wesdome Gold Mines Ltd. are potential targets for Australian miners looking to expand in Canada through acquisition, BMO analyst Brian Quast wrote in May.“There’s a natural tendency for gold miners to consolidate, as most of them failed to invest for the future” by expanding their mining activities, Barrick Gold Corp. CEO Mark Bristow said in an August interview in Toronto.Meanwhile, the two megamergers are also expected to provide smaller rivals the opportunity to snap up assets.Barrick is targeting $1.5 billion of asset sales by end of next year and is engaged in selling its 50% stake in the Kalgoorlie mine in Australia, Bristow said. It’s also weighing a sale of its Tongon Gold mine in the Ivory Coast, people familiar with the matter said in August.Asset SalesNewmont completed its $10 billion acquisition of rival Goldcorp in April. It too is planning to divest up to $1.5 billion in assets, taking advantage of the higher gold price, Goldberg said by phone.Assets up for potential sale include Red Lake in Canada, Newmont said Friday in a statement. Some operations at the mine were paused temporarily earlier this year to do work to protect workers in the event water entered the mine. In July, CEO Goldberg had said the company needed to do more exploration at Red Lake before deciding if it would sell.Meanwhile, gold producers nowadays are also competing for attention from a smaller group of more passive investors who tend to put money in tracker funds, or index-related investments.“There’s a need for consolidation as companies need to be larger to stay relevant to a shrinking pool of investors,” Richard Tory, global head of metals and mining investment banking at Morgan Stanley, said in a separate interview.&#92;--With assistance from Danielle Bochove, David Stringer and Joe Richter.To contact the reporter on this story: Vinicy Chan in New York at vchan91@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Reg Gale, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-potent-mix-low-reserves-210000075.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-10	2019-09-10 19:00:14	NEM	Newmont Corporation	A Forgotten Gold-Rush Hub Is Producing More Than It Has in a Century	(Bloomberg) -- Deep under gum-tree lined paddocks in southern Australia that delivered a bullion bonanza in the 19th Century, the unexpected promise of a second gold rush is luring a new generation of prospectors from billionaires to global miners and weekend panhandlers.As prices soar, production in the goldfields of Victoria state is rising again and has already climbed to the highest since 1914 as mining companies dig deeper and new technology helps to uncover once hidden and richer deposits in a region that almost rivaled the Californian gold rush and was thought to have petered out decades ago.“I’ve never seen anything like it in all my life — it’s like finding a safe underground,” David Baker, managing partner of gold investor Baker Steel Capital Managers LLP, and a visitor to mines for more than 30 years, said following a tour last month of Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd.’s Fosterville mine, the flagship for the region’s revival. “You don’t get better than that unless you can dig into Fort Knox.” With Victoria’s state government forecasting there may be as much as another 80 million ounces buried underground in the region —about as much as was dug out during the initial gold rush from 1851 — major players are moving in, including Newmont Goldcorp Corp. and billionaire miner Gina Rinehart.The region’s renaissance is also stoking hopes that new exploration of other historic global mining hubs could yet yield more riches.A thirty minute drive east of Bendigo, a city of elegant Victorian-era civic buildings built with the proceeds of the first gold rush, Kirkland has transformed its underground mine into one of the world’s most profitable gold operations.In a section of tunnel about 1.2 kilometers (0.75 miles) below surface, a thick diagonal white vein of gold-bearing quartz stretches across a face of dark gray rock, and fragments of ore scattered on the floor are studded with visible, glittering flecks of the metal.Delving deeper into the earth to tap this different and more concentrated source of the metal has dramatically shifted Fosterville’s fortunes. The site was first mined for about a decade from 1894 and then sporadically over the next century, before an underground mine was opened in 2006. “The better gold mines reveal themselves over time,” said Sydney-based Baker, a manager of the BakerSteel Precious Metal Fund, which holds about $450 million of assets, including Kirkland shares. Fosterville has shown “that it is actually a fantastic jewelry box, and one that’s only getting better,” he said.When valuing projects, miners estimate both the volume of remaining metal at an operation that’s economic to extract — the asset’s reserves — and the grade of the material, the amount of precious metal contained in each ton of excavated rock.Fosterville’s reserve grade, which had hovered at around 5 grams of gold per ton, began to rise through 2014 and 2015, and then surged from the end of 2016, when Kirkland completed about a C$1 billion ($756 million) acquisition of the site’s previous owner.At the end of last year, that grade was estimated at 31 grams a ton, among the highest in the world, and probably bettered only by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.’s Hishikari operation in Japan, according to Quinton Hennigh, a veteran gold executive and geologist who helped to review the Australian site before Kirkland’s 2016 deal.Improved grades have helped boost output to a record and spurred profits along with a rising gold price. Kirkland’s earnings from the operation more than doubled in the first half of 2019, according to a July filing.Toronto-based Kirkland, which also operates mines in Canada, is growing confident it can unlock further high-grade zones underground at Fosterville, and already has had encouraging results close to the current mining area and as far as about four kilometers away.“There’s something more broad and pervasive at play,” Ian Holland, Kirkland’s vice president for Australian operations said in an interview at the site. “Significant drilling programs will unlock that over time, that’s the truly exciting piece.”Others projects are also offering glimpses of potential. Gold Exploration Victoria Pty, a unit of Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting Pty, is partnering with explorer Catalyst Metals Ltd. on exploration around Bendigo that has shown early indications of high-grade gold finds.Two historic mines in Victoria have resumed production since 2018, while Newmont has applied for an exploration tenement in the state, the company said in an emailed statement. Before the end of the year, Victoria’s government will launch an international tender for newly released exploration ground with similar geology to Fosterville, Minister for Resources Jaclyn Symes said.Modern exploration techniques — like airborne electromagnetics and geochemistry — are helping miners globally to locate troves of metals buried deeper underground, and often beneath the cover of other rocks.In the U.S., Nevada Exploration Inc. is using techniques including the sampling of groundwater to locate new gold deposits in a heartland of production. Companies including Australia’s Newcrest Mining Ltd. are also combing back over historic regions in Nevada.Other established mining centers in the U.S. and Western Australia hold similar potential to deliver more gold from deeper underground, according to Hennigh, president of Novo Resources Corp. “There are certain gold camps that I see, where there are the telltale signs of there being a heck of a lot more,” he said. “There will be more discoveries without question.”  To contact the author of this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Keith GosmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forgotten-gold-rush-hub-producing-190014419.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-30	2019-08-30 14:52:57	NEM	Newmont Corporation	8 Precious Metals Stocks to Mine For	Precious metals stocks have been on fire over the last few months, and you don't have to dig deep to know why. Essentially, investments like gold and silver represent safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty or turmoil. With the raging U.S.-China trade war, along with multiple geopolitical flashpoints, there's plenty of both descriptors to go around.Primarily, one of the biggest catalysts for precious metals stocks to buy is the inversion of the yield curve. Specifically, the yield for the longer-maturing 10-year Treasuries dipped below the yield of the shorter-maturing 2-year Treasuries. Therefore, what we have is a nonsensical economic condition: a riskier (based on time exposure) asset offers less reward than a more stable or predictable one.That kind of circumstance invites investor fears, which is bullish for precious metals stocks to buy. However, what could really send this commodities sub-segment to the moon is the Federal Reserve's response.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNaturally, the central bankers don't want this circumstance to continue; otherwise, no one in their right minds would buy 10-year Treasuries. First on the Fed's agenda is to flatten the yield curve. And at this point, that can only be accomplished by cutting benchmark interest rates further. Theoretically, this should drive down the 2-year Treasures' yield below the 10-year bonds.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow But will this work? I'm not a central banker so I'm not an expert on this topic. But what I do know is that such actions are inflationary. And based on the present fiscal and economic circumstances, this is the only lever the Fed can pull.In layman's terms, gold and similar commodities will moon. Thus, here are eight precious metal stocks to consider. Barrick Gold (GOLD)Source: Shutterstock Precious metal stocks such as Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) have certain risks that the underlying physical bullion markets do not; namely, the human element. Therefore, it pays when loading up on commodities-based stocks to buy to consider a heavier allocation toward established, stable names. With a long history and a market capitalization nearing $34 billion, GOLD stock certainly qualifies.Aside from its sheer size, what I like about Barrick is its quality of international exposure. Although geopolitical risks in their African projects exist, for the most part, the mining company is exposed to stable administrations. We're talking names like Canada, Chile, Australia, and the U.S.Plus, GOLD stock is bringing home the goods for stakeholders. On a year-to-date basis, shares have jumped over 46%. And since the beginning of June, they're up 51%.Ordinarily, I'd avoid such technically hot assets. However, GOLD stock is likely riding on unprecedented series of fundamental tailwinds. Newmont Goldcorp (NEM)Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock Many investors understandably avoid precious metals stocks because of the reputation of speculative mining projects. But like any sector, it's the quality of the individual company that matters. And with Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM), you have the provenance of nearly a century of experience. Thus, even if we see the return of a bear market in the metals, NEM stock will probably stick around.But I'm almost certain that such pessimism is far out into the future. For the near-to-intermediate term, Newmont Goldcorp should attract significant investor dollars. On a YTD basis, NEM stock has gained over 16%. That may not sound like much until you consider that since the beginning of May, shares have jumped nearly 35%.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off Moving forward, I see strong gains ahead despite the already impressive performance. The majority of Newmont Goldcorp's projects are located in the stable regions of North America and Australia. Four projects are in South America, while only two are levered to Africa. Therefore, even if geopolitics rears its ugly head, NEM stock should find significant insulation. Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM)Another top name to add to your list of precious metals stocks to buy is Agnico Eagles Mines (NYSE:AEM). While some of the top-tier miners have some exposure to geopolitical risks, AEM stock is arguably almost completely insulated. I say this because Agnico Eagles has mining projects only in Canada, Finland, and Mexico. None of these countries strike me as dangerously unstable.But what really stands out about AEM stock is that the underlying company does not engage in forward gold sales. Forward sales are commonly used in sectors like commodities to help businesses predictably flatten the target assets' volatility. However, with Agnico Eagle, the eschewing of forward gold sales is a long-standing policy. Thus, buying AEM stock gives you full exposure to the gold spot price.In prior years, that was a raw deal. But at this juncture, this is exactly what you want. Already, the gold price has shot up over $1,550. Just a couple months ago, it was under $1,300. And with nothing indicating a headwind to this run, AEM stock gives you cheap exposure to the yellow metal. Royal Gold (RGLD)Although it's an incredibly hot name right now, Royal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD) is an interesting play. And in my opinion, RGLD stock still has significant upside remaining.Most precious metals stocks to buy in the mining sector are risky because of the unknown. This is especially true for companies specializing in gold exploration: sometimes you hit pay dirt, and sometimes you don't. Because of the unpredictability involved, these investments can be incredibly volatile. But with RGLD stock, the underlying company mitigates the wildness through its streaming business model.Instead of actively mining for metals, Royal Gold instead has streaming and royalty agreements with miners. Typically, a company like Royal Gold will pay an upfront fee in exchange for future deliveries of a particular asset.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income Because of this inherent risk mitigation, RGLD stock has outperformed many other physical mining-centric organizations. For instance, on a YTD basis, RGLD shares have skyrocketed nearly 61%. With bullion markets likely headed higher, Royal Gold might still be a bargain. Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM)If you're looking to precious metals stocks for protection in the markets, it's natural to only focus on gold. However, as my sit-down with commodities expert David Morgan illustrates, silver has tremendous potential right now. As proof, since my interview with the godfather of silver investing, the target metal has shot up over 18%.Of course, the silver spot price is more volatile than gold. But if you want exposure to this exciting metal but with some risk mitigation, consider Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM). Formerly known as Silver Wheaton, WPM stock is no longer just a pure-play silver equity. However, the company still enjoys one of the biggest silver streaming businesses in the world.As I mentioned above for Royal Gold, WPM stock is intriguing for this streaming model. Unlike every other mining outfit, Wheaton doesn't have the associated onerous overhead costs. Management knows what their outlays are because they are negotiated ahead of time. That's a huge plus for WPM stock because pure miners operate under a cloud of uncertainty. First Majestic Silver (AG)Source: Shutterstock In my view, silver is the cryptocurrency of precious metals stocks to buy. Although it has the same monetary fundamentals as gold - silver was at one point &quot;real money&quot; - it also seems to have a mind of its own. Nevertheless, for me, the outsized potential for silver is enough to accept the risks. If you have a similar mindset, you should take a look at First Majestic Silver (NYSE:AG) and AG stock.For starters, First Majestic Silver lives up to the hype of precious metals stocks levered to the white metal. Since January's opening price, AG stock has soared over 91%. And since the beginning of August, First Majestic shares have popped up over 14%.As I've mentioned with the other sector players, I don't like to engage such strong momentum. But I keep going back to the Federal Reserve's inability to do anything but cut interest rates. That's inflationary for gold and should be exponentially so for silver.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week Finally, on a fundamental note, First Majestic primarily focuses on Mexico's mining market. Close to home and a vital U.S. trading partner, I don't foresee major problems there. Therefore, AG stock also provides some measure of geopolitical insulation. Sibanye Gold (SBGL)Source: Money Metals via FlickrSibanye Gold (NYSE:SBGL) has significant operations in South Africa, which is both a blessing and a curse. Obviously, South Africa is exceptionally endowed with natural resources, including multiple robust gold mines. That naturally bodes well for SBGL stock. But on the flipside, the country's class and race dynamics have caused substantial conflicts, including mining-related labor strikes.Recently, such strikes over job losses and pay cuts have negatively impacted Sibanye Gold. As a result, SBGL stock hasn't seen the explosive returns that other precious metals stocks have witnessed over the past few weeks. Nevertheless, Sibanye has serious potential, as judged by its explosive YTD return of over 110%.Now, you might say that among this sector's stocks to buy, superior options exist. However, very few companies have the kind of robust exposure to the other precious metals, platinum and palladium. In particular, palladium is an incredibly rare commodity and Sibanye is the world's second-largest producer of it. Thus, I like my chances with SBGL stock. Norilsk Nickel PJSC (NILSY)Source: Shutterstock I'm going to be completely blunt: Norilsk Nickel PJSC (OTCMKTS:NILSY) is a ridiculously speculative name among precious metals stocks. Therefore, I wouldn't buy NILSY stock unless you fully understand that you're taking a gamble. Even then, I wouldn't allocate all of my &quot;stupid&quot; money on Norilsk.With these caveats out of the way, I'm still very intrigued with the potential upside opportunity in NILSY stock. Russia has the largest stockpile of palladium in the world. As such, Norilsk Nickel is the world's top producer of this rare commodity.Why am I so big on palladium? First, it's incredibly rare. Up until recently, one troy ounce of palladium was worth more than the equivalent size of gold. And while the yellow metal is on a run due to global economic fears, palladium still has a chance to regain its crown.That brings me to my second point: palladium has multiple uses and should be a relevant commodity in the 21st century. The metal is both resilient to atmospheric influences and is extremely ductile. These properties lend themselves to high-tech usage, which is why I'm even considering NILSY stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long the physical precious metals mentioned in this story.

2019-08-13	2019-08-13 00:00:00	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Barrick Gold CEO Eyes Massive Retrofit Through M&A, Partnerships	(Bloomberg) -- Eight months into his job, Barrick Gold Corp. CEO Mark Bristow is shopping, selling and negotiating his way through a complex portfolio of assets in a massive retrofit of the global miner.The chief executive officer of the world’s second-largest gold producer is pushing ahead with plans to sell about $1.5 billion in assets by the end of next year, while looking to buy more top-tier gold projects, in Canada and elsewhere, and invest in copper assets.After reporting positive second-quarter earnings, Bristow also flagged the possibility Newmont Goldcorp Corp., its partner in the Kalgoorlie open-pit gold mine, may be swayed to join Barrick in selling the entire Australian asset.“KCGM is for sale, straight up, we put the sign out,” Bristow said of its 50% stake in Kalgoorlie after Barrick released its second-quarter earnings statement. “Gary said to me, depending on the price he’ll sell it, buy it or partner it,” Bristow said, referring to Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg.“We would consider transactions to consolidate or divest our interest in KCGM under the right valuation terms,” Omar Jabara, a spokesman for Newmont, said by email. “Beyond that we are not able to speculate.”‘No Shortage’Goldberg has said he’d be interested in buying Barrick’s half of Kalgoorlie at the right price. During Monday’s interview, Bristow said Northern Star Resources Ltd. is “one of the front-runners” among companies that have expressed interest in Barrick’s stake.“We’ve got no shortage of interest in that asset -- it’s an icon in the gold industry,” Bristow said in an interview Monday, referring to Kalgoorlie. Barrick has engaged with Goldberg and “he needs to decide,” Bristow said.Barrick shares climbed as much as 2.9% in New York trading Monday after reporting that second-quarter revenue climbed 21% and costs this year will be at the lower end of forecasts. The company’s shares later closed 0.9% lower, trimming this year’s gain to 33%, still almost double the pace of bullion.Among countries targeted for deals, Barrick is keen to buy more mines in Canada and is actively looking for opportunities. “We’re under-invested in Canada: watch this space,” he said. “We don’t want to buy companies; we’re after assets.”To contact the reporters on this story: Danielle Bochove in Toronto at dbochove1@bloomberg.net;Vinicy Chan in Hong Kong at vchan91@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/barrick-gold-ceo-eyes-massive-000000419.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-07	2019-08-07 18:44:08	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Gold Tops $1,500 as Investors Seek Shelter From Gathering Storm	(Bloomberg) -- Gold futures rallied above $1,500 an ounce on sustained demand for the traditional haven as the U.S.-China trade war festers, global growth slows and central banks around the world ease monetary policy.The metal advanced as much as 2.6% an ounce on the Comex to the highest since 2013. The move extends this year’s climb to 19%, with gains underpinned by inflows into exchange-traded funds and central bank purchases. China’s central bank expanded its gold reserves for an eighth straight month in July.Gold has been one of the chief beneficiaries of the turmoil in global financial markets as Washington and Beijing spar over trade. In recent days, the Trump administration threatened fresh tariffs against Chinese goods, the yuan was allowed to sink, and the U.S. branded China a currency manipulator. The stand-off has boosted the odds of more easing from the Federal Reserve. Mounting “growth worries,” prompted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to predict prices will climb to $1,600 an ounce over the next six months.“Gold is serving its traditional role as a safe-haven asset,” said Wayne Gordon, executive director for commodities and foreign exchange at UBS Group AG’s wealth management unit. Under the bank’s risk case, marked by a further escalation of the trade fight, prices could go as high as $1,600, he said.Futures for December delivery rose 2.4% to settle at $1,519.60 an ounce at 1:30 p.m. in New York, gaining for a fourth day. Silver also surged, with futures climbing above $17 for the first time since June 2018.Miners also benefited from the rally, with AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. rising 4.8% to its highest price in more than seven years. Kinross Gold Corp., Barrick Gold Corp. and Newmont Goldcorp Corp. also soared.Lower RatesLast month, the Fed reduced borrowing costs for the first time in more than a decade, responding in part to the impact of the trade war. Lower rates boost the appeal of non-interest-bearing bullion.On Wednesday, New Zealand’s Reserve Bank shocked markets with a half-percentage point interest-rate reduction, while India’s central bank also delivered a bigger-than-expected move. Those cuts were followed by the Bank of Thailand unexpectedly lowering its benchmark interest rate for the first time in more than four years.The latest ructions have sent investors rushing to havens, pushing the world’s stockpile of negative-yielding bonds to a record, with the market value of the Bloomberg Barclays Global Negative Yielding Debt Index closing at $15.01 trillion Monday. The yield on 10-year Treasuries has tumbled.Bullion has plenty of fans among veteran investors. Mark Mobius said in July prices were poised to top $1,500 as interest rates headed lower, declaring: “I love gold.” Billionaire hedge-fund manager Ray Dalio has suggested the market may just be at the start of a period that would be very positive for gold.In addition to the challenges thrown up by the trade war, there are other risks. In Europe, investors are tracking the chances of a no-deal Brexit later this year, while there are tensions in the Middle East between Iran and the U.S.Further support for the rally has come from central-bank buying, with authorities in China, Russia, Poland and Kazakhstan all boosting holdings. That trend shows no sign of slowing, with the People’s Bank of China adding almost 10 tons to reserves in July.“We see the ongoing steep rise in the gold price as an expression of the high risk aversion among market participants,” said Daniel Briesemann, an analyst at Commerzbank AG. “Gold is quite clearly still in demand as a safe haven in the current market environment, as reflected, among other things, in continuing ETF inflows. ”&#92;--With assistance from Krystal Chia.To contact the reporters on this story: Ranjeetha Pakiam in Singapore at rpakiam@bloomberg.net;Rupert Rowling in London at rrowling@bloomberg.net;Justina Vasquez in New York at jvasquez57@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Phoebe Sedgman at psedgman2@bloomberg.net, ;Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Jake Lloyd-Smith, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-approaches-1-500-investors-002916725.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-26	2019-07-26 00:00:00	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Mega-Merger Hurdles Hit Profit at World’s Largest Gold Miner	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s largest gold miner is experiencing some growing pains as it tries to integrate a slew of new assets from its recently completed mega-merger.Newmont Goldcorp Corp.’s shares fell after it posted an adjusted profit that was about half what analysts were expecting in a messy second quarter that included its merger with Goldcorp Inc. and the start of a new joint venture with rival Barrick Gold Corp. in Nevada.Although there have been “no surprises” in the acquired Goldcorp assets, underinvestment has been an issue throughout the portfolio, Newmont President Tom Palmer told analysts Thursday on an earnings call. “There was not the work done on exploration, there wasn’t the work done on development, and that’s absolutely fundamental in either an open pit or an underground mine.”While Newmont is bringing technical rigor and discipline to the newly acquired mines, optimizing them will take time, said Palmer, who is slated to take over as Newmont’s chief executive officer on Oct. 1. “It’s going to take us 24 to 36 months to really get those assets performing to the level that we’d expect, but the underlying infrastructure, the underlying ore bodies, are really good,” he said in a phone interview.In its earnings statement, the Greenwood Village, Colorado-based company cited a number of cost pressures that eroded earnings, including:Integration costs associated with the Goldcorp merger and the Nevada JVHigher costs due to shutdowns at two mines acquired in the Goldcorp deal, Penasquito and MusselwhiteHigher sustaining capital investments for the Goldcorp assetsHigher spending for growth projectsIn April, Newmont warned that a serious fire at the Musselwhite mine in Canada at the end of the first quarter could affect guidance. The blaze affected the full 2.5-kilometer (1.6-mile) length of the conveyor system, Palmer said on the call. Meanwhile, a blockade at the Penasquito mine in Mexico in the second quarter lowered production and hiked costs, Newmont said in the statement.‘Very Confident’Newmont now expects consolidated production of 165,000 ounces of gold from Penasquito in 2019. Last year, the mine produced 272,000 ounces of gold for Goldcorp. Newmont is forecasting zero production at Musselwhite this year and doesn’t expect the mine to be fully operational until mid-2020. In 2018, it produced 205,000 ounces of gold.The company said its full-year gold production will be 6.5 million ounces, which compares with a June forecast for 7 million ounces in 2019 and 7.4 million in 2020. The company is “very confident” it can achieve that guidance, Palmer said, noting that guidance for next year will be provided in December.The lack of clarity about next year could worry investors, Anita Soni, an analyst with CIBC World Markets, said in a research note. “No further 2020 outlook was provided, which will likely be an overhang on the stock given the uncertainty surrounding the production profile for the recently acquired Goldcorp assets,” she said.Shares DropNewmont fell 2.7% to $38.25 on Wednesday in New York, reducing its year-to-date gain to 10%.Outgoing CEO Gary Goldberg said the company is still planning to divest $1 billion to $1.5 billion worth of assets as it optimizes its new portfolio but doesn’t have a timeline for the sales.“We’ve had lots of expressions of interest in a variety of things, many of which don’t fit the category of things we’d like to sell -- so the answer is pretty quick on those,” he said in a phone interview.The company is planning to keep the Penasquito, Cerro Negro, Musselwhite and Eleonore mines, he said, but needs to gather more information -- especially around exploration potential -- before deciding what it might sell. Some smaller exploration assets could be sold “sooner rather than later,” Goldberg said.There is potential for enormous long-term value from four potentially multibillion-dollar projects: NuevaUnion, Norte Abierto, Galore Creek and Yanacocha, Palmer said. “And then we’ve got a whole bunch of other medium-sized projects that sit alongside them.”As the company integrates the two portfolios, and works with Barrick on a joint venture in Nevada, it needs to make sure it manages execution risk and capital spending risk, he said.“We need to step back and look at our project pipeline and make sure we are prioritizing and sequencing those projects for the long term,” Palmer said.In the wake of the merger, Newmont said in a presentation its rationalization of Goldcorp’s former head office in Vancouver had saved it $40 million in labor costs so far, as well as $10 million in “non-labor synergies.”A company spokesman said the Vancouver headcount is shrinking from 174 to a range of 140 to 150, with most of cuts comprised of former Goldcorp executives, accounting for the $40 million.“There’s lots of other external services that you no longer use because you’re no longer a headquarters, so you’re starting to see that flow through,” Palmer said in the phone interview.&#92;--With assistance from Aoyon Ashraf.To contact the reporter on this story: Danielle Bochove in Toronto at dbochove1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven Frank, Joe CarrollFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mega-merger-hurdles-hit-profit-161013833.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-08	2019-07-08 17:44:47	NEM	Newmont Corporation	If You Like Gold Stocks Now, Don’t Sweat the Pessimistic Headlines	A strong five-week rally by gold stocks and related ETFs like the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:GLD) hit a wall two weeks ago, but it was completely reversed this past week. As it turns out, the Federal Reserve is more or less happy with where interest rates are right now, and the strong June jobs report has quashed inflation worries for now, buying the FOMC some more time.Source: Shutterstock GLD has fallen 3% from its late-June peak, while leading gold stocks like Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) and Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM) have suffered similar setbacks. In short, the buying that sent gold prices up 30% beginning in early May appears to have been mistimed.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 Before jumping to conclusions that this is just another false start for gold stocks though -- extending a multi-year streak of false starts -- it would be wise to take a step back and digest another stark reality about the use of gold as a hedge against any sort of financial difficulties. The reality is that, for better or worse, gold never actually behaves as it's &quot;supposed to.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, charts tend to lead views on gold rather than the other way around. Reality CheckGold is allegedly a hedge against inflation. It's also a safe haven against currency turbulence. It's also a preferred holding during economic lulls. And gold prices as well as gold stocks are often viewed as a beneficiary of falling interest rates.Finally, gold prices are expected to rise when the U.S. dollar loses value.All of these moving parts result in one overarching reality: Speculating on gold is mostly a coin toss.That's not a truth a wide swath of gold pundits agree with, though that doesn't change the facts of the matter. Specifically, the presumed relationship between interest rates and gold prices doesn't hold up. Neither does the relationship between gold and inflation. As a result, since interest rates and inflation also impact the actual value of currency, the correlation between gold and the U.S. dollar is wobbly at best.The idea of using gold as a currency hedge may hold some water, though the volatility of exchange rates can be difficult if not impossible to successfully handicap.None of this means that the basic underpinnings of all the aforementioned relationships don't hold any water. They do. I'm simply pointing out that many of the underpinnings are also impacted in unpredictable ways -- often in opposing ways -- by one or more of the other drivers of gold prices.But gold prices are still impacted primarily by speculation.Speculation controlled gold prices between 2010 and 2012, when inflation remained tame and interest rates were steady. The value of the dollar was relatively weak at the time, too, but it was also holding steady, even as gold and gold stocks soared on the presumption that the greenback would lose more value.It didn't.The failure of those factors to ever fully justify the large jump in gold prices ultimately set the stage for a big price pullback by GLD and gold stocks in 2013 and 2014. The U.S. dollar was on the mend at that point, but not to the degree suggested by the gold selloff. The Outlook of GLD and Gold StocksDon't misread my message. While the recent gold rally was thwarted by new perceptions that a rate cut isn't a foregone conclusion and the increasingly clear message that inflation isn't an issue just yet, the rebound efforts could be rekindled.The key is the shape of the chart.Based on the chart of GLD, one can see that the peak from two weeks back may have been destiny anyway. GLD's recent high near $135.50 more or less lines up with peaks from mid-2017 and early 2018.  Click to EnlargeAlso note that since the late-2015 low, gold prices have managed to log a string of higher lows. Big swings between the technical floor and ceiling have been the norm, though.And those big swings haven't necessarily been in conjunction with the appropriate changes in interest rates, the dollar's value, or inflation. Assumption and speculation have continued to be responsible for most of the movement of the prices of gold stocks and of GLD.That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. Right or wrong, speculators tend to move in rather predictable patterns that become visibly evident on a chart.In this case, a slide back to the floor near the $114 area wouldn't be out of character for GLD, while a break above the recently-conformed ceiling near $136 would likely spark a melt up. Even if such a bullish thrust is in the cards though, it's unlikely to take shape without a small setback first, which will give the bulls the opportunity for another running start to punch through that resistance.Little to none of that action, of course, will actually have anything to do with the things traders like to pretend control GLD and gold stocks.In other words, if your gut is at odds with the rhetoric, don't be afraid to trust your gut.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The company aims to kick off a formal sale process shortly for part or all of its stake, the people said.Barrick is targeting $1.5 billion in asset sales through 2020 following the company’s $5.4 billion takeover of Randgold completed in January. The gold mining industry is consolidating quickly, and the biggest producers have been selling off smaller, unwanted assets as they merge.Acquisitions of gold miners are up nearly sixfold over the last 12 months to about $27 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. No final decisions have been made, and there’s no certainty the deliberations will lead to a sale of the Massawa project, the people said.A spokeswoman for Barrick declined to comment.Barrick owns about 83% of the Massawa project, according to its website. The asset is located in eastern Senegal, about 700 kilometers (435 miles) southeast of the capital city of Dakar.Massawa is an an example of a project where Barrick could sell part of its stake to another miner operating nearby, Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said in a May interview. Other companies in the area include Toronto-listed Teranga Gold Corp. and closely held Toro Gold Ltd., Bristow said.Barrick walked away from a nearly $18 billion bid for Newmont Mining Corp. earlier this year, opting instead for a joint venture around the two companies’ Nevada mining assets. Newmont in April agreed to buy Goldcorp Inc. in a deal valued at $10 billion, becoming Newmont Goldcorp Corp. in the largest takeover of its kind.&#92;--With assistance from Danielle Bochove and Doug Alexander.To contact the reporter on this story: Dinesh Nair in London at dnair5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Aaron Kirchfeld at akirchfeld@bloomberg.net, Amy Thomson, Ben ScentFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/barrick-prepares-start-sale-massawa-172748689.html?.tsrc=rss

Yes, some folks may have abandoned gold in favor of digital gold -- bitcoin has surged several hundred percent recently. But the world's favorite precious metal is sparkling again too. Recently, the price of gold topped $1,400/oz, marking its highest level in more than five years. Gold's move has come with surprising speed as well, it's up nearly 10% over the past month.Not surprisingly, with gold surging, investors are starting to come back to a long dormant group of companies: mining stocks. Now, to be fair, most of these gold stocks are rightly ignored. As the famous adage goes, a gold mine is a hole in the ground with a liar at the top. That's true of far too many small prospecting companies.Incredibly, over the past 10 years, even with the price of gold up overall, mining stocks have gotten wrecked. The main sector ETF, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) has lost nearly half its value over the past decade. Meanwhile, the more speculative smaller gold companies fund, VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDXJ) has lost a catastrophic 67% of its value. Again, that's during a time when the price of gold went up on net, and stocks in general soared.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer That means that it is most important to stick to quality operations when picking your gold stocks. Unlike many sectors, mediocrity generally isn't enough to drive positive performance in gold, even if the overall conditions are relatively decent. With all that in mind, what should you buy and what should avoid as gold stocks take off again? Barrick Gold (GOLD)Source: (C)iStock.com/TomasSereda One good rule for buying into an unloved sector is to buy one of the industry leaders, as long as it has a decent balance sheet. Newmont (NYSE:NEM) has been in a terrible funk since it made its questionable purchase of Goldcorp. Newmont stock has barely moved since the gold stock rally got going. That leaves Barrick Gold  (NYSE:GOLD) as the next best option. With its $30 billion market cap and operations spanning many countries, Barrick is one of the world's leading diversified miners.In fact, by at least one metric, Barrick is the world's powerhouse gold mining firm. It has five of the world's ten Tier 1 mines --  defined as a mine that produces 500,000 ounces or more per year, has 10+ years of reserves left, and operates at or below the median global cost of mining. This huge number of long-life world class assets ensures the Barrick is here to stay. Regardless of where the price of gold goes, Barrick will be mining lots of gold -- profitably -- for many years to come.The company has a lot to offer investors in 2019 specifically, as well. In its first quarter, for example, Barrick showed nice leverage to the price of gold despite it having lower-cost mining operations. For the quarter, Barrick managed to boost cash from operations 27% while doubling earnings as gold production rose 8%. That's some solid results. At $16/share, GOLD stock is still well short of the $22 level it hit in 2016 on the last wave of gold stocks momentum. If gold can keep its momentum, GOLD stock should be able to revisit $22 in a hurry. Gold Stocks To Buy: Franco-Nevada (FNV)Source: Shutterstock Buying industry leaders is a good way to catch a sector as it comes out of a long slumber. However, thinking back to how poorly mining stocks in general have performed, there's another important thing to consider. That's the different between gold streaming stocks and gold mining stocks. The gold streamers act as a sort of specialty finance shop, lending money to the mining companies, and getting a cut of ensuing gold production at a (usually) fixed price.The gold streamers take on significant risks including gold price variation, delays in production, and bankruptcy of the counterparty mining firm. In return, however, the gold streamers tend to earn fat returns. Over the past decade, while mining stocks as a group lost half their value or more, streamers prospered. For example, Franco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV) quadrupled, and rival streamer Royal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD) soared 150% over the past 10 year period while mining stocks plummeted.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Same Price as Beyond Meat Franco-Nevada specifically, over the years, has built a huge pool of streaming assets across gold and other things. Last year, it sold nearly 350,000 ounces of gold, along with nearly 100,000 gold equivalent ounces of other metals including silver and platinum. For the year, it produced $139 million in net income off of $653 million in revenue, generating a robust profit margin. It also pays a modest dividend to shareholders -- a rarity in the gold stocks industry -- to reward its owners. Gold Stocks To Buy: Sandstorm Gold (SAND)Source: Shutterstock While Barrick Gold and Franco-Nevada will offer big upside if and when gold stocks rally more, the list wouldn't be complete without at least one potential home run pick. Enter Sandstorm Gold (NYSEAMERICAN:SAND). While the ticker may be SAND, Sandstorm is much more precious than that.The company is attractive because it is a small streaming company with several big deals in the pipeline. At the moment, it has streams on 22 operating assets, which, at a gold price of just $1,300/oz throw off more than $60 million a year in cash flow. By 2022, as new contracted assets come into play, Sandstorm's cash flow is projected to double to around $130 million per year -- again using that conservative $1,300/oz gold price number.Now, consider that Sandstorm's market cap is just $1 billion. That's something like just 7x cash flow once its new mine streams come online. Now factor it significantly higher gold prices and things get even more exciting. SAND stock is already up 50% since its November low. It could run a lot more than that if and when the gold stocks rally kicks it into next gear.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned SAND and FNV stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

2019-06-21	2019-06-21 00:35:15	NEM	Newmont Corporation	China National Gold Studies Bid for Canadian Miner Iamgold	(Bloomberg) -- China National Gold Group Corp., the nation’s second-biggest miner of the metal, is studying a bid for a stake in Canada’s Iamgold Corp., people familiar with the matter said. Iamgold shares jumped the most in more than four years.The state-owned gold miner is working with financial advisers on the potential offer, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Iamgold is exploring a possible sale of all or part of the company and has spoken to several potential buyers, Bloomberg News reported last month.The Toronto-based firm’s decision to explore a sale follows several sizable mergers in the industry, including Newmont Mining Corp.’s acquisition of Goldcorp Inc. and Barrick Gold Corp.’s deal for Randgold Resources Ltd.Iamgold’s shares were 6.8% higher at close in Toronto trading, giving the company a market value of $1.5 billion. The shares earlier gained as much as 18%, the biggest intraday increase since December 2014.Gold prices have been on the rise as investors seek havens amid slowing global growth. Bullion for immediate delivery jumped to the highest in more than five years on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated a readiness to cut interest rates.China National Gold is the largest shareholder of China Gold International Resources Corp., listed in Hong Kong, and Shanghai-traded Zhongjin Gold Corp. No final decisions have been made and China National Gold may still decide against an offer, the people said.A representative for China National Gold didn’t respond to requests for comment. A representative for Iamgold declined to comment.The relationship between China and Canada remains tense after the arrest of Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver last December on an American extradition request.More than 80% of Iamgold’s revenue comes from outside Canada, with major operations in South America and Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.(Updates Iamgold share price move in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Winnie Zhu, Danielle Bochove and Michael Hytha.To contact the reporters on this story: Dinesh Nair in London at dnair5@bloomberg.net;Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Fion Li at fli59@bloomberg.net, ;Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Ben ScentFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-national-gold-said-study-132450581.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-20	2019-06-20 11:09:02	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Is Barrick Gold Stock Must-Buy Recession Insurance?	Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) has been coming back to life in recent weeks. While GOLD stock was flirting with a fall below $11.50 just a few weeks ago, it's now trying to hold onto a potential breakout over $14. Is this 23% rally in just a few weeks too much, or is Barrick Gold stock set to continue running?Source: Bullion Vault via Flickr (Modified)Simply put, GOLD stock generally acts as a proxy to gold prices. When uncertainty, fear and recession worries climb, often times the yellow metal does too. Currently, there's a lot of that going around. Rates, Rates, RatesEven though stocks are near all-time highs and the labor market is strong, worries about a recession persist. The odds of a recession are on the rise, increasing the probability, but far from guaranteeing an economic retreat. Those odds are based on the yield curve. As the curve compresses, it raises the odds for a recession. When it inverts it has an eerie ability to foreshadow a recession.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese trends get more complex when considering the Fed's role alongside global central banks. Because the global economy has maintained such low rates, it's created immense demand for longer-dated U.S. Treasury bonds. They are safer from a credit perspective and have a far more attractive yield than all of its peers. For instance, why buy a French 10-year bond with a slightly lower rating yielding close to 0%, when you can buy a 10-year Treasury yielding ~2.1% right now?  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today While U.S. rates are historically low, they are high a global basis at the moment.That's driving long-term rates down at a time where the Fed was raising rates, helping to fuel an inversion. Now, odds call for a rate cut. And in fact, not just one but several. The market is pricing in a 94% chance that the Fed cuts rates by its September meeting. Investors are pricing in an almost 50% chance of two cuts by the same meeting.Wow. Valuing Barrick Gold StockSo what does all of that have to do with Barrick Gold stock? A lot, actually.If the Federal Reserve cuts rates, it could give a boost to gold prices. That's as it weakens the U.S. dollar and causes commodities to rise. Think of a company like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) or Chevron (NYSE:CVX) when oil prices catch a boost. The same can happen for GOLD stock.As long as there are worries -- think: trade war or recession related -- they could also act as catalyst for gold prices.As it relates to GOLD stock, analyst estimates aren't bad, but are far from robust. Analysts expect revenue to grow 14.5% this year to $8.3 billion. Earnings are expected to grow 8.6% to 38 cents per share. That leaves GOLD stock with a price-to-earnings ratio in the mid-30s, which is not exactly value territory.At the start of the year, Barrick completed its merger with Randgold Resources. This formed a $25 billion precious metal conglomerate. However, it didn't take long for the new entity to pursue Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM). Newmont rejected the bid, and the two eventually decided on a joint-venture partnership instead. But it's clear that GOLD management has margin improvement and synergies in mind.  * Stocks to Buy for $20 or Less Even with $5.5 billion in long-term debt and $2.15 billion in cash, GOLD stock has a solid balance sheet. The fact that investors can collect any kind of dividend yield is nice too, given that they don't receive any income from gold. Currently that yield is about 1.1%. Barrick is far from a mega-income generator, but it's better than nothing Trading Gold Stock Price  Click to EnlargeSo where do we stand in all of this? Barrick Gold stock has decent but not great growth, a good balance sheet and a so-so, earnings-based valuation. But at the end of the day, it's a gold miner and that means it depends on the price of gold to drive its share price. It's worth pointing out that GOLD stock tends to outperform gold during the good times, but underperforms during the bad times.That's no surprise to anyone that follows the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) or the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDXJ). These follow a similar pattern when tracking against the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD).With GOLD stock price, we can see that shares broke out over range resistance at $14. Shares ran up to almost $14.50, where Barrick Gold stock topped out at in March. The trade now is simple -- and simple is good.Over $14 and investors can stay long the breakout. Below $14 and GOLD stock may need to reset. Perhaps that's with a test of the 20-day moving average. Maybe it's the 50-day. It may even fall back into its prior range and probe the range lows near $11.50 to $12.But over $14 could get us a run to $15 and possibly much higher should gold prices really take off.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Still, gold stocks - the mining companies that actually produce the shiny commodity - are worth a look right now.A little exposure to gold can help your portfolio. And one way to get that exposure is via mining companies, whose results are heavily tied to the metal's price but can also stand out from one another based on their management, operational efficiency and economies of scale.Prices, while slightly lower this year, remain well off their two-year lows set in August 2018, sitting roughly in the middle of their three-year range. Moreover, gold and gold stocks remain a hedge against market, economic and geopolitical turmoil here and abroad. Choose your catalyst: failure to reach a trade deal with China, saber-rattling on the Korean peninsula, a no-deal Brexit, new Russian incursions. Any of these could help gold regain its moxie.Here are five gold stocks to buy to take advantage of additional sparks in the yellow metal. All five stand out as some of the best operators in the space, and all do something that gold itself can't do: pay cash dividends.

2019-05-06	2019-05-06 12:36:11	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Yamana Gold Stock Is Stifled By the Range-Bound Gold Market	Yamana Gold (NYSE:AUY) stock fell following its quarterly report. The Toronto-based gold producer beat earnings estimates but missed on revenue. This left Yamana Gold stock falling back towards 52-week lows.Source: Shutterstock Yamana Gold has moved to stabilize its balance sheet in recent weeks. However, until the gold market sees significant upward price movements, both AUY and other gold stocks will see little traction.For its first quarter, the company reported earnings of two cents per share. This beat analyst estimates by one penny per share. AUY lost three cents per share in the first quarter of 2018.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, revenues of $407.1 million missed expectations by $7.39 million. They also fell 10.5% from year-ago levels. Even worse, revenue fell short in a quarter where production exceeded analyst estimates. AUY stock fell by more than 3% in morning trading following the announcement.  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio During the quarter, Yamana Gold sold its Chapada copper and gold mine in Brazil to Lundin Mining (OTCMKTS:LUNMF) for over $1 billion. As our own Will Ashworth points out, this allows Yamana to bring down its $1.793 billion debt burden. Yamana Gold Is a Proxy for Gold PricesI agree with my colleague that this sale strengthens the balance sheet of AUY stock. Does it make AUY a buy? I'm not so sure.On the surface, the forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of around 14.9 appears reasonable. It looks even better when traders factor in predicted earnings increases. Wall Street expects profit growth to average about 40% per year over the next five years.Still, such forecasts tend not to guide gold stocks. Historically, Yamana Gold stock and the equities of peers such as Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM) and Lundin Mining tend to become proxies for gold prices. Unfortunately for Yamana Gold investors, gold prices have seen little traction over the last few years. AUY stock briefly surpassed $20 per share in 2012 as gold prices surged toward $2,000 per oz.However, the price of gold has not exceeded $1,400 per oz. since 2013. Consequently, it has remained range-bound since that year. Over the last 5.5 years, gold has bottomed at about $1,050 per oz. and has seen a top of around $1,375 per oz.This has left Yamana Gold stock trading in a range. As a result, the stock price trades at levels it saw in 2015. Now, with gold at around $1,275 per oz., AUY stock has traded between $2 per share and just above $3 per share for the last two years. Yamana Gold and the Looming BearGold tends to rise when investors lose confidence in the reserve currency, which remains the U.S. dollar. However, in the midst of a crisis, history shows that traders lose confidence in gold.At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, gold fell in value as investors flocked to the perceived safety of the U.S. dollar. Gold did not rise again until 2010 when investors started to want an alternative to the dollar. After about three years, the price of gold fell back to the range where it trades today.As things stand now, I don't see any catalyst that will take gold sufficiently higher. If history serves as a guide, a stock market swoon will become bearish for the dollar, and by extension, AUY stock. As long as investors retain their confidence in the dollar, neither gold nor gold stocks will break out of their respective ranges. The Bottom Line on Yamana Gold StockAfter earnings, expect little activity from AUY stock until it can rise out of its trading range. AUY sold off as the company missed revenue estimates despite increased production.On the surface, AUY looks increasingly solid. Selling the Chapada mine should reduce its debt. Moreover, the reasonable PE ratio and the high levels of profit growth predicted should presumably send Yamana Gold stock higher.Unfortunately, gold stocks tend to follow the price of gold. As gold has remained range-bound, so too has AUY stock. Even worse, no apparent catalyst has appeared that would take gold higher.If investors lost confidence in the dollar, both gold and Yamana Gold stock would become a screaming buy at current levels. However, as things stand now, things will likely get worse before conditions improve for AUY.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-04-03	2019-04-03 13:13:55	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Investors Have Little Reason to Stick With Goldcorp Stock	It's hard not to feel for the owners of Goldcorp (NYSE:GG) stock. GG stock has been one of the worst-performing stocks this decade, dropping from its 2011 highs of $55 to below $10 in October.Source: Shutterstock At those lows, GG's management continued to talk up the company's turnaround plan. then promptly sold the company to Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM). The all-stock deal offered only a modest premium for the owners of Goldcorp stock, which promptly plunged as NEM 's shares sold off following the announcement of the deal.  * Should You Buy Q1's 6 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks? GG stock has rallied since then. But although it's above $11, GG stock still trades at a massive discount to its former valuation. With Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) apparently backing off its plans to bid for Newmont, the spread assigned Goldcorp stock has narrowed as well. Goldcorp investors will receive 0.328 shares of NEM stock for each Goldcorp share. That currently values GG  stock at about $11.75,  just a 2.5% premium (or deal spread) to the current price of $11.47.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn other words, what GG stock right now provides is ownership of Newmont Mining stock,  at a small discount. It's difficult to see why that is an attractive proposition. The First Big Problem With Gold StocksThe problem with gold stocks remains relatively simple. Gold stocks should provide leverage to the price of gold, meaning they outperform when gold goes up, and underperform when gold goes down.A simple example is instructive. If gold is at $1,000 an ounce, and a company's all-in costs are $800, the company's pre-tax profit should be $200 an ounce. Cut the price of gold 20%, to $800, and its profits drop 100% to basically zero. The company's stock likely falls substantially in this scenario, certainly more than the 20% drop in the value of the underlying commodity.Raise gold prices 20%, however, to $1200, and profits now double. And the stock should rise much more than 20% (even if the stock won't necessarily double, as investors may see some risk that gold prices will pull back). In short, and in theory, the move of underlying gold prices should be magnified by gold stocks.In practice, though, there are two real problems with this theory. The most notable problem is that major gold miners have failed spectacularly to give shareholders that leverage. Barrick has been the most notable disaster, as I wrote last year, but other majors have performed equally poorly.Over the past decade, gold has gained about 35% (in U.S. dollars). During that time, GG stock has lost 66% of its value. Barrick stock is down 58%. Newmont has been the best of the majors,and it has declined 20%. With dividends, NEM shareholders probably have broken even.All of these stocks should be rising faster than gold prices, yet they haven't. Whether the prolem is excessive executive compensation, geopolitical problems,  sheer execution, or some combination of them major miners have failed to provide positive returns. The Second Big ProblemThat history leads to a simple question: if an investor is bullish on gold, why would she buy gold miner stocks in general and  shares of the major miners in particular? Smaller miners have shown some ability to provide returns, with Kirkland Lake Gold (NYSE:KL) perhaps the best example of late. The diversified, large, majors, however, have made money for their employees , executives,and lawyers, but not for their shareholders.And if those shareholders see gold moving higher, there are ways to make that bet without the messy aspects of actual mining. ETNs like the VelocityShares 3x Long Gold ETN (NASDAQ:UGLD) or the DB Gold Double Long ETN (NYSEARCA:DGP) offer leveraged exposure. Options trades (though only suitable for advanced investors who understand the trades) similarly can provide weighted upside to gold prices.To be sure, those strategies entail risk - but the performance of miners over time shows there's plenty of risk in those trades as well. NEM stock, for instance, sits below 1990 levels. And if gold prices tumble, mining stocks are going to do the same. Why GG or NEM?So if an investor is going to buy GG stock - which essentially implies NEM stock - she has to believe that something is going to change. Either miners will become more efficient, Newmont will outperform, or the Goldcorp deal is a good one.That's a tough case to make at this point. Miners are trying to focus more on profitability and cash flow, instead of production. That hasn't done much for share prices of late, however. Recently, Newmont has done better than its major mining peers, but it's hardly done well.As far the Goldcorp deal, it's important to ask one simple question: why was the deal made? If Goldcorp's assets are so valuable, why is Goldcorp's management selling them at a modest premium to GG stock when Goldcorp stock is at a 15-year low? The owners of GG stock aren't even getting any cash in the deal.Some investors have pointed to the payout being received by Goldcorp CEO David Garofalo and Chairman Ian Telfer. But Garofalo, in particular, has nearly 900,000 shares, restricted stock units, and rights - enough to suggest he would participate in any rally of GG stock on a Goldcorp turnaround. It's a bit too conspiratorial to suggest that Goldcorp's board would allow the owners of GG stock to be fleeced simply for golden parachutes.Rather, the issue seems to be that GG itself doesn't see its assets as worth much more than $12 per share of Goldcorp stock. So what is Newmont getting in return for giving roughly one-quarter of its equity to the owners of GG stock?Synergies between GG and Newmont are estimated to be as much as $100 million a year; in the context of a $30 billion market cap for the combined company, that's a drop in the bucket.Owning GG stock means owning NEM stock. Owning NEM stock certainly seems like more of the same. It's hard to see how that's a good deal, even at a modest discount.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-03-29	2019-03-29 14:19:45	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Goldcorp Special Dividend Is Capital Allocation at Its Finest	Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM), is offering an 88-cent special dividend to Newmont shareholders to close its $10 billion acquisition of Goldcorp (NYSE:GG). Owners of GG stock should be happy about Newmont's capital allocation decision.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the ten-yard line, Newmont had to do something to convince prominent shareholders, such as John Paulson, that the deal to buy Goldcorp was a good one. Newmont initially offered Goldcorp shareholders .328 shares of NEM stock in mid-January for every share of GG stock held, along with 2 cents in cash per share. Newmont trotted out the natural synergies explanation as to why the deal made sense -- $365 million in annual pre-tax synergies while delivering 6-7 million ounces of gold annually within a decade -- but Newmont shareholders felt the deal unfairly benefited Goldcorp shareholders. On March 25, VanEck portfolio manager Joe Foster, who oversees the VanEck precious metals investment team, changed his mind about the merger vote. VanEck, Newmont's third-largest shareholder, had serious concerns about the deal. The special dividend has removed any such concerns. &quot;As things stand right now I plan to vote in favor of the Newmont deal,&quot; Foster said in an interview. While Paulson is still reviewing the special dividend, it's likely that he'll also fall in line and vote for the deal. Ratification is expected April 4. &quot;From my standpoint, I think we've done what we needed to do,&quot; Newmont Chief Executive Officer Gary Goldberg said in an interview. &quot;It now is up to our shareholders. I'm really looking forward to positive results out of both votes.''While the special dividend will only be paid on the successful consummation of the $10 billion deal, it illustrates why more companies should utilize this capital allocation lever ahead of customary shareholder rewards such as regular dividends and share repurchases. Here's why.  Greater Flexibility to Handle All Economic ConditionsIn April 2016, I highlighted four stocks that had paid one or more special dividends in the past year, that I thought were good investments. My argument was relatively straightforward. &quot;In my opinion, special dividends are one of the best examples of efficient capital allocation because it shows me that management understands the ebb and flow of its own cash flows and is more than willing to reward shareholders when the coffers are flush and to hold back when they're not,&quot; I wrote on May 3, 2016.&quot;But I wasn't just looking for stocks to buy that paid a special dividend -- I was after those that don't pay a regular dividend and have no formal dividend policy.&quot;Here's how the four stocks have performed in the 35 months since. Stock Performance Amerco (NASDAQ:UHAL) 4.0% Diamond Hill Investment Group (NASDAQ:DHIL) -12.3% Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) -52.3% Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) 42.4% SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) 44.1% So, what happened? Why such terrible performance relative to the index?Well, each of the businesses has had different issues to deal with: Amerco (rising costs), Diamond Hill (increased competition), Under Armour (bad management) and Facebook (privacy issues).These are hardly my best stock selections over the past three years. However, I do believe that all four are company-specific problems rather than asset allocation mistakes. Long-term, all of these stocks should make investors money. But I digress. Newmont's Capital Allocation Winning ChoiceOver the past three fiscal years, Newmont generated $2.9 billion in free cash flow. From that, it's paid out $648 million in dividends, repurchased just $98 million of its stock, and repaid $1.7 billion of its debt, leaving it with plenty of cash for other potential uses. The 88-cent special dividend will cost the company $469 million. However, the combination of it and Goldcorp should produce at least $1 billion in annual free cash flow -- probably more if it achieves the projected cost synergies of $365 million annually. Without the special dividend available to it, there's almost no way Newmont could have achieved a successful vote. That's because it would have had to reduce the number of shares it issued Goldcorp shareholders (less than 0.3280) to pay for the deal. Goldcorp shareholders likely would have vetoed such a plan. Newmont was a rock in a hard place.I don't know why companies don't utilize the special dividend more often. It provides greater financial flexibility so that management can do what's right for all stakeholders, including shareholders, without locking the company into quarterly rent checks that become a noose around its neck.The argument against special dividends is that it benefits Johnny-come-lately shareholders at the expense of long-time shareholders, who didn't buy on the news. There's a measure of truth to that.  * 7 Dividend Stocks With Double-Digit Increases However, in the long run, I believe the pros outweigh the cons. If you're Joe Foster at VanEck, you see the benefits.    At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-26	2019-03-26 17:03:53	NEM	Newmont Corporation	3 Gold Stocks That Should Glitter With Rising Gold Prices	Since hitting a low of about $1,175 per oz. on Aug. 14, gold prices have steadily risen. Gold took off as stocks dropped dramatically last fall. However, as shares began to recover from a December 24th low, gold and gold stocks continued to rise. Gold now trades above $1,315 per oz., close to levels seen last April.Many blame the rise in gold prices on an inverted yield curve in the bond market. As the annualized rate on 90-day loans exceeds that of the 10-year bond, many see that as a sign of recession. Such an inversion preceded the previous seven recessions, according to the Cleveland Fed.Gold stocks, which usually rise and fall with the price of gold, should also benefit. Gold stocks have suffered in the last eight years. The yellow metal experienced a bear market as prices fell from the almost $1,900 per oz. level they saw back in 2011. Now, with the bull market having persisted more than 10 minutes, many wonder if a pullback -- and subsequently a rising interest in gold -- is imminent. Our own Aaron Levitt has cited the increasing M&A activity that has come with gold trading above $1,300 per oz.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Play the CBD Trend Assuming a new bull market in gold has begun, these three stocks on the rise could benefit: Gold Stocks on the Rise: Goldcorp (GG)Source: Shutterstock Canada-based Goldcorp (NYSE:GG) has become a leading target among gold stocks as Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) seeks to acquire the company.GG stock has risen by about 15% since the two companies announced the proposed takeover. It has also increased around 32% since the Q3 earnings report last October sent the stock plunging. Thanks to the merger and rising gold prices, it trades at just over $11 per share today.Under terms of the proposed deal, the new company will become Newmont Goldcorp. Current Newmont shareholders will own 65% of the company with the remainder of the control going to current holders of GG stock.Although the deal has received regulatory approval in Canada and Mexico, it has faced opposition in some quarters. Hedge fund Paulson & Co. had initially opposed the deal. However, Newmont's CEO offered a special dividend of 88 cents per share to Newmont shareholders if the transaction occurs. With that, Paulson withdrew its opposition.Moreover, even without the merger, GG stock looks poised to move higher. Thanks to rising gold prices, analysts forecast a 200% increase in profits this year. They also predict earnings will increase by 45.5% next year. With that kind of growth and its 23.5 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, one can understand Newmont's interest.The deal awaits regulatory approval in the U.S. However, whether traders deal with GG stock or NEM stock longer-term, the future appears bright for holders of Goldcorp stock. Barrick Gold (GOLD)Source: Jeremy Vohwinkle via Flickr (Modified)Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) led the recent consolidation move among gold stocks. Its takeover of Randgold Resources likely inspired the proposed deal between Newmont and Goldcorp. That merger made the Toronto-based company one of the world's largest gold producers.Barrick had also attempted a hostile takeover of Newmont. Both have operated mines in Nevada for decades, and Barrick wanted to benefit from the potential synergies of combining operations. Instead, both companies will enter into a joint venture to combine the Nevada mine operations.Despite mixed success on the takeover front, GOLD stock has risen by almost 50% since hitting lows in September. After the Randgold merger closed at the end of 2018, Barrick stock has traded in a range. Now, GOLD has finally begun to rise above post-merger levels in recent days. Today, it trades in the $14 per share range.Now, with merger-related speculation likely over for now, the future of GOLD stock again relies on the price of physical gold. Barrick stock trades well below 2011 levels, when it last saw prices above $50 per share. Analysts foresee profit increase of 14.3% this year and 17.5% the next. The company has shown confidence as it has hiked its dividend for three years in a row. This has taken the annual dividend yield to about 2%, or 28 cents per share on a yearly basis.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly However, the accuracy of those forecasts hinges on gold prices. It took gold prices of almost $1,900 per oz. to take GOLD stock to the $50 per share level. However, gold has not traded above $1,365 per oz. since 2013. Assuming the price of gold can finally rise above that level, both profit forecasts and the price of GOLD stock should eventually move back toward 2010-2011 highs. Vale (VALE)Source: Shutterstock Vale (NYSE:VALE) faces a different set of challenges than gold stocks like Goldcorp and Barrick. Unlike these Canadian counterparts, the Brazil-based materials company mines a variety of minerals. A ruptured dam in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais killed more than 300 people in January. Since that time, that state has won its bid to freeze more than 2.95 billion reals ($795 million) in company assets. A dividend suspension following the disaster has also weighed on VALE stock.Due to this dam issue, VALE stock has not risen in the last six months like other gold stocks. Also, with profits forecasted to fall by 3.7% this year, near-term hopes look dim. However, as grim as this may sound, such disasters tend to create buying opportunities for investors.Indeed, the outlook improves dramatically once it can put the tragedy in Minas Gerais behind it. Analysts expect profits to increase by 50% next year. Also, despite the recent setback, VALE stock has risen dramatically from 2016 levels when the stock briefly dipped below $2.50 per share. Now trading at about $13 per share, VALE has stabilized despite the setback. Like other gold stocks, Vale trades well below 2011 levels when the equity approached the $35 per share level.Given the uncertain political environment in Brazil and the issues with the ruptured dam, the reputation of Vale has seen a setback. However, the rising price of gold and other precious metals offers VALE stock the opportunity it needs to recover both its reputation and its stock price.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

On top of that, it’s unfair that Goldcorp shareholders should benefit from a joint venture between Newmont and Barrick Gold Corp. in Nevada, given that was negotiated after the Goldcorp-Newmont terms were set, he said.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaneck-shares-paulson-apos-concerns-163644150.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-02-28	2019-02-28 20:39:48	NEM	Newmont Corporation	3 Ways to Trade the Bull Market for Gold Stocks	A new bull was born in gold prices late last year. And since then fundamental and technical forces have combined to drive the yellow metal higher. Spectators looking to get in on the action in gold stocks will be happy to know a pullback is forming to provide lower risk entries.Though the original spark for the gold bull market's birth was the desire for safety amid a crashing stock market, the fuel that should sustain it hails from a different corner of the financial sphere -- monetary policy. Over the past few months, the Federal Reserve has pulled an about-face, from hawkish to dovish. Talk of future rate hikes has given way to reassurances that Jerome Powell and crew will be patient and take actions supportive of asset prices if necessary.Some even think their next move may end up being a rate cut.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith interest rate projections ratcheting lower and inflation expectations notching higher, investors are betting that the backdrop for gold is now warming.  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 Today we'll look at three ways to capitalize on higher prices in the gold mine.  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim  VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX)Gold stocks are reveling in their newfound bullishness. Since bottoming last September, the Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX), which tracks a basket of the top gold mining stocks, has gained 29%. Along the way it climbed back above the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages, confirming buyers have wrested control of the trend on all but the longest of time frames.Dips have proved valuable buying opportunities along the way which is why traders should be eyeing this week's retreat with interest. With today's descent, GDX stock is working on its sixth down day in a row. If past is prologue, bulls should emerge to halt the decline within the next few trading sessions.Buy the April $22 calls for around 95 cents.  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim  Gold Miners Bull 3X Direxion ETF (NUGT)If you're looking for a higher octane way to bank on further upside in gold prices, then leveraged ETFs are beckoning. In sticking with the theme of buying gold mining stocks, you could use the Gold Miners Bull 3x Direxion ETF (NYSEARCA:NUGT) which aims to move 300% of the NYSEArca Gold Miners Index over a single session.Though its performance varies significantly over weeks and months, on a daily basis, NUGT moves close to 3x what GDX does. For example, at the time of this writing, GDX is down 0.54%, and NUGT is down 1.59%.The posture of NUGT is similar to GDX. It rallied back above all major moving averages this year and is in the midst of a six-day pullback. Because of its more volatile nature, the options listed on NUGT carry juicier premiums than the non-leveraged gold miners ETF. As such, the potential payout for strategies like covered calls and naked puts are attractive.  * 9 Best Stocks to Buy on U.S.-China Trade Optimism If you think NUGT will end up above $17 at April expiration, then sell the Apr $17 put for 85 cents.  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim  Newmont Mining (NEM)The previous two ideas offered diversified ways of gaming a basket of gold stocks. My final selection involves picking a specific gold stock  -- Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM). It boasts one of the best setups of its peers and is rallying today, despite the drop in gold prices.If the relative strength persists, a bullish trade on NEM could deliver sector-beating returns during the next upswing. Implied volatility for NEM stock options sits at 27% or the 38th percentile of its one-year range. That means premiums are juiced enough to make short option strategies interesting.Sell the April $33 puts for 77 cents.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-27	2019-02-27 16:50:15	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Bet On Gold Stocks as the M&A Love Triangle Gets Interesting	The past few years haven't exactly been that great for the various gold stocks. In fact, it's been pretty lousy.Source: Shutterstock After gold prices crashed and stayed low for what seemed like a decade, the sector was basically dead money. The various gold miners were forced to pick up the pieces, pay down high debt loads and scrap by.But you wouldn't know that when looking at the gold stocks recently. The sector is a hotbed of activity as gold prices have surged higher. It's quickly becoming a hotbed of merger-and-buyout activity as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market That includes the love triangle between Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD), Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) and Goldcorp. (NYSE:GG). The trio of top miners is locked in a battle of takeovers, hostile bids and saber rattling. The outcome of which could send the rest of the gold stocks into a tizzy.For investors looking seriously at gold, what happens to GOLD, GG and NEM are very important. Rising Prices, Rising M&A for the Gold StocksAs concerns about the health of the global economy are starting to bubble up to the surface, gold is starting to regain its luster. These days, an ounce of gold will set you back around $1330 per ounce. That's far cry from its peak, but still a very good increase from its post-recession lows.Perhaps, more importantly, it's at a level that the various gold stocks feel comfortable about turning a profit and making some big waves in the sector. With average all-in cash costs lower and precious metal prices much higher, the major gold stocks are opening their checkbooks and hunting for deals.This started with Barrick at the end of last year.Barrick made the move to acquire rival Randgold Resources for a cool $18.3 billion share-for-share deal. That buyout created the world's biggest gold mining firm. A firm that now owns five of the world's top tier one gold mines.The gave GOLD a huge advantage over its super-major rivals. So, naturally, other top gold stocks couldn't sit ideally by. With that, Newmont made a bid for struggling Goldcorp for a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $10 billion. That deal would create a worthy rival to Barrick and hold an equally impressive portfolio of mines, reserves and offer on the strongest dividends among gold stock.Here is where it gets interesting.Barrick decided that this NEM/GG deal would be detrimental to its bottom line and the threat wouldn't be easy to brush off. On that note, GOLD decided to make a hostile bid for Newmont for a whopping $17.8 billion in stock.If the buyout is successful, the deal would create the world's largest gold company with a value of around $42 billion at current market prices. The mega-sized gold stock would hold assets on almost every continent -- including Australia, Africa, the U.S. and Latin America.This isn't the first time that Barrick has tried to court Newmont in a merger/buyout. However, all other attempts haven't been successful mostly due to culture clashes at the two gold stocks.This time may not be any different as CEOs for both firms have stepped up their war of words. However, some major shareholders have backed the proposal. What It Really Does for the Gold StocksIf the Barrick/Newmont deal does go through, the size and scope of the new firm would put some fear into the rest of the sector. The combined company would hold immense scale, low costs and be able to pull around $7 billion in synergies. That's impressive. And even if GOLD isn't able to get its hands on NEM and Newmont buys Goldcorp, you're still looking at two massive gold producers.For everyone else in the sector, this a huge problem. Trying to compete with such massive entities tends to be a losing proposition. The solution to the problem is to get bigger themselves. All in all, this will lead to more M&A down the road.Top gold stocks like Agnico-Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM), Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC), Yamana Gold (NYSE:AUY) and even AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE:AU) are all now going to have to think big and think about how to grow in order to compete with the supermajors.For investors, this creates an interesting scenario. Already, many gold stocks have moved higher over the last year as prices for the precious metal have increased, profitability has improved and the situation in the sector isn't so dire.But now, with the majors starting to wheel and deal, and the middle tier firms being forced to think about acquisitions as well, the whole sector should start to trade at a bit of a buyout premium.This is sort of exactly what happened back in 2006/2007 when the last round of major gold stock M&A happened. Considering Gold Stocks for Your PortfolioSo, what's the portfolio answer?Betting on exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDXJ) or iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:RING) could be a good start.These ETFs feature a wide swath of those firms that could be doing the buying and those that could be bought-out over the next few quarters. Moreover, the ETFs makes it easy for investors and there's no need to pick specific winners.All in all, the Barrick/Newmont/Goldcorp saga is far from over. But its real contribution to the gold mining sector is more M&A. Mid-tier and smaller rivals will be forced to grow in order to compete. For investors, that should bring up the values of almost any gold stock with real assets and production.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-02-21	2019-02-21 20:42:50	NEM	Newmont Corporation	5 Must-See Stock Charts for Friday: Newmont, Nike, Tesla	Stocks fell on Thursday morning but are doing their best to shake off the losses. Investors are still trying to weigh a pausing Fed and an improving trade situation with the giant rally already seen in U.S. stocks. But that still leaves a number of must-see stock charts for us to examine as the indices teeter on a potential pullback. Must-See Stock Charts 1: NikeNike (NYSE:NKE) is in the news Thursday, as its share price sinks 1.5%. But the stock's decline isn't the reason Nike's in the news. Rather, the company is making headlines after college basketball's biggest player, Duke's Zion Williamson, had his Nike shoe &quot;blow out&quot; on him just seconds into Duke's big game vs. North Carolina.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Healthy Dividend Stocks to Buy for Extra Stability Not only did Duke lose the game, but they have lost Williamson to injury for the time being. We've now got Nike shares -- very conveniently I might add -- pulling back from resistance near $86. Sometimes the news lines up a little too perfectly.In any regard, we're now looking for support. Will the 20-day moving average be enough to prop up NKE? Perhaps, provided the overall market holds up too. But with the latter seemingly coming under pressure, We could see a juicy pullback in Nike down the $79 to $80 level. See how it handles the 20-day first. If it holds, a retest of the highs could be in the cards. Must-See Stock Charts 2: TeslaExecutive departures and Consumer Reports pulling its recommendation for the Model 3 are whacking shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Thursday, which are down more than 3%.Worse though, the stock is below $300 and threatening a big-time support level at $290. This $290 to $300 area (and more loosely speaking $290 to $310) has been a very important area for Tesla.The stock has been locked in a downtrend since early December, with higher lows and higher highs spelling out a chart that gets more bearish by the week. It doesn't help that Tesla will almost surely close below $360 on March 1st, obligating the company to pay back its $920 million in convertible debt with cash rather than stock. Between that and a somewhat disappointing earnings result, shares seem starved for a positive catalyst.All I can say is this: Below $290 and the $275 to $280 level is in play. But below that and we may not see the bulls make a substantial stance until Tesla's down in the $250 to $260 range. Must-See Stock Charts 3: Newmont MiningGold has been on fire, which is giving Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) some extra zest. It helps that the company reported a top- and bottom-line beat on Wednesday afternoon, leading to a modest rally in the stock.Shares are up plenty from the January lows and NEM, at least for now, is having trouble pushing higher. Just over the 50% Fibonacci retracement level now, NEM technically has nearby support. If it holds, look for a push up to $36.67, the 61.8% retracement of the 52-week range. That level also draws in what was a rough support level in the first six months of 2018.What happens if the 50% Fib gives way? I wouldn't stake a huge claim to this level holding in the first place, but should it fail, there should be plenty of support below. For those that can live with a 5.5% loss from current levels, they can use a stop-loss on a close below $33.50. More conservative bulls may wait for a pullback into the $34 area to take a better/risk long position in NEM. Must-See Stock Charts 4: Boston BeerInvestors are saying &quot;Cheers!&quot; on Thursday to Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM), which is up more than 13% after the company beat earnings expectations. While the rally is solid, SAM is sporting an RSI near 80 and coming up to downtrend resistance (blue line).Bears can consider a solid risk/reward short bet with a stop-loss on a close over resistance. Likewise, bulls can buy on a breakout over resistance. Otherwise, the latter should wait for some consolidation and/or a pullback before getting long. Must-See Stock Charts 5: HormelShares of Hormel (NYSE:HRL) are down 3.5% after missing earnings and revenue estimates but reaffirming its 2019 outlook. The quarter was a bit of a mixed bag and leaves Hormel's chart showing some confusion.Just when it looked like shares were going to breakout over $44 after having already broken over downtrend resistance (blue line), the stock has broken back down. It's now below $44 and downtrend resistance, while clinging to uptrend support (black line).There's another uptrend line nearby drawn in purple, but the direction of the overall market may drive HRL in the short term. Rather than buy now, I'd prefer to see how HRL shakes out over the next few days. If buyers can get it closer to $40, it may be a worthwhile long.  * The 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Right Now Let's see how the S&P 500 does the next few days as well, as we may get our much-need pullback.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) and Randgold Resources have merged, creating one massive gold-mining outfit. Shares of newly-issued GOLD stock began trading at the beginning of the year.

The deal was overwhelmingly approved by Barrick shareholders, with more than 99% of them voting in favor of the pairing. Randgold's investors weren't quite as keen, though with 95.2% of investors on board with the merger plan, there was still more than enough support to combine the two outfits.

In both cases, owners were desperate to try anything that might provide a much-needed lift to their stakes; neither company has thrived in the shadow of tepid gold prices.

But, here comes the hard part… two strong-willed chiefs working together. The sale of unwanted assets, which should be a simple project, will be the first test of the combined company's management structure. Especially given the more recent announcement that Newmont Mining will buy Goldcorp to become the largest gold producer.

### Gold Stock and the Merger

There's no denying Barrick Gold is a powerhouse within the industry. The two companies jointly owned and operated five of the world's top ten mines, in terms of potential output at a lower-than-average cost.

As one, the new Barrick will be able to produce six million ounces of gold per year. The merger gives Barrick an effective toehold in Africa too, where it has struggled of late, but where Randgold has thrived.

Of course, Randgold should have thrived in Africa. It was built from the ground up there, led by South African-born Mark Bristow since 1995. He knows his way around the continent's gold-mining industry, but perhaps more than that, he's well-versed in the art of navigating Africa's increasingly tricky political environment.

The latest case(s) in point: Wrangling with Mali over taxes linked to the company's Loulo-Gounkoto mine, and recent changes in the DRC's mining codes that could cost Randgold another $20 million in annual expenses.

Some have suggested not all of Randgold's mines will remain with the new company though. Namely, BMO has speculated that the aforementioned Tongon could be on the chopping block, along with its Massawa and Morila properties.

Meanwhile, Barrick (the piece of the company that wasn't Randgold before the merger) may be looking to offload its Lumwana copper mine in Zambia as well as Chile's Zaldivar mine. There's even speculation that Barrick is interested in pairing up its Nevada operations with Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM). The recent announcement might change that, though.

The ultimate end goal? BMO's analyst believes asset sales will be &quot;aimed at positioning the company as the lowest cost western-based gold producer, but not necessarily the largest.&quot;

### Management and GOLD Stock

That's assuming Barrick's two most powerful employees can agree on which properties to keep, and which to shed. They might not.

Bristow brings with him not just decades of experience within the gold mining industry (and Africa's gold mining landscape in particular), but a reputation of being something of a &quot;one man show.&quot;

He's been known to personally fly to investors to mines on his private plane, and he's got something of a penchant for big-game hunting. He'll also be sharing some of the leadership responsibilities with Barrick's executive chairman John Thornton, putting him in an unfamiliar position.

Thornton's title isn't a merely honorary one. Prior to the merger, Thornton eliminated his other job as CEO altogether, limiting the top leadership position to President, thus ceding even more control of the company to himself. Adding to the awkwardness is that prior to the pairing, Bristow was a fairly regular critic of Barrick.

Underscoring that awkwardness is the wealth of experience Bristow has compared to Thornton.

Prior to being named executive chairman, Thornton had only been CEO of Barrick since early 2017, and the former banker had never been in an underground mine until 2016. That's in contrast with Bristow, who as founder of Randgold in 1995 has walked underground mines countless times. The latter easily could feel compelled to take charge.

The fact that neither executive intends to live or work in Toronto, where Barrick is based, doesn't suggest a personal friendship will be forged either.

### Looking Ahead for GOLD Stock

Still, it might be a deal that pays off exactly as prescribed. Indeed, it will probably pay off as prescribed.

Though observers have cast doubts on how well the two chiefs will mesh, most worst-case scenarios are rarely realized in full. Not only are Thornton and Bristow adults, Barrick and Randgold were two of the most respected, reliable names in industry.

The fact that the combined companies will not only have plenty of prime properties but also will be able to shed their unwanted ones only bolsters the bullish case. Again, it might take some time to account for Newmont's purchase of Goldcorp, announced today.

Limiting itself to higher-quality mines means, according to Barrick, a cash cost of only $538 per-ounce of gold mined. Wood Mackenzie anticipates that cash cost being a bit higher, at $611. Even at the higher figure though, Barrick still boasts one of the lowest per-ounce cash costs in the business.

The biggest threat to the value of GOLD stock for the foreseeable future? The sheer process of combing two highly disparate companies while divesting properties that won't necessarily be easy to sell.

As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. You can follow him on Twitter, at @jbrumley.

## Newmont-Goldcorp merger

Today, Newmont Mining (NEM) and Goldcorp (GG) announced that they have entered an agreement in which NEM will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Goldcorp in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $10 billion.

Newmont will acquire each share of Goldcorp in exchange for 0.3280 NEM shares, which represents a premium of 17% based on the companies’ 20-day volume weighted average stock prices.

## Sector-leading gold combination

Newmont Goldcorp’s reserves will be among the largest in the gold sector (GDX) (GDXJ). Moreover, the combined entity is targeting $1.0 billion–$1.5 billion in divestitures over the next two years to optimize gold (GLD) production at a sustainable rate. As per the press release, “In addition to providing shareholders the largest gold Reserves per share, Newmont Goldcorp will offer the highest annual dividend among senior gold producers.”

## Following Barrick-Randgold merger

This transaction comes on the heels of the merger of Barrick Gold (GOLD) with Randgold Resources, which was completed on January 2, 2019. On September 24, Barrick Gold agreed to acquire Randgold Resources in a share-for-share deal. The merger created a sector-leading gold company, which owns five of the industry’s top ten Tier 1 gold assets. The combined entity has a market cap of ~$23.75 billion. It will also have the largest gold reserves among its senior gold peers (GDX) (NUGT).

2019-01-14	2019-01-14 11:52:51	NEM	Newmont Corporation	3 Big Stock Charts for Monday: Masco, Newmont Mining and O’Reilly Automotive	"Friday's lackluster start didn't last until the closing bell rang. Though the S&P 500 still logged its first loss in six sessions on the last day of last week, the bulls pared the loss back to a mere 0.01%. Plus, the sellers never really came out in numbers.

General Motors (NYSE:GM) did its part to keep the broad market out of the red, gaining 7.1% after dishing out a 2019 profit outlook that exceeded expectations. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) chipped in as well, advancing 4% after UBS upgraded the stock to a &quot;Buy,&quot; explaining investors now have more clarity about its challenges.

But, there were just a few too many names like Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) weighing stocks down. Although advancers outnumbers decliners on Friday, the decliners dished out big dips like the 9.4% tumble ATVI took after it was announced it was parting ways with one of its game development partners.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The weekend should clean the mental slate for most tickers, though the stock charts of Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM), Masco (NYSE:MAS) and O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) are already largely locked into a pattern that's leading into something.

### Masco (MAS)

The last time we looked at Masco back on Nov. 29, shares were knocking on the door of a break above technical resistance around $32. It ended up following through just a couple of days later, but to no avail. Shares reversed course the day after that, and spent the following month falling back to its previous low around $27.

That pullback ended up turning into a double-bottom though, and since the MAS has fought its way back above $27. The newest hurdle now stands just above $33, where Masco shares peaked the one day more than a month ago the ceiling at $27 was breached. Masco shares haven't been able to break above that ceiling either, and another one's since moved into the picture. If that resistance can be cleared, however, MAS could soar.

  
Click to Enlarge • As was noted, the new ceiling is around $33, where shares peaked in December and again so far this year.

• Also coming into the picture is the 100-day moving average line, plotted in gray. MAS neared that line last week, but traders are cautious about pushing past it.

• There has been a great deal of volume behind the recent upturn, however, suggesting there are buyers ready and willing to step in if it can break above the last technical resistance level.

### Newmont Mining (NEM)

It has got more to do with rising gold prices than with the miner itself. But, for traders looking for a good way to plug into what's quickly becoming an impressive rally, Newmont Mining may be the best of the best. The momentum is strong, and there's only one more hurdle to clear.

What a hurdle it is though.

  
Click to Enlarge • The hurdle in question is the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. It was tested with Friday's high, but NEM didn't push above it.

• Guiding Newmont shares to and possibly beyond their 200-day average is a set of well-established support and resistance lines, plotted in yellow on both stock charts.

• Whatever support isn't being provided by the lower edge of the rising trading range, the stock's other key moving average lines are offering. The purple 50-day average line has been especially helpful.

### O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY)

Finally, it's suspicious just how much O'Reilly Automotive has failed to participate in the recent market recovery. More than that though, a closer examination of the stock's undertow suggests a pullback is brewing. One misstep could easily put a profit-tracking chain reaction in place.

  
Click to Enlarge • With just a quick glance, ORLY looks no worse than stagnant, trapped by converging support and resistance lines plotted in yellow on both stock charts. But, we just saw bearish crosses of key moving averages.

• The selling volume has also been heavy. It's been so heavy, in fact, that the weekly chart's Chaikin line has been below the zero mark for weeks. Though O'Reilly are holding their ground, a great number of traders are getting out.

• The trigger for any selling avalanche will most likely come in the form of a break below the lower edge of the recent support line, current at $331.

2019-01-09	2019-01-09 12:30:59	NEM	Newmont Corporation	Can Barrick’s Valuation Rerate Further after the Merger?	"Is Barrick Worth a Look after Its Merger with Randgold?

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Valuation

Among senior miners (GDX), Barrick (GOLD) has the second-highest EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value-to-EBITDA) multiple of 6.6x, which represents a premium of 1% to its historical multiple. Its multiple has rerated since its announcement of its merger with Randgold Resources (GOLD) to form an industry-leading gold company (SGDM) with the greatest concentration of Tier 1 gold (GLD) assets.

Since the announcement of the merger, GOLD’s multiple has expanded 18.5%.

Among its peers, Newmont Mining (NEM), Goldcorp (GG), and Kinross Gold (KGC) are trading at multiples of 8.2x, 6.2x, and 4.9x, respectively.

## Catalysts

As we discussed in Is the Barrick-Randgold Merger Enough of a Reason to Bet on ABX? Barrick’s costs are expected to fall, and its production profile is expected to improve on low-cost, high-quality assets after the merger. Since it owns five of the top ten Tier 1 assets in the world, its unit costs are expected to be significantly lower than its peers’. However, its new position will also add to its geopolitical risk.

## Problems to overcome

Most of Randgold’s operations are in Africa. Due to many African countries’ rising resource nationalism and ambition to secure bigger shares in mining activities, many mining companies are facing difficult times operating in these jurisdictions.

Political problems in these countries could add to Barrick’s operational risks. In addition, market participants worry that the working styles of John Thornton, the new company’s executive chair, and Mark Bristow, its CEO, will clash, leading to problems for the company down the line.

As we discussed earlier in the series, the resolution of the company’s dispute with the Tanzanian government could be another major catalyst for its stock.

To achieve further upside, the company will need to show more execution on its projects and resolve its disputes successfully.

2019-01-08	2019-01-08 15:31:08	NEM	Newmont Corporation	What Factors Are Affecting Analysts’ Earnings Estimates for GOLD?	"Is Barrick Worth a Look after Its Merger with Randgold?

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Factors affecting Barrick’s estimates

Barrick Gold (GOLD) significantly outperformed its peers in 2018. Its stock performance improved after the announcement of its merger with Randgold Resources. 

Most analysts are positive about the new company’s prospects following the merger. However, they’re waiting for the combined entity’s execution on its stated priorities and its resolution of other matters, such as its Tanzanian tax issues.

## Analysts’ revenue estimates

Wall Street analysts expect Barrick to see revenue of $7.3 billion in 2018, implying a 13.0% fall YoY (year-over-year). The company expects its production to fall 11.0% between 2017 and 2018. This expected fall in production has been the main driver of analysts’ lower revenue estimates for the company in 2018.

For 2019 and 2020, however, analysts expect Barrick’s revenue to rise 11.9% and 1.0%, respectively, due to the merger of Barrick and Randgold. Prior to the merger, Barrick’s revenue profile was on the decline.

Among Barrick’s close peers (GDX) (JNUG), Newmont Mining (NEM), Goldcorp (GG), Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM), and Kinross Gold (KGC) have strong production growth profiles.

## Earnings estimates

Analysts expect rather impressive growth in EBITDA for Barrick post-2018 due to merger synergies. While the company’s expected EBITDA for 2018 is $2.97 billion, implying a fall of 26% YoY, its growth in 2019 and 2020 is expected to be 11.1% and 10.2%, respectively, higher mainly due to the expectation of cost improvements in the new company.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Tanzanian tax dispute

One of the major overhangs on Barrick (GOLD) stock of late has been its subsidiary Acacia Mining’s issues with the Tanzanian government regarding taxes. The Tanzanian government banned mineral concentrate exports from the country in March 2017. It believed it wasn’t getting a fair share of profits from mining in the country.

On October 19, 2017, Barrick announced that it and the government had agreed on a framework for a new partnership between Acacia and the government. The partnership would include the sharing of economic benefits generated by Acacia on a 50-50 basis going forward. However, this framework has yet to be implemented, and the issues are still ongoing.

## Bristow on resolution

Mark Bristow, the CEO of the combined company, has expressed confidence that this conflict will be resolved. In a phone interview with Reuters, Bristow said that Barrick could buy the remainder of Acacia it doesn’t own or split the company among other options. He added, “This conflict has destroyed lots of value. We need to make sure there’s enough value to work out a solution that various interested and affected parties get something that’s fair and proper for them.”

## Bristow’s experience to come in handy

Bristow has experience in resolving tax and other issues with governments in Africa. Lately, many miners (GDX) (NUGT) have been facing issues related to resource nationalism and governments demanding increased shares of mining from their countries in Africa. This phenomenon has also affected the likes of Kinross Gold (KGC) and Newmont Mining (NEM).

Barrick expects more details on the resolution of the Tanzanian issue in the second week of February. In addition to a possible resolution, the company is expected to see a lot of other changes in February. It’s also reviewing the possible sale of a number of assets, and it could even acquire new assets.

We’ll discuss more about these changes and other portfolio restructuring initiatives in the next article.

The CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) reports the position of major players in the futures market through its COT (Commitment of Traders) report.  According to the COT report for the week ended June 26, 2018, money managers were barely net long on gold with just over 4,000 net speculative long contracts.  According to Commerzbank, “Short positions, in particular, were built up, which means speculative financial investors are currently betting heavily on falling prices.” For the week ended June 3, money managers kept their positions almost unchanged, which implies the lowest levels of net long positioning since late 2015 when gold prices dipped below $1,050 per ounce.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/2deb2639-47fa-359b-8000-35947fc138e6/does-speculative-positioning.html?.tsrc=rss

While these factors have helped gold, the US dollar is also attracting bids because of these factors, which has capped gold’s gains.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/37e0e3ad-d720-3b21-bcce-c40a970b4a18/why-investors-should-take-a.html?.tsrc=rss
