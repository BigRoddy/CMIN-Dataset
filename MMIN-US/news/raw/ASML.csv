2021-05-20	2021-05-20 13:58:39	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	Infineon Adds to Doubts About Europe’s Chipmaking Ambitions	(Bloomberg) -- The European Union’s plan to become a powerhouse in producing next-generation semiconductors will do little to help the region’s vital industries today, one of its biggest homegrown chipmakers said Thursday.“We think Europe should focus on bringing modern, but not state-of-the art technology” to meet local demand, Helmut Gassel, Infineon Technologies AG’s chief marketing officer, said in an interview.As chip shortages ripple through industry after industry -- preventing companies from fulfilling demand for products from cars to game consoles and refrigerators -- the EU wants to double its chip production to at least 20% of global supply in the next decade.Read More: Chip Crisis in ‘Danger Zone’ as Wait Times Reach New Record The approach aims to boost the design and production of 20-nanometer to 10-nanometer chips with the help of a European alliance of chipmakers, research centers and national governments. It would then target production below 5-nanometers down to 2-nanometers, an ambitious goal not yet reached by industry leaders Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co.But the goals for the cutting-edge chips that are more expensive to make have drawn skepticism from the industry. The decline of the region’s consumer electronics industry in recent decades has left Europe without obvious customers for the smallest and most powerful components. Carmakers, whose vehicles have room to hide older, bulkier chips, are where most of the demand for semiconductors lies for now. Only fully autonomous vehicles would eventually be able to take advantage of the higher computing power found in the more advanced chips, Gassel said. The German company is one of the world’s largest suppliers of automotive chips. “The vast majority, if not all of the components, in a car today and in the next five years to come, won’t take any benefit from anything below 20-nanometers,” said Gassel. “If your product doesn’t need the functionality, then you will not use it because every time you shrink” transistors on chips, the cost goes up exponentially. STMicroelectronics NV Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery has also distanced his company from the EU’s ambition. “If it’s about advanced technologies, we don’t have any reason to participate,” Chery told French news channel BFM TV this month. “That’s marginal to our activities.”Gassel said if the alliance’s plans were more targeted to the European ecosystem, including automotive, industrial and internet-of-things production, the company would be willing to participate.Read More: EU’s Breton Says Time to Fix ‘Naive’ Approach to Chip SupplySpeed NeedThe architect of the EU chip plan, Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton, pushed back at a press conference later on Thursday, saying his job is to “prepare for the next market and it will come sooner than we think.”For now, European chip suppliers were focused on car components as that’s where the market lies, said Breton. However, he said Europe will need very high-speed processors to power 5G wireless networks and so-called edge computing, where devices process data themselves instead of transmitting it back to a data center. Pointing to foreign companies like TSMC, Samsung and Intel Corp. that are already making plans to produce semiconductors below 5 nanometers, Breton said “if others see the market, I don’t see why, in Europe, we don’t see the market.”ASML Holding NV, the Dutch producer of chip manufacturing equipment, backed him up. The prospect of new innovations means it makes “perfect sense” to build a European production base, ASML Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink said at the press conference alongside Breton.(Adds Breton, ASML CEO reaction from 10th paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infineon-adds-doubts-europe-chipmaking-135839985.html?.tsrc=rss

Investors are naturally drawn to rising stocks – and while a particular equity’s past performance won’t ensure its future gains, momentum is a good indicator for determining price movements. Momentum trading – buying into stocks that shown solid gains and are likely to keep moving upward – is a sound strategy, but it does take some skill on the investor’s part. A savvy investor has to know how to differentiate between a true momentum stock and a fad. The key is in the profile. Investors can look for stocks that offer a combination of three factors: strong, sustained gains; highly optimistic ratings from Wall Street’s analysts; and an upside potential that points toward maintenance of further gains. Based on that profile, we’ve pulled up three momentum stocks using TipRanks’ database. Not only have all of the tickers amassed enough bullish calls from analysts to be given “Strong Buy” consensus ratings, but each could also see considerable share price appreciation. Kulicke And Soffa Industries (KLIC) Industrial tech is big business. Every digital device that we use, from smartphones and tablets to factory robots, depends on a linked series technical gadgets, giving tool makers and part manufacturers a sound foundation for true momentum. Kulicke and Soffa, KLIC, provides solutions for electronic assembly in a variety of industries, including the automotive, communications, computing, and consumer goods sectors. The company’s product portfolio includes a range of tools for advanced packaging, electronics assembly, lithography, and wire bonding. In the most recent quarterly report, for fiscal Q1 of 2021, KLIC reported $267.9 million at the top line, up 85% year-over-year. Income also gained, with EPS at 77 cents. This was more than triple the year-ago quarter’s 21 cents. The company attributed the strong quarter to increased demand in the second half of calendar year 2020. Looking forward, management expects to see continued growth, and set fiscal Q2 guidance at $300 million in revenue (+/- $20 million) and EPS of 88 cents (+/- 10%). Combining industry and high tech has been good for KLIC, whose stock has gained an impressive 143% in the past 12 months. Covering KLIC for B. Riley Securities, 5-star analyst Craig Ellis believes that the path is clear for continued momentum. “We boost F21&F22 estimates… with three factors sustaining a Buy. First, upstream secular and cyclical chip fundamentals should drive strong growth deep into C22, propelling upside estimate potential. Second, we believe new mini-LED and Advanced Packaging products remain on track for $100M of incremental F22 sales and greater LT. Third, near-term GM headwinds look temporal, and we expect progress toward 47.5% through F21/22 but model more conservatively,” Ellis noted. "" To this end, Ellis gives KLIC shares a Buy rating, and his $75 price target indicates confidence in a 26% upside for the coming year. (To watch Ellis’ track record, click here) While there are only three reviews on record for KLIC, they are unanimous – to Buy the stock. This shows that Ellis’ upbeat outlook is no outlier, and gives the stock its Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. (See KLIC stock analysis on TipRanks) ASML Holding (ASML) We'll stick with the high tech sector, and look at another provider of the tools that digital equipment manufacturers cannot live without. Specifically, ASML Holding designs and builds photolithography equipment, which is vital in the production of semiconductor chips. The company’s tools use optical imaging to impress circuit patterns on silicon wafers. This is the essential process in chip making, and ASML Holding has a 67% market share in its industry. It’s a niche industry, but it’s one of the few that truly does make the world go ‘round.' And ASML has profited mightily from its leading position. The stock is up 131% over the past 12 months. The Netherlands-based company posted these share gains against a background of rising revenues. The top line has increased in each of the last four quarter, reaching 4.4 billion Euro (US$5.26 billion) in Q1 of 2021. EPS came in at 3.21 Euro (US$3.86), more than triple the $1.02 recorded in 1Q20. In the first quarter, the company reported high customer demand, with bookings reaching 4.7 billion Euro (US$5.69 billion). Demand was especially strong in the Installed Base segment, as existing customers moved to upgrade software to meet their own increasing demand. In the background here is a semiconductor chip market that is seeing both increased demand and a severe supply shortage, as customers are racing to meet orders backlogged during the pandemic shutdowns and suppliers are racing to ramp up production from pandemic-induced low levels. With all of that in the background, BofA analyst Didier Scemama selected ASML as his top large cap pick in European semiconductors. “We expect ASML to benefit from multiple drivers incl. 1) Healthy competition among ASML customer base, confirming ASML status as a “weapon dealer” in the Intel/TSMC/Samsung process “war”, 2) Silicon sovereignty, driving EU/US to incentivize chipmakers to re-shore semis production and adding to China’s 2025 semis self-sufficiency ambitions, 3) EUV cycle: we model 21% sales CAGR ’20-25 driven by multiple, concurrent high-growth end-markets,” Scemama opined. Unsurprisingly, Scemama rates ASML a Buy, and his price target of $806 suggests an upside of 20% in the next 12 months. (To watch Scemama’s track record, click here) If we step back and look at the bigger picture, we can see that overall the stock has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus rating. In the last three months, the stock has received 4 Buy ratings and just 1 Hold. (See ASML stock analysis on TipRanks) Ashland (ASH) The third momentum pick, Ashland, inhabits the specialty chemical niche, producing a variety of necessary ingredients for a range of industries. The company products include adhesives, emulsifiers, and preservatives – to name just a few categories – and are used in the construction, coating, energy, food and beverage, health and wellness, packaging, pharmaceutical, and transportation industries. In short, Ashland is diversified. That diversification has helped the company to weather the corona crisis, and propelled it to a share gain of 62% in the last 12 months. These gains came even as the pandemic – and the associate market, production, and supply disruptions – pushed 2020 annual revenues down to $2.3 billion from the prior year’s $2.5 billion. In the most recent quarter, Q1 of fiscal 2021, Ashland reported $552 million at the top line. This was up 3.5% year-over-year, and beat the pre-earnings estimates by 1.6%. EPS came in at 99 cents per share, nearly double the 52 cents reported one year earlier – and 25% above expectations. Analyst John McNulty, weighing in on Ashland from BMO Capital, sees a clear path forward for the company. “We see solid upside to margins over the next few years, a focus on innovation/growth helping the top line and increased cash conversion... ASH continues to work towards improving its cost structure while also working to re-accelerate its top-line growth... Assuming management continues to execute and margins improve to 25%+ while the top-line growth improves to a mid-single-digit level, ASH should see earnings growth that significantly exceeds expectations while also enjoying multiple expansion.” the analyst commented. McNulty rates ASH shares as Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $115 price target implies a one-year upside of 22%. (To watch McNulty’s track record, click here) Wall Street’s analysts can be a contentious lot – but when they agree on a stock, it’s a positive sign for investors to take note. That’s the case here, as all of the recent reviews on ASH are to Buy, making the consensus rating a unanimous Strong Buy.

ASML Sees 2021 Sales Up 30% as Chip Shortage Boosts Demand	(Bloomberg) -- ASML Holding NV sharpened its full-year guidance as demand for its chip-making equipment soared during the global semiconductor shortage.The Dutch company, a crucial supplier to Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., said it now expects 2021 revenue growth of about 30% from a year ago, compared to a previous target of “double-digit” growth. It also said it expects the full-year gross margin to be between 51% and 52%.Shares rose as much as 5.8% in Amsterdam trading Wednesday and are up about 35% since the start of the year. ING Groep NV analyst Marc Hesselink called the full-year guidance a significant raise and said the results were “very strong,” in a note to investors.Key InsightsSecond-quarter revenue will rise to between 4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) and 4.1 billion euros, with a gross margin of about 49%, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Analysts on average had expected a sales forecast of 3.95 billion euros and a gross margin of 50.2%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.ASML reported first-quarter sales of 4.4 billion euros. That compares to the 4.03 billion-euro average estimate from analysts.“The main reason why it was above guidance is basically because of the market situation,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink said. “You just read the papers, chip shortages everywhere.”Wennink said customers installed ASML software to upgrade machines and make them more productive.The roll-out of 5G, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing is also fueling demand.ASML shipped nine of its newest EUV machines in the first quarter, but recognized revenue for seven, amounting to 1.1 billion euros.The company said it still expects total EUV system sales this year to be 30% higher than 2020 and plans to ship 55 systems next year.The advanced EUV machines are needed to make chips that are faster, cheaper and more efficient.Market ContextCarmakers have suffered the most from a global semiconductor shortage, but other industries, including telecom companies, are increasingly affected.TSMC last week boosted its capital expenditure plan for the year to $30 billion, from an earlier estimate of as much as $28 billion, and said the chip supply crunch may persist into 2022.Intel Corp. in March unveiled new plans to create a foundry business that will make chips for other companies.U.S., Europe and China are all seeking self-sufficiency in the production of cutting-edge semiconductors.“That will lead to higher capital intensity because it’s decoupling as a worldwide ecosystem, but it also leads to some capital inefficiency,” Wennink said. “There is a beneficiary of that capital inefficiency, and that’s us.”While ASML stands to benefit from the trend in the short-term, it has warned that it could take years for governments to change the existing global supply chain.ASML also has faced difficulty getting the Dutch government to renew a license to export its EUV systems to China amid ongoing trade tensions.Get MoreSee more of the company’s presentation here.(Updates with shares, analyst reaction in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asml-sees-2021-sales-30-061040886.html?.tsrc=rss

Our first-quarter net bookings came in at €4.7 billion, including €2.3 billion from EUV systems. ""Compared to three months ago, we are seeing a significant increase in demand across all market segments and our product portfolio. The build-up of the digital infrastructure with secular growth drivers such as 5G, AI and High-Performance Computing solutions fuels demand for advanced and mature nodes in Logic as well as Memory. We now expect revenue growth towards 30% in 2021 compared to last year,"" said ASML President and Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink. ASML expects second-quarter revenue between €4.0 billion and €4.1 billion with a gross margin around 49%, R&D costs of €650 million and SG&A costs of €175 million. The estimated annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 14% and 15% for 2021. Products and business highlights In our EUV business, we improved transmission of the pellicle to 90%, supporting higher output in high-volume manufacturing of our customers.In our DUV business, we achieved over 300 wafers per hour at ASML on a TWINSCAN NXT:1470. This is almost a 50% improvement versus the previous model (XT:1460). We completed the 100th DUV SNEP (System Node Extension Package) upgrade at a customer. The SNEP product offers customers a low-cost solution elevating system performance to align with our more advanced technologies, thereby extending the lifetime of the system. We achieved the milestone of the 1000th shipment of a TWINSCAN KrF system. In our Applications business, as demand for scanners continues to increase in both EUV and DUV, we expect demand for scanner control applications to grow in 2021 as well. The newly released YieldStar 385 is beginning to ramp up across our customer base. Share buyback program updateAs part of its financial policy to return excess cash to its shareholders through growing dividends and share buybacks, in January 2020, ASML announced a three-year share buyback program, to be executed within the 2020–2022 time frame. As part of this program, ASML intends to purchase shares up to €6 billion, which includes a total of up to 0.4 million shares to cover employee share plans. ASML intends to cancel the remainder of the shares repurchased. ASML purchased shares in Q1 for over €1.6 billion. The expected cash generation enables the opportunity for continuation of significant share buybacks in the coming quarters and therefore ASML expects an early completion of the current share buyback program.

ASML CEO Says Trying to Control Chip Sales to China Won’t Work	(Bloomberg) -- Export controls against China will not only fail to halt its technological progress but also hurt the U.S. economy, ASML Holding NV Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink said, after trade tensions between Washington and Beijing led to restrictions on the sale of the Dutch company’s advanced chip equipment to Chinese firms.“I believe that export controls are not the right way to manage your economic risks if you have determined that there is an economic risk,” Wennink said during an online industry event on Wednesday, arguing that if “you close China from access to technology, that will also cost non-Chinese economies a lot of jobs and a lot of income.”While it will take a long time for China to build its own semiconductor equipment and technology due to a lack of access to foreign technology, eventually non-Chinese companies will be shut out of one of the largest chip markets, Wennink said.If American business with China on semiconductors is cut off completely, it will probably cost anywhere between $80 billion to $100 billion in sales and 125,000 jobs in the U.S., Wennink added, citing U.S. Commerce Department estimates.ASML, which has a de facto monopoly on advanced extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment needed to make cutting-edge chips, is a crucial supplier to Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., but it has plans to drive deeper into China. Beijing wants to build a world-class home-grown chip industry to wean itself off foreign imports -- an effort that would need ASML’s one-of-a-kind EUV machines. Yet the company faced difficulty getting the Dutch government to renew a license to export the systems to China amid ongoing trade tensions.Wennink said in January that ASML hasn’t shipped its latest EUV machines to China because the request for an export license is still with the Dutch government, adding that there have been ongoing talks between Dutch, the European and the U.S. governments.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asml-ceo-says-trying-control-132050561.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-08	2021-04-08 21:01:18	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	The Chip Industry Has a Problem With Its Giant Carbon Footprint	(Bloomberg) -- Day and night, trucks arrive at the Southern Taiwan Science Park to pour concrete for what will become the world’s most advanced chip factory.It’s a giant undertaking that befits the out-sized ambitions of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s go-to chipmaker. The TSMC facility’s estimated cost of $20 billion is about three times that of Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. gigafactory near Berlin.It’ll have a carbon footprint to match.Demand for semiconductors is surging as life becomes increasingly digital, with chips the key component of applications from washing machines to artificial intelligence.But all that computing power comes at a cost. Silicon Valley talks a lot about sustainability, yet the reality is that chip-making is a hugely resource-intensive business.In an October 2020 paper, researchers led by Udit Gupta of Harvard University used publicly available sustainability reports from companies including TSMC, Intel Corp. and Apple Inc. to show that as computing becomes increasingly ubiquitous, “so does its environmental impact.”Information and computing technology is expected to account for as much as 20% of global energy demand by 2030, with hardware responsible for more of that footprint than the operation of a system, they found. “Chip manufacturing, as opposed to hardware use and energy consumption, accounts for most of the carbon output,” the researchers concluded.As implied by the title of the paper — “Chasing Carbon: The Elusive Environmental Footprint of Computing” — that’s a little-known fact, and an uncomfortable one for governments pushing high-end chip making.President Joe Biden’s drive to set up cutting-edge fabrication plants, or fabs, in the U.S. risks colliding with his climate friendly agenda, while the European Union’s plans to build chip production could test its commitment to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.Semiconductor companies broadly acknowledge there’s a footprint issue, although stress the actions they are taking to mitigate their emissions.There’s a paradox at play. The industry touts technological advances that have enabled chips to become incredibly powerful while operating with far greater efficiency, slashing energy use during their lifetime. Yet with billions of transistors now crowded on to a single chip, producing them is increasingly elaborate work.It takes three to four months for a disc of silicon to go through the multiple stages required to process them into the finished product. The wafers make their way along rows of machines that layer on microscopic materials, burn in patterns and scrape off the unneeded portions in procedures that are fully automated. Rinsing with huge amounts of ultrapure water is a key component. And with each new generation, more electricity, water and greenhouses gases are required.The upshot is that the most advanced chipmakers now have a larger carbon footprint than some traditionally more polluting industries. In 2019, for example, company disclosures show that Intel’s factories used more than three times as much water as Ford Motor Co.’s plants and created more than twice as much hazardous waste.“The general trend is the energy consumption is increasing, the water consumption is increasing as all chips become more and more complex,” said Marie Garcia Bardon, a senior researcher at the Imec nanotechnology center in Belgium who does pioneering work estimating aspects of the industry’s carbon footprint.Taiwan with its finite resources is on the horns of the dilemma that poses for both industry and government. TSMC is a major driver of the economy as well as a key player in efforts to overcome a global shortage of chips, hence a strategic asset as Taiwan seeks to keep China, which claims the democratically-governed set of islands at its own, at bay. At the same time, signs of environmental strain raise questions over Taiwan’s vulnerability to climate change — and that of the global semiconductor supply chain.Chip plants in Taiwan called in water trucks earlier this year to ensure supply during a drought caused by the absence of monsoon rains. TSMC’s water consumption has increased almost fivefold in the last decade, and in 2019 amounted to the equivalent of 79,000 full Olympic swimming pools.Power use is more dramatic still: TSMC’s annual electricity consumption is estimated by Greenpeace at 4.8% of Taiwan’s entire usage, and more than that of the capital, Taipei. Greenpeace says that will rise to rise to 7.2% once commercial production comes online of TSMC’s newest fabs that will shrink the process further from the current leading-edge of 5 nanometers, or billions of a meter, to 3nm chips.“For the future of Taiwan’s economic development, the biggest challenge that the electronics industry faces is whether it can bear the weight of its carbon emissions and electricity consumption,” researchers led by Kuei-tien Chou of the National Taiwan University wrote in a paper published in October 2019.TSMC is a key supplier to Apple, and it’s the iPhone maker’s commitment to become carbon neutral by 2030 that is driving much of the change throughout the supply chain. TSMC has pledged to be using 100% renewable energy by 2050, and in July last year signed a deal to buy the full output of a 920MW offshore wind farm to be built in the Taiwan Strait by Orsted AS of Denmark as part of Taiwan’s transition from coal.“TSMC continues to develop more advanced and efficient technologies to reduce energy/resource consumption and pollution per unit during the manufacturing process,” as well as during product use, the company said in a statement, adding that it will continue to increase its renewable energy use and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.The advent of environment, social and corporate governance, or ESG, is forcing chipmakers to respond, according to Kyle Harrison, an analyst at BloombergNEF. For many of them, “the risk is they could lose significant sources of revenue if they don’t start taking ESG reporting and decarbonization more seriously,” he said.The industry is keen to show how hard it’s working to address its emissions.Samsung Electronics Co., which with Intel is TSMC’s only rival at the cutting-edge of chip making, said in a statement that it went 100% renewable for all operations in the U.S., Europe and China, and is adding solar arrays and geothermal power generation to its South Korean campuses at Pyeongtaek and Hwaseong. It’s improving energy efficiency and reducing the use of harmful substances, CEO Kinam Kim said in March. SK Hynix Inc., also of South Korea, issued a $1 billion green bond earlier this year.Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, said that it was already among the top three users of renewable energy in the U.S., and that chip manufacturers have voluntarily reduced carbon emissions for more than 20 years. Intel treats and returns some 80% of the water it uses and has a goal to raise that to 100%.The risk, however, is the overall environmental impact still grows, as chips become a geopolitical pawn in U.S.-China tensions and countries rush to build more advanced fabs to increase self reliance.TSMC said on April 1 that it plans to spend $100 billion over the next three years to expand its fabrication capacity, while Samsung is committing $116 billion over a decade on its foundry business. Intel plans to build two more fabs at a cost of $20 billion in Arizona. China is pumping billions into trying to catch up, and many chipmakers don’t report their emissions.Both the industry and governments stress that semiconductors are key to cutting emissions through innovations such as efficient energy grids and electric vehicles. Digital technology can help reduce global emissions by 15% “and outweigh the emissions caused by the sector,” according to a spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU’s executive.A senior Biden administration official said the U.S. wants new chip facilities to be built where the energy they consume is clean power, such as solar or wind. The president has made his commitment to tackling the climate crisis clear, the official said, citing $35 billion for innovation to help establish the U.S. as a global leader in clean-energy technology.Still, it’s far from easy for big industry players to clean up chip making all the way down the chain.ASML Holding NV, which has a virtual monopoly on the lithography machines required to etch out the most advanced chips, is tackling its direct emissions by using renewable energy for its plants, recycling parts and and making technological advances that boost efficiency. It still projects its overall carbon footprint will grow through 2025 since most of its emissions are so-called scope 3, meaning a large proportion come from the use of its products by customers. In a candid assessment, ASML said in its 2020 annual report that meeting energy savings targets for its latest machines depend on overcoming “strategic technical challenges” that “are particularly tough to solve.”Gary Dickerson, chief executive officer of California-based Applied Materials Inc., the world’s largest maker of chip equipment, said the responsibility lies with industry leaders to ensure that advances made possible by semiconductors are sustainable.The world is “at the biggest inflection of our lifetimes,” he said, contrasting developments with the industrial revolution powered by coal and oil. “It had a very meaningful, positive impact on the world,” he said in an interview. “But the legacy is not so great from a climate change point.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chip-industry-problem-giant-carbon-210118303.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-01	2021-04-01 08:34:55	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	TSMC to Spend $100 Billion Over Three Years to Grow Capacity	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to spend $100 billion over the next three years to expand its chip fabrication capacity, a staggering financial commitment to address booming demand for new technologies.TSMC, the world’s leading manufacturer of advanced semiconductors, already planned a record capital expenditure of as much as $28 billion this year, but recent trends and developments have pushed for even more capacity. Now at the center of a global chip supply crunch, Taiwan’s biggest company has pledged to work with customers across industries to overcome a deluge of demand.Read more: See How a Chip Shortage Snarled Everything From Phones to Cars“TSMC expects to invest USD$100b over the next three years to increase capacity to support the manufacturing and R&D of advanced semiconductor technologies,” the company said in a statement responding to local media reports. “TSMC is working closely with our customers to address their needs in a sustainable manner.”TSMC suppliers surged on the news, buoyed in part also by Micron Technology Inc.’s bullish forecast. Screen Holdings Co. climbed 6%, Tokyo Electron Ltd. rose 4.7% and ASM International NV jumped as much as 5.4% while ASML Holding NV was as much as 3.2% higher on Thursday. TSMC’s own share price was up 2.6% on the day.It’s unclear how TSMC -- with $28 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet at the end of December -- intends to finance that record outlay, which underscores the enormous capital required to stay at the forefront of the industry. Relied on by everyone from Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. to Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., TSMC is the world’s go-to semiconductor foundry, or producer of chips designed by others. The silicon it churns out goes into practically every modern piece of electronics, from smartphones and smart fridges to connected cars.In a letter to customers obtained by Bloomberg News, TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei wrote that the company’s fabs have been “running at over 100% utilization over the past 12 months,” but demand still outpaced supply. Thousands of new employees are being hired and multiple new factories are under construction, he added, and TSMC will suspend wafer price reductions for a year from the start of 2022.Carmakers have been hit particularly hard by the chip shortages, with estimates for lost revenue of more than $60 billion this year. Ford Motor Co. just said it would temporarily suspend production at two plants that make its best-selling F-150 pickup. F-Series trucks are Ford’s biggest moneymakers and any lost production has a direct impact on the bottom line.Read more: Samsung Warns of Severe Chip Crunch While Delaying Key PhoneU.S. rival Intel Corp. in March announced plans to directly compete with TSMC for the business of manufacturing chips for other companies, with a $20 billion investment in two new factories in Arizona. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. is also spending in excess of $100 billion over a decade to expand its semiconductor business.(Updates with share reaction in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-spend-100-billion-over-020928049.html?.tsrc=rss

Here’s How the World’s Chip Shortage Is Playing Out for Stocks	(Bloomberg) -- A global semiconductor shortage has upended the supply of everyday devices from smartphones to gaming consoles to tech-dependent cars. With companies warning the issue may last into the second half, the fallout threatens to weigh on share prices for months to come.Since news broke in November that Apple Inc. faced a shortage of chips for its latest iPhone, warnings about the impact have been coming thick and fast. Truckmaker Volvo Group and electric-vehicle company Nio Inc. last week joined a long list of auto producers that have idled assembly lines.The lack of chips has been caused by booming demand for tech gear, in large part because of the pandemic, and winter weather in Texas and a fire in Japan have added to the problem. It’s been a boon for companies such as Applied Materials Inc. and Lam Research Corp. that produce the equipment semiconductor makers need to boost output.Here’s a look at the companies with the most at stake as the global chip shortage rages on, and how their stocks have been affected:AutomakersAuto stocks have come roaring back from their pandemic lows. Now both the chip shortage and concern over a resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic have pulled a Bloomberg index of global manufacturers down 14% from its Jan. 25 record high.Volvo Group slumped 7% Tuesday after saying it will have to suspend production due to the lack of semiconductors, while China’s Nio slid 4.8% Friday when it said it will stop output at a factory in Anhui province.A fire March 19 at a Japanese factory operated by Renesas Electronics Corp., one of the biggest makers of automotive chips, hit the industry hard. It triggered a 6.7% drop in General Motors Corp. shares over three days last week. In Japan, shares of Toyota Motor Corp., which touched a six-year high March 18, slumped 6.1% in the subsequent four sessions.“The automotive sector has arguably experienced the greatest level of disruption, with more and more OEMs either slowing production or closing manufacturing plants on a temporary basis,” said Thomas Fitzgerald, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management Ltd., referring to original equipment manufacturers.China’s Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. slid 19% over three days last week after reporting disappointing earnings. Daiwa Securities cited the chip shortage in downgrading the stock and cutting estimates for this year and next. China is dealing with unrelated chip-supply issues of its own.READ, Chip Shortage May Put Market-Beating Rally at Risk: Taking StockSmartphones, Consumer ElectronicsBeyond the auto industry, it’s harder to tease out the stock market impact on companies that depend on semiconductors. Shares of Apple, for example, didn’t react in November to the impact of the shortage, and they’re up more than 5% since then. Smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. slumped 4.4% Thursday after warning that parts shortages could slow its growth for the next few quarters.One positive aspect of the chip shortage: With demand for consumer electronics as strong as it is, it gives companies the power to raise prices and pass on higher costs, said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. “The share prices haven’t reacted particularly negatively to the news, and I think that’s because the important part is that you’re seeing a snapback in demand for these goods,” he said.Lenovo Group Ltd. said in August that its profit margins took a hit from the chip shortage, and in November it said it couldn’t fill all customer orders due to the lack of components. Still, demand for the company’s laptops is soaring because of purchases by people working at home, and the stock has doubled since August.Sony Corp. said last month it might be unable to fully sate demand for its new gaming console in 2021 because of production bottlenecks. The stock touched a 21-year high in February, though it’s dipped 8.2% since then.While Samsung Electronics Co.’s foundry business making chips for other companies benefits from the favorable supply-demand equation, the South Korean firm also has its own line of consumer products that are hurt. Samsung this month warned of problems, including the possible cancellation of the launch of its new Galaxy Note, one of its best-selling smartphone models.Makers of networking equipment also have been feeling the pinch. Analysts at Oddo BHF flagged a DigiTimes report that the lead times for deliveries of networking chips are extending to as long as 50 weeks, suggesting that the chip shortage has also reached the networking segment and will likely last into early next year.ChipmakersWhile automakers have struggled, the flip side of the semiconductor shortage is that the companies supplying those chips could see a boost to their business. Most semiconductor companies should report strong results for the first quarter and give good guidance for the second, said Janardan Menon, an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd.“This is all great news for the semiconductor vendor,” Liberum’s Menon said by phone. “This kind of tightness -- of capacity utilization, rising prices, very, very strong demand -- invariably means that their results are very, very strong.”However, Menon cautioned that share prices may not follow, given the market is now worried that the peak of the semiconductor cycle is approaching.European auto chip supplier Infineon Technologies AG is up 12% for the year while STMicroelectronics NV has gained just 5.6%. In the U.S., Texas Instruments Inc. is up 15%, while NXP Semiconductors NV and ON Semiconductor Corp. have done better, up 25% and 24% respectively, versus the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index’s 11% rise.There are also broader winners from the shortages in the semiconductor industry, with chip foundries such as leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. running at close to full capacity to try to keep up with the surge in demand. TSMC shares are down 12% from their record set Jan. 21 but are still up 11% on the year.Semiconductor-Equipment ManufacturersThe makers of equipment used to produce semiconductors are benefiting from the supply crunch as chipmakers rush to add capacity to their factories and governments concerned about national security risks are looking at measures to encourage local production. The combination has created a spending environment that some analysts say will benefit the industry for years.Applied Materials, the biggest equipment maker, has seen its shares double in the past six months, while Lam Research has gained 77% over the same period, nearly twice the return for the Philadelphia semiconductor index. ASML Holding NV is up 74%.TSMC committed to as much as $28 billion in capital spending in 2021, up from $17 billion the year before, while Intel Corp. unveiled a plan on March 23 to pour billions of dollars into production facilities.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-chip-shortage-playing-stocks-040000472.html?.tsrc=rss

Taiwan Probe Spurs Fears of China Poaching Top Chip Talent	(Bloomberg) -- An investigation into illegal talent poaching by Beijing-based Bitmain Technologies Ltd. has revived fears Chinese companies will target Taiwan’s top engineers as their country works to build a world-class chipmaking industry.Investigators descended on the offices of Bitmain’s two Taiwan units and interviewed 19 people Tuesday in a probe into whether the crypto-mining startup had violated local laws, according to Chang Jui-chuan, a spokeswoman for the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office. The Chinese firm, which develops semiconductors for mining and other purposes, is suspected of illegally recruiting hundreds of engineers from Taiwanese firms over a period of three years. Taiwan prohibits firms from China from doing business or recruiting locally without prior approval, a measure intended to limit the influence of its political rival.The accusations against Bitmain spur concerns that Chinese firms will accelerate efforts to hire away Taiwan’s best engineers in a bid to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency. Beijing has pledged to develop its own advanced chip manufacturing in order to dominate future technologies and cut its dependence on $300 billion of annual semiconductor imports.Read more: China to Pour More Money Into Chips, AI and 5G to Catch U.S.Taiwan’s deep pool of expertise revolves around Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s leading chip fabricator and a supplier to most American tech giants from Apple Inc. to Nvidia Corp. U.S. and European companies like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and ASML Holding NV have set up engineering hubs and research bases to tap local talent.“China’s poaching of Taiwanese engineers undermines Taiwan’s semiconductor industry,” said Carol Lin, a law professor at the Hsinchu-based National Chiao Tung University, which is now part of the newly formed National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. “Through the maneuver, Chinese competitors can learn about Taiwan companies’ progress. If these engineers bring trade secrets with them, Chinese rivals can have a firm grasp of Taiwan companies’ past success and failure in technological developments, and this could result in unfair competition and even endanger national security.”Beijing has denied Washington’s claims that it demands technology or talent transfers or targets the intellectual property of overseas firms. Bitmain representatives didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.Read more: The World Is Dangerously Dependent on Taiwan for SemiconductorsBitmain’s actions are suspected of breaching Taiwan’s Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, Chang said. An article in the act stipulates that for-profit Chinese firms cannot set up units in Taiwan and conduct business activities -- including headhunting -- without approval from Taiwanese authorities, she added.A separate press statement from Chang’s office, while not identifying Bitmain by name, shed light on the allegations. In order to develop artificial intelligence chips, the Chinese startup created a new entity in China with a Taiwanese engineer as chairman. This engineer then recruited colleagues from his former company in Taiwan and formed a headhunting team to set up a research and development center in Taiwan, according to the statement. Chang confirmed the company in the press release was Bitmain.The team offered potential recruits double their existing salaries and advertised openly on Taiwanese job sites, the prosecutors said. The country’s top chip designer MediaTek Inc., a major rival to Qualcomm Inc., was affected by Bitmain’s recruitment drive, Taiwan’s Apple Daily reported. A MediaTek representative declined to comment.Taiwanese executives have accused Chinese rivals of aggressive poaching for years. In 2018, Taiwanese DRAM maker Nanya Technology Corp. President Lee Pei-ing said some of his engineers were being offered three to five times their current salaries by Chinese competitors. The typical practice was to first lure away a manager who would then go on to recruit more of his former colleagues, according to Lee.Beyond talent poaching, global firms with operations in Taiwan and local officials have accused Chinese companies of technology theft. In 2019, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted five people for leaking tech belonging to German chemical maker BASF SE to Jiangyin Jianghua Microelectronics Materials Co., while Micron Technology Inc. has sued Taiwan’s United Microelectronics Corp. and its Chinese partner Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. for stealing trade secrets. Both Chinese companies have denied wrongdoing.Read more: Engineers Found Guilty of Stealing Micron Secrets for ChinaBitmain, the world’s largest crypto-mining equipment maker, has over the years tried to expand into AI chipmaking to cushion Bitcoin’s volatility, but the strategy divided its management.

China Revs Up Grand Chip Ambitions to Counter U.S. Blacklistings	(Bloomberg) -- In just two decades, China sent people into space, built its own aircraft carrier and developed a stealth fighter jet. Now the world’s youngest superpower is setting out to prove its capabilities once more -- this time in semiconductors.At stake is nothing less than the future of the world’s No. 2 economy. Beijing’s blueprint for chip supremacy is enshrined in a five-year economic vision to be unveiled during a summit of top leaders in the capital this week. It’s a multi-layered strategy both pragmatic and ambitious in scope, embracing aspirations to replace pivotal U.S. suppliers and fend off Washington, while molding homegrown champions in emergent technologies.China wants to build a coterie of technology giants that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., conferring the same priority on that effort as it accorded to building atomic capability. While specifics of that endeavor won’t emerge for months, comments by government officials, Party mouthpieces like the People’s Daily and state think-tanks provide important clues about the envisioned road map.Read more: Xi Mobilizes China for Tech Revolution to Cut Dependence on WestThe approach entails making do over the next five years or so with aging semiconductors that are adequate for electric cars and even military applications, but can’t run advanced smartphones and similar devices. That buys China time to focus on fields like so-called third-generation chipmaking in which no country yet dominates and -- Beijing hopes -- create an array of indigenous giants in areas including machinery, software and new materials. The ultimate goal is to groom local alternatives to global linchpins like Cadence Inc. and Synopsys Inc. in design software and Europe’s ASML Holding NV in chipmaking gear.“Semiconductors are a crucial sector in the information era that will lead the future of economic development,” Science & Technology Minister Wang Zhigang said at a press conference last week. “At the same time, China will strive to achieve self reliance and strengthen our own capabilities.”The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeChina’s efforts gained urgency because the Biden administration is escalating a battle against what it called “techno-autocracies.” That could extend or even expand blacklistings that banned key transactions with corporations from Huawei Technologies Co. to ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. To a country that imports $300 billion of chips annually, a worsening global shortage drives home the risk of relying on potentially hostile suppliers for the building blocks of everything from artificial intelligence to sixth-generation networking and autonomous vehicles.It will take years for local companies to match foreign counterparts in manufacturing and design expertise, during which there’s no ready answer to the dominance of Japanese and American names in chipmaking equipment. Chinese companies will still only supply 35% of its domestic demand by the end of this decade, IDC analyst Mario Morales estimates.They’ll also have to contend with Washington. The U.S. signaled it intends to go ahead with a Trump administration-proposed rule to secure the technology supply chain next month, a move that gives the Department of Commerce broad authority to prohibit transactions involving “foreign adversaries” like China.“The United States and its allies should utilize targeted export controls on high-end semiconductor manufacturing equipment ... to protect existing technical advantages and slow the advancement of China’s semiconductor industry,” the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, headed up by former Google chairman Eric Schmidt, recommended to Biden and Congress this week.Huawei, the country’s largest technology company by revenue, underscores the leverage Washington wields. Once the world’s biggest smartphone maker, Huawei was forced to sell its Honor division and run at close to minimum production capacity after it lost access to chips from the likes of TSMC under American regulations.Read more: China Said to Plan Broad Chip Sector Support to Fight Trump“It just stimulates the Chinese community to accelerate their internal developments and eventually they may come out even stronger,” said Luc Van den hove, president of the Imec research center in Leuven, Belgium, which focuses on innovation in semiconductor technology. “And I think that’s certainly a risk of trying to keep the two worlds further apart.”Read more: Biden Putting Tech, Not Troops, at Center of U.S.-China StrategyBeijing had set aside at the start of its last five-year plan around 1 trillion yuan ($155 billion) for potential investment in semiconductors over five to 10 years, according to McKinsey. It will now continue to bankroll research and investment in coming years, Wang said last week. China will increase fiscal support for scientific research and encourage leading companies to join national programs, he added. That should galvanize the much larger influx of private capital needed to produce genuine breakthroughs.It’s an approach that’s worked before for the internet, where a mix of government and private capital helped build the likes of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing Inc. In February, the state-backed Global Times reported smartphone makers Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo acquired stakes in Jiangsu Changjing Electronics Technology Co., exemplifying the sort of private-sector involvement Beijing’s counting on.When it comes to the chips, “we will see more support relative to private firms, because they play a bigger role in those sectors,” said Wendy Leutert, GLP-Ming Z. Mei Chair of Chinese Economics and Trade at Indiana University.Read more: The U.S.-China Conflict Over Chips Is About to Get UglierIn the meantime, up-and-comers such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and Tsinghua Unigroup can help tide the country over a deficit of mobile processors, memory and telecom modules should Washington close off supply routes. They will mainly operate mature processes of 14 nanometers and older, sufficient for all but the most exacting applications such as smartphones, high-performance computing and graphics processors. Meanwhile, global leader TSMC is ramping up for mass production of 3 nm chips in 2022, about five or six generations ahead.At the same time, they’ll act as focal points for the country’s most capable brains to work on stop-gap measures such as advanced packaging that can improve chip computing power in the absence of more sophisticated U.S. technology. The hope is that such fine-tuning buys time for the homegrown development of advanced technologies, such as in 7-nanometer chips and silicon design software.Some of the key local players in that space include Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment Co. and Naura Technology Group Co., who are working on equipment that can someday replace ASML’s extreme ultra-violet lithography or EUV machines -- a prerequisite for any advanced chipmaking.Local startups like Empyrean are trying to replicate the similarly indispensable software tools licensed by Synopsys and Cadence, employed by most of the world’s chip designers from Intel on down. Even in the commoditized realm of memory, a subsidiary of state-backed Tsinghua Unigroup is spending billions on mass production to challenge Samsung Electronics Co. and Micron Technology Inc.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysTSMC may lose market share in China in the next three years to local contract chipmakers such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International. These Chinese peers are accelerating advance-node technology development and will likely gain orders from local chip designers such as Will Semiconductor and Unisoc, which are trying to avoid dependence on U.S. technology due to bilateral trade tensions and the risk of sanctions.- Charles Shum and Masahiro Wakasugi, analystsClick here for the research.Read more: China Still Buying $300 Billion of Chips From U.S., ElsewherePresident Xi Jinping has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies ranging from wireless networks to AI. A big chunk of that is geared toward semiconductors.Chinese firms such as Tsinghua will be responsible for building half the world’s 30-odd new fabrication plants or fabs in the next two years alone. It’s already spending 2.4 times more than the U.S. on semiconductor equipment, much of it made by American companies, Morales wrote in a report.The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeThe bet is that its corporations can compete if they accelerate research into burgeoning, adjacent fields like AI and quantum computing now. That’s where third-generation chips come in. Those are mainly made of materials such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, can operate at high frequency and in higher power and temperature environments, with broad applications in fifth-generation radio frequency chips, military-grade radar and electric vehicles.The country may secure first-mover advantage, even if traditional silicon-based semiconductors will continue to account for the vast majority of global use for the foreseeable future, Citigroup analysts have said. U.S.-based Cree Inc. and Japan’s Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. are just beginning to grow this business, while Chinese rivals such as Sanan Optoelectronics Co. and state-owned China Electronics Technology Group Corp. have made inroads.The country’s other chipmakers, which include SMIC, Will Semiconductor Ltd. and National Silicon Industry Group Co., benefit more broadly from the state support.“The investment commitment that China is making ensures that the Chinese semiconductor ecosystem will continue to play an important role in the progress of our industry and the overall IT market,” said IDC’s Morales.(Updates with China’s comment on research in the 12th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-revs-grand-chip-ambitions-210000983.html?.tsrc=rss

Over the past month, the stock increased by 6.14%, and in the past year, by 82.77%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently higher from its 52 week high by 0.75%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings. Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries. ASML Holding Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 59.73 of the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. price to earnings ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance.

2021-02-03	2021-02-03 10:18:47	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	China Stockpiles Chips, Chip-Making Machines to Resist U.S.	(Bloomberg) -- China is taking decisive steps to protect itself from a widening U.S. technology ban, with imports of computer chips and the machines that make them surging last year.Chinese businesses bought almost $32 billion of equipment used to produce computer chips from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere, a 20% jump from 2019, a Bloomberg analysis of official trade data shows.And with companies like Huawei Technologies Co. stockpiling supplies ahead of U.S. sanctions, imports of computer chips climbed to almost $380 billion -- making up about 18% of all of China’s imports for the year.The U.S. has steadily restricted Chinese firms’ access to American technology, pushing Beijing to redouble efforts to develop a domestic chip industry after years of slow progress. The Trump administration’s actions exposed China’s vulnerability in this key sector -- and even with President Joe Biden now in office, Beijing is pushing ahead with a sweeping new plan to become self-sufficient in semiconductors.“In the near term, China is dependent on imports to advance its semiconductor manufacturing,” said Dan Wang, a technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics in Shanghai. “China does not yet have the capability to produce the advanced chipmaking equipment it needs. The country is investing heavily, but success will require more than a decade-long effort.”Chinese companies like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. have ramped up their purchases of the machines needed to make silicon wafers and computer chips. China became the largest market for such equipment in 2020, according to a December report from SEMI, an industry association.With Huawei and other tech companies stockpiling chips ahead of U.S. restrictions, imports surged about 14% in 2020. Huawei was blacklisted by the U.S. government, preventing it from buying the chips and other components from American suppliers it needs for smartphones and communications equipment. The Trump administration tightened rules even further to stop any company that uses American gear from supplying Huawei.China’s chip purchases also soared because of strong global demand for computers and work-from-home technology during the pandemic. A large portion of chips imported by China are assembled into devices from smartphones to laptops and then exported.One of the big winners of that surge in chip demand was Taiwan, with orders at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. and other firms climbing and Taiwan’s economic growth outpacing China’s for the first time in 30 years. Soaring demand also contributed to global shortages of chips for carmakers, forcing some auto plants to halt production.Demand should continue to increase this year, with the Semiconductor Industry Association forecasting in December that global chip sales would gain 8.4% this year, continuing to benefit firms like TSMC, Intel Corp., and Samsung Electronics Co. Chinese firms also will continue to buy equipment as they seek to produce more of their own semiconductors, likely helping the sales of companies like Tokyo Electron Ltd. and ASML Holding NV.“We expect that China will take a more balanced approach in chipsets imports, sourcing high-end chipsets that China is not able to manufacture for now from global vendors,” said Charlie Dai, a technology analyst at Forrester Research Inc. “China will also strategically make investment to accelerate the localization of high-end chipset manufacturing, which is all about addressing the geopolitical challenge.”Whether this bonanza for foreign technology companies lasts will depend on China’s success and pace in developing a self-sufficient semiconductor industry.The government will announce details of its five-year economic strategy in March, and has already cited self-reliance in technology as a national strategic goal. Central to that is China being able to manufacture its own chips and reduce reliance on foreign know-how. That, in turn, could see foreign companies losing their share of the Chinese market and domestic competitors becoming stronger.(Updates with analyst’s comment in 11th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-stockpiles-chips-chip-making-210000407.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-25	2021-01-25 21:06:20	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	The World Is Dangerously Dependent on Taiwan for Semiconductors	(Bloomberg) -- As China pushes the world to avoid official dealings with Taiwan, leaders across the globe are realizing just how dependent they’ve become on the island democracy.Taiwan, which China regards as a province, is being courted for its capacity to make leading-edge computer chips. That’s mostly down to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest foundry and go-to producer of chips for Apple Inc. smartphones, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.Taiwan’s role in the world economy largely existed below the radar, until it came to recent prominence as the auto industry suffered shortfalls in chips used for everything from parking sensors to reducing emissions. With carmakers including Germany’s Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. of the U.S. and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. forced to halt production and idle plants, Taiwan’s importance has suddenly become too big to ignore.U.S., European and Japanese automakers are lobbying their governments for help, with Taiwan and TSMC being asked to step in. Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron discussed the potential for shortages last year and agreed on the need to accelerate Europe’s push to develop its own chip industry, according to a French official with knowledge of the matter.The auto industry’s pleas illustrate how TSMC’s chip-making skills have handed Taiwan political and economic leverage in a world where technology is being enlisted in the great power rivalry between the U.S. and China -- a standoff unlikely to ease under the administration of Joe Biden.Taiwan’s grip on the semiconductor business -- despite being under constant threat of invasion by Beijing -- also represents a choke point in the global supply chain that’s giving new urgency to plans from Tokyo to Washington and Beijing to increase self-reliance.By dominating the U.S.-developed model of outsourcing chip manufacture, Taiwan “is potentially the most critical single point of failure in the entire semiconductor value chain,” said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of the technology and geopolitics project at Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung. The Trump administration exploited that pinch point to deny Beijing access to technology. By banning access to all U.S. chip technology including design, it was able to cut off the supply of semiconductors from TSMC and other foundries to Huawei Technologies, hobbling the advance of China’s biggest tech company.It also negotiated with TSMC to establish a $12 billion chip fabrication plant in Arizona. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. is set to follow, with a $10 billion facility in Austin, Texas.The “CHIPS for America Act” introduced to Congress last year aims to encourage more plants to be established in the U.S. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, plans to reintroduce the bipartisan bill this year with a view to securing $25 billion in federal funds and tax incentives. McCaul said in a statement he’s working with colleagues in the House and Senate “to prioritize getting the remaining provisions of CHIPS signed into law as quickly as possible.”News that Intel Corp., the onetime industry leader, was considering outsourcing production of some chips to TSMC under its former CEO underscored the need for a U.S. player that can fabricate at the leading edge, said a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee staff who is not authorized to speak publicly.The European Union aims to bolster the bloc’s “technological sovereignty” through an alliance armed initially with as much as 30 billion euros ($36 billion) of public-private investment to raise Europe’s share of the global chip market to 20% (without a target date) from less than 10% now.It’s also encouraging Taiwan to increase investments in the 27-nation bloc, with some success. GlobalWafers Co. -- based in TSMC’s hometown of Hsinchu -- just boosted its offer for Germany’s Siltronic AG to value the company at 4.4 billion euros, an acquisition that would create the world’s largest silicon wafer maker by revenue.That’s not to say Taiwan is the only player in the semiconductor supply chain. The U.S. still holds dominant positions, notably in chip design and electronic software tools; ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands has a monopoly on the machines needed to fabricate the best chips; Japan is a key supplier of equipment, chemicals and wafers.But as the emphasis shifts to ever smaller, more powerful chips that require less energy, TSMC is increasingly in a field of its own. And it’s helped Taiwan form a comprehensive ecosystem around it: ASE Technology Holding is the world’s top chip assembler, while MediaTek has become the largest smartphone chipset vendor.Tokyo, too, is attempting to attract TSMC to set up in Japan. With 110 billion yen ($1 billion) earmarked last year for R&D investment and another 90 billion yen for 2021, some of that may go to a TSMC facility, which reports have said the company is considering setting up in Japan.“TSMC is becoming more and more dominant,” said Kazumi Nishikawa, an official working on technology issues at Japan’s Economy Ministry. “This is something everybody in the chip industry must find a way to deal with.”China, in its five-year plan presented in October, is channeling help to the chip industry and other key technologies to the tune of $1.4 trillion through 2025. Yet even that kind of money doesn’t negate the need for Taiwan. Indeed, China has long tapped the island for chip-making talent; two key executives at China’s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., used to work at TSMC: co-Chief Executive Officer Liang Mong Song and Vice Chairman Chiang Shang-yi.But with Washington stymieing China’s progress, there is also speculation that Beijing could resort to stealing chip IP, with Taiwan at the heart of those endeavors.Taiwanese cyber security firm TeamT5 has observed a steady increase in attacks on the island’s chip industry corresponding to the tightening of U.S. export controls on China. While it’s not always possible to know if these are Chinese state actors, “they are all attacking the Taiwanese semiconductor industry,” Shui Lee, a T5 cyber threat analyst, said.Fellow analyst Linda Kuo said the Taiwanese government was alarmed by a ransomware attack on TSMC in 2018 and had announced plans for some $500 million to help the industry become more aware of cyber security issues.The greater worry is that TSMC’s chip factories could become collateral damage if China were to make good on threats to invade Taiwan if it moves toward independence.TSMC's capital spending of as much as $28 billion for this year suggests it's going to stay out in front.“Taiwan is the center of gravity of Chinese security policy,” said Mathieu Duchatel, director of the Asia program at the Institut Montaigne in Paris. Yet while Taiwan’s status in the global chip supply chain is a “huge strategic value,” it’s also a powerful reason for Beijing to stay away, said Duchatel, who’s just published a policy paper on China’s push for semiconductors.Assuming Taiwanese forces were to be overwhelmed during an invasion, “there is no reason why they would leave these facilities intact,” he said. And preserving the world’s most advanced fabs “is in the interests of everyone.”For all the moves to reel back domestic chip fabrication, it’s optimistic to think the supply chain for such a complex product as semiconductors could change in short order, Peter Wennink, ASML chief executive officer, told Bloomberg TV. “If you want to reallocate semiconductor build capacity, manufacturing capacity, you have to think in years,” he said.In the meantime, geopolitics means chip shortages could become a more regular occurrence, according to Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China.“This is going to move on to the point where actually because of export controls, because of governmental intervention, there will be all of a sudden supply chain disruptions not just because of capacity problems,” he told Bloomberg Television. “So better get prepared.” For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-dangerously-dependent-taiwan-semiconductors-210620534.html?.tsrc=rss

European Stocks Advance on Boost From Tech, Luxury Earnings	(Bloomberg) -- European equities were boosted by positive earnings reports, ranging from chip-gear maker ASML Holding NV to luxury products company Richemont.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.7% at the close. Tech shares rallied after ASML posted results that beat forecasts and announced a share buyback plan. High-end goods makers also climbed after Richemont reported a surge in Chinese revenue and Burberry Group Plc said it was encouraged by a strong performance in full-price sales.After rallying about 20% since the end of October on vaccine bets and Joe Biden’s U.S. election victory, European stocks have traded near their highest level in almost 11 months. Although tighter coronavirus-spurred restrictions have tempered bullishness, investors are seeking clues about the longer-term recovery as the earnings season gathers pace. They’re also betting on more stimulus after Biden was sworn in as president.“The earnings resilience that transpired from third-quarter results will extend” into the fourth quarter, Barclays Plc strategists including Emmanuel Cau wrote in a note. “New restrictions dampen the near-term outlook, but global growth is stronger than during the first lockdowns, while estimates have been cut sharply – we see room for positive surprises.”In Italy, the benchmark FTSE MIB Index rose 0.9% after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte survived a crucial Senate vote, but fell short of an outright majority.Among Stoxx 600 industry groups, carmakers and miners also outperformed, while utilities and consumer staples lagged, signaling an ongoing rotation into more economically sensitive cyclical shares and out of defensives.You want more news on this market?

Over the past month, the stock increased by 16.22%, and in the past year, by 87.41%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently above from its 52 week high by 0.20%.The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.View more earnings on ASMLDepending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.ASML Holding Inc. has a better P/E ratio of 57.28 than the aggregate P/E ratio of 57.11 of the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. Ideally, one might believe that ASML Holding Inc. might perform better in the future than it's industry group, but it's probable that the stock is overvalued.There are many limitations to P/E ratio.

2021-01-20	2021-01-20 12:36:59	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	ASML Beats Estimates, Grapples With Chip Supply Shortage	(Bloomberg) -- ASML Holding NV, a crucial supplier to Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, beat analyst expectations for the first quarter and is planning a significant share buyback in the first quarter, with U.S.-China tensions doing little to disrupt strong demand.Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink said ASML hasn’t shipped EUV machines to China because the request for an export license is still with the Dutch government. “There have been very deep, lengthy discussions between the Dutch, the European and the U.S. governments about the strategic nature of this technology. We don’t expect that the fundamental views of the U.S. towards China will change with the new administration. It is known that China is the big competitor.”ASML shares hit a record high in Amsterdam trading, rising as much as 4.1% to 457.85 euros.Key InsightsThe Dutch supplier of machines to make semiconductors expects revenue in the first quarter of 3.9 billion euros ($4.7 billion) to 4.1 billion euros, with a gross margin of as much as 51%, it said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts had expected sales of 3.52 billion euros and a gross margin of 49.3%.ASML is insulated from the pandemic-induced economic downturn as customers such as Intel Corp., Samsung and TSMC need its latest machines to make chips that are faster, cheaper and more efficient. Developments in artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and 5G wireless networks should support future demand.Still, the chip industry needs to deal with the global chip supply shortage that’s crippling automakers around the world, the CEO said.“This engine needs to start running again,” Wennink said in an interview with Bloomberg. “We start from an under-capacity view today. So we’ll just have to step up and ship more tools and more machines to get more semiconductor capacity out there.”In the fourth quarter, ASML shipped nine of its newest EUV machines and won orders for six EUV systems representing 1.1 billion euros. EUV machines are used to etch smaller circuits while increasing capacity and speed.The company expects total EUV system sales this year of 5.8 billion euros, 30% higher than 2020.“The build out of the digital infrastructure and the continued technology innovation is relevant to the consumer, automotive and industrial markets and drives demand across our entire product portfolio,” Wennink said.Market ReactionASML shares have risen 69% in the past 12 months, outpacing a 14% gain in the Stoxx Europe technology index.Get MoreASML kept its guidance for low double-digit revenue growth for 2021, and annual revenue at 15 billion euros to 24 billion euros through 2025.The Dutch company has repurchased 1.2 billion euros worth of shares under its 6 billion euro buyback program, running through 2022.(Updates with CEO comments from second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asml-beats-estimates-grapples-chip-123659059.html?.tsrc=rss

ASML expects first-quarter revenue between €3.9 billion and €4.1 billion with a gross margin between 50% and 51%, R&D costs of €620 million and SG&A costs of €165 million. The estimated annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 14% and 15% for 2021. Products and business highlights In our EUV business, we celebrated the milestone of the 100th EUV system shipment. By end 2020, 26 million wafers were exposed on our EUV installed base, of which 9 million in the fourth quarter. In our DUV business, we focused on meeting our customers' increasing demand for all DUV systems as well as on optimizing factory capacity, reducing the install cycle time and supporting the tools in the field for maximum productivity. While the first NXT:2050i systems took up to 120 days to build, at the end of last year we already showed build time capability of 60 days over the last five systems. We also shipped our first ArF dry system on the NXT platform (NXT:1470). On our Twinscan KrF platform, we shipped a record number of systems. The overall strong demand for DUV systems is confirmed by a record value of DUV bookings during 2020 (€7.3 billion). • In our Applications business, we shipped the first YieldStar 385 to a customer in Q4 and achieved a record year for YieldStar shipments. The YieldStar 385 offers the latest in-resist overlay and focus metrology, with enhanced throughput and accuracy, to meet N3 requirements. Compared to previous systems, key enhancements include a faster stage and faster wavelength switching, which enable highly accurate overlay measurements and tool matching using multiple wavelengths. We shipped three eScan1000 Multibeam systems in 2020. With 3x3 beams and high-speed stage technology, these systems provide up to 600% higher productivity than single beam systems, and will provide customers with early process integration capability. Dividend proposal and share buyback program updateASML intends to declare a total dividend in respect of 2020 of €2.75 per ordinary share. Recognizing the interim dividend of €1.20 per ordinary share paid in November 2020, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the General Meeting of €1.55 per ordinary share. This is a 15% increase compared to the 2019 total dividend of €2.40 per ordinary share. As part of its financial policy to return excess cash to its shareholders through growing dividends and share buybacks, in January 2020, ASML announced a new three-year share buyback program, to be executed within the 2020–2022 time frame. As part of this program, ASML intends to purchase shares up to €6 billion, which includes a total of up to 0.4 million shares to cover employee share plans. ASML intends to cancel the remainder of the shares repurchased. To date, €1.2 billion worth of shares has been repurchased under the current program.

2021-01-15	2021-01-15 01:30:03	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	TSMC’s $28 Billion Spending Blitz Ignites a Global Chip Rally	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. triggered a global chip stock rally after outlining plans to pour as much as $28 billion into capital spending this year, a staggering sum aimed at expanding its technological lead and constructing a plant in Arizona to serve key American customers.The envisioned spending spree sent chipmaking gear manufacturers surging from New York to Tokyo. Capital spending for 2021 is targeted at $25 billion to $28 billion, compared with $17.2 billion the previous year. About 80% of the outlay will be devoted to advanced processor technologies, suggesting TSMC anticipates a surge in business for cutting-edge chipmaking. Analysts expect Intel Corp., the world’s best-known chipmaker, to outsource manufacture to the likes of TSMC after a series of inhouse technology slip-ups.The sheer scale of TSMC’s envisioned budget -- more than half its projected revenue for the year -- underscores TSMC’s determination to maintain its dominance and supply its biggest American clients from Apple Inc. to Qualcomm Inc. At 52% of projected 2021 revenue, the chipmaker’s planned spending would be the sixth-highest among all companies with a value of more than $10 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The outlay may also ramp up pressure on Intel, whose budget for 2020 was roughly $14.5 billion.“The high capex guide is indicative of TSMC’s confidence in Intel’s outsourcing business,” Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a note. “TSMC’s track record also shows high capex always subsequently led to high growth.”The world’s largest contract chipmaker expects revenue of $12.7 billion to $13 billion this quarter, ahead of the $12.4 billion average of analyst estimates. That will power mid-teens sales growth this year, though that’s roughly half the pace of the increase in 2020.Net income in the quarter ended December climbed 23% to NT$142.8 billion ($5.1 billion), compared with the NT$137.2 billion average of analyst estimates, the chipmaker said Thursday. That contributed to a 50% increase in full-year profit, the speediest rate of expansion since 2010. Sales in the December quarter climbed 14% to a record NT$361.5 billion, according to previously disclosed monthly numbers, helped in part by robust demand for Apple’s new 5G iPhones.Read more: As Chip Rivals Struggle, TSMC Goes In for the Kill: Tim CulpanTSMC jumped as much as 5.6%, the most since July, to an all-time high in early Friday trade, extending a rally of more than 70% over the past year. Supplier Tokyo Electron Ltd. climbed more than 4%, while ASML Holding NV rose 5.9% on Thursday. Other semiconductor companies in the U.S. rallied on Thursday, with Applied Materials Inc. gaining almost 8% and Lam Research Corp up 6% in New York. Intel gained 4%.The fourth-quarter results revealed increasing contributions from TSMC’s most-advanced 5-nanometer process technology -- used to make Apple’s A14 chips. That accounted for about 20% of total revenue during the quarter, more than doubling its share from the previous three months, while 7nm represented 29%. By business segment, TSMC’s smartphone business contributed about 51% to revenue, while high-performance computing (HPC) was at 31%.As rivals like United Microelectronics Corp. fall behind and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. struggles with American sanctions, TSMC’s pivotal role is likely to expand in 2021. The company has been racing to meet demand from larger-volume electronics clients, exacerbating a severe shortage of automotive chips that’s forcing firms like Honda Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG to curtail production.TSMC said the automotive industry had been “soft” since 2018 and demand only started to recover in the fourth quarter. The company is working with its automotive customers to address the capacity supply issues, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said, though he didn’t elaborate when the bottlenecks that forced carmakers to cut production could be resolved.Read more: Missing Chips Snarl Car Production at Factories WorldwideExecutives didn’t address reports about potential orders from Intel on Thursday, saying that they don’t discuss specific customers. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker held talks with TSMC about making some of its best chips, people familiar have said, though it’s unclear whether the company may pivot after the appointment of Pat Gelsinger as its new CEO.“We believe Intel would not change its plans of CPU foundry outsourcing even with the CEO change,” Citigroup analysts wrote in a note, citing the time and costs associated with process qualification as well as the risk that U.S. chipmaker won’t get capacity from TSMC if it doesn’t book ahead. “In our view, Intel will be one of the major customers to first adopt 3nm for production. TSMC might start shipping 3nm wafers to Intel from early 3Q22.”Read more: Intel Talks With TSMC, Samsung to Outsource Some Chip ProductionConstruction on a planned $12 billion plant in the southwestern U.S. state of Arizona will begin this year, executives reiterated, without specifying how much of the planned budget for this year will be allocated to the project. The factory will be completed by 2024, with initial target output of 20,000 wafers per month, though the company envisions having a “mega scale production site” over the long term, Chairman Mark Liu said.Even as TSMC grows, foundries such as TSMC, UMC and Globalfoundries Inc. aren’t expanding fast enough to meet the pandemic-induced spike in demand for gadgets. Those bottlenecks snarled the flow of chips not just to cars, but also Xboxes and PlayStations and even certain iPhones. TSMC is by far the most advanced of the foundries responsible for making a significant portion of the world’s semiconductors, serving the likes of Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors NV, which also supply the mobile and auto industries.What Bloomberg Industries Says:TSMC’s $28 billion capital investment target for 2021 is 50% more than investors expected, and amounts to management’s strong vote of confidence in demand for smartphones and high-performance computing (HPC) chips over the next three years. The capital outlay target implies 2021 sales could leap to $56 billion, 4% higher than the $54 billion consensus expects, assuming 50% capital spending intensity.-- Charles Shum, analystClick here for the research(Adds analyst comments in fifth and 12th paragraph, latest share performance in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-spend-28-billion-2021-064820722.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-17	2020-11-17 01:02:06	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	Samsung Intensifies Chip Wars With Bet It Can Catch TSMC by 2022	(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. is pouring $116 billion into its next-generation chip business that includes fabricating silicon for external clients, betting it can finally close the gap on industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. as soon as two years from now.South Korea’s biggest company will mass-produce 3-nanometer chips in 2022, a senior executive at its foundry division told attendees at an invite-only event last month. That target, which hasn’t previously been reported, means it’s on a path to start churning out the industry’s most advanced semiconductors the same year as its Taiwanese rival expects to pass that milestone. Samsung is already developing initial design tools with key partners, Park Jae-hong, executive vice president of foundry design platform development, told conference delegates.If Samsung succeeds, that will be a breakthrough for its ambition to become the chipmaker of choice for the likes of Apple Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. that now rely on foundries like TSMC. The business isn’t new to Samsung, which was the first manufacturer of Apple’s A-series iPhone processors, but the company’s renewed push is now shepherded by billionaire heir Jay Y. Lee, who wants to see it establish tech leadership across advanced sectors like chipmaking and 5G networking to power its next phase of growth. Park’s comments suggest Samsung is accelerating its bid to compete with iPhone-chipmaker TSMC, one of the biggest beneficiaries of this year’s wave of stay-at-home demand for personal electronics.“To actively respond to market trends and lower the design barrier for competitive systems-on-chip development, we’ll keep innovating our cutting-edge process portfolio, while strengthening Samsung’s foundry ecosystem through close collaboration with partners,” Samsung’s Park told attendees, according to people at the event.Read more: Samsung Takes Another Step in $116 Billion Plan to Take on TSMCSamsung’s aim is in line with TSMC’s target of offering volume production of 3nm chips in the second half of 2022. But the Korean company also hopes to go one better by adopting what’s known as the Gate-All-Around technique, regarded by some as game-changing technology that can more precisely control current flows across channels, shrink chip areas and lower power consumption. TSMC had opted for the more established FinFET structure for its 3nm lines.“Samsung is catching up to TSMC very fast and it seeks to achieve dominance over its competitor by adopting the new technology for the first time,” said Rino Choi, a professor of materials science and engineering at Inha University. “However, if Samsung can’t improve production yields of the advanced node fast in an initial stage, it may lose money.”Already the world’s largest maker of computer memory and displays, Samsung wants a bigger share of the $250 billion foundry and logic-chip industry that’s set for accelerated growth with the advent of artificial intelligence and fifth-generation wireless technology. In 2019, TSMC controlled more than half of the contract chipmaking market while Samsung had just 18%, according to TrendForce data.Lee has taken a close interest in the matter. He flew to ASML Holding NV’s headquarters in the Netherlands last month to discuss supply of its extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, gear that’s indispensable to the creation of the most advanced semiconductors. Other top executives have toured major cities from San Jose to Munich and Shanghai, hosting foundry forums and negotiating deals.Some analysts question Samsung’s ability to carve out a significant share of a market dominated by TSMC, which spends some $17 billion annually to ensure it remains at the forefront of both technology and sheer capacity. For its part, Samsung’s semiconductor division plans to spend $26 billion on capital expenditure in 2020, but that’s been largely in support of its dominant memory business and not all of its expertise in making memory is directly relevant to creating advanced logic chips.Processors are more complex to manufacture than memory and their production yields are harder to control and scale up in the same way. Foundry customers also require bespoke solutions, imposing another barrier to rapid expansion and also making Samsung dependent on customers’ designs. But the Korean giant can draw confidence from its work with Nvidia Corp., whose chief executive officer sung the praises of collaborating with Samsung on customizing the manufacturing process for its latest graphics card silicon.The risks and initial setup costs have whittled down the number of companies capable of even competing in the EUV-based chipmaking industry. Intel Corp. this year announced it’ll consider outsourcing production of its most important chips for the first time, highlighting the complexities of the business and leaving Samsung and TSMC as the two major competitors. While Samsung has scored some marquee customers, TSMC’s long-standing relationships with clients allow for better coordination on design and manufacturing, leading to superior yields, said Sanjeev Rana, an analyst at CLSA Securities Korea.“In terms of chip performance, Samsung and TSMC are neck and neck,” Rana said. “Most smartphone, high-performance computing, high-end server applications need leading-edge process fabrication for performance and power efficiency reasons. This is where the competition between TSMC and Samsung comes into the picture.”Read more: Behind Samsung’s $116 Billion Bid for Chip SupremacyThe Korean company is making rapid advances, in part because even with TSMC’s deep pockets, the Taiwanese chipmaker cannot expand capacity quickly enough to satisfy all demand. Customers also prefer to use more than one foundry, which also works to Samsung’s advantage. The Korean company has already secured enough orders from major clients to keep its currently most-advanced 5nm process lines busy for the next few years, a company executive told Bloomberg News. The electronics giant increased its roster of semiconductor clients by 30% last year, according to another official. In recent months, Nvidia and IBM Corp. are among those that turned to Samsung for some of their chipmaking needs, while Qualcomm Inc. has reportedly awarded the company a 1 trillion won ($858 million) contract to build its flagship mobile processors.Samsung started up its first dedicated plant for EUV-based fabrication in the southern city of Hwaseong this year, while a second facility in Pyeongtaek is slated for mass production in the second half of 2021. The growth rate of its foundry business is expected to significantly exceed that of the market, which is likely to be in the high single-digits, Shawn Han, senior vice president of the semiconductor business, said during a recent earnings call. The GAA technology that Samsung’s chosen is expected to be adopt by TSMC for 2nm processes in 2024, but there’s a chance that schedule could be moved up to the second half of 2023, said Kim Young-soo, an analyst at SK Securities.“Technically, Samsung could turn the table in 2023 before TSMC kicks off the 2nm production,” Kim said. “There will be overflow orders of making application processor chips and edge computing devices. The key to expand the market share is how many EUV machines Samsung can secure.”Officials at Samsung believe the company has a competitive edge from its experience building both the chips and the devices that they go into, like Galaxy smartphones. It can foresee and address the engineering requirements of its clients. Samsung believes its other trump card is an ability to package memory and logic chips into a single module, improving power and space efficiency. But some companies may be wary about outsourcing production to a direct competitor. TSMC executives have from time to time highlighted the fact that the Taiwanese chipmaker doesn’t compete with any of its customers, a clear jab at Samsung.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-intensifies-chip-wars-bet-010206283.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-13	2020-11-13 15:00:14	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	A Look Into ASML's Price Over Earnings	In the current session, ASML Holding Inc. (NASDAQ: ASML) is trading at $420.27, after a 1.83% increase. Over the past month, the stock increased by 8.62%, and in the past year, by 53.68%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 0.22%.  The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. View more earnings on ASMLMost often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries. ASML Holding Inc. has a better P/E ratio of 43.93 than the aggregate P/E ratio of 40.66 of the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. Ideally, one might believe that ASML Holding Inc. might perform better in the future than it's industry group, but it's probable that the stock is overvalued.  There are many limitations to P/E ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-30	2020-10-30 03:30:24	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	In China, Big Tech Isn't the Enemy. It's the Strategy	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Beijing’s goal of building a self-reliant technology industry has been elevated to become a strategic pillar, part of the latest five-year plan setting out top national priorities. This means that China is redoubling efforts to wean itself off foreign companies, with the result likely to be a cohort of domestic giants and a slow freeze-out of overseas competitors.Just as the U.S. government starts looking to rein in, or even break up, big technology companies in the belief they have too much power, China is going in the opposite direction. We should expect to see more money, more policy favoritism, and more attention from party cadres aimed at ensuring the establishment of big successful chip and software firms.The Fifth Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party's 19th Central Committee wrapped up Thursday by tasking the nation to, among other things, develop self-reliance and build its technological power.The result will be a more insular approach to industry and trade as Beijing strengthens a robust domestic market for those up-and-coming heroes to ply their wares.Foreign companies — notably in semiconductors, software or materials — that still believe China is a viable long-term business are kidding themselves. Only those supplying crucial products and services not available locally will have any shot at sustained market access, and even then only until a domestic alternative comes along. Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. should take note. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. ought to be wary. Meanwhile, suppliers of the equipment, chemicals and software used to design and build chips should enjoy eating at the trough now, because the good times won’t last, if Beijing can help it.The likes of ASML Holding NV, Tokyo Electron Ltd., and Synopsys Inc. might see some growth years as Chinese companies lean on them to supply the core ingredients of a semiconductor industry, if the U.S. administration doesn’t get in their way to further stymie China’s advancement. But they’d be foolish to not understand that local rivals, backed by Beijing, are doing everything possible to replicate their products. Over the past decade, the government has done a lot to improve intellectual property enforcement and secure economic rights over technological innovation. Nonetheless, it would be a brave Chinese prosecutor or judge who sides with a big Western company over a local upstart in any case of alleged IP theft. I believe we’ve yet to see the next era of national champions emerge. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. have been the backbone of China’s internet development. Beijing would want to see their equivalents in semiconductors come forth. Huawei Technologies Co. fits the role, a fact that Washington recognizes by attempting to impede the Shenzhen company’s chip division HiSilicon. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. will also play a part, but after two decades it has still failed to match rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or United Microelectronics Corp. Then there’s a collection of state-backed chipmakers such as those in the orbit of the esteemed Tsinghua University.Yet the Alibaba of chips may not yet be born.It could be bubbling away in a small Shenzhen office, helmed by former HiSilicon execs determined not to give up their semiconductor dreams despite Washington’s pressure. Or the topic of Zoom calls among locked-down postgrads finishing up their American degrees and planning to return home. Or in the bank balance of a Taiwanese engineer, enticed by the promise of vast riches, after a decade of toiling away at TSMC.Whoever the next big Chinese tech giant is, you can be sure that Beijing has the money and determination to make sure it succeeds. At all costs. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-10-22	2020-10-22 17:42:36	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	The U.S.-China Conflict Over Chips Is About to Get Uglier	(Bloomberg) -- On a scorching hot day in late August, representatives of Taiwan’s government and industry crowded into the clinical cool of a state-of-the-art semiconductor facility for a symbolic moment in the global tech conflict.They were attending the opening ceremony for a training center built by Dutch company ASML Holding at a cost of about $16 million, small change for an industry used to spending $10 billion or more on a single advanced manufacturing plant.The real value of the site in the southern city of Tainan is strategic: It’s one of just two such facilities outside the Netherlands capable of training semiconductor engineers to fabricate cutting-edge chips on ASML machines. Fellow U.S. ally South Korea hosts the other — and Washington is working hard to ensure China never acquires the same technology.  As the U.S.-China confrontation takes root, the ability to craft chips for everything from artificial intelligence and data centers to autonomous cars and smartphones has become an issue of national security, injecting government into business decisions over where to manufacture chips and to whom to sell them. Those tensions could kick into overdrive as Communist Party leaders set a five-year plan that includes developing China’s domestic technology industry, notably its chip capabilities.Semiconductors made from silicon wafers mounted with billions of microscopic transistors are the basic component of modern digital life and the building blocks of innovation for the future. They are arguably one of the world’s most important industries, with sales of $412 billion last year; scale that up to the electronics industry that depends on chips, and it’s worth some $5.2 trillion globally, according to German manufacturers.Politics is roiling that business model, sparking a drive for more autonomy from the U.S. to China, Europe and Japan. “We’re in a new world where governments are more concerned about the security of their digital infrastructure and the resiliency of their supply chains,” said Jimmy Goodrich, vice president of global policy with the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association. “The techno-nationalist trends gaining traction in multiple capitals around the world are a challenge to the semiconductor industry.”At once highly globalized and yet concentrated in the hands of a few countries, the industry has choke points that the U.S. under the presidency of Donald Trump has sought to exploit in order to thwart China’s plans to become a world leader in chip production.Washington says Beijing can only achieve that goal through state subvention at the expense of U.S. industry, while furthering Communist Party access to high-tech tools for surveillance and repression. China rejects the allegations, accusing the U.S. of hypocrisy and acting out of political motivation.For both sides, Taiwan, which is responsible for some 70% of chips manufactured to order,  is the new front line.Beijing is increasingly hostile toward Taiwan, a democratically governed island it regards as its territory. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s status as the world’s largest contract chipmaker — a trend taking over the industry — the go-to supplier for Apple Inc. and the focus of next-generation chip-making, adds another dimension to China’s enmity, and to its standoff with the U.S.TSMC has become “turf that all geopolitical players want to secure,” founder Morris Chang said in November.Just a couple of kilometers from the new training center, cranes dot a massive construction site where TSMC is building “fabs” in which it will manufacture the most advanced chips in the world — chips that are no longer available to China’s Huawei Technologies due to U.S. export controls. Huawei used to be TSMC’s second-largest customer, accounting for 14% of sales; those shipments stopped in September.The White House has also imposed export restrictions on China’s largest chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., having already squashed Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., once among Beijing’s biggest hopes to climb the chip ladder. The U.S. is also reaching out to key players at home and abroad to ask them to reconsider their relations with China.  China’s intentions are so alarming to America because chips can be dual-use items with military applications, according to a former official familiar with the U.S. administration’s efforts. “They are the fundamental basis of our qualitative military advantage, from missiles to radars to submarines,” the official said.After decades when the industry was encouraged to go global, Trump is attempting to reel it back home. The CHIPS for America Act introduced to Congress in June aims to set up incentives to support semiconductor manufacturing and research in the U.S.One executive at a Chinese semiconductor company, asking not to be named due to commercial and political sensitivities, said three of its deals had been aborted because of concerns raised by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, which reviews the national security implications of transactions. Germany has also been effectively cut off, making any deals very difficult, the person said.China “firmly opposes the unjustified suppression” of its companies by the U.S. “under the weakest pretext of national security,” and will continue to defend them, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters in late September.China — the world’s biggest semiconductor market, accounting for more than 50% of all chips sold — isn’t standing by as its high-tech ambitions are kneecapped. That outsized demand means many major deals need Beijing’s sign-off: Qualcomm gave up its pursuit of NXP Semiconductors in 2018 after failing to win approval from China.China’s five-year plan for the chip industry will lend it the same strategic importance Beijing gave to its atomic bomb program. What's more, a law passed Oct. 17 may allow China to hit back at the U.S., with speculation that it could prompt export controls on rare earths used in chip production.Still, the rolling restrictions imposed by Trump haven’t just hit China’s chip capabilities but are upending the entire industry. And there’s scant sign of a climbdown, whoever wins the U.S. election in November.   Citing the need to promote “digital sovereignty,” the European Commission is exploring a 30 billion-euro ($35 billion) drive to raise Europe’s share of the world chip market to 20%, from less than 10% now.  Japan is also looking to bolster its domestic capacity. At least one Japanese delegation traveled to Taiwan in May and June this year in the hope of convincing TSMC to invest in Japan, a person with knowledge of the visit said. But TSMC announced in May that it was building a $12 billion facility in Arizona, and the company declined to receive any foreign visitors seeking to woo it, said another person familiar with the company’s thinking. Both asked not to be named discussing corporate strategy.Meanwhile South Korea, home to Samsung, the No. 1 memory chipmaker, is striving for more self-reliance after Japan imposed export curbs last year on chemicals used in semiconductor manufacture during a flare-up in the countries’ tensions over Japan’s wartime past.While the U.S. remains dominant with giants like Intel Corp and Qualcomm and a virtual monopoly on the software essential to chip design, “there’s no region in the world that can proclaim strategic autonomy in semiconductors,” said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of the Technology and Geopolitics project at Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung. “Take out any of these players and the value chain falls down.”In January, days before Trump signed an initial trade deal with China, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo sat down for dinner with around 30 CEOs in Silicon Valley. He was the guest of Keith Krach, a 30-year veteran of the tech scene who was appointed undersecretary for economic growth in June 2019.Pompeo had a message for them: China’s Communist Party “is a threat to your companies because they don’t want to compete, they want to put you out of business,” Krach recalled him saying, he told a virtual conference of the German Marshall Fund of the United States on Sept. 29.Trump may have weaponized the semiconductor value chain, but it was the Obama administration that first acted on the threat posed by China, unveiling a semiconductor strategy in January 2017 as one of its last acts. Trump picked up the baton, but the nature of the supply chain means that others are in the U.S. line of sight.Israel — a high-tech R&D hub where Intel is the largest private employer — exported semiconductors worth about $2.1 billion last year, with about half going to China, data compiled by UN Comtrade shows.That closeness to China risks becoming a liability. Zvika Orron, a partner at Israel’s Viola Ventures who leads semiconductor investing, said there’s a hesitancy on the Israeli side to look to China because of worry that Chinese funding could imperil future U.S. deals. Carice Witte, founder of the SIGNAL nonprofit focused on Israel-China ties, said the U.S. is bound to “start asking more questions.”The U.K. is another pinch point thanks to Arm Ltd., whose instruction set — the basic code that allows chips to communicate with software — underlies everything from smartphones to the world’s fastest supercomputer. Arm currently sells to China, but the company’s takeover by Nvidia Corp puts that business in doubt. If the $40 billion deal wins regulatory approval, Arm would become part of an American company, a development that has provoked concerns it would be even more subject to U.S. export controls. Nvidia and Arm have said the change of control won’t alter its status in that regard. While the U.K. government has yet to show its hand, it allowed the sale of Arm to Softbank of Japan in 2016, so wouldn’t normally be expected to intervene now. But the newly strategic nature of the industry has prompted lawmakers to call for a review of the deal’s implications. Here too there are concerns at being caught between the U.S. and China.Losing a world-class technology company to the U.S. for the Department of Justice to “weaponize” is not a good place to be, according to a person with knowledge of British national security considerations. The risk, they said, is a U.K. strategic asset becomes “recognized as part of the U.S. arsenal” in its campaign against China.Over the Taiwan Strait on mainland China, the mood at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference in Nanjing in late August was gloomy. Chinese executives worried what the Trump administration might do next to hobble Beijing’s progress.“The conflict remains very fluid, which makes it impossible to predict what next moves both sides are going to take,” said Huang Yan, application and sales director at Senodia Technology, a Shanghai-based chip design company that develops sensor chips for smartphones.China is on course to import $300 billion of semiconductors for the third straight year, underscoring its dependence on U.S. technology. That’s something President Xi Jinping is determined to end.Xi has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies from artificial intelligence to wireless networks. A focus of Beijing is to accelerate research into so-called third-generation semiconductors — circuits made of materials such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, a fledgling technology where no country dominates.Yet without silicon capabilities it will be difficult for China to build a proper semiconductor industry, said a senior TSMC official. Another person from a company involved in third-generation chip production said designing them is an art, and even poaching a team of designers won’t necessarily guarantee success.The consensus is it won’t be easy for China to catch up, especially at the cutting-edge where TSMC and Samsung are producing chips whose circuits are measured in single-digit nanometers, or billionths of a meter. SMIC would have to double annual research spending in the next two-to-three years just to prevent its technology gap with those companies widening, says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum.The tussle raises the prospect of a broader decoupling of the global industry with two distinct supply chains. As with 5G, the question then becomes one of the extent of each system: Does China’s high-tech gravity pull in Southeast Asia and parts of Europe, or is it confined to its immediate neighborhood? How many allies will side with the U.S.?To be sure, the chip industry is still thriving, with the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up about 30% this year. Geopolitics is now a feature of boardrooms, said the SIA’s Goodrich, but 5G and AI are likely to cause more market upheaval.The direction of travel still worries key players. Shares of Micron Technology Inc., the largest U.S. chipmaker, fell in September after it was forced to halt shipments to Huawei, its biggest customer.Complete decoupling would harm U.S. competitiveness and hurt China, raising the prospect of less money for R&D, slowing innovation, said Goodrich. “A world in which the U.S. and China are independent from one another is a negative outcome for everyone.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-china-conflict-over-chips-230112790.html?.tsrc=rss

Photolithography is the process in which a light source is used to expose circuit patterns from a photomask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a meaningful portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips. Chipmakers will require next-generation EUV lithography tools that have been in development by ASML to continue past the 10-nanometer process node. ASML's products are used at every major semiconductor manufacturer, including Intel, Samsung, and TSMC.See more from Benzinga  * Earnings Scheduled For July 15, 2020  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Joe Rogan Can't Fix Spotify's Biggest Flaw	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Europe has its first $50 billion internet company: Spotify Technology SA breached the mythical barrier on Thursday. While it’s a moment worth savoring, the Swedish company isn’t entirely deserving of the inflated price tag. Unfortunately, investors seem a little out of tune with the music streaming service’s real potential.The stock has more than doubled from a March low, spurred by an aggressive push into podcasting. Since May it has signed deals with podcasting giant Joe Rogan, Superman and Wonder Woman parent DC Comics and reality TV star Kim Kardashian, adding to acquisitions such as the $230 million deal for production house Gimlet Media Inc. Altogether, it’s a $1 billion bet on a flourishing industry.It’s nice to see a European tech company finally flying high. The continent has long bemoaned its lack of a consumer-internet company to rival the giants of Silicon Valley. The continent’s tech behemoths often struggle to capture the popular imagination: Germany’s SAP SE makes enterprise software, ASML Holding NV builds machines to make semiconductors and Amsterdam-based investor Prosus NV owes its 138 billion-euro ($155 billion) valuation to a 31% stake in Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. Spotify is a rare success.The podcasting strategy of Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek is shrewd, but alone it is not going to fix Spotify’s biggest problem: paying a giant slice of revenue to the record industry for royalties. That expenditure is why it has a pitiful (for an internet company) gross margin of just 25%.Yes, podcasts will reduce the Stockholm-based firm’s dependence on music for its income, allowing it to chase higher margin advertising dollars where it won’t have to pay a cent to the record labels. But advertising is still likely to remain a small slice of total revenue. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Amine Bensaid estimates ad revenue will account for just 12% of sales by 2022, up from 8% this year. The impact on the gross margin will be limited.For sure, Spotify is concentrating on the right trends. Revenue in the U.S. podcast market is set to double to $1.4 billion by 2024, and that will help Spotify’s business slowly become more like Netflix Inc. The video streaming giant pays a flat rate for content, meaning that every additional subscriber brings incremental profit.But investors are already valuing Spotify more generously than Netflix. Including cash and debt, it’s valued at 48 times the analyst consensus for its 2024 Ebitda, a measure of earnings. Netflix is valued at just 18 times expected 2024 Ebitda. Even using the most optimistic analyst estimate for that year, Spotify is valued at more than 22 times Ebitda. Investor expectations are out of kilter with reality.What’s more, deep-pocketed rivals such as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are also eagerly eyeing podcasts. Both firms have been seeking to develop more original shows, Bloomberg News has reported. Podcasting is a slightly different proposition for the two tech giants, since, if successful, they can subsequently be adapted for their video streaming offerings where Spotify doesn’t compete.

2020-06-08	2020-06-08 05:53:46	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	Huawei Employees See Dire Threat to Future From Latest Trump Salvo	(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration has fired multiple salvos against Huawei Technologies Co. since the start of a campaign to derail China’s technological ascendancy. The latest blow threatens to cripple the country’s tech champion.Huawei’s leafy campus in southern China has been engulfed in a state of emergency since the Commerce Department in May banned the sale of any silicon made with U.S. know-how -- striking at the heart of its semiconductor apparatus and aspirations in fields from artificial intelligence to mobile services. Its stockpiles of certain self-designed chips essential to telecom equipment will run out by early 2021, according to people familiar with the matter.Executives scurried between meetings in the days after the latest restrictions, according to one person who attended the discussions. But the company has so far failed to brainstorm a solution to the curbs, they added, asking not to be identified talking about private matters. While Huawei can buy off-the-shelf or commodity mobile chips from a third party like Samsung Electronics Co. or MediaTek Inc., it couldn’t possibly get enough and may have to make costly compromises on performance in basic products, they added.What Huawei’s brass fears is that Washington, after a year of Entity List sanctions that’ve failed to significantly curtail the company’s rapid growth, has finally figured out how to quash its ambitions. The latest curbs are the culmination of a concerted assault against China’s largest tech company that began years ago, when the White House tried to cut off the flow of American software and circuitry; lobbied allies from the U.K. to Australia to banish its network gear; even persuaded Canadian police to lock up the founder’s daughter. The latest measures however are a more surgical strike leveled at HiSilicon, the secretive division created 16 years ago to drive research into cutting-edge fields like AI inference chips. That unit surged in prominence precisely because it’s viewed as a savior in an era of American containment, and its silicon now matches rivals’ like Qualcomm Inc.’s and powers many of Huawei’s products: the Kirin for phones, Ascend for AI and Kunpeng for servers.Now that ambition is in doubt. Every chipmaker on the planet, from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to China’s own Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., needs gear from American outfits like Applied Materials Inc. to fabricate chipsets. Should Washington get serious about throttling that spigot, Huawei won’t be able to get any of the advanced silicon it designs into the real world -- stymieing efforts to craft its own processors for mobile devices and radio frequency chips for 5G base stations, to name just two of the most vital in-house components. Dubbed the Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule or DPR, Trump’s latest constraints have implications for China’s 5G rollout, for which Huawei is by far the dominant purveyor.The ban “focuses on HiSilicon-designed chips, which present the biggest threat to the U.S.,” Jefferies analyst Edison Lee wrote in late May. “The DPR could quash HiSilicon and then Huawei’s ability to make 5G network gears.”Read more: U.S.-China Fight Over Chip Kingpin Rattles Tech IndustryThe scene at Huawei’s Shenzhen nerve center invokes deja vu from a year ago, when Huawei billionaire Ren Zhengfei emerged from seclusion to declare his company’s survival in doubt. In the months following that proclamation, two things happened. U.S. companies, spooked by the prospect of losing billions, lobbied Washington for exceptions to the Entity List and suppliers from Intel Corp. to Micron Technology Inc. relocated assembly to increase foreign-produced components and continue supplying the Chinese company. Huawei employees -- spurred on by patriotism given perceptions the nation was under attack -- went to 24-hour days to design alternatives to American parts.The latest curbs could prove more effective because they remove Huawei’s chipmaker of choice from the equation. In theory, any chipmaker can petition the Commerce department for approval to ship Huawei-designed semiconductors, and opinion is divided on both sides of the Pacific as to how far the agency will allow shipments to proceed. But if it chooses to enforce the new curbs to the hilt, HiSilicon can no longer take its designs to TSMC or any foreign contract manufacturer. And local peers such as SMIC typically operate two generations behind TSMC.In fact, the latest curbs could severely disrupt production of some of the more critical and visible products in Huawei’s portfolio, including the Kirin brains and communications chips of future 5G phones, AI learning chips for its cloud services and servers and the most basic kinds of chips for networking. In February, Huawei touted how its next-generation antenna chips have been installed in “the industry’s highest-performance” 5G base stations. It may no longer able to ship those base stations after the chip inventory runs out.“HiSilicon won’t be able to continue its innovation any further until it’s able to find alternatives through self-development and collaboration with local ones, which will take years to mature,” said Charlie Dai, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. “We estimate that Huawei’s inventory of high-end chips (including baseband chips and CPUs for Huawei’s high-end smartphones) may last 12 to 18 months maximum.”Read about how Trump’s blacklisting of Huawei failed to halt its growth.Modern chip manufacturing at the highest levels simply cannot happen without American gear from the likes of Applied Materials, KLA Corp. and Lam Research Corp. Even in basic wafer fabrication, replacing TSMC is impossible because the Taiwanese foundry is the only company able to reliably make semiconductors using 7 nanometer or smaller nodes -- a must for high performance. Moving everything in-house -- essentially building an American-free plant -- is a pipe dream because it requires extreme ultraviolet lithography machines from ASML Holding NV -- a prerequisite for next-generation chipmaking. Yet ASML’s machines also use American technology from the likes of suppliers such as II-VI Inc. and Lumentum Holdings Inc, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The best Chinese alternative could be Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment, but its EUVs are again a few generations behind the Dutch firm’s.All that’s even before factoring in the uncertainty over Huawei’s access to design software developed by Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc. The pair provide electronic design automation (EDA) tools that Hisilicon’s engineers rely on to draw up blueprints for next-generation processors. As Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Nonproliferation Christopher Ford told reporters in late May: “If one wants to be working in the area of the very best chips, the chips that have the most computing power packed into the smallest space, it is necessary to use U.S. design tools right now because we have a commanding comparative advantage in that area.”“While there will be lots of opportunity to continue selling lesser quality chips to Huawei, this will be an additional challenge for the really good stuff,” he added.How Huawei Landed at the Center of Global Tech Tussle: QuickTakeIn the long run, the lack of consistent in-house chip supplies will disrupt China’s grand ambition of challenging the U.S. for global tech supremacy. More immediately, they threaten to curtail China’s crucial $500 billion 5G rollout -- a key piece of Beijing’s longer-term strategic vision.Huawei stands at the center of Beijing’s $1.4 trillion New Infrastructure initiative to seize the lead in 5G-based technology. Now it’s uncertain if it can even fulfill the 90-plus contracts it’s won so far to build networks for local operators like China Mobile Ltd. and other carriers around the world. That’s because HiSilicon’s chips are essential in products waiting to be shipped out. The uncertainty of not just fulfilling contracts -- but also around Huawei’s very ability to maintain clients’ networks once they’re up and running -- may also spook potential future customers.Internally, executives remain hopeful of finding a workaround, and are repeating the same mantra of a year ago -- doing without American technology isn’t impossible. “The good news is we still have time,” said one person involved in Huawei’s supply chain management. Chip architecture and supply “redesign takes time, but not something that can’t be done.”(Updates with table of Huawei’s chipmaking options after the tenth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-troops-see-dire-threat-210000676.html?.tsrc=rss

TSMC's Outlook Isn’t the News You Were Hoping For	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. just posted net income that beat estimates, showed fatter margins, and forecast revenue surpassing expectations. Pretty impressive in a world where the Covid-19 pandemic is hitting economies and industries from all sides.But that’s the end of the good news. The maker of chips for Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., and almost everyone else, also provided a series of bullet points to investors that should make the whole sector worry.Let’s compare the outlook from three months ago to what the company told investors Thursday afternoon.Then: Global semiconductor industry would climb 8%.(1) Now: “Flat to a slight decline.”   Then: The made-to-order foundry industry, which acts as a proxy for chip designers, would climb 17%. Now: Possibly half that, in the order of “high single digit to low teens” percentage.   Then: TSMC’s own growth would rise more than 20%.(2) Now: “Mid-high teen” growth.An important caveat to this revised outlook, which might be considered rosy given current uncertainties, is that it’s based on the pandemic stabilizing in June. Let’s hope we’re that lucky. Even in some places that have shown success in battling the disease, such as Singapore and South Korea, new cases continue to mount. Outbreaks could recur until a vaccine is found and widely deployed.Economically, many companies continue to believe things are better than they really are. In China, for example, some executives in the tech sector seem to think that they’re immune from the financial malaise that’s playing out in the rest of the world. It will catch up with them.TSMC hasn’t abandoned all hope, at least in the long term. It maintained its previous guidance for capital expenditure this year of as much as $16 billion, based on the belief that industry trends like the rollout of 5G networks and handsets in coming years will still justify its investment in new equipment.Much of this view comes down to an educated guess. But TSMC’s extensive client list and years of experience riding economic cycles make its predictive power better than almost anyone else.ASML Holding NV, a TSMC supplier and one of the world’s biggest makers of chip equipment, didn’t even dare Wednesday to predict what its revenue might be this quarter or year. Halfway through last quarter, Apple threw out its previous guidance and didn’t take a shot at a new one. Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei made clear that the new outlook was based on TSMC’s own read of the end-market for devices, not on any indication that its semiconductor clients were cutting orders. That’s an oblique way of saying that customers haven’t reduced purchases yet, but they probably will. The task now is for global technology companies such as Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia Corp., Xiaomi Corp. and Huawei to adjust to the new reality. Some haven’t: Xiaomi last month predicted that smartphones are a necessity and demand would rebound quickly. Heading into earnings season, investors ought to examine how executives handle this crisis through the same lens that we assess political leadership. As with the epidemic itself, those who are the quickest to face reality and work to mitigate the impact will stand the best chance of getting through it unscathed. The deniers may not be so fortunate.(1) This figure excludes the memory-chip sector, which is calculated separately.(2) TSMC had forecast &quot;several percentage points&quot; higher then the foundry sector.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-03-23	2020-03-23 05:00:00	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	Shielded from Pandemic, Work Continues in World’s Cleanest Room	(Bloomberg) -- A two-hour drive south of Amsterdam in Veldhoven, workers decked out head-to-toe in protective gear toil in vast assembly halls. Before entering the inner sanctuary of the facilities, they meticulously layer on masks, gloves and special socks. A single speck of dust or a hair can have devastating effects on production. The result of all this painstaking process is an environment that is 10,000 times more purified than outside.And as the coronavirus grips the world, it might just be the safest place to work right now.The teams belong to ASML Holding NV, which holds a de-facto monopoly on the industry of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines needed to make next-generation chips. Each cost about 150 million euros ($160 million) apiece and ship mainly to the U.S., Korea and Taiwan, where the likes of Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., known as TSMC, rely on them to make faster, cheaper and more energy efficient semiconductors.ASML manufacturing staff operate in an environment that is literally shielded from the coronavirus pandemic that has forced millions of workers around the world to isolate themselves from colleagues to slow the spread of the disease. As the rest of the Netherlands and much of the continent locks down, work in ASML’s Veldhoven clean-rooms has continued largely unhindered, potentially giving the company an edge for when corporate life returns to normal.“So far we have been able to keep our production going,” said Frits van Hout, ASML’s chief strategy officer, ASML. “The situation is of course dynamic. We encounter challenges as with every lockdown our suppliers will be affected, directly or indirectly.”Keeping DistanceLike other companies, ASML has also implemented a raft of contingency measures –from segmenting staff to drawing up plans if disaster strikes at a key supplier -- so it can keep manufacturing equipment for chip-makers around the world. Workers are split into two teams and are screened for virus symptoms via infrared thermal cameras at the entrance of the clean room in Veldhoven.Social distancing protocols are in effect, and the company has spaced out the morning and night shift to ensure the groups don’t meet, ASML said.Clean rooms are highly specialized infrastructure that’s costly to set up and maintain, making that kind of environment difficult to replicate in other industries. The biggest risk for the company lies not so much in its own operations seizing up but in a potential breakdown of its 5,000 suppliers, 790 of which provide materials and equipment that are used directly to produce the ASML systems.Besides its ultra-sanitized work environment, ASML has the benefit of making machines that are considered almost recession-proof, given its commanding lead in an industry on the cusp of another technological leap: high-speed 5G networks.On Track“Most customers want EUV and if ASML cannot deliver due to such a factor, then they know they have to wait until the next quarter because you cannot get it anywhere else,” said Marcel Achterberg, executive director of equity research at KBC Bank.The prized EUV machines are the size of a bus. Customers can order older equipment, but EUV delivers better resolution, smaller components and improved performance in the chips it produces.They’re a crucial source of revenue for ASML’s customers, too. By the end of next year, as much as half of TSMC’s revenue will depend at least partly on some EUV processes, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Masahiro Wakasugi.Volume production of TSMC’s most cutting-edge 5-nanometer chips, which use EUV, is still “on track” for the first half of 2020 as previously stated by management, TSMC spokeswoman Nina Kao saidFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shielded-pandemic-continues-world-cleanest-050000867.html?.tsrc=rss

Infineon Deal Scrutiny Raises Trade Threat to Europe Tech Firms	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. officials are dragging Europe’s technology industry more deeply into a trade war with China, threatening the region’s ability to create its own semiconductor giants.The Committee on Foreign Investment is urging President Trump to block Infineon Technologies AG’s $8.7 billion acquisition of Cypress Semiconductor Corp., claiming it poses a risk to national security, Bloomberg News first reported Thursday. Although it wasn’t clear what spooked Cfius, both Infineon and Cypress have Chinese customers including Huawei Technologies Co. Cfius is sensitive about deals allowing Chinese buyers to get their hands on advanced American technology.QuickTake: All About CFIUS, Trump’s Watchdog on China DealmakingEurope’s tech firms have tried to stay neutral in the power struggle. Semiconductor makers said earlier this year that they’d keep supplying Huawei after after a Trump’s administration order in May demanding U.S.-based companies stop. At the time a spokesman for Infineon said the majority of products it delivers to Huawei were not subject to U.S. restrictions.In recent months European lawmakers have pushed back against Trump’s calls to cut Huawei out of European telecom infrastructure. The U.K., France, and Germany are all looking to keep the door open to the Chinese telecom giant in some way, nubbing the U.S. view that Huawei could be a security risk. Italy, Croatia, Hungary and Switzerland have signed partnerships with Huawei.Huawei is Infineon’s sixth-largest customer accounting for about 2.4% of sales, according to supply chain data compiled by Bloomberg. Other Chinese buyers of Infineon products include iPhone-assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.“Obviously national security considerations are very important,” said Keily Blair, Partner at law firm Orrick. “It would be good to see an evidence-based approach in the U.S., similar to what we have seen in the U.K. with Huawei.”In 2017, Cfius blocked Infineon’s proposed deal for Wolfspeed, a semiconductor unit of U.S.-based Cree Inc. Aixtron SE’s planned sale to a Chinese-backed company collapsed in 2016 after U.S. opposition. Trump has also blocked Broadcom Inc.’s hostile takeover of Qualcomm Inc.“We have always been less sure about the regulatory approvals than Infineon management,” said Citigroup Inc. analyst Amit Harchandani, “given the number of recent cross-border deals failing to clear the regulatory hurdle.”The U.S. is also trying to dictate who European firms do business with. Dutch chip gear-maker ASML Holding NV has had difficulty renewing an export license to China following U.S. political pressure. The company wants to sell equipment to China that would help the company produce its own next-generation chips and help it wean itself off foreign imports.In January, U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands Pete Hoekstra told Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad that ASML’s technology “doesn’t belong in certain places,” suggesting China. The Chinese ambassador, Xu Hong, had warned days earlier in the same paper that the relationship between the Netherlands and China was at risk if the government blocks EUV machine exports.Other European tech deals are now in focus. British chip designer Dialog Semiconductor is another key figure in the European tech supply chain with Chinese customers and American acquisition targets. In February, it said it’d agreed to buy Santa Clara, California-based Adesto Technologies Corp. for about $380 million.Dialog’s biggest customer is Apple Inc., but Huawei is its third-largest with an exposure of about 2.1%. Dialog CEO Jalal Bagherli declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg on Friday.Although Cypress’s share price has collapsed following the report that Cfius is interested in the deal, some analysts believe all is not lost. “We believe mitigation conditions might still be an option and it would be premature to assume the deal is off,” said Citi’s Harchandani.“We believe worst-case we have a delay until the closing,” Vijay Rakesh, analyst at Mizuho Sescurites, said. A “potential delay or divestiture would be par for the course, but we see deal as mostly consummated.”\--With assistance from Nate Lanxon.To contact the reporters on this story: Giles Turner in London at gturner35@bloomberg.net;Sarah Syed in London at ssyed35@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Nate Lanxon, Amy ThomsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infineon-deal-scrutiny-raises-trade-122701502.html?.tsrc=rss

The Commerce Department is weighing rule changes that would let the agency ask for licenses from any companies that wanted to use U.S. equipment to make chips for Huawei Technologies Co., according to the WSJ report. &quot;This time around, the administration appears to be going after such [semiconductor capital-equipment] vendors like Applied Materials , KLA, Lam Research and Teradyne  that sell equipment to the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor ,&quot; wrote Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini. &quot;TSM uses such equipment to make chips for the likes of Apple  and Huawei. Perhaps the administration has realized they cannot restrict ASML , the key enabling vendor!&quot; Hosseini said that this potential development, along with the new coronavirus, represent near-term headwinds for chip-equipment companies.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/988e737c-f43c-30c2-81fc-f6365f8eccb0/lam-research%2C-kla-stocks-slip.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-02-18	2020-02-18 08:22:57	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	Tech Investors Jolted by Apple Pin Hopes on a Fast Turnaround	(Bloomberg) -- Tech stock futures fell as traders worked to price in the impact of a revenue shortfall at a company responsible for more than a tenth of the S&P 500’s gain over the last year.While Apple Inc. described the impact of the coronavirus on its sales as “temporary,” slips among big tech companies sit uneasily with investors who have watched many stocks soar 50% or more over the past 12 months. The iPhone maker has a 12% weighting in the Nasdaq 100 Index, which closed last week at 29.4 times annual earnings, the highest in a decade.“This will be an important test,” said Jason Browne, president of Alexis Investment Partners. “Obviously, Apple is a huge weight in major indexes, and one of the most loved companies by investors. That may help as it has generally been better to buy Apple on setbacks than to sell, especially if the market expects the disruption to be temporary.”March contracts on the S&P 500 fell 0.4% as of 8:06 a.m. in London. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 lost 0.9%. Exchange trading of individual U.S. shares has been closed since Friday for the Presidents’ Day holiday. Both the tech-heavy Nasdaq and Apple itself are already up more than 10% in 2020, after an 86% rally in Apple last year pushed the gauge to its best performance since 2009.In a Monday release, Apple said it doesn’t expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to work slowdowns and lower demand caused by the outbreak of novel coronavirus in China. The company had forecast revenue of $63 billion to $67 billion for the fiscal second quarter ending in March. Analysts on average estimated $65.23 billion.Equity traders face a difficult task in determining how much of the weakness is specific to Apple and whether to project the shortfall on the broader market. The company has always been likely to fare worse, given how much of its supply chain and consumer market are in China. At the same time, the sales warning is one of the most tangible examples of impact on a U.S. company and Apple’s size makes it capable of swaying indexes by itself.“My gut says I think the market probably expects this to some extent, and we know this market tends to look through things pretty well,” said Nathan Thooft, Manulife Asset Management’s head of global asset allocation. “People had anticipation that some of these companies would be affected by what was going on there and they certainly knew there were closures and supply chain issues.”While no rally is straight up, the one that has swollen Apple’s market value by as much as $545 billion since early August comes close, with only three down weeks in 21. The iPhone maker received 18% of its revenue from China in fiscal year 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg show, enough to keep analysts worried about the longer-term consequences of the outbreak.Apple’s news will have ramifications for a long list of semiconductors and other suppliers around the world. Its announcement came hours after Dow Jones reported that President Trump’s administration is considering new trade restrictions that would limit the use of U.S. equipment to produce chips for China’s Huawei Technologies Co.European equities opened lower on Tuesday, led by technology shares as the Stoxx 600 Technology Index fell as much as 1.6%. Semiconductor stocks tumbled, with ASML Holding NV falling 2.3%, STMicroelectronics NV dropping 2.6% and Infineon Technologies AG retreating 2.3%.“Of all the big companies exposed to China, this announcement seemed the most inevitable,” Michael Antonelli, managing director and market strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co, said by email. “What will this do to the market? It will remind investors that the risks surrounding the coronavirus are still unknown and unquantifiable. There will likely be an increase in volatility this week.”Apple’s most famous profit warning came in November 2018 amid the U.S. stock market’s worst stretch since the financial crisis. Its shares tumbled 7.1% on Nov. 2, 2018, after Apple reported stagnant iPhone sales and forecast revenue for the holiday quarter that fell short of Wall Street expectations at the midpoint. The Nasdaq 100 lost 1.5% that day.“We’ve been getting nothing but headlines about the virus for weeks. Starbucks is closing its stores, Caterpillar is shutting its facilities. Company after company has been saying this,” Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group, said by phone. “We have been expecting bad sales headlines, this isn’t good, but it’s not surprising.”To contact the reporters on this story: Sarah Ponczek in New York at sponczek2@bloomberg.net;Elena Popina in New York at epopina@bloomberg.net;Catherine Larkin in Chicago at clarkin4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Chris NagiFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-investors-jolted-apple-pin-014706936.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-22	2020-01-22 12:34:56	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	ASML Chief Dismisses U.S., China Tensions as a Headache	(Bloomberg) -- ASML Holding NV’s top executive brushed off concerns about tensions between the U.S. and China, a market that’s growing in importance to the Dutch chip gear-maker.“Someone needs to make those chips and to make those chips you would need EUV, and there is basically only one place where they can get it,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio, referring to its advanced lithography equipment. “For our total business it doesn’t really matter.“ASML, which has a monopoly on advanced lithography equipment needed to make next-generation chips, is already a crucial supplier to Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. but hopes to drive deeper into China. Beijing wants to build a world-class homegrown chip industry to wean itself off foreign imports -- an effort that would need ASML’s one-of-a-kind machines. Yet it’s faced difficulty getting the Dutch government to renew a license to export to China amid ongoing trade tensions.ASML shares rose 0.2% at 1:14 p.m. in Amsterdam trading.“It’s up to the Dutch government to determine whether there is a national security risk and of course there are views in the U.S. and China whether that’s a risk,” Wennink said, adding that the company has responded to requests for information from the Dutch government.Asked whether he was optimistic about obtaining the license, Wennink said “the Dutch government takes very due care when it concerns the facts and the circumstances.”Read more: China Stockpiles U.S. Chips as ‘Silicon Curtain’ DescendsChina relies on imported chip manufacturing equipment for its audacious ambition of creating a self-reliant semiconductor industry, which supplies key components for a wide spectrum of electronics from smartphones to satellites. ASML is an essential link in that plan, which will drive Chinese purchases of more than $30 billion of semiconductor equipment between 2020 and 2021, according to industry organization SEMI. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement last week the Netherlands should make an objective decision on ASML’s exports based on its own interests.U.S. PressureEuropean businesses have been caught in the middle of trade tensions between the U.S. and China, even as Washington and Beijing last week sealed the first phase of a trade deal. But the U.S. still maintains tariffs on roughly two-thirds of imports from China and both sides still need to negotiate the pact’s second phase, with discussions expected to be difficult.U.S. officials have urged allies to scrutinize business ties with Beijing, invoking concerns around national security and espionage. The White House, concerned about China’s ambitions to dominate a swath of technology from AI to semiconductors, has sought ways to contain the country’s rise. China, meanwhile, has threatened European countries with retaliation on trade if its companies are shunned.European telecom operators are among those squeezed between the two major world powers after Washington called on European governments to exclude Huawei Technologies Co.’s equipment from the build-out of their 5G networks.The Dutch government has held back on renewing the license ASML needs to export its extreme ultraviolet lithography machines under pressure from U.S. officials, Reuters reported this month. That equipment is key to any chipmaker that wants to fabricate next-generation chips, say of 7 nanometer or lower nodes.Last week, U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands Pete Hoekstra told Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad that ASML’s technology “doesn’t belong in certain places,” suggesting China. The Chinese ambassador, Xu Hong, had warned days earlier in the same paper that the relationship between the Netherlands and China was at risk if the government blocks EUV machine exports.For its part, the Netherlands says it will take its own decision on the matter, independent of foreign influence. “They are free to express their view and we take note of that, but it is not decisive,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said of the U.S. and Chinese ambassadors’ comments last week.ASML’s EUV technology has both civilian and military applications and therefore is subject to EU dual-use licensing obligations under the Wassenaar Arrangement, according to the Dutch Foreign Ministry.EUV LicenseWennink said at a press conference the Dutch government had asked the company questions about the EUV technology, how it works, and who the customer is. The level of detail the government is seeking “is probably more than they would normally do,” he said.The delay in getting the EUV license has “zero” impact on the company’s business, he said. The licensing issue concerns their first-ever EUV order from a customer in China, where few companies are at the stage of ordering the cutting-edge technology. ASML mostly ships the machines, which cost roughly 150 million euros, to the U.S., Korea and Taiwan.The company forecast first-quarter sales largely in line with analyst expectations and said it won orders for nine more of its EUV lithography machines in the last quarter. The Dutch company said it expects sales of 3.1 billion euros ($3.4 billion) to 3.3 billion euros for the first quarter, compared with an average estimate of 3.26 billion euros.ASML also announced a share buy-back program of as much as 6 billion euros over three years, as it said it expects to win 4.5 billion euros in EUV revenue this year.(Updates with CEO comments from the 15th paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Joost Akkermans and Gao Yuan.To contact the reporters on this story: Ellen Proper in Amsterdam at eproper@bloomberg.net;Natalia Drozdiak in Brussels at ndrozdiak1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Amy ThomsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asml-ceo-dismisses-u-china-075820550.html?.tsrc=rss

The $150 Million Machine With $200 Billion at Stake for China	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Huawei Technologies Co. has become very much the U.S.’s whipping boy in the battle to nip China’s technological ascendancy in the bud. President Donald Trump’s administration has slapped sanctions and curbs on the Shenzhen-based company and lobbied allies to do the same. Last month growing resistance against Huawei among lawmakers in Germany’s governing coalition sparked threats of retaliation from the Chinese ambassador. But what’s happening next door in the Netherlands has higher stakes for China. There, Beijing’s envoy this week said there will be negative consequences if the Dutch continue to block the export of a single piece of high-tech manufacturing equipment made by ASML Holding NV. According to Reuters, the U.S. has exerted pressure to prevent the sale to a Chinese firm. But it’s not just any machine. It’s a $150 million state-of-the-art apparatus that could ensure Moore’s Law — which says that processing power doubles every 18 months — continues apace, and the microchips powering our smartphones, computers and networks get ever smaller.Like with Huawei, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited intelligence concerns, though Reuters didn’t specify what they are. The Hague subsequently rescinded an export license it had previously granted for the machine.Any individual nation state cutting Huawei, the world’s largest networking business, out of the supply chain for its 5G networks will of course be a blow to the Chinese firm. But the impact on China as a whole will be limited. Beijing will still be able to build its own next-generation telecommunication networks, and losing a few exports will have a minor effect on the economy as a whole. Huawei’s sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa totaled $31 billion in 2018.A ban on buying machines from ASML is potentially far more significant, because it will hinder China’s ambitious goals to strengthen its super high-tech manufacturing industry.As far as tech giants go, ASML doesn’t have the global brand cachet of an Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. or Amazon.com Inc. That’s partly because its products are two steps removed from the electronic devices that reside in consumers’ pockets, on their desktops or in their living rooms: ASML builds the machines that make the semiconductors that go into their devices. But it’s one of Europe’s biggest three technology companies, and its top customers include chipmakers Intel Corp., Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which is known as TSMC and makes chips for Apple and Huawei alike.The Dutch firm stands out from rivals Nikon Corp. and Canon Inc. because it’s alone in having mastered an approach known as extreme ultraviolet lithography, which is needed for the manufacture of the next generation of chips. Lithography is the process by which circuit patterns are etched onto silicon wafers, and the EUV process will allow the printing of circuits that are more than 10 times smaller than the current standard.QuicktakeHow Chinese Technology Grew to Rival Silicon ValleySo you can see why China would be particularly interested in using ASML’s equipment. Although the country is a hub of electronics manufacturing, much of that is simply assembling iPhones, laptops, smart speakers and the like. The underlying tech is often imported, including some $200 billion-worth of semiconductors each year.Beijing wants to reduce that dependence on imports by investing $150 billion over a decade in an effort to take the lead in technology design and manufacturing. Access to machines made by ASML will be essential to achieving that. By the end of next year, as much as half of TSMC’s revenue will depend at least partly on some EUV processes, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Masahiro Wakasugi. That could be $18 billion worth of chips. TSMC said on Thursday that its deployment of EUV machines was on schedule, advancing at a similar rate to earlier technologies, as it reported earnings that exceeded analyst expectations.While it could take a decade and more than one EUV machine for Chinese firms such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. to rival that, that is clearly the long-term goal. (SMIC is reportedly the company that placed the order at the heart of the current spat.)Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad reported last year that ASML was the target of theft by a rival with ties to the Chinese state, though the company later said that any “suggestion that we were somehow victim of a national conspiracy is wrong.” Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink surely doesn’t want to lose China’s business: It’s ASML’s fastest-growing market.What makes the Dutch move so remarkable is that the U.S. can only unilaterally block sales abroad if components or R&D contributions originating domestically exceed 25% for the relevant product. Here, it seems to have succeeded in leaning on the Dutch government to prevent the sale even though, according to press reports, ASML’s extreme ultraviolet lithography machine doesn’t meet that test. An even greater risk would be that other important suppliers of underlying technology follow suit, whether under U.S. duress or not.(Adds TSMC comment on latest technology in fourth-to-last paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Tim Culpan.To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

Leading Fund Prefers Samsung to ASML as Asian Stocks Grow Cheap	(Bloomberg) -- A global equity fund manager has pared his stakes in expensive western stocks such as ASML Holding NV and now favors cheaper Asian shares including Samsung Electronics Co.The Dutch semiconductor equipment maker is a “super nice company” but was looking too pricey, said Klaus Ingemann, a portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein LP. Instead, he’s particularly bullish on Samsung, for which he sees further equity gains despite lingering concerns over stagnant DRAM chip prices.“We reduced our most expensive growth stocks,” the Ingemann said from Copenhagen. His main fund, which has assets of about $2 billion, has beaten 94% of peers over the past five years. “We have Microsoft a little in the portfolio, but some the higher-growth names in the U.S. were just too expensive. So we tried to be a little bit conservative.”Lately, Ingemann has been looking at cheaper companies in Asian nations like Japan, South Korea and Singapore. He favors a “neutral” strategy, balanced with value and growth shares with large to small market value across various sectors and regions.Shares of Samsung, South Korea’s most-valuable company, have rallied 33% this year on hopes for a recovery in global memory makers. And yet, it’s still trading at about 13 times estimated earnings for the next year, compared with 29 times for ASML.Samsung reported quarterly earnings that beat analyst estimates earlier this month and will release its detailed results Thursday.“Probably the demand is coming back in mid-next year,” Ingemann said. He expects a new smartphone cycle, 5G and re-acceleration of capital investment in cloud operations by Google and Amazon.com Inc. to be a boost. But that’s not all, he added. “There’s something interesting going on, as we see more cameras in self-driving, which will need more memory too.”To contact the reporter on this story: Heejin Kim in Seoul at hkim579@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lianting Tu at ltu4@bloomberg.net, Kurt Schussler, Cecile VannucciFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leading-fund-prefers-samsung-asml-200000715.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-21	2019-10-21 18:02:01	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	Semiconductor Stocks Are Breaking Out	As usual, last week's headlines were filled with anything but positive news. Trade war scares, partisan politics and out-of-context economic figures hid an incredible story. In this episode of Matt McCall's &quot;Moneyline&quot; podcast, he discusses what was at the heart of this silver lining: semiconductor stocks.Based off the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index, as tracked by the iShares PSLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), semiconductor stocks hit all-time highs last week, powered by a breakout in some big names. But almost no financial media outlets covered this success. Why? McCall uses this to illustrate the dangers in turning to the likes of CNBC and Fox Business for investment advice. Instead, just read the headlines for entertainment.So what had semiconductor stocks soaring? Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the way, reaching an 11-month high last week. Nvidia stock has several catalysts. The 5G rollout, data centers, high-tech gaming and self-driving cars all will use Nvidia chips. Additionally, with rumors of a U.S.-China trade war resolution on the way, any sign of peace could boost NVDA and its peers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut NVDA didn't lead the breakout alone. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) also contributed to last week's record. As 5G keeps growing, make sure to keep your eyes peeled on semiconductor stocks. McCall's Podcast﻿Unfortunately for investors, McCall argues that the financial press also obscured the truth behind September's retail sales numbers. Instead of focusing on the positives, many reported that September's sales were down 0.3% from August. But, year-over-year, September's numbers were up 4.1%.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before December's Meltdown True, auto sales and receipts at service stations both fell. But McCall points out that the service station figure most likely reflects cheaper gasoline. Plus, the core retail sales figure doesn't count those categories due to their historical volatility. On the brighter side, clothing and furniture sales were both up, as were sales from restaurants and bars. To McCall, one thing is very clear: The U.S. consumer is still very healthy.So instead of listening to the naysayers, do your own research. That's why McCall prefers to do his own boots-on-the-ground exploring. Through this practice, he's found several stocks to buy. One name is a growing star in the retail space -- and another sign the consumer is still happy and healthy.Tune into &quot;Moneyline&quot; for more information on Canadian-based Aritzia (OTCMKTS:ATZAF) and more insight on last week's gloomy headlines.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2019-10-17	2019-10-17 09:34:04	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	TSMC’s $15 Billion Splurge Galvanizes Hope of a 5G-Led Rebound	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s plan to spend as much as $15 billion on technology and capacity in 2019 -- roughly 50% higher than originally envisioned -- is spurring hopes that the dawn of fifth-generation networks will rev up global chip and smartphone demand.The primary chip supplier to Apple Inc. told investors it’s sharply increasing its estimate for 2019 capital expenditure to between $14 billion to $15 billion from as much as $11 billion previously, and Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said 2020 spending will be similar. The Taiwanese company also projected current-quarter revenue ahead of estimates, an affirmation that the latest iPhones have proven a hit with consumers.Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei sketched out hopes that the emergence of 5G, the foundation of future technologies from automated factories and smart homes to blazing-fast consumer electronics, will help underpin its business in coming years. TSMC, which is the world’s largest contract chipmaker, and is seen as a barometer for the tech industry thanks to its heft and place in the supply chain, said the advent of 5G-enabled smartphones will result in more chips in devices than before.“We are much more optimistic than six months ago,” Wei said, adding that the 5G momentum was larger than the company expected. TSMC has increased its forecast of the 5G smartphone penetration rate in 2020 to a percentage in the mid-teens from its previous single-digit estimate. Many countries, especially larger ones, were rapidly pushing ahead with 5G rollout plans, Wei added.Suppliers including ASML Holding NV, Applied Materials Inc. and Tokyo Electron Ltd. could stand to benefit from TSMC’s capex increase.In addition to 5G, TSMC’s push is driven by growing demand from tech giants such as Apple and Huawei Technologies Co., said Roger Sheng, a semiconductor analyst with Gartner.“Everyone is waiting to see a bounce back of global smartphone market next year after Apple adopts 5G. The self-designed Huawei chipsets will also push demand, as will Qualcomm’s 5nm chips for next year and AMD’s server chip demand,” Sheng said.Although the demand outlook remains uncertain for 2020, the global semiconductor market is set to make a gradual recovery on the back of the demand related to 5G, AI and automotive applications, according to a note from TrendForce on Oct. 2.On Thursday, TSMC also underlined expectations that Apple, its largest customer, is riding a bounce-back in demand for the iPhones after a lukewarm 2018 iteration. Lower prices and aging handsets are helping drive demand for the iPhone 11 range, and Apple is said to be asking its assemblers to target the high end of an original forecast for 70 million to 75 million unit shipments in 2019.The Taiwanese company foresees revenue of $10.2 billion to $10.3 billion in the pivotal December holiday quarter, surpassing an average projection for about $9.9 billion. TSMC gave that sales outlook after reporting net income of NT$101.1 billion ($3.3 billion) for the September quarter, handily beating estimates as the global chip market recovers.Still, fallout from ongoing trade conflicts could crimp an industry revival. While TSMC doesn’t factor trade conflicts into its capex plans, any international trade war will have a negative effect on the semiconductor sector, Wei said. China is an especially important market for TSMC and the semiconductor industry, he added.TSMC and its industry peers had grappled with a plateauing smartphone market, efforts by Apple to move beyond hardware, and U.S. tech-export curbs on No. 2 customer Huawei. But investors are growing more confident that the emergence of 5G will prop up chip prices and demand, while the latest iPhones are firing up consumers. TSMC is in fact straining against capacity constraints in the current quarter, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Mark Li said.The “iPhone is driving stronger near-term demand. We believe the competitive pricing of iPhone 11 is garnering good traction and has prompted Apple to place more orders at the supply chain,” Li said in an Oct. 10 note.Revenue was NT$293 billion according to previously reported sales data. Shares of TSMC climbed to a record in October on optimism over the latest iPhones. They closed about 1% lower ahead of the earnings report.To contact the reporters on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.net;Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-profit-beats-estimates-thanks-053547980.html?.tsrc=rss

Chip Gear-Maker ASML’s Sales Outlook Beats Analyst Estimates	(Bloomberg) -- ASML Holding NV forecast fourth-quarter sales ahead of analysts’ expectations, as Europe’s largest semiconductor equipment maker won orders for 23 more of its newest lithography machines.The Netherlands-based company, which has a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet-lithography equipment, predicts sales of 3.9 billion euros ($4.3 billion) for the fourth quarter, compared with an average estimate of 3.87 billion euros. A year earlier, ASML reported sales of 3.14 billion euros over that quarter.Shares of ASML fell as much as 2.1%. The shares has surged 77% so far this year through Tuesday, making ASML the fourth Dutch company with a market value of more than a 100 billion euros.Key InsightsASML, an important supplier to chip makers including Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., forecasts a gross margin of about 48% to 49% in the fourth quarter of the year, matching the average estimate for 48.8%.The 23 EUV orders in the third quarter contributed to the highest-ever value of bookings in one quarter, said Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink. “This strong order flow confirms the adoption of EUV in high volume manufacturing for Logic and Memory.”Wennink added he expects the Logic business to continue to be strong, driven by the leading-edge nodes supporting end-market technology and applications such as 5G and artificial intelligence, while the timing of the memory industry’s recovery remains uncertain.ASML locked in bookings worth of 5.1 billion euros in the last quarter.Analyst Comment“The order value really pops out, what is impressive amid the trade war and negative impact on electronics,” InsingerGilissen Bankiers analyst Jos Versteeg said by phone, “Such a strong growth does show how confident chip manufacturers are and that they do not want to miss the boat. I think the build-up to 5G leads to a considerable demand for semiconductors.”Know MoreThird-quarter sales came in at 2.99 billion euros, slightly below the average estimate of 3.01 billion euros. In the quarter, ASML shipped seven EUV systems, three of which were NXE:3400C, the higher productivity model.ASML newest machines, called extreme ultraviolet lithography systems or EUV, etch smaller circuits while increasing capacity and speed. EUV machines, about the size of a bus, cost more than 100 million euros each. ASML earns the bulk of its revenue in Asia.ASML models an annual revenue opportunity of 13 billion euros in 2020 and an annual revenue of between 15 billion euros and 24 billion euros through 2025, based on its positive view of technology drivers such as 5G communications, automotive, artificial intelligence and data centers. CEO Wennink said in the statement he continues to see 2019 as a growth year.What Bloomberg Intelligence says:Greater exposure to chip lithography equipment could help ASML achieve strong sales growth from 2020 onward, although sales and profit may temporarily drop in 2019. ASML is well-positioned as the only maker of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, for the next generation of chips for AI and 5G.(Updates with shares, analyst comment.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ellen Proper in Amsterdam at eproper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chip-gear-maker-asml-sales-062408333.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-11	2019-10-11 14:54:44	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	5 Semiconductor Stocks Worth Your Time	Like the rest of the broader markets, semiconductor stocks to buy have operated under a cloud of uncertainty this year. Although both sides of the U.S.-China trade war demonstrated some signs of thawing relations, recent developments suggest that this economic conflict has devolved to the worst point ever.As reported by multiple news agencies, the Trump administration earlier this week blacklisted 28 Chinese companies. Human rights concerns over Chinese treatment of the Uighur and other mostly Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region catapulted this decision. While the front-facing issue of protecting human rights is a noble one, it invariably complicates U.S.-China relations.Obviously, one of the worst impacted assets are semiconductor stocks. Following the announcement, the exchange-traded fund VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) took a sizable hit. As you know, several U.S. companies have robust relations with Chinese tech firms. China also represents a critical revenue pathway for American semis.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite the ugliness, a contrarian opportunity exists for those seeking semiconductor stocks to buy. No matter what happens with the global economy, semiconductors represent progress. By its very definition, progress moves forward, not backward.  * 10 Great Biotech Stocks to Buy in Q4 Granted, this sector features many threats which we'll discuss. Therefore, waiting for some of these names to come down would be an ideal move. But stay away altogether? I believe these five semiconductor stocks to buy have enough critical catalysts to survive this present onslaught. Lam Research (LRCX)Source: Shutterstock Typically, major semiconductor firms specialize in specific product categories, such as graphics processers. What makes Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) stand out among other semiconductor stocks is its versatility and indispensability. Lam specializes in wafer fabrication equipment and services. According to the company's website, &quot;nearly every advanced chip is built with Lam technology.&quot; Of course, this fact alone represents a long-term catalyst for LRCX stock.Moreover, this massive demand for the company's products and services is well reflected in the LRCX stock price. On a year-to-date basis, shares have gained over 73%. Better yet, this is a balanced rally. In the first half of this year, LRCX stock gained 42%. And in the second half so far, shares have increased in value by nearly 20%.While arguably most semiconductor stocks face incoming turmoil from the trade war mess, Lam may get a reprieve. Simply put, the company is too valuable for the global semi industry. Qorvo (QRVO)Source: Shutterstock Whenever individual investors face uncertainty, most financial advisors suggest portfolio diversity. Based on simple probabilities, you're more likely to have at least a few winners if you spread out your exposure. And among semiconductor stocks, Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) has its hands occupied with multiple industry subsegments, services, and products.But what really makes me excited about QRVO stock is its expertise in the connected auto segment. Several months ago, I upgraded my ride to a very modern variant. For me, the most distinct change in the driving experience had to be its connectivity. The modern dashboard is no longer merely an information conduit but a genuine computer. With Qorvo taking the lead in this arena, I have high hopes for QRVO stock.  * 10 Super Boring Stocks to Buy With Super Safe Returns Additionally, the tech firm specializes in radar, communications, and electronic warfare systems for the defense and aerospace industries. Given the rapidly devolving nature of our foreign policy, I'd say QRVO stock is a relevant pick. ASML Holding (ASML)Source: Shutterstock In life, there are two guarantees: death and taxes. With semiconductor stocks, we also have dual inevitabilities. Computer chips will decrease in size yet increase in performance. How this amazing trend continues to evolve year in and year out underlines the case for ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) and ASML stock.Specializing in a process called semiconductor lithography, ASML utilizes proprietary technologies to print distinct patterns on a silicon substrate. Another word for silicon substrate is wafer. What makes ASML stock indispensable in the broader computing industry is the above reference trend. Chips are getting increasingly smaller, which requires unthinkably acute and precise machinery for lithography.Therefore, I'm not at all surprised that ASML stock has a similar price trend to Lam Research shares. On a YTD basis, ASML has gained over 58%. Furthermore, ASML, like LRCX, has printed a balanced rally in 2019. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)Source: Shutterstock Shares of Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) have technically undergone what you might expect from semiconductor stocks. While SWKS stock enjoyed a mercurial lift starting in 2014, by the spring of the following year, the equity started to stall. Over the trailing four-year period, Skyworks hasn't moved much.Interestingly, though, SWKS stock has formed what I perceive to be a pennant formation. Starting from mid-April of this year to the present, SWKS has charted a series of lower highs but higher lows. Technical analysts believe that at the apex of this formation, the target equity will either break out or break down.  * 10 Cloud Stocks to Invest in the Future I believe the former is the more likely outcome. SWKS stock is all about the 5G rollout. Specifically, the company's next-generation transmitters are crucial for delivering 5G services to both residences and commercial buildings. Because this rollout will continue for several years throughout the world, you should keep Skyworks on your short list of semiconductor stocks to buy. Ambarella (AMBA)Source: Shutterstock Within this list of semiconductor stocks to buy, Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) is easily the riskiest. Due to the heightened tensions in U.S.-China relations, AMBA stock has unfortunately taken the brunt of the damage. In the Oct. 8 session - a day after the White House blacklisted 28 Chinese companies - shares tanked almost 10%.That one move immediately dropped AMBA stock below its 50-day moving average, a common barometer of nearer-term strength (or weakness). However, it's important to note that Ambarella shares are still inside a longer-term bullish trend channel. Fundamentally, the current volatility should prove to be a viable buying opportunity because of Ambarella's specialty: vision processors armed with artificial intelligence.These AI processors offer multiple applications. In my opinion, the most important is security. As this technology advances, operators will be able to identify and respond to threats before they strike. Anything that can prevent a 9/11-style attack is a worthwhile endeavor. Thus, I have zero issue backing AMBA stock among my semiconductor picks.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Tiny Japan Firm Helps to Crack Code for Next-Gen Computer Chips	(Bloomberg) -- Chipmakers have spent two decades pouring investment into a revolutionary new technique to push the limits of physics and cram more transistors onto slices of silicon. Now that technology is on the cusp of going mainstream, thanks to a secretive Japanese company that’s mastered the skill of manipulating light for applications from squid fishing to cinema projection.Ushio Inc. announced July it had cleared a key milestone, perfecting the powerful, ultra-precise lights needed to test chip designs based on extreme ultraviolet lithography or EUV, the process through which the next generation of semiconductors will be made. With that, the Japanese company became a major player in future chipmaking.“The infrastructure is now mostly ready,” Chief Executive Officer Koji Naito said in an interview. “Testing equipment was one of the things holding back EUV. With that piece in place, production efficiency and yields can go up.”Read more: How an Obscure Rubber Company Became a Linchpin of Tech IndustryUshio’s advances cement its position among a coterie of little-known Japanese companies indispensable to the production of the world’s consumer electronics. The Tokyo-based company developed a light source for equipment used to test what are known as masks: glass squares slightly bigger than a CD case that act as a stencil for chip designs. These templates have to be absolutely perfect, as even a tiny defect in one of them can render every chip in a large batch unusable.That’s where Ushio comes in. Its technology uses lasers to vaporize liquid tin into plasma and produce light closer in wavelength to X-rays than the spectrum visible to the human eye. That light helps chipmakers spot potential defects in the product. This process takes a room-sized machine that looks like a sci-fi death ray and requires a team of people to operate. After 15 years in development, the EUV business will start contributing to profit from the next fiscal year, Naito said, without giving further details.The move to EUV is the culmination of a decades-old trend. The push for smaller geometries that started when integrated circuits replaced vacuum tubes in the 1970s is approaching its final stages, and the number of companies that can compete in that space has been whittled down to a handful. Only Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have plans to use EUV to go smaller than the 7-nanometer processes that are the current cutting edge of CPU design. All three will use lithography machines from ASML Holding NV, and for a few specialist suppliers like Ushio, that means a chance to have a 100% share of their respective markets.“We don’t chase the mass market, even though there is potentially a ton of money to be made in home lighting or automotive,” Naito said. “Instead, we want to focus on niche areas and do things that others can’t.”Naito believes Ushio is positioned to control the market for light sources used in testing of patterned EUV masks, while a small group of fellow Japanese companies specialize in other aspects of the technology. JSR Corp. and Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Co., for instance, control production of the light-sensitive resins required to print the designs, while the blank masks are made by only two companies, AGC Inc. and Hoya Corp., which both use Lasertec Corp.’s machines to test for flaws. All are based in the greater Tokyo area and espouse an almost artisanal commitment to high-precision manufacturing.Why Japan and South Korea Have Their Own Trade War: QuickTakeThe fact that much of the EUV supply chain hails from a single country was seized upon by Japan in its trade spat with South Korea. Tokyo slapped export restrictions on key materials heading to Korea, giving undesired attention to companies that prefer to operate behind the scenes. While Ushio’s machines were not targeted, photo-resists made by JSR and Tokyo Ohka made the sanctions list. The government has since relented, but concern lingers that the industry’s delicate balance may be again disrupted in the future.“There hasn’t been a direct impact for us yet,” Naito said. “But because we have such a high market share for our products, we feel a responsibility to absolutely make sure our customers’ production lines do not stop.”Alongside its EUV ambitions, Ushio commands an 80% share of the market for lithography lamps used to make liquid crystal displays and controls 95% of the supply of excimer lamps used in silicon wafer cleaning. The key to its success is balancing mass production with craftsmanship. Materials like quartz glass are difficult to handle and have different thermal expansion properties from metals like the molybdenum in which they are housed. Some of the lamps still have to be finished by hand.“Wherever you have a manufacturing process that needs to shine a very bright light, you will find Ushio,” said Damian Thong, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.Ushio’s expertise also extends beyond semiconductors. Founded in 1964, it was the first Japanese company to develop and produce halogen lamps. From 1973, fishermen began to use its lights to catch squid -- -- a controversial technique in many countries. Finding new uses for its technology, from tanning salons to movie projectors, helped Ushio more than triple its sales over the past 25 years. The company is now experimenting with the use of sodium lamps to nurture plants and using ultraviolet light calibrated to such a precise wavelength as to kill bacteria without damaging human skin.“For Japanese firms with strong legacy manufacturing technology, the bigger danger is being trapped in them,” Thong said. “You have to give Ushio credit for moving further downstream, away from manufacturing toward something that requires more system integration.”To contact the reporters on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.net;Yuki Furukawa in Tokyo at yfurukawa13@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiny-japan-firm-helps-crack-210000575.html?.tsrc=rss

Naspers Says Prosus Unit to Be Valued at About $100 Billion	(Bloomberg) -- Naspers Ltd. said a newly created entity containing assets including a stake in Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. will be valued at about $100 billion.Africa’s largest company by market value received shareholder backing last week to proceed with the listing of Prosus NV in Amsterdam next month. Alongside the Tencent stake, the new company will hold businesses from Brazil to Germany in industries such as online food delivery and classified advertising.A value of $100 billion would make only Royal Dutch Shell Plc and consumer-goods giant Unilever bigger in Amsterdam by market capitalization. The company would overtake ASML Holding NV, a semiconductor gear-maker priced at about 80 billion euros ($89 billion).Naspers opted to spin off Prosus -- in which it will keep a 73% stake -- to ease its dominance of Johannesburg’s stock exchange and help reduce a valuation gap between the Cape Town-based company and its stake in Tencent. The new group’s assets were valued at about $34 billion as of end June, Naspers said in a statement on Monday.Naspers Looks to Invest in AI as Prosus Listing ApprovedNaspers shares erased gains after the publication of the anticipated market value of Prosus, and traded 0.1% higher at 3,421.11 rand as of 11:52 a.m. in Johannesburg.The stock could gain by a further 40% to 4,800 rand, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by JP Davids said in a note published Monday. “In addition to Tencent’s outperformance, we expect the recent compression in the holding company’s discount to be sustained as it reduces its South African sovereign exposure.”Prosus had net income of about $1.4 billion for the three months through June, compared with $1.1 billion the previous year, Naspers said.JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are the main financial advisers on the Prosus listing.(Updates with Amsterdam ranking in third paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Joost Akkermans.To contact the reporters on this story: Loni Prinsloo in Johannesburg at lprinsloo3@bloomberg.net;Renee Bonorchis in Johannesburg at rbonorchis@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rebecca Penty at rpenty@bloomberg.net, John Bowker, Frank ConnellyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/naspers-says-prosus-unit-valued-102005206.html?.tsrc=rss

Chipmakers Surge as Trade Truce Removes Key Overhang	(Bloomberg) -- Shares of semiconductor companies and other suppliers to Huawei Technologies Co. spiked on Monday, after President Donald Trump said he would delay trade restrictions against the China-based company, suggesting an easing to one of the biggest headwinds facing the group.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index jumped as much as 5%, putting the industry benchmark on track for its highest close since early May, as well as its fourth straight positive session. While the index is still about 4.3% below record levels, it has surged more than 17% off a low from late May. Among notable gainers, Western Digital Corp. spiked as much as 7.4% in what was set to be its 10th positive session, its longest rally since a 10-day gain that ended in March 2018. WDC, which gets about 4.3% of its revenue from Huawei, according to supply chain data compiled by Bloomberg, has surged nearly 41% over the 10-day rally.Micron Technology jumped 8.1%. The company gets 13% of its revenue from Huawei.Chipmakers were broadly higher across the globe, supported after the U.S. and China declared a truce in their trade war over the weekend. The industry has been highly correlated to this issue, given that China is both a major market for companies, as well as a critical part of their supply chains.Separately, Lam Research was up 3%, and U.S.-listed shares of ASML Holding NV rose 3.6%. Applied Materials rose 5.9%; the company earlier announced it would buy Kokusai Electric from KKR & Co. in a deal worth about $2.2 billion.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves wrote that he viewed the Huawei announcement “as a large positive for the semiconductor industry even though it is unclear if the lift will be permanent in nature.”He added that the implications of the announcement were “unclear for Nvidia, AMD and Analog Devices given that their products represent potential security risks.” Nevertheless, these names were were also among the day’s gainers.Nvidia rose 5.9%, Advanced Micro Devices climbed 5.5%, and Analog Devices gained 4.7%.Among other major Huawei suppliers, NeoPhotonics Corp. -- which gets nearly half its revenue from Huawei -- spiked nearly 22%. Lumentum Holdings jumped 9%; more than 18% of its revenue is derived from Huawei.Semiconductor stocks have performed well throughout the first half of 2019, despite waning optimism that they could see improvements in such key issues as demand, pricing and inventory levels over the remainder of the year.(Updates trading to market open throughout, adds chart.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Vlastelica in New York at rvlastelica1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven Fromm, Janet FreundFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chipmakers-surge-trade-truce-removes-135749334.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-07-01	2019-07-01 08:13:14	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	European Tech Stocks Reach One-Year High on U.S.-China Truce	(Bloomberg) -- European technology stocks reached the highest level since June 2018 after the U.S. and China signaled a truce in the trade dispute, and the U.S. said it would permit some companies to do business with blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co.Chipmakers in Europe have taken a hit since the U.S. blacklisted China's Huawei and scores of its affiliates around the world in May. That decision also exacerbated trade tensions between the U.S. and China, hurting chipmakers since China is a key end market for their components. Two silicon wafer companies, the U.K.’s IQE Plc and Germany’s Siltronic AG, both warned last month about the impact of the ban, and the broader effect of the trade war on the semiconductor sector.The Stoxx 600 Technology sub-index rose as much as 2.5%, the most intraday since April 24, with semiconductor firms leading the charge. AMS AG, STMicroelectronics and Infineon Technologies AG all surged, as did chip equipment makers like ASML Holding NV and ASM International NV.Conversely, telecoms equipment groups Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB have benefited from the blacklisting of Huawei as it removed a key competitor for contracts to build the next generation of 5G mobile networks. Those two were among the worst performers in a mostly green tech sector on Monday morning.Here’s what analysts are saying:CowenCurtailing restrictions on Huawei “could temporarily improve sentiment” on the semiconductor capital equipment group. Although most of these companies, such as ASML and Applied Materials Inc., don’t sell directly to Huawei, they’ve been affected by recent semiconductor supply chain disruptions, the analysts said.Morgan Stanley“A resumption in trade talks is a step in the right direction, although it will not cure the fundamental problem of weaker demand and excess inventory that continues to plague semis. A resolution on trade could provide an important catalyst to help demand, but as of right now it feels like status quo.”Oddo“The readacross is positive for the smartphone market and the semiconductor market as the U.S. and China converge toward a deal. The halt on additional tariffs should also bring some stability to the semiconductor market.”Liberum“These moves are positive for the entire tech industry, especially semiconductor suppliers. The semiconductor down cycle is currently at its trough” with a new up cycle expected to start from the second half of the year, the analysts said.“The removal of sanctions on Huawei and the holding off of additional tariffs is likely to strengthen the recovery in coming months.’’New Street“First of all, it is worth noting this is not a full lift; tensions will remain. Second, it means China will accelerate the development of alternative supply chains and ecosystems. It means investments will probably accelerate, to the benefit of the semicap equipment industry.’’“On the 5G front, it means things will get back into motion. Huawei will likely lose some market share in Europe, where operators will continue to buy from Huawei but reduce exposure to the vendor, while European players will likely lose ground in China in similar magnitude.’’Baader Helvea“The positive element certainly is Trump’s softened stance on Huawei, which has not been expected ahead of the meeting. This may raise hopes that a technology war can be averted. However, the Huawei issue will probably be part of any trade deal and may only be addressed at a later stage when other stumbling stones have been resolved.’’(Adds analyst comments.)To contact the reporters on this story: Sam Unsted in London at sunsted@bloomberg.net;Kasper Viita in London at kviita1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Beth Mellor at bmellor@bloomberg.net, Monica Houston-WaeschFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/european-tech-stocks-reach-one-081314134.html?.tsrc=rss

After hitting two-year lows last month, the STOXX 600 has  regained some ground so far this year with investors lured back  by cheap valuations, although uncertainties remain over how long  the rebound could last.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/european-shares-sluggish-poor-updates-172624812.html?.tsrc=rss

In spite of the positive guidance, Lam signaled that capital spending among NAND flash memory makers is under pressure.  The company forecast that its sales to NAND makers, many of whom have been paring back their capex plans as 3D NAND production increases yield heavy price pressure, would drop in the first half of 2019 relative to the second half of 2018.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/063ae7a6-aa4d-301d-a7bf-22dfff2c0155/lam-research-and-asml%27s.html?.tsrc=rss

The S&P 500 (.SPX) zigzagged furiously between positive and negative territory after the 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) release of the Fed's September meeting minutes.

2018-10-12	2018-10-12 10:18:51	ASML	ASML Holding N.V.	[$$] European Equities Market Talk Roundup	1000 GMT - WH Smith’s investors might be surprised by the one-off costs booked in its high street division, but should note that the retailer continues to deliver stable profit results in this segment despite tough conditions, says J.P. Morgan Cazenove.  WH Smith’s FY18 pretax profit fell 4% to GBP134 million due to GBP11 million of one-off costs, predominately stemming from a review of the high street division.  The U.S. broker continues to like WH Smith due to its sustained underlying performance and sees any weakness in the retailer’s shares as a buying opportunity.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/7ca0fa4c-7c83-3d93-9e08-d6c2e43b664b/%5B%24%24%5D-european-equities-market.html?.tsrc=rss

Shares of KLA-Tencor Corp. , ASML Holding NV , and Applied Materials Inc.  are all down in premarket trading as well. Lam shares are down 9.5% over the past 12 months, while the S&P 500  has gained 16% and the PHLX Semiconductor Index  has risen 22%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/de6b6a9e-b031-3db5-9fc2-4206c8722b5b/lam-research-stock-falls.html?.tsrc=rss

Why Chip Stocks Could Get Hit Hard in June	The ongoing twists and turns of the U.S.’s face-off with China has the potential to derail America’s chip sales to that country, and also sales of chip-making equipment, as explored in the Technology Trader column in Barron’s magazine last month.

Unlike Lam Research (LRCX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC), and Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML, which is headquartered in Veldhoven, in the Netherlands, could be the “perfect political choice,” Maire believes.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/324ba8d7-2166-3036-b249-98a7186f087d/why-chip-stocks-could-get-hit.html?.tsrc=rss

Apple Clouds ASML Earnings Forecast	"Ahead of the earnings report on April 18 from chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), the Street is contemplating its sales could be hurt by slowing use of its tools at chip makers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)—and unwillingness by Apple (AAPL) to subsidize its cutting-edge technology.  After describing problems with getting adequate “throughput” of silicon wafers in ASML’s machines, Mullane wrote “with no near-term fixes to the throughput issues alone, there is a high risk to ASML that EUV implementation into high volume manufacturing could be delayed again."" Part of the problem, apparently, is that Apple, a big customer of TSM, which fabricates chips for the iPhone, doesn’t want to have to pay extra money it would cost TSM to make chips using the ASML technology, known as “EUV,” or “extreme ultraviolet”:  Our latest checks suggest that AAPL is not interested in paying more for 7nm+ shrink for their next generation iPhone models in 2019, given the early price increases that TSM has quoted."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f2639e06-52c9-3652-a64f-b8774701b7b9/apple-clouds-asml-earnings.html?.tsrc=rss

"Shares of chip equipment maker ASML (ASML) are up $10.46, or almost 6%, at $ $196.80, after the company this morning reported Q4 revenue and earnings that topped analysts’ expectations, though it forecast revenue this quarter below nonsense, and announced it will buy back up to €2.5 billion of its shares through next year, and said it intends to boost its buyback by 17%.  The results are having a nice effect on ASML’s peers, with Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX), and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) all getting a lift this morning.  Reading the tea leaves broadly, Jefferies & Co.’s equipment analyst Masahiro Nakanomyo writes that “the overall market should sustain brisk growth in 2018.” Nakanomyo observes that “customers are requesting early shipment."" Although Nakanomyo anticipates ""a pace correction at some point” in the equipment market, nevertheless ""memory prices and semiconductor company profits remain high, supporting the continuation of forward investment."" And so, “the market appears poised for continued YoY growth in 2018,” writes Nakanomyo."	http://finance.yahoo.com/r/930a4ca7-541d-3637-873a-927bd6f2e697/asml-surges-and-aggressive-demand-for-equipment-lifts-peers-lam-et-al-1516202751?mod=yahoobarrons&ru=yahoo&yptr=yahoo&.tsrc=rss
