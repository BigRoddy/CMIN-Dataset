Costs to expand the Oyu Tolgoi mine, Rio's biggest copper growth project, have ballooned up to $6.75 billion from Rio's original budget of $5.3 billion in 2016, and this has led to a friction over funding with Turquoise Hill. Turquoise Hill, in which Rio has a 50.8% stake, owns 66% of Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest-known copper and gold deposits.	https://ca.news.yahoo.com/rio-tinto-mismanagement-caused-cost-124904425.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-11	2021-05-11 22:18:03	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Palantir Rallies on Sales Forecast, Embrace of Bitcoin	(Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc. expects sales to grow 43% in the second quarter, showing new distribution deals are putting its data analysis software into the hands of more customers.Revenue will reach $360 million in the period ending in June, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Shares gained 9.4% to close at $20.21 in New York.With more cash flowing in, the Denver-based company said it’s embracing a newer form of currency: Bitcoin. Palantir accepts customer payments in Bitcoin and is debating whether to use company cash to purchase the asset, Chief Financial Officer David Glazer said on a conference call with analysts. Such a move would follow similar ones by Square Inc. and Tesla Inc., which helped drive a surge in Bitcoin prices.The results provided some signs of encouragement after a prolonged slump for the company. At the close of trading Monday, the shares had reached their lowest point in almost six months, reflecting a sharp turn away from technology stocks by investors worldwide over concerns about inflation.Co-founders Peter Thiel and Alex Karp started Palantir with a focus on providing tools and consulting to the U.S. and allied governments. Palantir has overhauled its software in recent years to court more businesses and lower prices for customers.The company has placed a great deal of emphasis on growth, which shows in the results. In the first quarter, revenue increased 49% to $341 million, beating estimates.However, Palantir said compensation costs ballooned, contributing to a loss in the first quarter that was wider than expected. The loss was 7 cents a share as stock-based compensation more than tripled in the period that ended in March.Palantir said it signed 11 new commercial customers during the quarter and invested in two customers with long term potential: Sarcos Robotics and aviation startup Lilium. Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said both companies built operations around Palantir’s Foundry software “from day zero.” “Manufacturing is a huge focus for us and one of deep strength,” he said.New customers, including Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration, drove first-quarter sales, along with expanded agreements with existing customers such as 3M Co., BP Plc and the mining company Rio Tinto Plc.Palantir expanded its small sales team during the previous quarter, bringing on 50 sales people, and struck partnerships with International Business Machines Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. to re-sell its technology and with Amazon.com Inc.’s Web Services to support it.The company maintained an earlier forecast for annual revenue growth of 30% or more through 2025. Palantir reported U.S. government revenue grew 83% in the first quarter, while sales from U.S. businesses increased 72%. It didn’t disclose the global breakdown of the two business divisions.(Updates with executive comments starting in the third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-rallies-sales-forecast-embrace-221803926.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-29	2021-04-29 13:33:54	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Sanjeev Gupta pursued by Rio Tinto for $50m over Dunkirk smelter sale	Sanjeev Gupta is locked in a legal battle with Rio Tinto over $50m in missed payments after it sold Europe’s biggest aluminium smelter to the embattled steel tycoon. Rio Tinto claimed it is owed the money following the sale of the smelter in Dunkirk, France, to Mr Gupta’s GFG Alliance for $500m in 2018. The FTSE 100 miner launched arbitration proceedings against Mr Gupta in 2019 for the missed payments, which are related to price adjustments that took place after the transaction. However, talks between the two sides continue. GFG’s purchase of the smelter was Mr Gupta’s first major industrial deal financed through traditional bank debt and formed part of a wider spending spree as he snapped up tired steel and aluminium assets around the world. GFG Alliance also bought the Lochaber smelter in Fort William, Scotland, from Rio Tinto in 2016, with backing from the Scottish government. The legal wrangling with Rio Tinto is the latest headache for Mr Gupta as he scrambles to arrange new financing following the collapse of the supply chain financier Greensill, which blew a $5bn hole in GFG’s finances. The crisis has left GFG’s UK arm, Liberty Steel, which employs about 5,000 staff, fighting for survival. Ministers have rebuffed a £170m bailout request from the group, amid concerns over whether taxpayer money would be spent on its UK operations.	https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/sanjeev-gupta-pursued-rio-tinto-133354707.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-27	2021-04-27 22:08:47	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Battery Boom Prompts Iron Giant Vale to Mull Base Metal Spin-off	(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA, the world’s second-largest iron ore producer, is exploring spinning off of its base metals business as the global transition to clean energy and transport spurs demand for copper and nickel.“We are in a phase of studying -- analyzing the possibility,” Chief Executive Officer Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo told analysts on a conference call Tuesday.The Rio de Janeiro-based miner, which is recovering from an iron-ore tailings disaster in 2019, continues to trade at a discount to its Australian-focused rivals BHP Group and Rio Tinto Group. Housing base metals operations in Canada, Brazil and Indonesia in a separate company may help unlock value as the company expands copper and nickel output and exits coal.Vale, already the top commercial producer of mined nickel, sees an opportunity to grow in the electric-vehicle supply chain as the world tries to wean itself off fossil fuels.The company recently signed a “significant” multi-year contract to supply battery-grade nickel, and wants to channel 30% to 40% of its high-quality nickel to the EV space, said Mark Travers, who heads the base metals business. Vale has the “ESG credentials” of low-carbon intensity and the respected jurisdiction of Canada to do so, he said.In copper, the metal used in wiring that’s trading near the highest levels in a decade, Vale is looking to lift annual output from about 360,000 tons to 500,000 tons in the coming years as it explores the Hu’u deposit in Indonesia.Iron ore miners tend to trade at a discount to base metals. Perth-based Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., for example, fetches 4.7 times enterprise value over earnings before items compared with Chilean copper miner Antofagasta Plc’s ratio of 6.7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.“This is not the first time Vale has looked at a spin off,” BI analyst Grant Sporre said. “The company is one of the biggest nickel producers globally but the earnings are dwarfed by iron ore. So this is all about unlocking value.”(Adds comments from BI analyst in last paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/battery-boom-prompts-iron-giant-220847132.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-20	2021-04-20 07:15:50	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Iron Ore Giants Challenged in Race to Meet China Demand	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s top two iron ore miners struggled to keep up with strong Chinese demand in the first quarter of 2021, hit by operational challenges and weather disruptions, in a positive sign for prices that are already at decade highs.Brazil’s Vale SA churned out less ore than expected last quarter after lower productivity at one mine and a ship loader fire, with its recovery from an early-2019 tailings dam disaster proving a little slower than expected. Rio Tinto Group’s shipments were disrupted by wetter-than-average weather at its Pilbara operations in Western Australia.Benchmark iron ore surged Monday over $180 a ton -- the highest since May 2011 -- following news that China’s crude steel production jumped 19% last month from a year earlier to near a record. The nation’s output of the alloy is booming at the same time as a pollution crackdown has lifted prices and benefited profit margins at mills.“With the market relatively tight at the moment, it will certainly see any failure to meet current guidelines as relatively positive for the price,” said Daniel Hynes, senior commodities strategist at ANZ Banking Group Ltd. Vale and Rio both maintained their forecasts for full-year production, though a slower-than-expected recovery at Vale could see the market reset its expectations, he said.Rio cautioned that its guidance for annual output of up to 340 million tons was subject to logistical risks associated with bringing 90 million tons of replacement mine capacity on stream. It also said that Tropical Cyclone Seroja had impacted its Pilbara mine and port operations in April.It was a “mediocre quarter” for Rio, Tyler Broda, mining analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note. Quarterly production was 6% less than the bank’s estimate, he said. “Not all that much is going in the right direction from a bottom-up basis for Rio Tinto as they continue to tackle the various challenges at their operations and projects, but main commodities iron ore and aluminum are both benefiting from the China decarbonisation theme.”Iron ore futures in Singapore rose as much as 3.7% to $182.80 a ton before trading at $182.75 by 2:48 p.m. local time. Prices in Dalian gained as much as 4.7%, while hot-rolled coil and rebar both rose in Shanghai. Rio Tinto’s shares settled 0.5% lower in Sydney.Steel prices in China finished the quarter at decade highs as construction activity and demand in the first quarter exceeded both 2020 and 2019, Rio said. Strong demand and margins -- at their highest since 2018 -- have lifted demand for higher quality iron ore products and the nation’s renewed focus on reducing steelmaking emissions will likely restrain exports in 2021, supporting margins globally, the company said.The short-term outlook for iron ore prices remained strong, ANZ’s Hynes said, with Chinese steel mills content to accept current high prices for their main feedstock while their margins were so strong. However, he added the cost of ore was now well above fair value, with the risk of a pullback later in the year if Beijing’s plans to curb steel production to control greenhouse gas emissions start to impact on demand.“If we saw a 1% fall in Chinese steel production that would potentially wipe out about 15-20 million tons of iron ore,” said Hynes(Closes shares in 7th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iron-ore-giants-challenged-race-020511635.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-08	2021-04-08 11:32:26	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Tinto S. African Project in Limbo on Security Fear	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group’s new $463 million mining project in South Africa will remain on hold until the security problems that halted work two years ago are resolved.Richards Bay Minerals, the South African unit of Rio Tinto, is in talks with the country’s authorities to permanently address violent protests around its operations before resuming work on the Zulti South project, said Werner Duvenhage, RBM’s managing director.RBM was forced to halt work at the project in 2019 after a spate of community protests that led to one employee being shot and injured. While security has improved and work continues at the rest of RBM’s operations, the company is still concerned about stability at Zulti South and doesn’t know when work will resume.“The project is still suspended but we continue to work with authorities to progress work,” Duvenhage said. “Its critical for the long-term sustainability of the entire business that we get Zulti South in operation as soon as we possibly could do that.”Violent Protests Shut Down Key Rio Tinto Mine in South AfricaRio Tinto’s only South African business employs about 5,000 workers and exports titanium dioxide slag, used to create ingredients for products including paint, plastics, sunscreen and toothpaste. Zulti South is intended to extend the life of the entire operation as the commercially viable ore at other sites is depleted. RBM initially targeted completing the project this year.The freezing of Zulti South weighs against President Cyril Ramaphosa’s efforts to attract new investment in the country. Africa’s most-industrialized economy contracted the most in a century last year after measures aimed at limiting the spread of the coronavirus hampered growth.South Africa’s department of mineral resources and energy didn’t immediately respond to emailed questions.Community protests around mines relate to issues from poor municipal services to labor conditions and are often marred by violence. RBM has previously said the demonstrations aren’t related to the company.While costs associated with the project’s delay aren’t yet significant, “there will be a time when it will probably be too late” to proceed with development, Duvenhage said.(Corrects RBM name in third, fifth and penultimate paragraphs of April 7 story)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-south-african-project-113054483.html?.tsrc=rss

Partnering with Rio Tinto, a global mining industry leader, provides a significant opportunity to leverage the discovery potential of our large portfolio of base metals properties while we continue to focus on growing gold resources within our 100% owned exploration and operating properties in support of our ‘Hub-and-Spoke’ operating model.” 2021 Exploration Program Since entering the Borosi option agreement in February 2020, the RTX team has conducted extensive evaluation of exploration data stemming from Calibre’s work over the past 10 years as well as Rio’s own information sources and data archives that go back several decades. More than 50 prospective target areas have been identified within the Borosi concessions. Four of these areas have been prioritized for a first pass drilling campaign totaling 5,500 metres commencing in early Q2 2021. Additionally, an orientation survey has been initiated to characterize the broader geochemical expression surrounding the Primavera copper-gold porphyry deposit discovered by Calibre in 2011. The results of this work will provide an important benchmark to guide future regional reconnaissance work to be carried out under the RTX-Calibre Exploration Alliance agreement the companies also entered in early 2020. The four areas targeted for first pass drill testing have been selected based on a combination of factors that include favorable geologic setting, surficial geochemical signature, and geophysical expression. Three of the targeted areas are located within 12 km of the town of Siuna and the fourth, Carpatos, is located northeast of Rosita. Summary descriptions of these areas are provided below: Carpatos The Carpatos prospect is located 25 km northeast of the town of Rosita. The targeted area covers a 6 km² geophysical magnetics high and coincident copper-molybdenum and distal zinc-lead-gold soil geochemical anomalies which remain open to the south. Expansion of the soil sampling grid is underway and will continue in parallel with exploration drilling expected to commence in April. Approximately 1,500 metres of reconnaissance drilling is planned as a first pass test of the Carpatos target. The Carpatos mineral concession block adjoins Calibre’s 100% owned Eastern Borosi concession block where Calibre has recently initiated an exploration and infill drilling program. Doña Francesca Doña Francesca is located 5 km to the northeast of the town of Siuna. The target is defined by a 2 km² copper-gold in soil anomaly and coincident induced polarization (IP) and resistivity geophysical anomalies. Wide spaced reconnaissance drilling completed along a 3 km trend in 2017 yielded abundant evidence of porphyry style alteration and veining hosted within porphyry intrusive host rocks. Observations from drill hole NS17-053 included strong potassic alteration and associated “A” and “B” style quartz-magnetite+chalcopyrite veinlets and geochemically anomalous copper and gold values over a 120m downhole interval. Approximately 1,000 metres of reconnaissance drilling is planned as a first pass test of the Doña Francesca target. Timbuco Located approximately 3 km north of Doña Francesca, the Timbuco target area comprises a 12 km² copper in soil geochemical anomaly, the largest in the Borosi project concession package. Approximately 1,000 metres of reconnaissance drilling is planned as a first pass test of the Timbuco target. Mina Victoria – Cerro Asa The Mina Victoria – Cerro Asa targets encompass a cluster of gold-copper in soil geochemical anomalies that extends over 8 km² area. Surface trenching completed in 2013 intersected anomalous gold and copper values that included 45m averaging 0.40 g/t Au and 0.19% Cu in trench VTR13-001 and 10.2 meters grading 0.70 g/t Au and 0.11% Cu in trench VTR13-021. The mineralization is associated with northeast oriented porphyry intrusive dykes which crosscut the local volcanic and sedimentary host sequence. Approximately 2,000 metres of reconnaissance drilling is planned as a first pass test of the Mina Victoria and Cerro Asa targets. Calibre’s Borosi properties host inferred gold-silver and copper-gold mineral resources at the Cerro Aeropuerto skarn and the Primavera copper-gold porphyry deposits. The Cerro Aeropuerto deposit contains gold, silver and within a system of quartz veins and associated replacement skarn + base metals mineralization. The NI 43-101 compliant Inferred Mineral Resource estimate for the Cerro Aeropuerto deposit is provided in the table below: Cerro Aeropuerto NI 43-101 Inferred Mineral Resource (April 11, 2011) TonnesGrade(Au g/t)Grade(Ag g/t)ContainedAu (ounces)ContainedAg (ounces)6,052,0003.6416.16707,7503,144,500 1.

Primavera Copper-Gold Porphyry Deposit (“Primavera”) The Primavera deposit is characterized by porphyry style copper-gold mineralization hosted within a series of diorite porphyry dikes that have intruded a sequence andesitic volcanic rocks. Mineralization occurs in both rock types and is typical of porphyry deposits. As Nicaragua’s first porphyry style copper-gold discovery, Primavera provides good evidence for the region’s potential for the discovery of new porphyry style copper + gold systems.In addition to Primavera, several other prospective areas have been identified within the 20 km² Primavera project area, as demonstrated by anomalous gold and copper in rock and soil samples, magnetic and radiometric geophysical anomalies, and geological mapping.

2021-04-01	2021-04-01 02:10:30	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio’s Next Chair Must Navigate Greening China, Restive Investors	(Bloomberg) -- It could be the toughest job in mining. Whoever replaces Simon Thompson as chair of Rio Tinto Group will face a raft of complex and problematic global issues -- not least relations with its biggest customer and shareholder, China.Thompson in March announced plans to step down at next year’s annual meetings, completing a clear-out of top management in the wake of last year’s Juukan Gorge heritage fiasco. Rio is under increased pressure from investors on environmental and social policies, but trade and political tensions between China and Australia may present a major headache for the incoming chair.“The challenge for the new chairman is the relationship with China -- it’s very delicate,” said Philip Kirchlechner, director of consultancy Iron Ore Research Pty and a former head of Rio’s Hamersley iron ore division in Shanghai. The miner “will have to be sensitive not only to local communities, but also to different markets and the complexity of China,” he said.The diplomatic spat that began in 2018 and intensified last year has seen China bar Australian goods ranging from coal to copper, wine and lobsters. While iron ore hasn’t been targeted yet, the world’s second-biggest economy has long held ambitions to reduce its dependence on major overseas producers for the material critical to its giant steel industry -- one that’s pivoting toward the lower-emissions future being proscribed by government.The ongoing fallout from the destruction of ancient caves at Juukan Gorge in the iron ore heartland of Western Australia also poses a potential financial -- as well as ESG -- risk for Rio and its iron ore business, which accounts for more than three quarters of total earnings.Rio needs up to 12 replacement mines to maintain output out to 2027, much more than peers BHP Group and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a March 16 report. Proposed state legislation to tighten heritage protection laws could mean longer lead times for its growth projects. This process will maintain pressure on Rio and its management.​Investors in Australia are pushing for a local to replace the Oxford-educated, Englishman Thompson -- who became chairman in March 2018 -- to better reflect the importance of the group’s West Australian iron ore business. Rio’s shares have risen about 45% during his tenure, with the bulk of the gains coming since late 2020 on the back of a China demand-driven surge in ore prices.“Rebuilding trust with Australians, particularly with the indigenous community and stakeholders, must be a priority,” said Fiona Reynolds, chief executive officer at the London-based investor group Principles for Responsible Investment. “To do this, the chair must ensure that processes are in place so that we never again see the destruction of indigenous cultural heritage.”The incoming chair will also need to navigate sensitive local relationships in Mongolia, where the government is pushing for a greater share of the spoils from Rio’s giant Oyu Tolgoi copper project, and in Arizona, where local cultural heritage campaigners are seeking to derail the Resolution copper project, which Rio is jointly developing with BHP Group.When it comes to corporate governance, Rio still has ground to make up on its peers. The resources giant met just five of 14 ESG criteria in a ranking system devised by analysts at Morgan Stanley, putting it among the worst performers among Australia’s top listed miners.Signs of a change in approach are emerging. The company in March announced plans to bolster its reporting on heritage protection and has taken steps to strengthen its climate policies this year. Independent board members Sam Laidlaw and Simon McKeon are jointly leading the search for Thompson’s successor, Rio said in a statement on March 3.In staying in his post until next year’s AGMs, Thompson would “provide an important period of stability and support” for new Chief Executive Officer Jakob Stausholm and his executive team, Laidlaw said in the statement. “This will allow an orderly process for the appointment of our new Chair and other key Board members.” The group will hold its London annual meeting on April 9.Rio shares rose 1.7% in Sydney on Thursday, out-pacing a 1% gain in the S&P/ASX 200 resources sub index.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-next-chair-must-234623258.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-22	2021-03-22 12:39:50	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Fight Between Commodities Giants and Shippers Leaves Seafarers Stuck	"(Bloomberg) -- A standoff between commodities giants and shipping companies is prolonging the labor crisis at sea, with an estimated 200,000 seafarers still stuck on their vessels beyond the expiration of their contracts and past the requirements of globally accepted safety standards. In an effort to keep deliveries of food, fuel and other raw materials on schedule, some of the big commodities firms are avoiding hiring certain vessels or imposing conditions that may block relief for exhausted seafarers. The companies are trying to steer clear of crew changes, which have become far more expensive and time-consuming during the coronavirus outbreak. In an effort to keep shipments on schedule, some firms have asked their shipping partners to guarantee that no change will take place, according to emails and contracts reviewed by Bloomberg.Those requirements risk worsening a labor crisis already in its 12th month, according to ship owners, labor unions and the United Nations. More than a year into the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of mariners are long overdue for shore leave. Some have been working without pay or a firm plan for repatriation, and many have taken desperate measures: in one instance, a captain diverted his ship to the middle of the ocean and refused to return to course without a guarantee of relief.Prior to the pandemic, a ship owner could bring in new crew during routine port stops. That common practice has become a logistical nightmare with Covid border curbs. Some ports require lengthy quarantines for incoming and outgoing workers, others turn away vessels that have changed crews within 10 to 14 days over fears seafarers could spread the virus.In January, around 300 companies, including Vitol Group, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, and Australian mining behemoth Rio Tinto Group, signed a pledge to take action to resolve the crisis for seafarers. Called “the Neptune Declaration,” signatories recognized a “shared responsibility” and promised increased collaboration between ship operators and charterers to facilitate crew changes.As of now, though, some ship owners and labor advocates say little has changed, and not all of the biggest charterers signed on. “We chose not to sign because we believe that our current practices in respect of crew changes are fair and fully respect the need for regular crew changes,” said a spokesperson for Equinor ASA, a major oil, gas and energy company based in Stavanger, Norway. “We do not charter vessels for any voyage if a crew change will be required that cannot be accommodated in our delivery schedule.” Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S. oil and gas producer, has also declined to sign. A spokesperson said the company is “considering next steps.” The pact is “a work in progress,” said Rajesh Unni, a captain and chief executive officer of Synergy Marine, which manages more than 375 ships including container vessels and commodity carriers. Shipping has always had competing interests, he said, but companies that sign the Neptune Declaration “at least commit that they will then follow the standard protocol, which should then give you a lot more comfort that now we’re all on the same page.”What you need to know: Tracking the Labor Crisis at SeaThe fight over who should pay for the higher costs of crew changes is most acute for commodities companies and their shipping partners, which carry out what are called spot charters. Crewed vessels available on demand for anywhere from a few days to several months, spot charters make up 85% to 90% of dry bulk and tanker shipments in the commodities industry, according to industry group BIMCO.Some companies have stipulated no crew changes or asked for verbal guarantees before hiring a charter, according to emails and contracts reviewed by Bloomberg. Charterers have also used questionnaires to learn whether ships are planning crew swaps, according to ship owners. In one instance, a ship owner told Bloomberg, in order to secure a charter with Rio Tinto, he had to extend workers’ contracts, paid additional salary and promised to relieve them when the voyage was complete. He also had to confirm that no crew change was planned for the duration. “Rio Tinto does not use ‘no crew change’ clauses in chartering contracts,” the company said in a statement. “Rio Tinto aims to support the shipping industry and the human rights of the seafarers on which it depends. This requires collaboration between ship owners, who employ the seafarers, charterers and regional port authorities around transparency of information and flexibility on schedule.”The problem, labor advocates and seafarers say, is that the workers don’t have a choice either way. Ship captains often hold the passports of their crew – a convenience for port stops, they say – and ports are tightly controlled borders. Even if a worker wanted to walk away from his vessel, he wouldn’t get very far without a passport, a visa or a plane ticket home.The International Transport Workers' Federation, or ITF, which represents seafarers, is calling on the industry to do more to alleviate the crisis.``There are still charterers rejecting charters unless they are given assurances that crew changes don't take place,'' said Stephen Cotton, ITF general secretary. ``It might not be as blatant as putting it in writing, but it's still going on. As long as seafarers' lives remain secondary to companies' profits, this crisis will continue to unfold."" Read more: What Happens When Tycoons Abandon Their Own Giant Cargo ShipsThe industry says it is the responsibility of ship owners to arrange crew changes and to ensure the safety and well-being of the seafarers on their vessels. BIMCO has encouraged charterers to share the costs of crew changes and developed contract language that requires companies that hire vessels for a fixed period of time -- called a time charter -- to do just that. Owners of ships available for spot charter, the group said, should change crews when the ship isn’t out for hire.Labor and industry groups want companies to be more flexible and allow tankers and dry bulk vessels to divert or delay deliveries to help alleviate the crisis in stranded mariners. Shareholders, too: A group of 85 investors that manage more than $2 trillion of assets, including Fidelity International, said in January that frequent charterers should be flexible about enabling crew changes and should consider providing financial support for mariners who need to be repatriated.“Charterers at this point do need to share costs and assume the delays they might face,” said Laura Carballo, head of maritime law and policy at World Maritime University in Malmo, Sweden. “That’s their biggest argument: it’s about the delays. Sorry, we’re all facing delays right now. The world is only running because seafarers are doing their job.”Wichita, Kansas-based Koch Industries, which has interests spanning petroleum and agriculture, has instructed ship owners not to conduct crew changes while under charter, according to a person with direct knowledge of the terms and who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private. The requests were delivered verbally, not in writing.In response to questions about the stipulation, the company responded in a statement: “Koch works closely with vessel owners to ensure the safety and wellbeing of crew members. This is an issue we are watching closely and looking for ways to resolve.”Rotterdam-based Vitol has required ship owners not to make crew changes on some spot charters, according to people familiar with the company’s contract terms who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. Vitol says that it has “sought to manage our shipping business in line with the standards outlined in the Neptune declaration.”“Wherever commercially and operationally possible we facilitate crew changes,” company spokesperson Andrea Schlaepfer said in a statement. “As a vessel owner and manager Vitol appreciates the challenges of the current situation but believes that with good management owners can maintain high standards of seafarer welfare.”The Neptune Declaration also calls on world leaders to change their port and border policies to ease the burdens on seafarers, following a September statement from consumer companies including Unilever Plc and Procter & Gamble Co. to do the same. Last month, the IMO recognized 55 countries that agreed to consider seafarers “essential workers” and encouraged nations that hadn’t yet to do so. That designation has no official definition, and the countries weren’t specific about what if any change it would bring to the port procedures.On Friday, the shipping industry raised concerns that, while the number of seafarers stranded has dropped since its peak, the improvements could be short-lived as governments and port authorities respond to the threat of new Covid-19 variants with stricter restrictions. Seafarers, many of whom are from developing countries, may also miss out on the ongoing vaccination drives, risking further delays and supply chain disruption.“The crisis is still ongoing,” said Guy Platten, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents more than 80% of the world's merchant fleet. “Governments will not be able to vaccinate their citizens without the shipping industry or, most importantly, our seafarers.”(Updates with recent statements from the shipping industry on the threat of new Covid-19 variants to efforts to relieve seafarers. )For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fight-between-commodities-giants-shippers-210012412.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-19	2021-03-19 10:00:26	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	ESG Investors Score Another Win at Rio, This Time on Climate	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group will support two climate proposals at its next shareholder meeting, the latest win for ESG-focused investors after the miner’s destruction of Aboriginal heritage sites last year shined a spotlight on its governance.The world’s top iron ore producer will back a motion from Market Forces requesting it to disclose short, medium, and long-term targets for greenhouse gas emissions from its own operations as well as its performance against those targets. A similar motion last year was not endorsed by Rio, but still garnered the support of 37% of shareholder votes at the AGM.The other resolution asked that Rio enhance its annual review of industry association memberships to ensure they’re consistent with the Paris Agreement.“As Rio Tinto’s current approach is substantially consistent with both of the proposed resolutions, the Rio Tinto Board is recommending that shareholders vote in favor of these resolutions,” the company said Friday in a statement.Miners have been rolling out climate pledges as they face increased scrutiny over their environmental, as well as social and corporate, governance. Just last month, Rio made a major u-turn in its stance on customer, or scope 3, emissions, reversing an earlier position that it had no control over how steelmakers used the iron ore it mines. It’s also sought to repair its reputation after blasts by the company caused irreparable damage to ancient rock shelters in Australia, leading to the ousting of the chief executive officer.The shareholder recommendation “is important recognition from Rio Tinto that its climate ambition has been inadequate so far,” Julien Vincent, Market Forces’ executive director, said in a statement.Rio said it had already set out short, medium and long-term targets for its scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions in its 2020 annual report and climate change report and would continue to disclose them in the decade ahead.Falling ShortRio has said that its current targets -- which include a 15% reduction in operational emissions by 2030 from a 2018 baseline -- align with pathways to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But Market Forces said Rio’s targets “fall well short of what can be considered consistent with the Paris Agreement,” adding that alignment would require a 50% reduction in emissions over the same timeframe.Rival BHP Group, like Rio, is also targeting net-zero by 2050, while Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., the world’s number four iron ore shipper, earlier this week put down a marker with a target to be carbon neutral from its operations by 2030.Tackling scope 3 emissions was the biggest challenge for Rio, Vincent said, given that they account for the bulk of its carbon footprint. Rio said last month it would work with its customers to reduce steel-making carbon intensity by at least 30% by 2030 and aim for carbon-neutral steel production also by 2050. It’s also targeting zero-carbon aluminum and net-zero emissions from shipping by 2050 and, like BHP, will tie executive bonuses to progress.The company’s AGM will be held in London on April 9.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/esg-investors-score-another-win-100026674.html?.tsrc=rss

Yet the two have been at loggerheads over how to fund the ongoing expansion of the project.Turquoise Hill said Thursday that Chief Executive Officer Ulf Quellmann resigned after Rio told its board it wouldn’t vote for his re-election. The Canadian company brought back former executive Steeve Thibeault to serve as interim CEO as the board looks for a permanent replacement.Oyu Tolgoi is Rio’s flagship growth project, but has increasingly become a headache for the company as costs spiral. Rio has said it’ll block Turquoise Hill from taking on more than $500 million in additional debt, telling the company to raise the extra funds through a rights offer. In response, Turquoise Hill has started arbitration proceedings against its parent.Rio has also faced problems in Mongolia, where the government is seeking to change the framework that underpins the giant project.“Rio Tinto is supportive of the re-set in leadership at Turquoise Hill and is committed to working collaboratively and proactively with both Turquoise Hill and the government of Mongolia to enable the successful delivery of the Oyu Tolgoi Project,” Rio said in a statement.Thibeault served as Turquoise Hill’s chief financial officer between 2014 and 2017, and had led funding talks between the company and Rio Tinto back in 2015. He’s had no involvement in either company since April 2017, according to a statement.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/turquoise-hill-says-ceo-forced-142155303.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-03	2021-03-03 09:59:59	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Chair to Exit After Failings on Aboriginal Site Blasts	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group Chairman Simon Thompson became the latest high-profile casualty of the company’s destruction of an ancient Aboriginal site, saying that he’s accountable for the failings that led to the incident.The fallout from Rio’s actions at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara iron ore region of Western Australia last May has already led to the departure of former Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques and other senior executives. Thompson had also come under investor pressure to step down.“While I am pleased with the progress we have made in many areas, the tragic events at Juukan Gorge are a source of personal sadness and deep regret, as well as being a clear breach of our values as a company,” Thompson said in a statement. “As chairman, I am ultimately accountable for the failings that led to this tragic event.”Thompson will not seek re-election at the miner’s annual meeting next year, while another director, Michael L’Estrange, who led an internal review into the destruction at Juukan Gorge, will leave in the coming months. The departure of three executives and now the chair and another board member highlights the rise of socially conscious shareholders, who are scrutinizing how companies interact with society at large.That reality was acknowledged by Rio’s incoming CEO. Jakob Stausholm, who was appointed in December and shuffled his senior management ranks last month, says he wants to re-establish the company as a trusted partner for host communities. Thompson’s decision comes as Rio also faces fresh problems on a different continent over the development of a huge copper mine in Arizona involving Native American land.“The decision today allows for a fresh perspective and a renewed board focus on repairing and building stronger links with indigenous communities in the countries in which Rio operates,” said Debby Blakey, CEO of $37 billion pension fund Hesta. “Rigorous board oversight and governance will be crucial to achieving future progress in this regard.”AustralianSuper, the largest pension fund in the nation where Rio generates the bulk of its profits, in December called for “changes of personnel” on the firm’s board following its response to the Juukan Gorge incident.Read more: Rio Backed CEO After Blast, Then Watchdog Investors RevoltedThompson in August initially backed Jacques and others leaders, saying they were the right executives to lead Rio’s effort to rebuild relations with Aboriginal Australian communities, only to reverse course weeks later under a barrage of pressure from investors. After a decision to replace the executives, Thompson said in a September interview he believed he should remain in the post to guide the tasks of appointing a new CEO and overhauling the miner’s procedures.Juukan Gorge exposed Rio’s “blindness” on heritage protection, said Joe Dortch, a Perth-based spokesman for the Australian Association of Consulting Archaeologists Inc. “Across the company there’s a recognition that there was that blindness,” he said, adding that Rio was showing a readiness to communicate better and be more open in its dealings with indigenous landowners.A spokesman for the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation, which administers the traditional lands that encompass Juukan Gorge, declined to comment on Rio’s announcement.Senior independent directors Sam Laidlaw and Simon McKeon will lead the search for a new chair, the London-based company said.Thompson, previously an executive director at Anglo American Plc, was appointed chairman in 2018 having previously served on the board since 2014. He was selected after shareholders rejected a plan to install Mick Davis to the role.Rio shares rose 0.8% in London, after hitting a record high Tuesday.

This is in addition to the more than A$8.4bn (US$6.4bn) of Australian income tax paid during the relevant period. The assessments relate to the denial of interest deductions on an isolated borrowing used to pay an intragroup dividend in 2015. This borrowing was repaid in 2018. Borrowing to fund the payment of a dividend is a normal commercial practice. Rio Tinto is confident of its position and will dispute the assessments.

2021-02-28	2021-02-28 14:00:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Tycoon Usmanov’s Firms to Build Plant for Greener Iron Products	(Bloomberg) -- Companies controlled by billionaire Alisher Usmanov will build a plant in central Russia to supply greener products used to make steel amid a growing focus to clean up the industry.A joint venture between USM and its Metalloinvest Holding Co.’s iron ore mine will invest 40 billion rubles ($540 million) to build a facility to make 2 million tons of hot-briquetted iron, or HBI, a year, the companies said Sunday. The plant, in Russia’s Kursk region, will begin operations in 2024.HBI is a briquetted form of direct reduced iron, and while it’s a more expensive ingredient in steel production, it leads to lower emissions. Turning the steel sector greener is crucial in the fight against climate change, with the industry accounting for about 7% of global carbon emissions.“This is the start of an important project for the Russian metals and mining industry,” USM Chief Executive Officer Ivan Streshinsky said in a statement. It “will further strengthen our country’s leadership in the global market for HBI, the base product for the green steelmaking of the future,” he said.The joint venture signed an accord with Primetals Technologies and Midrex Technologies, a supplier of direct reduction iron-making technology, to work on the project. USM will hold 55% of the venture with the rest held by Metalloinvest’s mine, which will supply iron ore pellets to the new HBI plant, planned to be one of the world’s largest.Metalloinvest itself already produces almost 8 million tons of HBI or DRI annually.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tycoon-usmanov-firms-build-plant-140000214.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-02-26	2021-02-26 18:37:41	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Vale Dangles More Dividends and Buyback With Cash ‘Way Too High’	(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA, once the most generous payer of dividends among major miners, is looking to regain that status as surging prices of iron ore, nickel and copper flood its coffers.The Rio de Janeiro-based company announced on Thursday a bigger-than expected payment from profit generated in the second half of last year and pledged Friday to return any excess cash to shareholders this year. Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Bartolomeo also said a share buyback is on the table, although no decision has been made on that yet.It’s a sharp turnaround from the last couple of years after a tailings dam disaster sent Vale into crisis mode, cutting dividends and scaling back operations as it focused on repairing the damage and shoring up safety. Now, with a dam-collapse settlement signed with authorities and prices of its metals rallying to multiyear highs, Vale is ready to reward investors who suffered through the lean years.The surge in prices has turned miners into cash machines once again, with Vale’s iron ore business generating its second-highest earnings ever and the company squarely focused on growing its existing assets rather than splashing out on deals as it did in previous booms.“So the natural way for money to flow is to the shareholders, as long as we can keep our business growing and safe,” Bartolomeo told analysts on Friday.Cash SurplusChief Financial Officer Luciano Siani Pires said on the same call that the company’s cash position “is way too high” and “we are looking into a number of alternatives.” BMO Capital Markets estimates Vale will generate free cash flow of $36 billion from 2021 to 2023, 36% of its current market value.Doling out more money to shareholders or buying back shares would also help Vale narrow its valuation gap with rivals BHP Group and Rio Tinto Group, whose mines are closer to China and headquarters are in developed nations.Vale’s shares trade at a ratio to estimated profit that is about half those of BHP and Rio Tinto. It’s a discount that “bothers us,” Pires said.Vale’s board approved a March dividend payment of 3.427 reais a share, beating a projection of 2.697 reais by Bloomberg’s Dividend Forecasting team and up from 1.41 reais in September. The stock has doubled in value in the past year to about 95 reais ($17).The CFO said Vale is already back in front of some competitors on dividend yield. “The expectation is that we can, going forward, lift these values,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vale-doling-more-cash-close-172948390.html?.tsrc=rss

The No. 2 miner’s balance sheet strength -- it has just $700 million of debt -- has led to speculation it could embark on a dealmaking spree after undertaking no significant acquisitions in more than a decade.Yet Chief Executive Officer Jakob Stausholm, who took the helm last month after the destruction of an ancient Aboriginal site led to the ouster of his predecessor, said the company must first strengthen its own development team before looking to do big deals.“We need to have the capabilities to develop things and integrate them well if we want to go down a path of buying assets, so it’s not imminent,” Stausholm said in an interview. “We do need to take some controlled risks to develop our portfolio of the next decade.”Successive Rio CEO’s have been reluctant to do any major deals after disastrous aluminum and coal acquisitions a decade ago. The miner also has made limited progress in recent years on developing key growth projects, including copper, lithium and iron ore assets in, respectively, the U.S., Serbia and Guinea.Anti-CyclicalMining companies have surged to multiyear highs, buoyed by a rally in commodity prices as the global economy pulls out from the coronavirus-induced slump of 2020. That’s seen metals like copper hit an eight-year high and iron ore surge, while Rio itself is trading at the highest on record. That boom might in itself make deals harder for Stausholm.“The key thing is to try to be careful to not be too pro-cyclical and try to be little bit anti-cyclical,” he said. “Right now you see that the cycle is running our way and we need to be a little bit careful.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swimming-cash-rio-boss-backs-095105859.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-02-17	2021-02-17 08:57:04	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Boom Times for Rio as Shareholders Pocket Record Payout	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group, the world’s top iron ore producer, posted its biggest annual profit in nine years and will pay out a record $9 billion in dividends, as global miners cash in on a nascent boom in metals prices.The London-based company said underlying earnings were $12.4 billion in 2020, up 20% on the prior year. Its full-year payout included a special dividend as Rio followed its peers in rewarding investors. Glencore Plc said Tuesday it would resume payouts after suspending them last year, while BHP Group paid a record dividend.From iron ore and copper to platinum and tin, metals prices are ramping higher as the world economy emerges from its coronavirus-induced slump of 2020, fueled by huge government and central bank support as well as tightening supply.“The fundamentals are pretty strong,” said Jakob Stausholm, presiding over his first results since becoming chief executive officer in January. “The Chinese economy is growing strongly and what we are learning coming out of 2020 is that -- more than anything -- we are having very commodity-intensive growth.”Rio shares rose as much as 3.5% to 6,480 pence, the highest on record, and were up 3.2% by 8:55 a.m. in London.Iron ore prices gained around 70% over the period, boosted by Chinese stimulus measures to accelerate the post-pandemic economic recovery which saw the country’s steel mills ramp up their activity. Rio said significant momentum in these prices boosted underlying earnings for ore from its operations in Western Australia.“Our strong operational performance in the Pilbara in 2020 enabled us to take advantage of the rising price environment for our high-quality products,” Rio said. “This price strength was driven by buoyant demand from China and constraints in global seaborne supply.”Read: Commodities Are Back In Fashion as Investors Get Ready for BoomRio said it has almost completed implementing recommendations from a board review of its cultural heritage management into the blasts last year in Western Australia that damaged ancient Aboriginal sites, although Stausholm declined to comment on any potential financial restitution during a media call.Tougher heritage protection laws are expected in the wake of the Juukan Gorge blasts which could lead to longer lead times for Rio to bring new resources on stream. “The rock shelter at Juukan should never have been touched,” Stausholm said, adding that he had visited the site this week and met with local elders.Rio said it was in “active discussions” with the government of Mongolia to address outstanding issues regarding the troubled Oyu Tolgoi copper project. Mongolia has asked Rio whether it’s prepared to mutually terminate the framework that underpins the $6.75 billion project in the Gobi Desert, the Financial Times reported earlier this month.(Updates with shares in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boom-times-rio-tinto-shareholders-070115237.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-02-17	2021-02-17 08:00:51	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio U-Turns On Emissions as New CEO Takes Climate-Change Journey	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group has set goals for lowering the greenhouse gas emissions of its customers, reversing an earlier stance that it has no control over how steelmakers use the iron ore it mines.Rio had been at odds with some of its biggest rivals amid a debate about who bears responsibility for Scope 3 emissions -- the pollution created when customers burn or process the raw materials extracted by mining companies. On Wednesday, under new Chief Executive Officer Jakob Stausholm, Rio announced climate polices that more closely mirror its peers.Stausholm is looking to repair relations with investors and authorities after the destruction of an ancient Aboriginal site hurt Rio’s reputation and led to the ouster of his predecessor. That sent shock waves through a mining industry that’s no longer tolerated for being, by its nature, dirty and environmentally destructive.Rio said it will work with customers to reduce steelmaking carbon intensity by at least 30% from 2030, and aim for carbon-neutral steelmaking by 2050. It’s also targeting zero-carbon aluminum and net-zero emissions from shipping by 2050 and, like rival BHP Group, will tie executive bonuses to progress.Unlike its major rivals, Rio doesn’t mine carbon in the form of coal, oil or gas. But it has huge iron ore operations that create the vital ingredient for steelmaking, a highly polluting industry that involves adding coking coal to make carbon steel.“We are all learning on the journey of climate change,” Stausholm said on a call with reporters Wednesday. “Today, you should just see it as an extension, recognizing that we can actually work together with our partners to reduce the Scope 3. It is a real shift, but it’s also a natural development. You start with your own emissions, and then you expand from there.”Like its fellow iron-ore miners, Rio stopped short of setting hard targets for Scope 3 emissions. Some analysts argue that setting intensity goals is less valuable than more precise targets for absolute reductions in emission volumesGoals include:Work in partnerships with customers on steel decarbonization, invest in technologies that could deliver reductions in steelmaking carbon intensity of at least 30% from 2030.Work in partnerships to develop technologies with potential to deliver carbon-neutral steelmaking pathways by 2050.Continue to scale up the ELYSISTM technology, enabling the production of zero-carbon aluminum, and progress to commercial maturity by 2025.Develop plans to reach net zero emissions from shipping of products by 2050, and meet IMO goal of 40% reduction in shipping intensity by 2030.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-u-turns-emissions-ceo-080051416.html?.tsrc=rss

That compares with the median estimate of $11.9 billion, based on a survey of 21 analysts.The company will pay a total dividend of $5.57, including a special dividend of 93 cents, representing a full-year payout ratio of 72%.Key Insights“Our strong operational performance in the Pilbara in 2020 enabled us to take advantage of the rising price environment for our high-quality products,” Rio said in a statement. “This price strength was driven by buoyant demand from China and constraints in global seaborne supply.”Iron ore prices rose about 70% over 2020 as stimulus measures from the Chinese government to accelerate the economic recovery from the pandemic stoked strong demand from the country’s steel mills, and weak production in Brazil curbed supply.This is Chief Executive Officer Jakob Stausholm’s first earnings report since becoming CEO on Jan. 1. He replaced Jean-Sebastien Jacques, who was forced to step down last year following an investor backlash after blasts at Juukan Gorge damaged ancient Aboriginal sites in the Pilbara.“Working closely with the board, we must earn the right to become a trusted partner for Traditional Owners, host communities, governments and other stakeholders,” Stausholm said in a media release.Rio said it was in “active discussions” with the government of Mongolia to address and close all outstanding issues over its Oyu Tolgoi copper project, “and increase the project’s benefits to all stakeholders.”The Mongolian government has asked Rio whether it’s prepared to mutually terminate the $6.75 billion project in the Gobi Desert, the Financial Times reported earlier this month.Rio expects to complete the first phase of technical work at its Simandou iron ore project in Guinea in the first half of 2021.Market ReactionRio’s shares rose 13% over 2020, compared to a 9% gain for its main rival BHP Group.

2021-02-06	2021-02-06 06:00:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	European Aluminum Buyers Are Starting to Pay Up to Go Green	(Bloomberg) -- Aluminum producers have long touted more environmentally friendly methods to make the metal as the way of the future, but no one has been willing to pay extra for it -- until now.Multiple transactions of so-called “green aluminum” as well as billet and foundry products fetched a premium over standard prices in Europe this week, according to researcher Harbor Intelligence.“The fire has been ignited,” Jorge Vazquez, managing director of the Austin, Texas-based research firm, said in an phone interview. “The fire is not simply a spark -- you’re talking several transactions by major players both on the consumer side and the producer side.”Almost 200,000 metric tons of European raw aluminum traded, with several deals carrying extra premiums of as much as $14 a ton, the firm said in a note to clients. Some quarterly contracts for billet, which is used in a range of goods including window frames and recreational vehicles, had surcharges of up to $12 per ton.Carbon FootprintThe “sharp” increase in green aluminum purchases are specific to Europe’s auto industry, according to Harbor. That comes as BMW AG and Emirates Global Aluminum PJSC struck a deal worth at least 100 million euros ($121 million) this week for the automaker to buy 43,000 tons per year of aluminum produced using solar power.This would be among the first times that consumers and producers agreed to pay a premium on aluminum with a smaller carbon footprint, likely made by tapping renewable power sources such as hydroelectricity or solar to produce the metal. The sales indicate some consumers are willing to pay more for greener aluminum.To be clear, the green aluminum being sold is the same metal producers and traders have been marketing for years. The difference now is that the producers who use lower carbon-emitting power generation are branding the aluminum as such. Companies with low-carbon options include Alcoa Corp., Rio Tinto Group, Norsk Hydro ASA, Emirates Global Aluminum and United Co. Rusal International PJSC, among others.“Those who have been able to sell with an upcharge have specific green aluminum brands,” Vazquez said.Norsk Hydro in December said during an investor event that it started to see customers willing to pay a “green premium” for its Hydro CIRCAL and Hydro REDUXA products. Chief Financial Officer Pal Kildemo said at the time that the company’s sustainability focus will be a differentiator in the years to come in terms of returns.Harbor Intelligence isn’t seeing any extra charges yet on green aluminum in North America, though Vazquez anticipates the region will begin seeing activity as some proposed green initiatives from U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration kick in.“It’s a trend we’ve seen from our customers and their customers and end-users,” Alf Barrios, the head of Rio Tinto Aluminum, one of the world’s largest producers, said in a phone interview. “People are asking more and more” about the environmental, social and governance factors behind the materials they buy, he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/european-aluminum-buyers-starting-pay-060000047.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-02-05	2021-02-05 17:25:51	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Why Palantir’s Long-Term Prospects Are Brighter than Ever	In light of stocks with the highest short float getting squeezed, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) may get a slight boost. PLTR stock has a short float of 9.3% but investors should not treat the short-covering event as a positive catalyst that will last. Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com The company has a market capitalization of above the $45 billion range. About 1.65 billion shares are outstanding, too. If anything, volatility will rise for this stock, increasing the related option prices. Investors more interested in holding the underlying shares should wait for the price to settle. Demo day and new multi-year contracts are the most recent events that matter more.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips PLTR Stock Due for a Dip Palantir shares could dip if analysts are justified in their caution. The average consensus rating is a “hold.” Notice the 31.8% sales growth lags the forward price-earnings ratio of over 100x. The P/E to growth (or PEG) is over 3x. Source: Data from Stock Rover Palantir will need to continue posting bigger contracts to justify the current valuations. Chances are very high that the software firm will do that. No other software company offers the same product. The company helps its customers cut costs and dramatically accelerate revenue. For example, in the third quarter, Palantir posted impressive customer additions. Global Head of Business Development Kevin Kawasaki said that one of its customers benefited from its Foundry modules and software-defined data integration. Using its enterprise resource planning suite, the customer had already saved over $50 million. It achieved this within a few hours of use. Word travels fast. That incredibly quick return on investment is attracting more customers. On Jan. 28, the company announced a multi-year enterprise agreement for its Foundry Platform with Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO). Cyclical miners need data integration projects and digitization to transform the business. The mining and metals market is highly competitive. So, giant companies like Rio will need to operate more efficiently to survive. And as the pandemic continues, the company may optimize its value chains to maximize the safety of its staff and customers. On Jan. 19, Palantir said it would provide Pacific Gas and Electric Company (NYSE:PCG) with its Foundry software. This will enable PG&E to have an integrated platform, giving decision-makers “a real-time, complete operational picture.” The deal is for several years and is in the multi-million-dollar range. This is the first U.S. utility customer for Palantir. Downside Price Target Only six analysts offer a price target on Palantir. According to Tipranks, the stock has a downside target of $18.80. Morgan Stanley’s analysts posted the most recent analysis on the stock, citing valuation concerns. Palantir’s 49% jump in the last month contradicts the analyst’s opinion. But if the indices lose momentum, investors may sell Palantir stock, too. A drop in the share price would give investors who missed the $10 post-initial public offering entry price. A discount to that level is highly unlikely, though. The company’s product update on each of its platforms – Foundry, Gotham, and Apollo – will lift sales in 2021. Demos of the platform will attract commercial and government customers, too. Risks Palantir’s AI-based technology is not easy to implement. Its complexity will require more trained staff to support customers. The company will need to increase its operating expenses to hire staff as it wins more customer contracts. This will weigh on the near-term results. Investors with a long-term view of Palantir’s prospects will watch the growth in recurring (subscription) revenue. Just as software giants like Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) post strong subscription sales each quarter, Palantir will eventually do the same. Your Takeaway PLTR stock has a solid moat in its platform and products. Patience will pay off for shareholders as the company continues to grow. When it reports quarterly results in the weeks ahead, management may raise its guidance. Government customers may increase their contract scope as their budget allows. Other software customers will lose business while Palantir takes on more work.

Vale -- the other member of the trio of suppliers that dominate the seaborne market -- will deliver its production report on Wednesday, including updating annual guidance.Stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter output or an increase in 2021 projections at Vale could pour more cold water on iron ore prices that have recoiled on China’s push to rein in steelmaking amid slumping margins and rising port stockpiles.Futures, which surged to as high as $175 a metric ton in December, have slipped back to about $150 and could end the year at $100, according to Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.Click here for more on iron’s nasty weekStill, there’s also a stronger-for-longer case, with Morgan Stanley this week outlining the “plausible scenario” of $165-plus over the next three years. A disappointing report from the world’s second-largest supplier would support such a storyline. While Chinese demand may slow, it remains robust.The Rio de Janeiro-based company will report quarterly output of 86.6 million tons, according to the average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be a slight decline from the third quarter but well ahead of the same period a year earlier.Assuming there were no big surprises in the final three months of the year, attention will focus on guidance. In its previous report, Vale lowered its 2020 iron ore projection to between 300 million and 305 million tons and forecast 315 million to 335 million tons this year. At the time, executives described the 2021 goal as part of a conservative approach, leaving the door open to adjustments. Since then, operations resumed at its Samarco venture with BHP.Vale is still looking to return to a capacity of 400 million tons, which would see it regain the title of world’s biggest producer that it lost to Rio Tinto in the wake of the Brumadinho dam collapse that killed 270 people.But the production recovery is taking a little longer than thought as Vale navigates legal and pandemic obstacles. That helped fuel last year’s price rally that pushed up earnings. The company was raised to an investment-grade credit rating by Moody’s and has reinstated dividend payments.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shaky-iron-market-turns-vale-200140483.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-01-28	2021-01-28 22:16:20	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Palantir Gains Rio Tinto As A Client For Foundry Platform	On Thursday, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR) announced it had signed a multi-year enterprise agreement with Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO), a mining and metals company, for use of its Foundry platform. What Happened: As part of Rio Tinto’s move to digital operations, it will use Palantir’s Foundry platform to help its front line and office-based workers integrate data securely and easily in order to “make decisions and take actions using a single source of truth that combines operational and transactional data,” according to the report. Why It Matters: Palantir recently debuted its Foundry and Gotham platforms at its demo day on Tuesday. The Foundry platform “reimagines how people use data by removing the barriers between back-end data management and front-end data analysis” and will increase productivity by allowing simpler and quicker decision making in Rio Tinto’s operations “leading to improved results in safety, cost and production,” said Fay Cranmer, Rio Tinto’s chief information officer. Related Link: Palantir To Debut New Software, Apps At Inaugural Demo Day What’s Next: Palantir already secured a .5 billion contract with the Trump administration for its Foundry and Gotham platforms to integrate data pertaining to COVID-19. On Palantir’s inaugural demo day, companies were able to see how the software works and decide if it's something that would benefit their operations. Rio Tinto thinks it will, and it's only a matter of time before more companies jump on board. (Photo: Palantir) See more from BenzingaClick here for options trades from BenzingaTim Cook Vs.

2021-01-15	2021-01-15 20:10:55	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Michelob Ultra Goes Greener With Aluminum in MacBooks	(Bloomberg) -- Michelob Ultra beer is getting an upgrade: it’ll be served in cans made from the same aluminum used in Apple MacBooks.The appeal of the metal is a better carbon footprint. Beermaker Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and metal producer Rio Tinto Group said Friday that the new cans are partly made using a “carbon-free” process that eliminates greenhouse gases. The specialty metal comes from a joint venture between Rio Tinto and Alcoa Corp., called Elysis, which has counted Apple Inc. among its backers.American consumers have been demanding and paying more for food and beverages that make sustainability claims, causing many traditional brands to scramble for an edge among shoppers.The move to lower-carbon cans advances “the transition toward more sustainable packaging” and also provides traceability, Tolga Egrilmezer, Rio Tinto’s vice president of sales and marketing, said in a statement. “Responsibly produced aluminium can play key role in helping our customers deliver the sustainable products expected by today’s consumers.”The new aluminum-making process emits oxygen instead of carbon, a process that could revolutionize the industry if it’s successful at a commercial scale.Rio Tinto said 2.5 million of the cans will be distributed over the coming months. Michelob Ultra is the second-highest selling beer by dollars in the U.S. after Bud Light, according to data from research firm IRI.More details: The Michelob Ultra cans were manufactured at Anheuser-Busch’s Metal Container Corporation facility in Jacksonville, Florida, using the Elysis aluminum cast into sheet ingots from Rio Tinto’s plant in Quebec, Canada.The companies did not provide specific volume or mix of aluminum coming from the Elysis joint-venture.Anheuser-Busch partnered with Rio Tinto in October to market the lower-carbon cans.(Updates with scale of can distribution in sixth paragraph.

2021-01-15	2021-01-15 19:01:10	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	U.S. Approves Copper Mine Land Swap on Native American Land	(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government published a report Friday that triggers a swap involving Native American land for an area that could become North America’s largest copper mine, pushing the project into the next phase of a permitting process.The U.S. Forest Service’s final environmental impact statement finalizes a land swap at Oak Flat in Arizona for Rio Tinto Group’s Resolution Copper mine, which has received increased scrutiny from indigenous groups in recent weeks and months. The agency also published a draft record of decision indicating it will issue, pending review, permits for use of power lines, pipelines and roads in the area.Rio Tinto said in a statement following the publication that it will continue to engage with Native American tribes and seek consent before any decision on the development of the project. The company is trying to avoid repeating mistakes it made on the other side of the world.Resolution Copper’s project manager wrote to 11 Native American tribes last month, saying the company welcomed the opportunity to increase direct engagement with the groups while emphasizing that the development remains in the early stages.The outreach comes as indigenous groups are getting more vocal about the finalization of the Oak Flat land swap, less than a year after London-based Rio Tinto provoked public and investor outrage when it leveled Aboriginal heritage sites in Australia during a mine expansion. The actions led to the departure of the firm’s then-Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two other key managers.Read more: Rio Names New CEO as Scrutiny Over Australian Blasts LingersResolution will pose a key early test for new CEO Jakob Stausholm, promoted into the role with a task to improve ties to local communities. The project may also show whether President-elect Joe Biden can both preserve the environment while speeding a transition to clean energy, which will require more copper and other metals.It’s likely the decision in the draft Record of Decision document will be made after the transfer of the Oak Flat parcel to Resolution Copper, the government said in its report.“Following the land exchange, all mineral extraction operations will take place on private land,” the document said. “In addition, Resolution Copper has indicated that it intends to place the tailings storage facility on private lands or Arizona State Trust lands.”The only decision to be made by the Forest Service concerns the proposed use of roads and land of the National Forest System for a tailings pipeline and power lines, the document said.Apache Stronghold, which represents the San Carlos Apache tribe, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Phoenix this week seeking to stop both the land transfer and the Forest Service’s statement. A judge denied the request late Thursday.Resolution, which Rio says would be able to supply 25% of U.S. copper needs, is committed to “careful and respectful treatment” of any Native American artifacts or ancestral remains found on the property, project manager Andrew Lye said in a Dec. 23 letter seen by Bloomberg.“We will comply with all laws related to Native American cultural heritage and will strive to do more,” Lye said. “I would welcome the opportunity to discuss these commitments with you and hear your views and ideas on these and any other matters you may wish to raise as we seek to work together in a way that can provide mutual benefit for us all.”The language of the letter contrasts with the company’s disastrous handling of Western Australia’s Juukan Gorge, where blasts in May flattened natural rock shelters that showed a record of life more than 40,000 years ago. Rio faced criticism over poor communication with traditional landowners of the sites.The San Carlos Apache tribe has been one of the most vocal groups opposed to the project, with its Chairman Terry Rambler drawing comparisons between the Australian debacle and the U.S. situation.“Like the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge, Oak Flat is a sacred and holy place that Resolution Copper greedily seeks,” Rambler said last year in a letter to a committee of Australian lawmakers. “If the land transfer occurs, Resolution Copper’s block cave mine will decimate Oak Flat, swallowing it whole by massive subsidence and collapse, leaving a huge crater almost two miles across and a thousand feet deep.”Land SwapIt’s a critical point that also comes as some worry the outgoing Trump administration is attempting to push through approvals, despite the land swap being part of Congressional legislation signed by the Obama administration years ago. That law said the formal handover would not be approved until after the EIS.Rio Tinto has reiterated that the project isn’t being fast-tracked and remains in the permitting and study phase. The Biden administration will oversee permitting that must be approved in the next few years, and the company says the decision to invest in construction hasn’t been made. BHP Group, the world’s top miner, is Rio’s partner in the project.“BHP recognizes the Resolution Copper project area has historical cultural significance for Native American tribes, and their members,” BHP said in an emailed statement after the U.S. publications. “BHP funding decisions in relation to Resolution Copper will be contingent upon the project satisfying both commercial considerations and alignment with our values, policies and practices in relation to the rights of indigenous peoples.”Oak Flat will remain untouched for decades and the land swap includes area around the sacred Apache Leap, which will be protected in perpetuity, according to Rio.The vice chairman of the White Mountain Apache Tribe, Jerome Kasey III, in a November letter acknowledged its inclusion in the consultation process with the Forest Service on the Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Resolution Copper project “ensuring the inclusion of the tribal voice.”(Updates with BHP statement in third-to-last graph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-approves-copper-mine-land-170810166.html?.tsrc=rss

BC Hydro's Site C dam, Rio Tinto's Kemano T2 hydropower project, the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, TC Energy's Coastal GasLink pipeline and the Royal Dutch Shell-led LNG Canada project are named in the order.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/british-columbia-post-holiday-covid-180226920.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-18	2020-12-18 09:30:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	China-Australia relations: Rio Tinto makes anti-pollution deal with world's largest steel producer amid iron ore price controversy	"Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto has agreed to invest millions of dollars in low-carbon steelmaking projects and research alongside the world's largest steel producer, China Baowu Steel Group, for the next two years, in a show of partnership as concerns of an iron ore trade rupture continue to froth.The US$10 million investment is an extension of a 2019 agreement between Rio Tinto, China Baowu and Tsinghua University to develop and implement new methods to reduce carbon emissions in the steel supply chain. The money will be used to fund the joint establishment of a Low Carbon Raw Materials Preparation R&D; Centre to develop lower carbon ore preparation processes.It will go towards paying for work on carbon dioxide utilisation at the China Baowu Low Carbon Metallurgical Innovation Centre, which is researching new technologies to create a low-carbon steel industry.Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China.""This investment with our partners at China Baowu is an important step in our climate partnership,"" Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a press release, while indicating that the partners had already identified specific projects that could produce significant carbon-reduction solutions.The Chinese industry has also taken steps to reduce emissions in an effort to line up with China's goal of being carbon neutral by 2060.Earlier this month, at the virtual Climate Ambition Summit 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed that China would reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by ""at least"" 65 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, raising the target slightly from the country's previous goal of ""up to"" 65 per cent.Baowu chairman Chen Derong said the Chinese steel industry has reached a consensus that global climate change is a priority, but it will require ""collective action"" from all parties - both upstream and downstream - in the supply chain.Rio's investment announcement comes at a delicate time in the industry, with soaring iron ore prices continuing to put pressure on steel mill margins. Rio and its competitor, ﻿BHP, another major iron ore supplier to China, were recently in discussions with the Chinese steel industry body, China Iron & Steel Association (CISA), over the reasons behind the surging price of iron ore, which was sitting at about US$155 a tonne on Thursday morning.Last week, it hit a record high of nearly US$160 a tonne, about twice the price at the start of the year.China-Australia relations: iron ore price surges amid strong demand and souring tiesThe CISA voiced concerns that the current pricing was not conducive to the steel supply chain, questioning miners about reductions in shipments, and calling on Chinese regulators to investigate bullish iron ore derivatives trading on the Dalian Commodity Exchange that could be affecting the price of iron ore.Both Rio and BHP committed to work with the Chinese steel industry to get to the bottom of the price anomalies while ensuring market and price transparency.Baowu and its Baoshan subsidiary, another big steelmaker, have so far been able to mitigate the high iron ore prices as a result of their larger size and negotiating power on iron ore purchases, but the same could not be said for smaller steel mills, analysts said.""Rising steel prices and the company's competitive cost structure have helped offset the high iron ore prices so far this year,"" S&P; Global Ratings said in a note. ""Baowu's large procurement volumes and stable relationships with suppliers offer the company a cost edge over smaller steel mills.""As the largest steel mill in the world, Baowu's strong market position will bolster its pricing power and ability to pass higher raw material costs to end-users, in our view,"" the note added.Baoshan, too, would piggyback on its parent Baowu's large raw material procurement and get similar discounts, S&P; said.As escalating political tensions between China and Australia spill into trade that has seen Chinese restrictions imposed on Australian exports of coal, lobster and cotton, as well as anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures against Australian wine and barley, there were growing concerns in Australia over the impact of the conflict on iron ore - the most significant trade between the two countries.Both countries are dependent on each other for the supply and purchase of the steelmaking material. About 60 per cent of the China's iron ore imports come from Australia, and Australia sells about 80 per cent of its iron ore to China. The most recent official Australian figures put the total value of its iron ore trade with China at A$84.9 billion (US$64.2 billion), for the July 2019 to June 2020 period.China-Australia trade deal does not oblige either country to continue buying goods, lawyers sayAustralian Senator and former resources minister Matt Canavan earlier this week called for the imposition of a levy on iron ore to China in retaliation against China's trade actions.""The funds raised can be used to compensate the Australian industries harmed by China's actions,"" he said in an opinion piece published in The Australian. ""We could then signal that every time China takes further action against Australian exporters, the levy would go up. We could signal that the levy would be removed if China ended its unjustified trade restrictions.""When asked whether the Australian government would consider the move, resources minister Keith Pitt did not warm to that idea in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, saying instead that the government would stick to working under a rules-based system and would adhere to all of its World Trade Organization and bilateral trade commitments.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

2020-12-18	2020-12-18 06:06:14	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	New Rio Boss Is a Crisis Veteran Facing His Biggest Test Yet	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group’s new chief executive officer, Jakob Stausholm, has a reputation as a crisis manager and peacemaker. He’ll need both those skills as he takes over one of the toughest jobs in mining.Rio will look to the 52-year-old Dane to repair relations with investors and authorities after the destruction of an ancient Aboriginal site hurt the company’s reputation at a time when corporate responsibility has never been so important. Stausholm, who’s been finance chief for the past two years, has a reputation as a well-liked and inclusive executive who’s dealt with crises in prior jobs in the oil and shipping industries. This will be his first CEO role.“He brings a very collaborative style which I think is going to be helpful in rebuilding some of the relationships we have around the world,” Simon Thompson, Rio’s chairman, said in an interview Thursday.Stausholm replaces Jean-Sebastien Jacques, a hard-charging Frenchman whose sudden downfall sent shockwaves through the industry. In the past, investors have tended to accept that mining, by its nature, is dirty and environmentally destructive. While Rio apologized for the Australian blasts that destroyed a 46,000 year-old heritage site, the company initially backed its CEO. It was caught off guard by a furious backlash from shareholders, who turned their ire on the board and chairman until Jacques was forced out.Fixing Rio’s relationships in Australia, where Rio operates hugely profitable iron-ore mines, will be Stausholm’s biggest test. Legislators this month branded Rio’s actions as “inexcusable” and said that it “knew the value of what they were destroying but blew it up anyway.” Thompson himself jetted into Australia in November to visit the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, the traditional owners of the caves.Read: A Miner Blew Up Ancient Human History. An Industry May Pay The new CEO will also need to show he can step out from Jacques’s shadow. Some investors had called for an external appointment, to draw a line under this year’s failures and improve a working environment that current and former employees have described in private conversations as difficult. The company’s internal culture has also been criticized on several occasions by Australian authorities probing the Juukan Gorge blasts.“The decision to appoint the CEO internally was a surprise as we had expected Rio’s Board to seek an external candidate for the role,” analysts at Macquarie said in a note. Rio’s shares rose as much as 1.3% in Sydney on Friday, hitting their highest in over 12 years.As a relative newcomer, Stausholm will have the inside knowledge to be effective immediately, but also the fresh perspective to bring about change. Despite the challenges, the miner’s business is booming amid surging commodity prices.“Stausholm is an excellent, cool-headed and sensible appointment,” said Edward Sterck, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “We do not expect an immediate change in Rio Tinto’s corporate strategy, but we do anticipate a transformation in corporate culture over time.”Since joining Rio two years ago, the new CEO has kept a relatively low profile among the investment community. He’s seen as a more personable and collaborate executive than his predecessor, and is well liked within the company. Yet many of his public appearances were overshadowed by the more charismatic Jacques. At more than 6 foot 7 inches tall, he is a keen sportsman who competes in triathlons.“Jakob provides exactly the right balance of continuity on strategy, but a new leadership style,” Thompson said. “On the 1st of January I’m sure he will hit the ground running.”Read: Rio Urged To Make Restitution Over Aboriginal Site BlastsStausholm was seen as a rising star during his nearly two decades at Royal Dutch Shell Plc, spending time in Argentina, Denmark, Singapore and later London where he was chief internal auditor, dealing with Shell’s 2004 reserves crisis.He was hired in 2012 by Denmark’s biggest company, A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, and rose through the ranks of the firm’s container-line unit. In 2016, as Maersk started a process to break up its century-old conglomerate structure, Stausholm was promoted to group CFO.He also took control of technology and transformation, effectively putting him in charge of the historic shift and making him the executive group’s key person to communicate the changes to investors. The company’s shares fell after his sudden departure was announced in 2018.His experience with dealing with crises at both Shell and Maersk is seen a key strength.The new CEO will also have to deal with challenges at Rio’s big Oyu Tolgoi copper project in Mongolia, where an expansion is overbudget and behind schedule. Rio’s also facing relationship and reputatios troubles over the flagship project.Read: Rio Rules Out Worst-Case Cost Blowout for Flagship Copper MineThe company through which it controls the project started arbitration proceedings over the way it’s being funded and U.S. hedge fund Pentwater Capital Management has blasted Rio over the way it’s managed the asset. The Mongolian government has been pushing for an independent review of the delays and cost overruns.As well as fixing the company’s culture, Stausholm will be expected to maintain a business strategy that has helped its share price soar to the highest in 12 years.Buoyed by surging iron ore and copper prices, Rio has handed back record amounts of cash to investors, including about $20 billion in the past two years. It’s also managed to get out of thermal coal, putting the company ahead of competitors who are under investor pressure to do the same. “Finding someone who can steady the ship and not make everyone upset is the right way to go,” said Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum.(Adds analyst comment and shares in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-boss-crisis-veteran-facing-164759802.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-17	2020-12-17 10:43:35	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Names New CEO as Scrutiny Over Australian Blasts Lingers	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group named finance head Jakob Stausholm as chief executive officer, tapping a relative newcomer to manage the fallout over its destruction of ancient Aboriginal sites in Australia.Danish-born Stausholm, 52, takes the helm at a time of crisis for the world’s second-largest miner. The blasts that destroyed a 46,000 year-old heritage site have damaged relations in Australia -- where Rio operates hugely profitable iron-ore mines --sparked criticism from investors and shined a spotlight on how the group’s internal culture may have contributed to the failures. They also cost outgoing chief Jean-Sebastien Jacques his job.While some shareholders who called for fresh blood at the top may be disappointed, Stausholm, who takes over as CEO on Jan. 1, is still new to both Rio and the mining industry. He joined the company as chief financial officer in 2018 from shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and earlier in his career spent 19 years with Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Read: A Miner Blew Up Ancient Human History. An Industry May PayThe new leader will need to convince investors, regulators and legislators that the mining giant can address its governance failings. He also inherits a multibillion-dollar copper mine expansion in Mongolia that’s been beset by delays, a budget blowout and a public spat with its partners on the project. Still, Rio’s core businesses are booming, with both iron ore and copper trading at multiyear highs, and its shares have outperformed rivals in recent years.“He’s got some bridges to mend that’s for certain. The problem is he’s part of the company where that happened,” said David Lennox, a resources analyst at Fat Prophets. “It’s a trade-off -- he’s knows the company well, he knows its operations.”Since joining Rio two years ago, the new CEO has kept a relatively low profile among the investment community. He’s seen as a more personable and collaborate executive than his predecessor, and is well liked within the company. Yet many of his public appearances were overshadowed by the more charismatic Jacques. At more than 6 foot 7 inches tall, he is a keen sportsman who competes in triathlons.In the aftermath of the Aboriginal-site blasts in May, Stausholm was among executives and directors who led meetings with investors, Indigenous leaders and legislators. That means he’s not only familiar with the company’s businesses, but also its response to the fallout in Australia. He already sits on Rio’s board.Read: Rio Urged To Make Restitution Over Aboriginal Site BlastsIn a statement, Stausholm said he was “acutely aware” of the need to restore trust with traditional landowners, adding that he viewed it as a key priority for the company.While Rio has responded to investor pressure by replacing senior executives, Chairman Simon Thompson is also under pressure to shake up the board to ensure the views of the Indigenous community are better incorporated into the company’s decision making. Rio, which is headquartered in London, has been criticized for a lack of understanding about community issues in Western Australia. The company’s iron-ore unit accounted for more than 90% of first-half earnings.“As an investor, we are closely watching how Rio’s board and its senior leadership take action to improve governance and oversight,” said Debby Blakey, CEO at Hesta, one of Australia’s biggest pension funds. “Investors have an expectation of significant and lasting change. A vital first step is opening up all agreements with traditional owners to an independent review.”Stausholm’s appointment also extends a broader changing of the guard across the world’s biggest mining companies. Larger rival BHP Group installed Mike Henry as its CEO in January, 2020, while Glencore Plc’s long-term boss Ivan Glasenberg in December announced he’ll retire and be replaced by insider Gary Nagle.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-names-stausholm-ceo-055259285.html?.tsrc=rss

Mr Stausholm, who joined as the group's chief financial officer in 2018, will start his new role on Jan 1, replacing outgoing boss Jean-Sebastien Jacques. Mr Jacques was forced to quit after an international outcry following the mining giant's disastrous decision to blow up 46,000-year-old sacred caves in Australia in search of iron ore. He will leave Rio on March 31, the company said.

2020-12-10	2020-12-10 11:31:42	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Iron Ore Is This Year’s Hottest Commodity on China-Fueled Surge	(Bloomberg) -- A surge in demand in China, the world’s key growth engine, risks a shortage of iron ore that’s pushed prices past $150 a ton and crowned it this year’s best-performing major commodity.Futures in Singapore have surged about 70% this year, hitting their highest since trading started in 2013, as China’s stimulus-led rebound fuels steel output and consumption. The rally received an added boost from Vale SA’s cut to annual production guidance last week, while the first quarter is likely to bring elevated risks of weather disruptions for southern hemisphere producers.At the heart of the gains is China’s position as the only major economy to see a sustained and robust rebound from a pandemic-driven slump this year, with investment in infrastructure a key pillar of growth. That’s boosting steel demand, buoying prices of the alloy and encouraging the top steelmaker to increase output even as input costs rise.It’s also got Chinese buyers seeking an intervention, and shares of Australian producers BHP Group and Rio Tinto Group soaring, while some market watchers are starting to caution that prices are rising beyond what’s justified by fundamentals.“The market is in disequilibrium right now -- investors are trading industrial metals like iron ore as a speculative play on how China’s economy is going to perform,” said Atilla Widnell, co-founder at Navigate Commodities. “There is no way iron ore can be at $150 based on demand and supply fundamentals.”Morgan Stanley said prices look increasingly overbought, though it forecast a deficit, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has highlighted the potential for more upside amid a shortage. Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. warned moderating steel production could pave the way for softer iron ore demand even as it predicted a tight market next year.Futures climbed as much as 5.7% to $155 a ton on the Singapore Exchange, before trading at $154.86. Iron ore futures in Dalian jumped 5.7%, while hot-rolled coil and rebar in Shanghai also advanced. Benchmark spot prices were at $157.45, the highest since 2013 when strong Chinese growth saw a surge in iron ore demand, though still about $36 below the record reached in 2010. High-grade ore climbed to the highest in data back to 2013, a sign of constrained supply from Brazil.Supply TroublesGoldman Sachs said this week it expects a “substantial” deficit next year, with resilient demand and restrained supply set to sustain bullish price momentum. Morgan Stanley forecasts a particularly tight first half of 2021, which will support prices above $100 a ton.On the supply side, shipments from Brazil in November dropped below 30 million tons for the first time since May. Vale’s lower production guidance for 2020 shows it’s struggling to return capacity after a dam disaster last year, and the company said it had taken a conservative approach to guiding for 2021.Figures from Australia’s Port Hedland, the biggest export terminal, showed a slight decline in shipments in November. On Thursday, the Pilbara Ports Authority issued cyclone advice and said it was clearing the port and anchorages of large vessels. There’s also concern that recommendations stemming from an inquiry into Rio’s destruction of an Aboriginal heritage site could impact Western Australian iron ore output.China’s iron ore port stockpiles, which at 128.7 million tons are the lowest since October, will be a key gauge of supply tightness. Goldman predicts levels could fall below 100 million tons by mid-2021, the first time below that threshold since 2016. Steel rebar inventories are the lowest since January.“The bull market for iron ore is set to extend into 2021,” Goldman said in its Dec. 8 report. “We now expect another substantial deficit next year, supported by a combination of only gradually decelerating China steel demand growth, sharply re-accelerating Western steel demand growth and tepid supply growth.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iron-ore-hottest-commodity-china-084005316.html?.tsrc=rss

It also advised that the state government replace the law with stronger protections.“Rio Tinto’s role in this tragedy is inexcusable,” the report said. “Rio knew the value of what they were destroying but blew it up anyway.”Explosions by Rio in May to open up a mining area at an iron ore operation impacted two rock-shelters -- shallow, cave-like structures -- in the Juukan Gorge region of Western Australia’s Pilbara region. The sites, used by Aboriginal Australians for cooking and shelter as long as 46,000-years ago, were among the most significant of their type in the country, according to archaeologists.“We recognize the destruction of the Juukan rockshelters caused significant pain to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people and we are working very hard to progress a remedy with them,” Rio’s Chairman Simon Thompson said in a statement, referring to the traditional landowners. The company said it has introduced some changes already aimed at bolstering protections for significant heritage sites.Other recommendations included that Rio carry out a full reconstruction of the site, commit to a permanent moratorium on mining in the Juukan Gorge area and undertake an independent review of all its agreements with traditional land owners.“We hope the inquiry’s preliminary findings prompt a fundamental reset of the sector, particularly in the relationships between Traditional Owners and mining companies,” PKKP Aboriginal Corporation spokesman Burchell Hayes said in a statement. “We have started the long road to healing and repairing our relationship with Rio Tinto, but there is still a long way to go.”While the blasts were lawful under a state government decision, Rio was accused of failing to act on information that later showed the heritage sites had greater significance than first understood. Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques was forced to step down in September after investors and legislators criticized the company’s tame initial response to the incident. He will leave his position by March, with two other key executives also leaving.The 196,000-square mile Pilbara is Australia’s most valuable iron ore region -- hosting a network of major mines that act as a profit engine for companies including Rio, BHP Group and billionaire Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. It’s also home to Indigenous communities that rank among the nation’s most disadvantaged, an imbalance that’s coming into sharper focus amid a wider investor drive for improved corporate responsibility.Iron ore is Australia’s top export earner, generating in excess of A$100 billion ($74 billion) in the year to end-June. The country’s top miners are also reaping the benefits of a price surge that has sent iron ore futures toward $150 a ton.At the same time, they are under increasing pressure from shareholders to bolster their environmental, social and corporate governance mandates and more fully account for their impact on the climate and local environments.A Rio board review into the company’s practices in protecting areas of cultural significance “did not go far enough,” said Liza McDonald, head of responsible investments at Aware Super, one of Australia’s biggest pension funds, ahead of the inquiry’s interim report.“Aware Super sees this issue as highlighting broader concerns at Rio Tinto around community engagement and First Nation people engagement, work culture and information flow across the organization and governance,” McDonald said, calling for a broader independent review with input from the Indigenous community.(Updates to add Rio Tinto comment in fifth paragraph.

Tribal leaders and other critics allege that the U.S. government is fast-tracking the environmental review process before Trump is replaced by President-elect Joe Biden next month, charges the government and Rio Tinto deny.  The land swap, outlined in U.S. government documents, reflects the tension between the increasing global attention on the rights of indigenous peoples and the need to boost metals production to power electric vehicles and reduce global carbon emissions.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-admin-set-approve-arizona-060000197.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-04	2020-12-04 17:59:18	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Billionaire Glasenberg’s Reign Spanned IPO Glory to Graft Probes	(Bloomberg) -- Ivan Glasenberg, a former coal trader who became the billionaire boss of Glencore Plc, will step down next year as the commodities behemoth navigates through corruption probes, scrutiny of its environmental bona fides and a share price that’s lost half its value during the past decade.The 63-year-old chief executive officer will relinquish his position within the next six months, he told investors Friday. He’ll be replaced by fellow South African Gary Nagle, 45, who oversees the company’s coal assets. Glencore’s London-listed shares rose to their highest in almost 10 months.The relentless Glasenberg took over as CEO in 2002 and became synonymous with the world’s biggest trader in coal, nickel, oil and agriculture. During his first nine years, the closely held company rode the Chinese-fueled commodity boom that sent demand for raw materials, and their prices, to unprecedented levels.That surge encouraged him to take the company public in a 36.7 billion-pound ($59 billion at the time) listing in London, providing the cash for a breakneck spree of deals that reshaped the industry. It bought Xstrata Plc in a $90 billion deal, becoming the world’s biggest coal shipper in the process. Glasenberg has a net worth estimated at about $4.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.“Ivan will be missed,” said Ben Davis, a mining analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. in London. “Far more capable of straight-talking than most CEOs, and it was always enjoyable to hear him cut through the illogical strategies of his peers.”Glencore’s troubles started in July 2018, when the company announced it was being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice for possible money laundering and corruption. Similar probes followed in Brazil, the U.K. and Switzerland, where Glencore is based and Glasenberg lives.At the core are Glencore’s operations in Democratic Republic of Congo and its deals with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, who was sanctioned by U.S. authorities for alleged corruption.The investigations sucked investor faith out of Glencore. The company subsequently lost more than half its value, prompting the first serious questions about whether Glasenberg was the right person to right the ship.Those doubts compounded as more institutional investors soured on the company’s giant thermal coal operations because of their greenhouse gas emissions.To help allay those concerns, Glencore said Friday it’s seeking to be a net-zero emissions company by 2050. That implies the company will be largely coal-free by then after running down the life of its current mines -- even while naming a coal-business veteran to be the new CEO. Glencore shares rose 3.1% in London, closing at their highest price since February.“We expect a seamless transition from Ivan to Gary,” said Chris LaFemina, an analyst with Jefferies LLC. “The announcement of Gary Nagle as Ivan Glasenberg’s successor is a positive.”Glasenberg was born in 1957 and grew up near Johannesburg, the son of a Lithuanian immigrant who imported and distributed luggage. He was a high-school athlete and became a national champion in race-walking. He graduated in 1981 from South Africa’s University of the Witwatersrand with an accounting degree and earned his master’s degree in business administration two years later at the University of Southern California.He learned the commodities trade at Marc Rich, the eponymous firm founded in 1974 by the man celebrated for inventing the spot-oil market. Rich later spent 17 years evading U.S. justice after making oil deals with Iran during the hostage crisis of 1979-1981. He was pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2001.Glasenberg was part of a management buyout from Rich in 1994 that saw the company renamed Glencore. Working under then-CEO Willy Strothotte, Glasenberg was instrumental in a strategy of buying the mines, smelters and refineries that produced the commodities it traded, helping separate the company from its major rivals.Glasenberg succeeded Strothotte in 2002, just as China embarked on a decade of economic expansion and infrastructure build-out that would make it the largest user of metals -- and Glencore’s biggest customer.The company’s global dealing in commodities enriched its owners, including Glasenberg, but the global financial crisis in 2008 forced change. Glencore’s reliance on bank leverage rather than shareholder equity left it exposed, while the company grew too big to be able to pay out its owners when they wanted to leave.That helped prompt Glencore to go public in 2011 just as commodity prices were hitting record highs. The promise of its black-box trading operation, which distinguished it from pure mining competitors, lured investors to pay 530 pence a share.During the next four years, the company evolved from disrupting the world of commodity trading to taking on the world’s biggest miners. Glasenberg implemented an empire-building strategy that scooped up mines across the globe. The Xstrata deal, a pursuit of Rio Tinto Group and analyst speculation about a possible bid for Anglo American Plc created an industry frenzy.The Xstrata takeover made Glencore the biggest coal shipper, while also spotlighting Glasenberg’s ruthless side. Mining grandee Mick Davis, who’d built Xstrata from a debt-laden miner into a $50 billion powerhouse, was poised to become CEO of the combined company, but shareholders revolted over payments he was set to receive.He was ousted, and Glasenberg took the top job. Davis has called that situation his lowest professional point.Glasenberg pursued more deals, spending billions of dollars on zinc mines in South America, soybean silos in Argentina and gas stations in South Africa.Looking back on almost 40 years of trading and investing in commodities, Glasenberg said Friday he got it right -- nearly always.“We’ve made investments over the years, most have been good,” he said. “I’d say 95% of them have been good.”As for the ones that didn’t work out, he said: “They’ve been small, thank God.”In 2014, Bloomberg News reported on Glencore’s tentative approaches to Rio Tinto, the second-biggest miner, before the talks progressed. Rio quashed the possibility, and Glasenberg missed the chance to absorb its huge iron ore tons, the world’s most-traded mined commodity, into Glencore’s fabled marketing business.Missing out on iron ore has hurt Glencore for years, with the company now dwarfed in value by Rio. That slump in Glencore’s value, especially compared with its rivals, led Glasenberg to say Friday he won’t play any role in the mining industry after retiring.Still, the company dominates the commodity supply chain as the biggest trader of cobalt, nickel and coal, and second-biggest of copper.Glasenberg’s chief lieutenants, who themselves became billionaires when the company listed, have been leaving the past two years. The exodus included former head of copper trading Telis Mistakidis, head of oil Alex Beard and Daniel Mate, who headed up its zinc business.Though Glasenberg is retiring, in many ways Glencore will remain under his influence. He holds a 9.1% stake in the company, making him its second-biggest shareholder.”I have no intention of selling my shares, and I have the full confidence of Gary to look after my investment,” he said in an interview minutes after announcing he was stepping down.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-glasenberg-ending-18-reign-154756574.html?.tsrc=rss

It is a critical moment for us and the industry.”Jacques was forced out last month after investors and legislators criticized Rio’s tame initial response to the incident, and will leave his position by March. Two other key executives are also leaving the company.It remains unclear what the long-term implications are for Rio’s iron ore unit -- its top earning division -- as the company revises its approach, and as Australia’s heritage laws are amended, Rio said earlier in a production report. Iron ore shipments fell 5% in the third quarter on maintenance work, the company said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-ceo-says-miner-made-014923313.html?.tsrc=rss

It’s also focused on exploration in the U.S., Mexico and Chile.“This cements that and obviously puts some more emphasis on it,” Biswas said. “It increases our optionality when we want to do things.”Newcrest, which raised about A$1.2 billion ($860 million) in share sales this year, has had renewed interest from North American investors in recent months as gold prices surged to a record. The company previously removed a Toronto listing in September 2013 after trading in Canada for about 18 months.“There’s a heightened interest in gold, particularly from generalist funds, and you’re starting to see some of that money coming into the market,” Biswas said. “I see no reason for that not to continue.”Newcrest has advanced about 3% in Sydney trading this year, compared to a 45% gain for industry leader Newmont Corp.’s U.S.-listed shares and a 40% rise in the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index.Biswas, who took up his post in July 2014, has been named among potential contenders to be appointed as CEO of Rio Tinto Group, which is seeking a new leader. He previously ran Rio’s Pacific Aluminium unit.Read more: Rio Needs More Than a Safe Pair Of Hands: Clara Ferreira MarquesIn response to the speculation, Biswas said that having worked to improve reliability and performance at Newcrest’s key operations, he now wants to helm the miner’s growth drive. “That’s a very rare thing,” he said. “It would be really cool for me to be able to execute that, and that’s my focus.”(Updates to add share price moves in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newcrest-ceo-says-primed-americas-022728247.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-28	2020-09-28 21:00:08	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Needs More Than a Safe Pair Of Hands	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Rio Tinto Group may choose to play it safe in its next choice of chief executive officer. With Jean-Sebastien Jacques heading for the exit after the destruction of a sacred Aboriginal site, Australian politicians are also piling on pressure for a local to be given the role. The mining giant should resist the temptation of an old-school solution.Jacques’s successor will certainly have to rebuild Rio’s credibility after the spectacular failure at Juukan Gorge. Repairing frayed community and government relations will be among the first tasks. It won’t be enough to pick a veteran technocrat for CEO, though, as miners did after the mistakes of the last boom. He or she won’t be able to repeat the trick that saw French-born J-S, as he is widely known, hand back billions to shareholders. The new boss will have to show Rio understands the iron ore business, which accounts for more than 90% of earnings and where prices are softening. Longer-term reconstruction will also involve resolving large, troublesome projects in Guinea and Mongolia, and positioning the company for greener growth. A steady hand on the tiller, while necessary, won’t be sufficient.Jacques, who took the top job in 2016 at 44, did plenty of things right. Rio has distributed $38 billion in cash returns since that year, including 2020’s interim dividend, and the shares have doubled. He extricated Rio from the Freeport-McMoRan Inc.-operated Grasberg mine in Indonesia. And he sold out of coal at a laudable price, well before peers began to rush for the door — even if the environmental, social and governance halo that came with both of those departures didn’t last.The outgoing CEO has also left plenty of problems for his replacement, well beyond the public relations disaster in Western Australia. A unit he set up to invest in green-economy materials has yet to make its mark. Mongolia, where Jacques’s role in settling a previous dispute was key to his elevation, remains a technical, financial and political  headache. The future of the giant Simandou iron ore mine in Guinea is also unclear. Least defensible of all, he stopped short of putting the miner on a decisively carbon-light track, failing to set targets for lower emissions beyond the company’s own operations.To make matters worse, his premature departure could hardly have been messier. As a result, a tainted CEO remains in place temporarily, while the chairman and board who will pick his replacement are badly sullied, too. They underestimated the problem and initially backed the forceful Jacques. They also failed to adequately prepare for his succession.Yet while the Anglo-Australian miner has suffered a reputational hit, its core operation is still producing impressive margins. It’s an enviable position that gives the company room to do more than bask in the iron ore price, even if investors are wary of radical moves — its shares rose after Jacques’s departure, on relief that big investments are off the table for now.One option to signal  willingness to change is to pick an outsider, preferably one with operational expertise to appease investors, but also enough familiarity with Rio to grapple with the culture and its problems.  That could be rail freight operator Aurizon Holdings Ltd.’s Andrew Harding, a former Rio iron ore boss passed over for the top job in 2016, if his Pilbara record holds up after Juukan Gorge. Otherwise, gold miner Newmont Corp.’s Tom Palmer, who previously worked in iron ore, or Newcrest Mining Ltd.’s Sandeep Biswas. Better yet, Rio could pick a female leader. Worthy candidates include Zoe Yujnovich, a one-time boss of Rio’s Canadian iron ore venture, before she left for Royal Dutch Shell Plc in 2014.Outsiders can be slow to bring on board, though, and Rio cannot afford to wait six or 12 months. Insiders, then, come into view.The new chief will have to rebuild bridges. Besides Western Australia, this matters in Mongolia, where Rio is in arbitration over tax payments. In Guinea, there is an election on the horizon. That may point to Mongolian-born Bold Baatar, who has been involved with the Oyu Tolgoi operation and is now in charge of Simandou, as part of energy and minerals. Former bankers make deal-wary shareholders uneasy, though. That suggests instead aluminum boss Alf Barrios, who has led a turnaround and proved he can tune in to clients’ green demands. China, a key consumer of Rio’s iron ore and other metals, has just promised to be carbon neutral by 2060, a warning worth heeding. Change isn’t easy, as BP Plc has shown. Adapting to the zero-emissions reality will be less dramatic for Rio, but no less necessary.One person can’t fix all these things, of course. A final step will be to refresh Rio’s underwhelming board, particularly with ESG and community relations experience, given mining in the Pilbara won’t be the same in the next decade and beyond.  There’s room here for that extra Australian voice that Canberra is demanding, perhaps in the chairman’s spot. Jacques’s abrupt departure has offered the world’s second-largest miner a chance to course-correct. Rio would be foolish not to take it. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-09-27	2020-09-27 00:00:15	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Miners Carve Themselves an Ugly Heritage	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The most shocking thing about Rio Tinto Group’s demolition of a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site in Australia’s remote Pilbara region is how commonplace it was.The Pilbara is source of about half of the world’s traded iron ore, worth about $65 billion a year. It’s also a crucial area of world heritage, home to the world’s largest collection of art from before the last ice age — a complex of thousands of sites and hundreds of thousands of individual rock carvings. Digging iron ore out of the ground and carrying it to port inevitably involves conflicts between miners and the Aboriginal traditional owners. So far, the miners have won every time.Since 2010, mining companies have applied to the Western Australian state government to carry out works 463 times, using the same 1972 Aboriginal Heritage Act that Rio Tinto relied on to lay waste to Juukan Gorge in May. As of that month, none of those proposals had been rejected. BHP Group was granted permission to destroy 40 sites just days after the demolition.Despite the resignation of three of Rio Tinto's top executives earlier this month over their handling of Juukan Gorge, the destruction itself wasn’t illegal. Indeed, it was only unusual because of the measured antiquity of the site and the willingness of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners to speak out.“It’s a farce, it’s non-existent rule of law,” says Nolan Hunter, a member of the Bardi people and chief executive officer of the Kimberley Land Council, representing Aboriginal traditional owners northeast of the Pilbara. “The law’s meant to be about heritage protection. But there is no protection.”Changing the 1972 Act has been a key priority of Ben Wyatt, a descendant of the Pilbara’s Yamatji people who’s the state’s first Indigenous Treasurer. Earlier this month, he published legislation to remove the most controversial aspects of the law, promising it would reset relations between traditional owners and industry and empower landowner groups.Already, though, the process is falling apart. An ongoing inquiry into Juukan Gorge has brought to the surface many of the ways in which Aboriginal groups have long been disadvantaged — for instance, through gag clauses in agreements with mining companies, which prevent public criticism or objections under the heritage laws. It’s not clear that these issues would be resolved by the new legislation. The Kimberley Land Council and South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council have declared Wyatt’s proposed changes “pointless,” since despite new appeal channels the final decision would still rest with the relevant minister.That issue is fundamental. As we’ve written, the core of most mining disputes comes down to a zero-sum battle between miners, governments and landowners about who should receive the economic benefits from developing a pit.Income from mining royalties provides about one-fifth of Western Australia’s state budget, or close to one-third of the amount raised in-state after grants from the federal level are taken into account. In that context, ministers are hardly impartial observers of disputes between miners and traditional owners — they’re interested parties, who can be expected to come down on the side of development, and resultant royalty revenue, at every turn.“Our people don’t really have a choice, because if they don’t agree then the proponent can go to the minister,” says Hunter. “Is there really ability for people to give consent when it’s under these sorts of conditions?”A just resolution shouldn’t be impossible. As evidenced by the large number of existing agreements with mining companies, traditional owners are happy for development to go ahead provided they have a proper say in protection of their heritage and due compensation for the digging of their land. Miners’ images have been tarnished by what happened at Juukan Gorge; it’s in their best interests now to support a solution that genuinely works for all sides.The problem with the current and proposed laws is that they deny Aboriginal people a level playing field in negotiation. The agreements already in place were often made under duress. Traditional owners “had no real choice but to take the deals that were offered or take nothing,” as the Pilbara-based Banjima Native Title Aboriginal Corp. wrote in a submission to the Juukan Gorge inquiry last month. A better system, oddly enough, would return to the spirit of the original 1972 law. That legislation gave the final say in heritage questions to a panel of archaeologists, anthropologists and Aboriginal experts, before being amended in 1980 to give that power to the minister.What’s needed is an independent commission to decide these issues, made up of traditional owners, mining representatives, and academic experts. Its work should be done in public, and Aboriginal people should hold the majority. That could be the honest broker to settle these disputes in a way that works for all parties. A heritage system that never protects heritage isn’t worthy of the name. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

During the summer, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer had expressed concern about recent struggles by American aluminum producers.The decision to reverse course in a matter of weeks comes in the shadow of President Donald Trump’s re-election efforts, in which major polls show him trailing Democratic nominee Joe Biden in key battleground states. The tariffs increased domestic aluminum prices amid a shortage of beverage cans in North America, heightening concerns that an increase in the raw material could fall on the shoulders of domestic brewers and soda companies, and eventually consumers.While the USTR announced the removal of the tariff, it said it “expects” shipments from Canada will be no greater than 83,000 tons in September and November and no greater than 70,000 tons in October and December, effectively signaling a quota. But Canada has not yet made a commitment to a volume limit.Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told journalists in a press conference that Canada would drop the counter tariffs it threatened as retaliation, but left the door open for future measures if the U.S. imposed duties. USTR said it would reimpose the 10% tariff retroactively if actual shipments exceed 105% of the expected volume for any of the months.“Should tariffs be reimposed on our aluminum exports in the future, Canada will retaliate with perfectly reciprocal dollar-for-dollar tariffs as we have done in the past,” Freeland said. “We will always stand up for our workers and our industry.”Shares of Century Aluminum, the second-largest U.S. producer with significant production in the country, slumped 11% to $9.33, reversing an earlier 5.4% gain.“After consultations with the Canadian government, the United States has determined that trade in non-alloyed, unwrought aluminum is likely to normalize in the last four months of 2020, with imports declining sharply from the surges experienced earlier in the year,” the U.S. Trade Representative’s office said in a statement.A senior Canadian government official stressed the USTR announcement was a U.S. decision to drop tariffs.“What American manufacturers need now is certainty that these tariffs won’t make another reappearance,” Myron Brilliant, EVP and head of international affairs, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in an emailed statement. “Setting aside these threats once and for all will allow American job creators to focus on economic recovery.”Can DemandBall Corp., the biggest aluminum can producer in the world, last month said demand in North America continued to outstrip supply and accelerated meaningfully in Europe and South America.Lockdowns have forced restaurants and bars, which rely heavily on sales of beer from kegs, to shutter, meaning consumers are stocking up on 12-packs. Makers of aluminum can sheet have seen demand gain as people drink more at home.Alf Barrios, the chief executive of Rio Tinto Aluminum, the largest producer in North America, said in an emailed statement that the decision is a positive step that ensures the North American supply chain will remain strong amid challenging global conditions.The tariffs have been the focus of an industry debate for months. The American Primary Aluminum Association, which represents Century Aluminum and Magnitude 7 Metals, had sought the tariff in May, saying a rise in Canadian metal had caused prices to collapse. The Aluminum Association of the U.S., which represents Alcoa Corp., Rio Tinto and dozens of other aluminum-parts makers, argued that imports were virtually unchanged since 2017.It’s unclear what would happen if Canada were to surpass the export limits the U.S. has unilaterally laid out. The total volume for the fourth quarter would be about 223,000 metric tons of aluminum. For context, the U.S. imported 134,708 tons of aluminum in the fourth quarter of last year, and 75,834 tons of aluminum in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Andrew Cosgrove.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-removes-canada-aluminum-tariffs-171000817.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-14	2020-09-14 20:00:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Australia Aluminum Sector in Fight For Survival, Industry Warns	(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s aluminum smelters are being priced out of the global market due to high energy costs, with closures looming unless they can find a pathway to cheaper power, according to the head of an international producer body.The warning comes as smelters across the globe are under pressure from the coronavirus-induced slump in demand, which has seen aluminum become one of the worst-performing base metals in London. Australia produced over 1.5 million tons of aluminum in the year to June 2020, according to government estimates, ranking sixth in global terms.“Any producer of aluminum would be looking pretty seriously at the viability of their facilities,” Miles Prosser, head of the International Aluminium Institute, said in a phone interview. “If you look at comparisons of global electricity prices -- and they are a key determinant of how competitive a smelter is -- then Australia is very much at the high end at the moment.”High electricity prices have lifted costs for the country’s smelters. Australian industry was still paying too much for natural gas -- a major driver of wholesale power prices -- the country’s competition regulator said in an August report, noting that while prices had eased in 2020 the decline was not in line with bigger falls seen in the global liquefied natural gas market.Alcoa Corp., which has been reviewing options for its Portland plant since even before the pandemic, may shutter the smelter after a four-year pact with the government to provide financial support expires next year. Rio Tinto Group’s three smelters, including the country’s biggest at Tomago, are similarly seen under threat unless the economics improve after the commodities giant announced the closure of its Tiwai Point facility in New Zealand earlier this year.Read: Aluminum’s Slump Claims a New Victim in a Far-Flung CornerGovernment intervention to curb power prices or better design of the energy market are among the options to rein in costs for the smelters, Prosser said. As the grid transitions to rely more on intermittent wind and solar power, it’s useful to have energy consumers such as smelters, which can adjust their electricity demand quickly in response to peaks and troughs in supply.In a low-carbon world, Australia should be the lowest cost place to manufacture aluminum thanks to its abundant solar and wind resources, Prosser said. The outlook for aluminum demand is strong over the next couple of decades, with environmental considerations likely to see it favored by manufacturers for its recyclable qualities, he said.“In a lot of ways, Australia is addressing that challenge of how you transition the grid probably sooner than is happening elsewhere. There’s opportunity there if they get the settings right,” said Prosser.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/australia-aluminum-sector-fight-survival-200000510.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-14	2020-09-14 00:55:55	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Backed CEO After Blast, Then Watchdog Investors Revolted	(Bloomberg) -- By the time Rio Tinto Group’s chairman, Simon Thompson, and non-executive directors talked on a late-night conference call Thursday, they’d spent a chastening two weeks in the bull’s-eye of hardening investor attitudes toward social and governance issues.Dozens of meetings with shareholders and Indigenous community leaders made it clear that, in the aftermath of explosions in Western Australia’s Outback that decimated two ancient Aboriginal heritage sites, the world’s second-biggest miner made another major miscalculation.Not only was the producer under fire for its decision in May to blast through two cave-like shelters in the Juukan Gorge, where recovered artifacts such as braided human hair indicate the sites were used by Aboriginal people as many as 46,000 years ago.Directors also were taking heat for conducting a tame internal review that said key leaders bore limited responsibility for the incident, for only levying financial penalties and for concluding that Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques remained the best choice to repair ties with Indigenous communities and restore Rio’s reputation.Rio’s attempt at a business-as-usual approach collided with the rise into the mainstream of socially conscious shareholders, who are scrutinizing how companies interact with society at large.Read more: Rio Shakeout Shows How Powerful Investor Advocacy Has Become“Some important stakeholders have clearly expressed very significant concerns,” Thompson said in a Friday interview after Rio confirmed it was replacing Jacques, iron-ore CEO Chris Salisbury, and Simone Niven, the corporate-relations executive responsible for Indigenous heritage.“What has become clear during the engagement over the last two weeks is that this issue of individual accountability is really hindering our ability to start the process of rebuilding trust,” he said, adding that he shouldn’t be replaced because the company has to hire a new CEO and change its procedures.The departures of 48-year-old Jacques, in his post since mid-2016, and associates could prove pivotal for the wider mining industry, highlighting how investor demands for improved governance are amplifying the pressure on a sector with a long history of environmental damage, fatalities and corruption -- and executives eluding accountability.Rio detonated the rock shelters in May to access about 8 million tons of high-value ore after rejecting other options that would have preserved them. Repeated chances were missed to change course as the cultural significance of the Juukan Gorge sites became better understood, including in the final days before the blasts. Those problems were exacerbated by miscommunication with traditional owners.“Our investment process places great importance on ESG considerations, and our team had been calling for further action following the Juukan Gorge debacle,” said Tal Lomnitzer, a portfolio manager in London at Janus Henderson Investors, one of Rio’s 30 biggest shareholders. “The initial sanctions of senior executives losing their bonuses were insufficient and irrelevant in the context of the destruction of irreplaceable heritage sites.”In the aftermath, Thompson held dozens of meetings and calls, including with 75 of Rio’s largest investors, and directors spoke with traditional landowner groups and Indigenous leaders. As board members exchanged details of their discussions, it became clear the company badly misjudged how shareholders and others would respond to its initial handling of events.AustralianSuper, the $130 billion pension fund that’s the nation’s largest, publicly criticized Rio, saying Aug. 26 the miner’s response fell short and needed to be reconsidered.Two former Australian prime ministers joined the chorus, with Kevin Rudd saying the company would be known as “Rio TNT.”It didn’t help when Rio told Australian lawmakers it had, in fact, recognized the potential damage that blasting the site would cause, but it was too late to do anything about it. More than 380 explosive charges had been laid and couldn’t safely be removed or left in place undetonated, the company said.During the maelstrom, even Jacques himself was holding meetings. As the crisis unfolded, he traveled from his recent base in Sydney to meet community groups in Western Australia.On Monday, he was in the Pilbara, the vast area of the arid Outback that hosts mines generating the majority of Rio’s profits. The next day, he was in Perth meeting with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation, traditional owners of the Juukan Gorge sites.It probably was too late by then, though. Jacques didn’t win anyone over when he took almost three weeks to make a public apology for the destruction, and his exit seemed a fait accompli after board members compared meeting notes.Rio’s Sydney-traded shares were 3.6% higher as of 10:18 am Monday.By many scores, Jacques was a successful CEO. Rio’s London-listed shares more than doubled, beating gains by key rivals, and the company handed back record amounts of cash to investors, including about $20 billion in the past two years. He also successfully jettisoned thermal coal, a headache his competitors are still dealing with.Yet he never built a strong power base in Australia, where the London-based company generates nearly all its profits but still is viewed as an outsider compared with locally headquartered BHP Group. After becoming CEO in 2016, he quickly provoked ire by telling staff during a meeting in Brisbane to “fit in or f--- off.”Rio still may not be off the hook with investors after it confirmed the departing executives will retain incentive payments worth millions of dollars. The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors wants more meetings to discuss those terms, “with the expectation that any exit won’t provide a windfall,” CEO Louise Davidson said.(Updates to add shares in 18th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-backed-ceo-blasts-then-040000023.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-11	2020-09-11 11:32:21	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Needs a CEO to Fix Its Reputation. Here Are Some Candidates	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group is hunting for a new leader to restore relations with the communities where it mines after Jean-Sebastien Jacques was forced out over the destruction of ancient Aboriginal heritage sites.Rio announced Friday that Jacques and two other senior executives will leave after investors and Indigenous groups demanded stronger action and accountability over the explosions that tore through the 46,000-year-old landmarks in May. The company had previously planned to only levy financial penalties on the executives but that proved insufficient at a time when investors and activists are wielding increasing clout.“The reputational damage has been enormous and they now need to work on rebuilding trust,” said Camille Simeon, a Sydney-based investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, which holds Rio shares and manages assets worth about $563 billion.London-based Rio, the world’s second-biggest miner, is reviewing internal and external options for a new chief executive officer and will prioritize candidates with the skills to repair the company’s tarnished standing, Chairman Simon Thompson said Friday in a phone interview.“They will have to take responsibility for what is going to be a process running over months, if not years, of restoring confidence in our ability to manage communities and heritage effectively, and that will be one of the key criteria,” he said.Here are some of the prospective candidates to become Rio’s new CEO that are being discussed by investors and analysts:Tom Palmer, Newmont Corp.The Newmont CEO spent two decades at Rio before joining one of the world’s biggest gold miners and is viewed as well-regarded by the board. Palmer, 52, is an Australian, educated in Melbourne, and was chief operating officer of Rio’s iron ore business -- the company’s main profit driver and the unit responsible for the incident that brought down Jacques.Bold Baatar, Rio TintoBaatar is seen as one of the leading internal candidates for the top job. The Mongolian is a former investment banker, having worked for JPMorgan Chase & Co. before joining Rio in 2016. He runs the company’s energy and minerals business and also overseas its dealmaking Ventures unit. Baatar is viewed as a strategic thinker whose responsibilities include mapping out which commodities will be crucial to the company’s future.Peter Beaven, BHP GroupBeaven, the current CFO at Rio’s larger rival, is leaving BHP at the end of the year. He was long seen as the frontrunner to get the top job there, before Mike Henry took over at the start of the year. He was born in Portugal and grew up in countries including South Africa, is an accountant by training and held the No. 2 role at BHP since 2014. BHP also has huge iron ore operations in Western Australia, so the former banker will be familiar with Rio’s business there, and he’s well known by investors and politicians.Sandeep Biswas, Newcrest Mining Ltd.Biswas has been the CEO of Australia’s biggest gold miner for six years. Like Palmer, he’s a former Rio employee, having worked for the company in both Australia and Canada.Graham Kerr, South32Kerr is the CEO of South32, a diversified miner spun out by BHP in 2015. The Australian was CFO at BHP before being picked to run the new business and was long touted as a potential candidate to run the world’s biggest miner. He’s currently based in Perth in Western Australia, home to Rio’s iron ore business.Other Rio InsidersOther internal candidates will likely include, Alf Barrios, the former oil executive who runs the company’s aluminum business, head of copper and diamonds Arnaud Soirat and CFO Jakob Stausholm, who joined from shipping giant AP Moller Maersk in 2018.Rio’s hunt for a successor to 48-year-old Jacques comes at a time of wider upheaval in the top ranks of the mining industry, as it confronts growing shareholder activism over climate change and governance. Leadership changes are expected in the near future at Anglo American Plc and Glencore Plc, while BHP installed Henry as its new CEO in January.“You have to listen to the expectations of society around you, that can be investors, it can be the broader public and governments,” Henry said Friday in an interview. “I want to ensure that BHP is attuned to those expectations and sensing the world around it.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-needs-ceo-fix-reputation-113221593.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-09-11	2020-09-11 08:22:03	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Tinto CEO Resigns Bowing To Shareholder Pressure Over Blast Of Aboriginal Site	Rio Tinto announced that its CEO Jean-Sébastien Jacques will step down after shareholders expressed discontent with the handling of the mining giant’s destruction of two Aboriginal rockshelters in Australia.Rio Tinto (RIO) said Jacques will be leaving by mutual agreement as “significant stakeholders have expressed concerns about executive accountability for the failings identified” following a Board Review of Cultural Heritage Management undertaken in response to the destruction of the Juukan rockshelters in May 2020.Jacques will remain in his role until March 31 next year to ensure business continuity and to maintain the performance of the group’s global operations during COVID-19, the company said. In addition, Rio Tinto will part ways with two other executives. Chris Salisbury will step down as CEO of Iron Ore with immediate effect and will leave Rio Tinto on Dec. 31 this year. Ivan Vella, currently Managing Director for Rail, Port & Core Services within Rio Tinto Iron Ore, will replace him on an interim basis. Furthermore, Simone Niven will leave his post as Group Executive of Corporate Relations by the end of this year.The mining company has long apologized for the destruction of the rockshelters at the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, saying that it should have never happened. The blasts of the caves went ahead on May 24 despite a multi-year battle by the local Aboriginal owners of the land, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, to save the site.“What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation,” Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson said. “We are also determined to regain the trust of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people and other traditional owners. We have listened to our stakeholders’ concerns that a lack of individual accountability undermines the group’s ability to rebuild that trust and to move forward to implement the changes identified in the Board Review.”Shares in RIO have climbed 2.6% year-to-date, while analysts are cautiously optimistic on the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus. That’s with an average analyst price target of $68 (12% upside potential).Jefferies analyst Chris LaFemina recently reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $69 price target, citing a number of factors including a positive outlook on its iron ore business and EBITDA exceeding expectations. (See RIO stock analysis on TipRanks).&quot;Iron ore markets are likely to stay strong in the near term. This is clearly good news for Rio as its iron ore business is now firing on all cylinders, and EBITDA from this business should exceed the market's expectations once again in 2H20,” LaFemina wrote in a note to investors. “Consensus earnings upgrades are coming, in our view, and Rio continues to be well positioned for the current environment.”Related News:   Tiffany Sues LVMH For Dumping $16B Deal; Analysts Say This Is Not The End   India’s Reliance Scores $1.02B Retail Investment From Silver Lake   KKR Plans To Inject Up To $1.5B In Reliance’s Retail Unit – Report More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Twitter Expands Policy To Block Misinformation Posts Ahead Of US Election   * Oracle Up 3% In Pre-Market As Cloud Business Drives Upbeat 1Q Results   * Rosenblatt Initiates Penn National With A Buy, Street High PT; Shares Rise   * Dave & Buster's Drops In After-Hours As Sales Plunge 85%	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-ceo-resigns-bowing-082203258.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-11	2020-09-11 07:10:52	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Tinto CEO Forced Out By Pressure Over Aboriginal Site Blast	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques will step down amid an investor backlash over the destruction of ancient Aboriginal heritage sites in Australia.The change comes only weeks after Chairman Simon Thompson said Jacques had the board’s backing to handle the fallout from the company’s destruction of the ancient sites. Chris Salisbury, iron ore unit CEO, and Simone Niven, group executive of corporate relations, will also exit. Jacques will remain in his role until the end of March next year, or a successor is appointed, Rio said Friday in a statement.Talks with about 75 investors and Indigenous community leaders in the past few weeks made clear that many were unsatisfied with penalties delivered by a board-led inquiry that found no single individual was at fault for the blasts and reprimanded the three senior executives by trimming bonus payments, Thompson said in a phone interview.“It became clear that this issue of individual accountability was just an obstacle to rebuilding trust,” Thompson said. “If these three individuals do not have the confidence of critical stakeholders to lead the required changes then we have got to move on.”Explosions in May to open up a mining area at an iron ore operation impacted two rock-shelters -- shallow, cave-like structures -- in the Juukan Gorge region of Western Australia’s Pilbara region. The sites, used by Aboriginal Australians for cooking and shelter as long as 46,000-years ago, were among the most significant of their type in the country, according to archaeologists.The successor to Jacques, CEO since July 2016, will need to convince investors, regulators and legislators in Western Australia that Rio can address governance failings in its iron ore unit -- the division that accounted for more than 90% of first-half earnings. The new CEO will also take on a flagship copper mine expansion in Mongolia that’s been beset by delays and a budget blowout.That will likely require an executive with experience of Australia’s iron ore sector, an ear for community relations and the capability to usher through complex growth projects, said Andy Forster, senior investment officer at Argo Investments Ltd., which holds Rio shares. “Clearly a big issue for the next few years is just going to be repairing those relationships,” he said.Rio, which is headquartered in London and has been criticized for a lack of understanding about community issues in Western Australia, should move to appoint an Aboriginal person to its board, Marica Langton, associate provost at the University of Melbourne, and a prominent Indigenous academic told Bloomberg Television Friday in a interview.While the May explosions were lawful under a state government decision, Rio has been accused of failing to act on information that later showed the heritage sites had greater significance than first understood.Jacques also told a Parliamentary committee hearing last month that the region’s traditional land owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation, were not made aware that Rio had three alternative options that could have avoided damaging the Juukan Gorge shelters. The PKKP will continue to work with Rio on the aftermath of the blasts and advocate “for wide-ranging changes to ensure a tragedy like this never happens again,” the corporation said in a statement, declining to comment on the executive changes.Rio’s next top executive will face a potentially lengthy task to restore the company’s relationships in local communities, and the ability to carry out that work will shape the board’s decision on replacing Jacques, Thompson said. Both internal and external candidates will be assessed, he said.“They will have to take responsibility for what is going to be a process running over months, if not years, of restoring confidence in our ability to manage communities and heritage effectively, and that will be one of the key criteria,” Thompson said.The departure of Jacques, 48, who joined Rio in 2011, comes amid wider upheaval in the top ranks of the mining industry, as the sector prepares for a longer-term slowdown in demand from China and navigates moves to decarbonize the global economy. Top miner BHP Group installed Mike Henry as its new CEO in January, while leadership transitions are seen looming at both Anglo American Plc and Glencore Plc.Under Jacques’s leadership, Rio’s London-listed shares have doubled, beating gains by BHP and the Bloomberg World Mining Index, and the company has handed back record amounts of cash to investors. Rio’s Sydney traded shares closed 0.6% lower Friday.Salisbury and Niven will leave Rio on Dec. 31, while Ivan Vella will be appointed as Rio’s new head of the iron ore division, the company said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-ceo-exit-miner-pressure-001350376.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-09-11	2020-09-11 06:08:51	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Shakeout Shows How Powerful Investor Advocacy Has Become	(Bloomberg) -- The departure of Rio Tinto Group Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques over the destruction of ancient Aboriginal heritage sites serves as a lesson to companies worldwide about the growing power of investors and their demand for accountability.In the face of concerted shareholder pressure, the world’s second-biggest miner announced Friday that Jacques will leave the company at the end of March, or when a successor is appointed. Chris Salisbury, iron ore unit CEO, and Simone Niven, group executive of corporate relations, will also exit.The backlash over the destruction of the rock shelters, that were used by Aboriginal Australians for cooking and shelter as long as 46,000-years ago, and the producer’s weak initial response, reflects the widening advocacy battlefront across environmental, governance and social issues. Investors welcomed Rio’s announcement, but put the company on notice they’ll be scrutinizing its future engagement with Indigenous communities.Here’s how investors, analysts and policymakers reacted:Debby Blakey, CEO of Health Employees Superannuation Trust Australia“While we welcome the steps taken by Rio today, changes in senior leadership should not distract from the need for an independent and transparent review of all current agreements between the company and Traditional Owners. The nature of these agreements and how they are negotiated represents a systemic risk for investors that will not be mitigated by executive changes.”Kristian Fok, CIO of Construction & Building Unions Superannuation“Rio must now work to restore the trust of its stakeholders, its shareholders and the community at large. We will continue to constructively engage with Rio regarding Board oversight and composition so that Rio is positioned to do what it takes to ensure unique sites of cultural heritage are protected, Rio maintains it social license to operate and to make sure this never happens again.”Ian Silk, CEO of AustralianSuper“We understand that no action by Rio Tinto can undo the destruction of the profoundly cultural significant sites in the Juukan Gorge, and the impact on the traditional owners of the land, the PKKP people.”“Rio can now work with traditional owners to guarantee that its processes are appropriate for the protection of culturally important sites, and that it has the right internal accountabilities. We will continue to take an active interest in how these changes are implemented.”Simon O’Connor, CEO of the Responsible Investment Association Australasia“This tragic event has uncovered systemic issues around how mining companies approach matters relating to cultural heritage, including how they engage with Traditional Owners. Many responsible investors will be scrutinizing much more closely the activities of all resources companies, to seek assurance that there are rigorous processes and practices in place which can prevent an event like this happening again in the future.”Louise Davidson, CEO of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors“Rio Tinto now has the opportunity to address the necessary remediation, cultural heritage and risk processes with fresh eyes.”“Investors will continue to engage with Rio Tinto to understand how the company will manage this transition period. We will also be looking closely at the separation arrangements, with the expectation that any exit won’t provide a windfall for executives on their departure.”Warren Entsch, Chairman of the Northern Australia Committee“The evidence received by the committee has made clear that the internal culture at Rio Tinto was a significant factor in the destruction of these sites. New leadership, new structures and new operating principles within the company are essential to preventing such catastrophes in the future.”Daniel Kang, Senior Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence“The chairman totally misread the mood in the market and expectations from society. The whole issue of social license to operate is a massive issue that is not going to shrink.”Marcia Langton, Associate Provost, University of Melbourne“The company since the appointment of Jean-Sebastien Jacques has treated Australia like a resource colony, based as it is in London. The board too should take note of the way Australians feel about how the company has treated the country in which most of its profits are sourced.”Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation“We will continue to work with Rio Tinto in the aftermath of the Juukan Gorge disaster. Our focus continues to rest heavily on preserving Aboriginal heritage and advocating for wide-ranging changes to ensure a tragedy like this never happens again. We cannot and will not allow this type of devastation to occur ever again.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-shakeout-shows-powerful-investor-050120722.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-11	2020-09-11 04:02:27	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Tinto Exits Leave Bigger Problems Behind	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- An explosion that destroyed a 46,000-year-old sacred Aboriginal site on a Rio Tinto Group iron-ore mine in May has now ripped through the top ranks of the company.Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques, iron-ore boss Chris Salisbury, and corporate-relations executive Simone Niven will all leave the company, Rio Tinto announced Friday.It’s an overdue sign that the board is finally getting to grips with the issue, after seemingly thinking they had solved it with a review and the scrapping of bonuses last month. The company had to “move on” if the three executives didn’t have the confidence of “critical stakeholders,” Chairman Simon Thompson told David Stringer and Thomas Biesheuvel of Bloomberg News. The uproar that followed suggests that they not only failed to realize the seriousness of the act, despite the company’s own archeological surveys of the Juukan Gorge site, but also took poor advice on how to handle the aftermath. Being forced to revise their decision is the worst possible outcome.The incident betrays a worrying disconnect between decades of well-meaning statements and the company’s true priorities, as we’ve argued. Robert Wilson, the executive who created the modern Anglo-Australian company through a 1995 merger, was a vocal advocate in the early 2000s for improving miners’ records on corruption, environmental performance and landowner relations.That always had to be taken with a pinch of salt. Ties between landowners, governments with royalty rights over mineral resources, and the companies that provide the labor and capital to extract them will inevitably be zero-sum. Any margin that miners can squeeze out to enrich their shareholders is money not going to owners of the resource. Any time that shareholders are feeling happy, landowners and governments are likely to be feeling short-changed.Juukan Gorge, though, laid bare how the legal and financial dealings between landowner groups and mining companies in Australia’s Pilbara iron-ore region are still mired in a history of exploitation. That issue can’t be waved away with positive mood music alone.Jacques’s most fatal decision was probably taking Indigenous heritage responsibility away from the operational, on-the-ground side of the business and putting it under London-based Niven. That act made it harder for timely information to get to the right people, and may have precipitated the poor communication that led to the blast. More pointedly, it exposed the vast gap in the power relationship by treating the rights of Indigenous groups as a matter of PR. Acknowledging the traditional owners of the land before every shareholder gathering will ring hollow for many years to come. While Jacques has delivered on share buybacks, it’s harder to argue that he has made a great success of managing the contradictions between his company and landowners and governments, at Juukan Gorge, or elsewhere. The copper mine where his negotiating skills helped propel him to the top job – Mongolia’s Oyu Tolgoi — has encountered numerous speed bumps and political conflicts. The tricky underground extension there is running as much as 30 months late and will cost up to a third more than planned. The other major item on his agenda when he took over has similarly remained unresolved: cleaning up the mess of alleged corruption that the company had got itself involved with in Guinea. Just four months after Jacques started in July 2016, the company alerted U.K. and U.S. authorities to email exchanges involving his two predecessors, which touched on payments relating to  Simandou iron ore deposit. Those investigations are ongoing four years later. Efforts to sell the project floundered.Any successor to Jacques will need to prioritize fixing these issues. Homegrown candidates for the top job include Arnaud Soirat, who runs copper and diamonds, or Alf Barrios, the globe-trotting head of aluminum. If Rio wants to appease those who argue that much of its problem comes from having a chief executive too disconnected from the Pilbara, it could choose Simon Trott, from Western Australia, who’s currently in the newly created role of chief commercial officer. Prioritizing Mongolia and a copper-heavy future might point to energy and minerals boss Bold Baatar, a native of the country. Whatever choice is made, Rio’s reputation for good governance and responsible ownership is in tatters.

The departures are the highest profile examples yet of the increasing muscle of institutional investors to hold companies to account for actions that fall short in areas such as human rights obligations and expected community standards.  Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques, who has led Rio since 2016, will step down by March 31 next year, while iron ore boss, Chris Salisbury, and Simone Niven, head of corporate relations, the unit responsible for dealing with indigenous communities, will also depart.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-bows-investor-pressure-024712717.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-09-11	2020-09-11 00:13:50	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio CEO to Exit Miner After Pressure Over Heritage Blasts	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques will exit the miner in the wake of concerted investor pressure to step up its response to the destruction of ancient Aboriginal heritage sites in Australia.The change comes only weeks after Chairman Simon Thompson said Jacques had the board’s backing to lead the response to the company’s destruction of the more than 40,000-year old sites. Chris Salisbury, iron ore unit CEO, and Simone Niven, group executive of corporate relations, will also exit the company. Jacques will step down and remain in his role until the end of March next year, or a successor is appointed, Rio said Friday in a statement.Rio’s reversal follows further talks with investors and community leaders who criticized a board-led inquiry that found no single individual was at fault for the blasts and reprimanded senior executives by trimming bonus payments. The explosions to open up a mining area impacted the Juukan Gorge rock shelters in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, sites that were among the most significant of their type in the country, according to studies for Rio by archaeologists.“We have listened to our stakeholders’ concerns that a lack of individual accountability undermines the group’s ability to rebuild that trust and to move forward to implement the changes identified in the board review,” Thompson said in the statement.Jacques had served as CEO since July 2016. His successor will be tasked with restoring London-based Rio’s strained relations with Indigenous communities and convincing investors, regulators and legislators in Western Australia that it can address governance failings in its iron ore unit -- the division that accounted for more than 90% of first-half earnings. The new CEO will also need to deliver a flagship copper mine expansion that’s been beset by delays and a budget blowout.The departure of Jacques, 48, who joined Rio in 2011, comes amid wider upheaval in the top ranks of the mining industry, as the sector prepares for a longer-term slowdown in demand from China and navigates moves to decarbonize the global economy. Top miner BHP Group installed Mike Henry as its new CEO in January, while leadership transitions are seen looming at both Anglo American Plc and Glencore Plc.Under Jacques’s leadership, Rio’s London-listed shares have doubled, beating gains by BHP and the Bloomberg World Mining Index, amid a revival in iron ore prices in the last couple of years. His tenure also saw Rio hand back record amounts of cash to investors as the company prioritized returns over deals, and completed about $13 billion in asset sales, including an exit from coal production.Salisbury and Niven will leave Rio on Dec. 31, while Ivan Vella will be appointed as Rio’s new head of the iron ore division, the company said.(Updates to add chairman comment in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-ceo-step-down-pressure-234329401.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-10	2020-09-10 09:59:18	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	BHP Misses a Chance to Go a Shade Greener	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Miners have been falling behind in the climate revolution. Now BHP Group has set clear near-term targets for greenhouse gas emissions, and is explicitly tying more of its leaders’ bonuses to that vision. That’s a welcome effort to align headline-grabbing promises and executive action. It isn’t enough to guarantee the right long-term outcome.Thursday’s much-anticipated climate announcement won’t have satisfied anyone looking for the bold agenda set out by BP Plc Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney in February, or the oil major's subsequent plan to cut oil and gas output by 40% over the coming decade. By comparison, the plans laid out by the “Big Australian” lack green zeal. It’s true there was plenty to like, in part because of the low bar set by the rest of the industry. BHP, one of the world’s biggest carbon emitters, will reduce emissions from its own operations at least 30% by 2030 from this year’s levels. That’s a far steeper cut than Rio Tinto Group’s 15% cut from 2018 levels, also on the way to zero operational emissions by 2050.But BHP stopped short of adequately tackling the elephant in the climate room: emissions produced indirectly when its oil, iron ore or coal is burned or processed by customers. That’s a problem. These so-called Scope 3 emissions account for as much as 97% of BHP’s total, and are larger than Australia’s. For the mining industry as a whole, such emissions count for more like a quarter, at most, of the total contribution to global greenhouse gases. BHP’s plan sets no overall reduction here, leaning heavily on carbon intensity ambitions instead, which while positive don’t guarantee the absolute reduction the planet needs.Admittedly, these indirect emissions are harder to get to grips with. Compared to getting a client to revamp its steel mill, it’s clearly easier to promise solar panels at your mine site. It might even be cheaper than diesel, too. So while BHP is right to pick the areas where it can be a catalyst for change — working with the shipping industry and steelmakers — sidestepping targets is an uncomfortable solution. It’s also behind the zeitgeist: At Rio’s Australian shareholder meeting in May, more than a third backed a proposal demanding targets even for Scope 3. Trying isn’t enough when outcomes matter.One clear positive is the follow-up to last year’s remuneration shakeup, adjusting the boss’s pay to match green promises. Far too few resources companies take this obvious step and even fewer do it in a meaningful way, sticking instead to traditional metrics. A Carbon Tracker report found that over 90% of major oil companies in 2017 paid executives based on volume growth, reserve and resource additions, or both. The picture is little better when considering a wider range of sectors. Research led by Xavier Baeten at Vlerick Business School calculated that in a universe of more than 700 European companies, almost 70% now include corporate social responsibility measures in compensation. Yet that mostly means employee issues, like staff engagement, and only translates into climate and environment targets for a tiny minority — less than 20% even for companies in the base materials sector.For CEO Mike Henry and his leadership team at BHP, by contrast, 10% of the cash-and-deferred-plan or bonus portion will depend on meeting its climate goals. That comes on top of other welcome changes last year, including shifting the main financial metric, which still makes up half the total, to return on capital, and obliging the top executive to hold shares for longer — at least two years after retirement.There are plenty of reasons to make remuneration a little more viridescent. For one, it’s in sync with a post-Covid environment where there is little tolerance for excess pay. More importantly, it displays a consistency between purpose and action that shareholders value, as Rio Tinto has found out after blowing up a 46,000-year-old sacred Aboriginal shelter and unleashing investor wrath that could topple the chief executive.We also know from academic research that including sustainability targets works, in terms of everything from actually reducing emissions to encouraging longer-term thinking and engagement in green innovation.The trouble is that this isn’t easy to do well. Climate goals are shifting. BHP has provided a model for the sector with a quantifiable target, consistent with its message and transparent. And even if 10% of the short-term incentive plan isn’t too impressive, holding shares for longer will help.What the shakeup hasn’t done at BHP, yet, is encourage ambition. That’s harder to build into pay. A little more wouldn’t go amiss. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-09-09	2020-09-09 08:38:44	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Board to Debate CEO’s Future as Pressure Mounts Over Blasts	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group’s board will debate the future of Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques as it faces pressure to respond more strongly to the destruction of ancient Aboriginal heritage sites in Australia, according to people familiar with the matter.Recent talks with shareholders, traditional landowners and legislators indicated the company needs to take further action to restore relations with key decision makers in Western Australia, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The Australian state is crucial for the world’s second-largest miner, hosting iron ore operations that accounted for more than 90% of its first-half profits.The board will discuss additional penalties over the May explosions, including whether Jacques and other key executives should remain in their roles, at a meeting that’s expected to take place before the end of this week, some of the people said.A Rio spokesman declined to comment. The prospect of Rio’s board meeting to discuss additional penalties was reported earlier by the Financial Times.A move to oust Jacques would represent a sharp reversal for Rio, after Chairman Simon Thompson last month backed the 48-year-old to lead the company’s response to the incident. Jacques has served as CEO since July 2016.However, investors including AustralianSuper, the nation’s largest pension fund, have called publicly for Rio to reconsider a decision last month to impose only financial sanctions against top executives following the destruction of rock shelters in the Juukan Gorge area of the Pilbara, sites that had been found to have evidence of use by human beings more than 40,000 years ago.Other shareholders expressed concern that strained relations between Rio and authorities in Western Australia could complicate the producer’s ability to win approvals for new mines or to expand existing operations.Read more: Key Fund Tells Rio Blast Punishments for Executives Fall ShortThe May blasts, to open up a mining area for the Brockman 4 operation, were legal and permitted under a Western Australian government decision in 2013. However, Rio has faced criticism that it failed to alter its plans after subsequent information showed the sites had greater significance than first understood, and an internal review identified failures of some management systems.Jacques told a Parliamentary hearing last month that mining through the landmarks would likely deliver about $135 million in extra value to Rio’s iron ore division, a unit that generated underlying earnings of $9.6 billion in 2019. He also confirmed the region’s traditional land owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation, were not made aware that Rio had been considering three alternative options that could have avoided damaging the Juukan Gorge sites.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-board-debate-ceo-future-083844496.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-04	2020-09-04 09:30:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	China's yuan gains foothold in iron ore deals, could increase Chinese self-reliance, analysts say	Iron ore miners' and steel producers' increasing use of the Chinese yuan will increase its internationalisation, reduce China's vulnerability to any possible US financial sanctions, and help the domestic economy in line with the new &quot;dual circulation&quot; strategy.By using the yuan rather than the US dollar to price iron ore, this will increase the internationalisation of the Chinese currency and so reduce China's vulnerability to any possible US financial sanctions.Using the yuan for domestic sales will also reduce volatility in iron ore prices and improve the resilience of the domestic economy, in line with the government's new &quot;dual circulation&quot; strategy, analysts added.&quot;This will enable Chinese steel mills to have a bigger say in iron ore pricing. Chinese steel mills will be able to minimise their exchange rate risks, as the vast majority of steel they produce is consumed in China,&quot; MySteel senior analyst Li Hongmei said.&quot;This will also help China internationalise its [yuan-denominated] iron ore derivative contracts on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.&quot;China to power world economy for several years as coronavirus recovery in developed countries lags, miner BHP saysRio Tinto and Vale, as well as rival Australian iron ore giants BHP Group and Fortescue Metals, have all confirmed they recorded their first yuan-denominated iron ore transactions in China in the last 12 months.In October 2019, Rio Tinto agreed to be paid in yuan for a shipment to a steel mill in northern China's Shanxi province, while in November, Vale struck its first yuan-denominated sale with the trading arm of Shandong Laigang Yongfeng Steel. It also agreed other yuan-priced deals with China Baowu Group and Hesteel earlier this year.In May, BHP agreed a 100 million yuan (US$14.6 million) sale with Chinese steel giant Baosteel and pledged to continue sales in yuan, while Rio Tinto closed a 100 million yuan shipment to Ansteel last month, while Fortescue Metals started yuan-based ore sales in July.Last week, Australian-based Rio Tinto, the world's second largest iron ore miner, also struck a deal with Ningbo Zhoushan Port Group to open a facility at its Beilun port to blend different grades of iron ore to meet specialised demand from more steel mills in the Yangtze River Delta and South China.Miners blend iron ore to provide the target grade of the material that is suitable for each steelmaker's production.It is Rio Tinto's first portside ore blending service in the Yangtze River Delta and in the southern part of China, as it expands beyond its existing centres at ports in northern and central China, the company said on its WeChat messaging account.On the same day, Brazilian miner Vale also agreed a deal with Ningbo Zhoushan Port Group to open its first portside grinding hub - a process of breaking down ore into certain sizes suitable for making steel pellets with three production lines to process iron ore at the Shulanghu Ore Transfer Terminal in Zhoushan City in Zhejiang province.The new facilities are aimed at attracting more business from speciality customers by offering them the flexibility of smaller volumes of blended iron ore with shorter lead times.This, in turn, points to a further rise in iron ore sales, an increasing amount of which are likely to be yuan-denominated, according to analysts.China's appetite for iron ore prompts Brazilian miner Vale to explore new deep water portNavigate Commodities managing director Atilla Widnell agreed yuan-pricing was a natural commercial move for iron ore miners to increase sales in China, but just as importantly, it was also another strategy for China to reduce iron ore pricing volatility.Yuan-pricing will protect China's domestic economy and increase its self-sufficiency, the goal of the &quot;dual circulation&quot; strategy announced by President Xi Jinping in May, said Heng Wang, co-director of the China International Business and Economic Law Centre at the University of New South Wales.The yuan, though, remains a relatively minor player on the international stage. In July 2020, the it retained its position as the fifth most active currency for global payments by value, with a share of 1.86 per cent, according to international payments messaging service SWIFTThe new &quot;dual circulation&quot; strategy aims for China to rely more on its domestic economy and technological innovation given rising difficulties in the international environment without sacrificing exports or pausing the opening up of the domestic economy to foreign businesses.&quot;China has strived to promote the yuan for a long time. The current US-China tensions may make [yuan] internationalisation more important for China,&quot; Wang said.&quot;Trade may be one way to promote the use of the yuan. It does depend on how other parties are willing to use this currency.&quot;Last month, Xi vowed to use the development plan for the Yangtze River Delta region to showcase the &quot;dual-circulation&quot; strategy.He highlighted the need to break down administrative barriers, enhance policy coordination and allow the easier flow of land, labour, entrepreneurship and capital in the region.The Yangtze River Delta development blueprint includes Shanghai and the neighbouring provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang - an area which accounts for a quarter of China's gross domestic product.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

2020-09-03	2020-09-03 22:00:39	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	BHP’s Road To Reduced Emissions Should Be Electric	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As oil companies flesh out plans to cut carbon emissions, their peers in the mining sector risk being left behind. BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group and Vale SA are already among the world’s largest emitters, thanks to the vast amounts of carbon spewed out turning their key product of iron ore into steel. Among producers with listings on major developed exchanges, only Royal Dutch Shell Plc sits higher than the big three miners in terms of so-called Scope 3 emissions. (This describes pollution generated when a company’s products are used, such as when gasoline is burned in a car or steel is produced in a mill. It comprises the vast majority of total emissions in the resources sector.(1))Oil companies are already working to address that issue. Eni SpA, Shell, Total SE and Repsol SA all have plans to reduce the emissions intensity of their products by about a third by the 2030s, with sharper cuts to 2050. BP Plc has signed up to a more ambitious target, reducing oil production 40% by 2030.The big iron miners, on the other hand, have made do with only the vaguest of promises. Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. refuses to even disclose its easily calculated Scope 3 total. BHP’s announcement of its plans Sept. 10 is likely to set a benchmark for other companies. New Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry has good reason to be bold.To see why, it’s worth considering what makes BHP unique among big miners. Unlike its peers, the company also has a significant petroleum business, with gas comprising about 55% of its 109 million barrels of annual oil-equivalent output. Producing another fossil fuel might not seem the most obvious way for BHP to decarbonize — but its expertise in the industry could go a long way toward reducing emissions from its steel mill customers.To make more than a marginal reduction in the 7% to 8% of global emissions that come from steelmaking will involve either a breakthrough in capturing carbon emissions and storing them underground, or a switch from making metal in blast furnaces to using electric arc furnaces. Understanding petroleum geology and engineering will be a major advantage in both cases.Carbon storage has never lived up to the hype. But to the extent that it’s viable anywhere in the world, it’s where CO2 is injected into underground petroleum reservoirs, usually to drive more oil and gas to the surface. If BHP’s customers are to go down that route, it’s the only major miner that could make money from being part of such a solution.As we’ve argued, the more likely approach is a switch to arc furnaces, which use electricity rather than coal to melt their metal. A growing mountain of steel scrap in China, combined with likely prices on carbon emissions and greater ability to match output to demand, should see them replacing an increasing number of blast furnaces over the coming decades. BHP itself sees the share of blast furnaces declining from 70% of global steelmaking capacity to between 55% and 60% by 2050.Mining companies genuinely motivated to halt rather than advance climate change should see a great opportunity in this shift. The key commodity for a world making steel without blast furnaces would be direct reduced iron, which can be produced by burning off the oxygen in iron ore using natural gas or hydrogen — probably in the easily transported form of hot briquetted iron, or HBI. BHP had bad experiences with this product two decades ago, but the technology hasn’t stood still and demand is forecast to rise rapidly. If the four miners that account for more than two-thirds of iron ore in the seaborne market committed to converting a rising share of their output to HBI, then they’d be nudging customers to decarbonize their steel mills, while selling a product that changes hands for about three times the price of iron ore. So far, though, only Vale has shown much interest.As a petroleum producer in the North West Shelf off the coast of the iron-rich Pilbara region, BHP is well-placed to provide the power an Australian HBI industry would need — first via “blue hydrogen” made from methane with carbon capture, but ultimately with “green hydrogen” made by splitting water molecules with renewable power and transported via legacy natural gas infrastructure.Such a switch wouldn’t be good news for BHP’s coking coal business, which is heavily dependent on blast furnaces retaining their market share. Becoming part of the solution, though, would allow the company to manage the decline of coking coal while making money from the technology that will disrupt it, rather than crossing its fingers that the world will fail to address climate change.The mining industry has played its cards well convincing environmentally minded investors that there’s no alternative to blast furnaces. That’s helped miners avoid the opprobrium, divestment and capital drought that's hit thermal coal of late — but with the world's fossil fuel-free steel mill starting operations this week, it’s becoming an increasingly untenable position.BHP’s reluctance to accept what was going to happen to the coal power industry in the 2010s cost its shareholders dearly. Is it going to make the same mistake again with steel?(1) Some oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., don't declare their Scope 3 emissions. BP would have comparable figures to Shell if it equity-accounted the emissions from its stake in Rosneft Oil Co.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

The sites had evidence of use by humans more than 40,000 years ago and were among the most significant of their type in the country, archaeologists had told the company in a 2018 report.The board’s review found no single individual, or error, was to blame for the blasts in May, carried out to allow Rio to access about 8 million tons of high-value iron ore.Read more: Rio’s Prize for Blowing Up Ancient History: $135 MillionThree other mining options that would have avoided damaging the sites were rejected, Jacques told an Australian Parliamentary committee earlier this month. Rio failed to tell the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation, the region’s traditional land owners, about the options that would’ve prevented any damage, he said.“The review is comprehensive in its recognition that a substantial number of changes need to be made,” said Camille Simeon, a Sydney-based investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, which holds Rio shares and manages assets worth about $645 billion. “From here implementation and execution is critical and will be a focal point.”Jacques has faced a call to resign over the incident from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, a small shareholder advocacy group, though most major investors have offered support, Thompson said in the interview. Aberdeen declined to comment on the fund’s view on the future of Rio’s executive team.“By and large, investors feel that J-S and the team have been doing an extraordinarily great job in very, very difficult circumstances, particularly in 2020,” Thompson said. “They obviously want to see what our response is to Juukan because of the damage that it has done to our reputation for really effective management of cultural heritage.”The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, a corporate governance advisory firm whose members include Australia’s two largest pension funds, expressed disappointment that managers had not been held more accountable and said it would’ve favored an independent inquiry.“The destruction of the caves resulted in a devastating cultural loss,” ACSI CEO Louise Davidson said in a statement. “It is of significant concern to investors because it puts at risk Rio Tinto’s relationship with key stakeholders and its social licence to operate.”Rio’s board-led review identified failures over nearly a decade that had contributed to the incident, including failures of management systems. The company will add a new social performance function to monitor the company’s approach to community and heritage practices and add processes to escalate heritage issues to senior management.Health Employees Superannuation Trust Australia, a A$52 billion ($37 billion) pension fund, will continue discussions with Rio on the issues raised, CEO Debby Blakey said in a statement. “We remain concerned that this gap between what the company says and how it acts points to broader oversight and governance issues,” she said.(Updates to add investor comment in 13th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-rio-tinto-executives-lose-004841180.html?.tsrc=rss

Rio chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques was grilled by an Australian Senate enquiry on Friday over how the company had legally destroyed two prehistoric rockshelters, causing deep distress to their Aboriginal owners.  “The fact that Rio Tinto’s senior management had not reviewed a critical report about the site itself calls into question the company’s governance and oversight processes,""  Councillor Doug McMurdo, Chair of Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), said in a statement."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-call-greater-rio-accountability-074922183.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-08-07	2020-08-07 12:04:52	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio’s Prize for Blowing Up Ancient History: $135 Million	(Bloomberg) -- A decision by Rio Tinto Group to destroy Aboriginal Australian heritage sites dating back more than 46,000 years delivered about $135 million in extra value to its iron ore division, according to the miner’s top executive.Rio rejected three other options that would have avoided damaging two rockshelters in Western Australia in order to access about 8 million tons of high-value ore, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques said Friday. The company recorded about $4.6 billion in profits from its iron ore unit in the first half.“The economic value at the time of the decision, or the net present value, was around $135 million,” when mining plans for the site in the Juukan Gorge region of the Pilbara district were decided in around 2012 or 2013, Jacques told a hearing of an Australian parliamentary committee investigating the blasts.At the time those decisions were made, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation, the region’s traditional land owners, were not made aware that Rio had been considering a total of four options, including three proposals that could have avoided the Juukan Gorge sites, Jacques told legislators on the conference-call hearing.Rio, the world’s second-largest miner, has made decisions on heritage preservation, or environmental grounds, that have removed about 380 million tons of iron ore -- more than a year’s worth of exports -- from mine plans over the past five years, he said.The producer has faced criticism from investors and lawmakers over the incident in May, when explosions to open up a mining area for the Brockman 4 operation blasted the Juukan Gorge sites. Archaeologists had told the company in a 2018 report the sites were among the most significant of their type in Australia and that evidence had been recovered showing use by humans more than 40,000 years ago.The incident, along with delays and a budget blowout at Rio’s flagship growth project at Mongolia’s Oyu Tolgoi mine, has stoked investor concern over Rio’s management and about Jacques’ leadership. “The buck stops with me, my focus is on putting this right,” Jacques told the Friday hearing.On Friday, the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, a shareholder advocacy group, said the CEO should resign.“At every turn, Rio’s group CEO JS Jacques has sought to deflect blame,” said Brynn O’Brien, executive director of ACCR. “His suggestion today that no single person is accountable for the decision to detonate the Juukan Gorge sites in May is indefensible. The buck always stops with the CEO, and he should resign.”Still, so far none of the company’s major investors have joined the call for Jacques to go and it is the best performing major miner this year, making bumper profits from iron ore.Read more: A Miner Blew Up Ancient Human History. An Industry May PayRio and competitors are facing the prospect of tighter regulation that could make it more difficult to win approvals to expand existing sites, or to build new mines, in the Pilbara. It’s the world’s key iron ore hub that generated forecast annual export earnings of A$100 billion ($72 billion) in the 12 months to June 30.Enhanced scrutiny is particularly significant for Rio, which probably needs about eight replacement mines in its iron ore division by 2026, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.The blasts were legal, permitted under a Western Australian government process that’s used to rule on cases where an impact on Aboriginal sites is deemed unavoidable. That system is scheduled to be replaced by legislation that will offer more protection for heritage areas and give communities rights of appeal.Repeated chances were missed to recognize the significance of the Juukan Gorge site’s heritage value from about 2008 onwards and those problems were exacerbated by miscommunication with traditional owners, Jacques told the hearing.When Rio belatedly recognized the potential damage that blasting the site would cause, it was already too late -- explosive charges had been laid and couldn’t safely be removed, the company said in a written submission.“The events at Juukan should not have happened,” Jacques, who has since traveled to meet with Indigenous community leaders in some other regions, told the hearing. “The destruction of the rockshelters has triggered some reflection in our company.”Rio will fund about $50 million of initiatives aimed at promoting more Indigenous people into leadership positions, he said. About 12% of the residential workforce in Rio’s iron ore unit are Indigenous people, according to the company’s most recent annual report.(Updates with ACCR comment in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/miner-prize-blowing-ancient-history-025208720.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-07	2020-08-07 00:52:36	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Trump Reimposes Canadian Aluminum Import Tariff to Stem ‘Flood’	(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration will reimpose tariffs on some Canadian aluminum imports, hitting a crucial trade partner just weeks after the president’s landmark North American trade agreement went into effect. Canada threatened retaliation.President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he’s removing Canada’s exemption from 10% tariffs, effective Aug. 16. The decision comes more than a month after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed concern about recent struggles by American aluminum producers, who have said they are hurting from a “surge” of metal from Canada flowing into the U.S.“Several months ago, my administration agreed to lift those tariffs in return for a promise from the Canadian government that its aluminum industry would not flood our country with exports and kill all our aluminum jobs, which is exactly what they did,” Trump said during a speech at a Whirlpool Corp. factory in Ohio. “Canadian aluminum producers have broken that commitment.”“In response to the American tariffs, Canada intends to swiftly impose dollar-for-dollar countermeasures,” Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement, calling the U.S tariffs “unwarranted and unacceptable.”Trump made the announcement at a time when he’s behind Democrat Joe Biden in the polls and trying to portray himself as best positioned to revive the U.S. economy from a recession caused by the coronavirus -- even as some economists have questioned the benefit to the U.S. of imposing tariffs.“To be a strong nation, America must be a manufacturing nation and not be led by a bunch of fools -- that means protecting our national industrial base. We have to protect our great companies and our great workers,” Trump said.Earlier, Bloomberg News reported that the measures would be unveiled as soon as Thursday, causing shares of aluminum producers Alcoa Corp. and Century Aluminum Co. to surge as much as 5.6% and 6.1% respectively, and the price to ship aluminum to the U.S. Midwest climb as much as 21%.The tariffs will drive up costs for end users such as brewers, Jim McGreevy, the president and chief executive officer of the Beer Institute, said in a phone interview. “The tariffs aren’t bringing back aluminum jobs, they’re creating higher costs for end users and that’s not really good for anyone.”That sentiment was echoed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.“These tariffs will raise costs for American manufacturers, are opposed by most U.S. aluminum producers, and will draw retaliation against U.S. exports -- just as they did before,” the group said in an emailed statement. “We urge the administration to reconsider this move.”Raw MetalThe tariff will affect “non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada, commensurate with the tariff imposed on such articles imported from most countries,” according to a proclamation from the White House. That raw material made up abut 73% of all Canadian aluminum imports -- including value-added products -- in the first half of the year, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.A spokesperson from Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. Canadian trade and business groups panned the move.“Tariffs were the wrong instrument when they were first imposed in 2018, and they remain the wrong instrument now,” the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said. “At a time when our economies are struggling with the economic fallout of Covid-19, these tariffs will only exacerbate disruptions to North American supply chains.”Raising Costs“Re-imposing tariffs only raises costs for U.S. consumers and businesses in the middle of economic recovery efforts,” the Aluminium Association of Canada said in a statement. “Since there is no surge in aluminium exports from Canada to the U.S., all options for retaliation should be considered by Canada.”Alcoa, the biggest U.S. aluminum producer, which has some smelters in Canada, said in an emailed statement it was “disappointed” that the U.S. decided to reimpose the tariffs.“We are working with our U.S. customers to minimize any negative impacts to the integrated supply of aluminium in North America,” a Rio Tinto Plc spokesperson said in an email, adding that the tariffs undermine “market confidence in secure supplies of aluminium in North America.”The decision was applauded by Century, a producer that had supported tariffs.“The president’s leadership helps to secure continued domestic production of this vital strategic material and level the playing field for thousands of American aluminum workers,” CEO Michael Bless said in an emailed statement.In July, Canadian Ambassador Kirsten Hillman said that the U.S. should be “patient” about determining whether to impose the tariffs, saying the increase in the production of raw aluminum is temporary because producers shifted from value-added products amid a drop in demand during the pandemic.Aluminum traded on the London Metal Exchange, the global benchmark for prices, is down almost 2% this year as demand evaporated due to lockdowns put in place to stem the global pandemic. This sent shockwaves through the industry, pummeling aluminum producers not only in the U.S., but from Canada to Russia to China and the Middle East.Despite the downturn, China is on track to increase its aluminum output in 2020, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The world’s largest producer and consumer of the metal could boost domestic output by 3% as some producers closed down old facilities to build new plants that are more efficient and lower cost. This also comes as demand has recovered from the virus outbreak since April.“Tariffs do not address the issue of Chinese overcapacity, which is the fundamental issue challenging primary aluminum production,” Alcoa said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-poised-reimpose-10-tariff-191310412.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-31	2020-07-31 09:30:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Australian miners Rio Tinto and Fortescue post record iron ore shipments as China industrial recovery continues	Australian mining giants Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group have joined BHP Group in reporting record shipments of iron ore, the bulk of it to China, as an infrastructure and property construction boom in the world's second largest economy drives a rebound in steel production.The companies have reported record earnings on the back of the iron ore shipments, even though exports of other minerals like aluminium and copper remain in the doldrums as the coronavirus pandemic saps global demand.Australia's record iron ore exports to China, combined with a surge in shipments of coking and thermal coal, indicate trade in the key industrial ingredients has not suffered because of a diplomatic spat between the two countries.Rio Tinto reported on Thursday its iron ore shipments to China in the first half of the year rose 3 per cent compared to the same period a year-earlier.This pushed earnings up 2 per cent and allowed the Anglo-Australian miner to promise a US$2.5 billion dividend payout for shareholders.Announcing its fourth quarter fiscal results, Fortescue projected that iron ore shipments to China would rise 6 per cent to 178 million tonnes for the full financial year ended in June, exceeding its target of 177 million tonnes. Full-year results will be announced in a few weeks.The miner said exports were buoyed by strong Chinese steel production of 499 million tonnes in the first six months of the year, 1.4 per cent higher than the same period last year.Rio Tinto chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said China had effectively absorbed the additional iron ore diverted from weaker steel markets in Europe and Asia.&quot;The main market for our high-quality iron ore is China, which compared to the broader global economy has recovered exceedingly well,&quot; Jacques said while announcing company results on Wednesday.&quot;China's steel production and demand for iron ore in 2019 was strong and this has continued despite disruptions in the first quarter.&quot;In 2020, [China's] crude steel production has again exceeded the 1 billion tonne annualised run rate and June production was a new all-time high record.&quot;Steel markets in Europe, the United States, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan were still weak, Rio Tinto said.BHP also said last week it had met production targets for iron ore, thanks to China's economic recovery.&quot;In China, blast furnace utilisation rates have increased from around 80 per cent earlier in February 2020 to above 90 per cent in June 2020,&quot; BHP said in its financial year review.&quot;We continue to believe that if China can avoid a second wave of Covid-19, steel and pig iron production can both rise in the 2020 calendar year versus the prior year.&quot;Rio Tinto said Australia's contract-based iron ore shipments were strong, despite impacts from the coronavirus outbreak, allowing it to outperform other major miners such as Vale in Brazil, which has suffered from production restrictions and delays.But Vale, which has recently suffered setbacks including the Brumadinho dam collapse at its Corrego do Feijao mine, also saw profit recover in the second quarter thanks to higher iron ore prices. It said on Wednesday it would pay dividends that have been suspended since the dam accident last January.The continued demand for iron ore in China means Rio Tinto is committed to developing new iron ore projects at Simandou blocks 3 and 4 in Guinea, along with Chinese partner Chinalco Mining and the country's government.The diversified miner said it had drawn up plans to commission China-based design institutes to update and re-engineer the infrastructure of the project, which was approved in 2010.&quot;The Chinese are pretty active and they want to see a pathway to develop the two blocks,&quot; Jacques said.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

2020-07-29	2020-07-29 10:01:01	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Tinto Can Stay Stuck in a Profitable Rut, For Now	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The world’s second-largest miner is proving pandemic-resistant.Rio Tinto Group’s latest results show earnings dipped only modestly as iron ore offset tarnished base metals. The steel ingredient’s long-term future looks distinctly rusty, but that’s not yet reality in 2020. Stubbornly high prices have again helped sate investors with dividends in a climate of sub-zero yields, meaning boss Jean-Sebastien Jacques is under little pressure to change tack. Until the global economy recovers, Rio will remain a near-perfect bond proxy.First-half underlying earnings came in at $4.75 billion, before impairments largely related to the aluminum business. That’s down 4% from a year earlier but above market expectations, thanks to top-earner iron ore, which cushioned the impact of worse performances in copper, aluminium and diamonds. Even compared to 2019, when it surged after Brazilian miner Vale SA’s fatal dam collapse, iron ore has shone this year — this time thanks to coronavirus-linked closures and other disruptions. The 72% margin at Rio's Pilbara — based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization — and an average realized price of $85.4 per dry metric ton bode well for peers including Vale, reporting later Wednesday, not least as the current market price is now a quarter above that.Jacques’ team presented broadly what investors have come to expect from mining majors: relatively pedestrian production, decent free cash flow — even if a drop to $2.8 billion will disappoint some —  and modest debt, with a net gearing ratio of just 10%. Plus, of course, a respectable payout. After all, miners are still building up their reputations as good custodians of shareholder cash.The trouble is just how much of this picture depends on iron ore — for this six-month period, the division accounted for roughly 80% of group Ebitda and well over 90% of earnings. That’s great news for the digger’s profits today, but less so for tomorrow’s prospects. Appetite is set to eventually ease along with China’s latest infrastructure splurge, and steel demand will cool. Supply looks plentiful, thanks to projects like Rio’s own problematic but alluring Simandou in Guinea. As Jacques said Wednesday, there is no question that mega-mine will eventually get built.Still, future problems look a lot less pressing when you’re the world’s top producer and iron ore is trading at over $100 per ton. Anglo American Plc’s South African iron ore business has pointed to a price level closer to $90 for the second half — hardly a headache for Rio, with cash costs at $14.5 per ton. In a volatile world of second-wave outbreaks and rock-bottom borrowing costs, investors are less anxious about growth than they are about stability and yield.On that front, Rio continues to deliver. There was no one-time splurge, but Rio still promised $2.5 billion of interim dividends, bringing what shareholders have received in cash returns since 2016 to $38 billion. Even with spending ticking higher, it’s hard to see that shifting. Deals are expensive, too: The balance sheets of long-mooted copper targets like Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and First Quantum Minerals Ltd. are looking healthier than they have in some time, making them harder prey.Super-generous returns are ultimately hard to sustain for a company that digs stuff for a living, especially one that should be doing far more to edge toward a greener, carbon-light economy. And there were welcome glimmers of growth, not least from higher spending and Rio’s exploration work in the Australian outback, where copper and gold finds could boost output and prove the sort of progressive investment that is likely to be welcomed.Corporate heavyweights change slowly. The truth, though, is that iron ore is simply working too well for now, for both Rio and dividend-hungry investors. Until they begin to demand more production, the global economy recovers, and inflation moves higher, there just isn’t a lot of incentive to shift away from austerity and splurge on risky growth. As in past cycles, it will eventually happen. Jacques just needs to call the turn before his rivals.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-07-29	2020-07-29 09:31:56	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Tinto Gets Closer to Building Game-Changer African Iron Mine	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group is accelerating work toward potential development of the giant Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, as half-year earnings showed the steel-making ingredient dominated the second-biggest miner’s profits.There’s been a longstanding question mark over Rio’s stake in the massive African deposit. For years, a cast of owners including Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz and authorities in the West African nation fought over rights to develop Simandou. Even with those disputes now settled, Rio must decide whether it’s prepared to spend the large amounts needed to extract and transport the super-rich ore from its part of the project.New studies with Rio’s Chinese partners are aimed at cutting the capital intensity, operating costs and development timetable, with some fieldwork to start this half, the London-based miner said Wednesday in an earnings statement. Meanwhile, the Guinean-led and Chinese backed consortium with rights to the other half of the project could be producing within five years.“Under all scenarios Simandou will be developed, with or without Rio Tinto,” Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in an interview Wednesday. “There is a huge incentive for the Chinese to make it happen now.”Read: Rio Rewards Keep Flowing on Iron Ore Even as Virus Hits ProfitAfter years of being largely forgotten by the mining world, Simandou snapped back into the spotlight last year when Steinmetz ended a seven-year dispute with Guinea’s government that saw him relinquish claims on half of the mine.The project’s reemergence could have big implications for the iron ore market. Half of the deposit could deliver more than 100 million tons a year of the highest-quality ore, which is increasingly in demand in China. China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, which oversees the biggest government-owned enterprises, is actively pushing forward with the project, people familiar with the situation said earlier this year.Simandou is divided into four blocks, with 1 and 2 controlled by the consortium backed by Chinese and Singaporean companies, while Rio Tinto and Aluminum Corp. of China, known as Chinalco, own blocks 3 and 4.The renewed interest from China, as well as new owners for the half not controlled by Rio, means the company will consider options including joint development of the sites or their infrastructure.“We will look at all options because it is an infrastructure project and scale is important,” Jacques said. “I think it’s important for people to understand what would be the benefits of putting together 1, 2, 3 and 4.”Rio, which has surpassed Brazil’s Vale SA as the top supplier of iron ore, could generate an additional $1 billion in annual revenue by replacing some lower-grade exports from Australia with better-quality material from Guinea, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Paul Young wrote in a July 23 note.Forming a joint venture between two separate projects at the vast site could also cut total capital expenditure by as much as $7 billion, through the sharing of costs for rail, port and power infrastructure, the Goldman analysts said.(Updates with details throughout)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-accelerates-africa-plans-075616752.html?.tsrc=rss

London-based Rio will pay out $2.5 billion in ordinary dividends, higher than the same period a year earlier, even as some rivals and other industries cut payouts by the most since the global financial crisis.Key InsightsIron ore accounted for more than 90% of earnings, underscoring the extent to which Rio is reliant on the steel-making ingredient and also on the pace of economic recovery in China, the top consumer. Demand in the Asian nation has remained strong, Rio said in the statement on Wednesday.The producer is working with partners to “reduce capital intensity, lower operating costs and shorten the timetable for development” of the high-grade Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, Rio said. Fieldwork involving geotechnical investigation and surveying will start in Guinea this half.Rio will make a submission by Friday to an Australian Parliamentary inquiry on the destruction of Aboriginal heritage sites in the Pilbara mining region, the company said.Rio may need to consider termination of an energy contract with Landsvirkjun for the ISAL aluminum operation in Iceland and “commence planning for an orderly closure of the smelter,” if the parties cannot improve electricity purchase conditions, the company said. Tiwai Point smelter on New Zealand’s South Island will be shuttered by next August 2021, the firm said earlier this month.The aluminum industry “continues to face challenging conditions in global markets and policy uncertainty, exacerbated by the impact of Covid-19,” and Rio is working to ensure the sustainability of smelters in Australia and Iceland, the company said.Rio’s board has approved funding for a feasibility study for Jadar lithium project in Serbia, the company said.Get MoreFor more details on the earnings data, click here.Read the statement here.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-raises-dividend-strength-063533193.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-28	2020-07-28 07:11:58	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Tinto Reveals Maiden Resource At Winu, New Gold Discovery	Rio Tinto (RIO) has disclosed the maiden Inferred Mineral Resource at the 100% owned Winu copper-gold project and revealed the discovery of a new zone of gold dominant mineralisation approximately 2 km east of the Winu deposit in the Paterson Province of Western Australia.The Inferred Mineral Resource, reported at a 0.2% copper equivalent cutoff, is 503Mt at 0.45% copper equivalent (CuEq). This includes a higher grade component of 188Mt at 0.68% CuEq at a cutoff grade of 0.45% CuEq.According to Rio, study work to date indicates that the copper mineralisation supports the development of a relatively shallow open-pit mine, and the company is targeting first production from Winu in 2023, subject to securing all necessary approvals.The discovery of a new zone of gold dominant mineralisation as well as a number of other encouraging drilling results nearby suggests potential for the development of multiple ore bodies within one system, says RIO.“We’re… working on the studies for a small-scale, start-up operation focused on Winu’s higher-grade core as we take another step towards commercializing this deposit” commented Rio Tinto’s Stephen McIntosh.He continued: “The additional exploration results reported today support our view that there is potential to develop the Paterson region into a large-scale operation over time… We’ve so far carried out exploration activity in just 2% of our tenements in the region and we’re building on this discovery at Winu with further encouraging results.”Shares in RIO have climbed 5% year-to-date, but analysts have a cautious Hold consensus on the stock. That’s with an average analyst price target of $68 (8% upside potential).

2020-07-21	2020-07-21 09:30:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Australia's iron ore exports to China strong, but weak global demand indicates mixed coronavirus recovery	Australian iron ore exports to China surged in the first half of the year, as demand from steel mills rose to supply Beijing's infrastructure building push to boost the coronavirus-hit economy.Iron ore exports from Australia to the rest of the world, though, remained weak, reflecting the sharp differences in the pace of the recovery in major economies from the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic.Australian mining giant Rio Tinto reported a 3 per cent increase in total iron ore shipments in the first half of the year, including a rise in a new trend of port-side sales in China, amid the need for more flexible trading in the early days of China's economic recovery.But while Chinese demand for iron ore has improved progressively since it reopened its economy in May, Rio Tinto cautioned in its first half report that recovery in demand around the world, such as in Japan and Europe, has &quot;yet to begin meaningfully and is likely to be subdued when it does&quot;.Alongside steady sales of seaborne iron ore to support longer-term contracts, Rio Tinto, the second-largest diversified miner in the world, gained 61 new customers for port-side trading. This new sales venture started in September last year, and allows buyers to acquire iron ore in smaller volumes with shorter lead times and smaller credit lines than seaborne trading, allowing steel producers to keep their inventories to a minimum but still restock on a just-in-time basis if demand rises.The increasing attractiveness of port-side trading underlines a need for more flexibility in the early days of recovery, when there is still volatility in Chinese demand as the Covid-19 pandemic continues, said Tim Harcourt, former chief economist at the Australian Trade Commission.&quot;There's efficiency gains and less regulation. It's a clear sign of China's industrial production coming back,&quot; he said, adding that flexible port-side trading is helping steel producers reduce variable costs to make production viable in the short-term.Rio Tinto's strong iron ore sales in the first half of the year were tied to a 9.6 per cent increase in total Chinese imports compared to a year earlier, according to data from China's General Administration of Customs.Chinese gross domestic product also expanded by a stronger-than-expected 3.2 per cent in the second quarter from a year earlier, a sharp reversal from a first quarter contraction of 6.8 per cent.Iron ore prices have also performed well on the back of rising Chinese demand, soaring to nearly US$110 per tonne in July, a level not seen since August 2019.This was driven not only by a rise in demand from China, but also a fall in the supply of iron ore from mines in Brazil, where the number of coronavirus infections has soared and is now the second-highest in the world, after only the United States, economic research firm Trading Economics said.But the downside risk in rising iron ore prices is that profit margins for steel production will be squeezed, which may lead to a slowdown in production that could trigger a future decline in Chinese demand, ANZ Research said in a new report on Monday.Rising inventories at Chinese steel producers also signal a potential slowdown in demand for Australian iron ore.&quot;Inventories are a good gauge for underlying demand strength. Iron ore inventories have started building up, signalling waning demand strength,&quot; according to the report by ANZ's Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari.And with a likely decline in Chinese iron ore demand on the horizon, and a slow pickup in steel production among major customers outside China, the industry is not yet on a firm upwards trajectory, both Rio Tinto and analysts cautioned.But some are optimistic. Australia's department of industry expects the long-term performance of its iron ore exports to be positive, with China's demand set to remain strong in the future given a need for it to rely on its domestic economy to produce growth in 2020. That means prices will stay relatively high, according to the department's &quot;Resources and Energy Quarterly&quot; report released last month.&quot;Chinese demand for iron ore has thus far proven to be relatively robust, despite the impact of Covid-19 and the shutdown of significant sectors of the Chinese manufacturing industry,&quot; the report said.&quot;At this stage, it is not expected that Chinese demand will fall significantly, though the ongoing decline of consumer spending in [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] nations will increase the dependence of the Chinese steel industry on domestic stimulus measures.&quot;A significant global recovery in 2021 would offset any reduction in iron ore demand in China, it said.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

2020-07-20	2020-07-20 04:25:17	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Iron Ore’s African Future Is Slowly Advancing, Rio Tinto Says	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group is making progress on the development of Guinea’s giant Simandou iron ore deposit, bringing a potential overhaul of global supply of the steel-making material closer into view.Firing up production from the small West African nation would add a new source of high-quality ore and deliver a challenge to some lower-grade exports from Australia and Brazil, the existing largest suppliers.“There is more activity in Guinea,” Rio’s Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in an interview. “Covid-19 remains a concern and the movement is pretty slow, but we are progressing our studies as we speak with our Chinese partner.”Read more: China Plans to Approve Building Giant Simandou MineThe renewed effort marks a turnaround for London-based Rio, after an earlier deal to sell its share in Simandou to partner Aluminum Corp. of China, known as Chinalco, wasn’t completed. Guinea is now regarded as a growth option alongside development of new mines in Australia’s Pilbara region.“We’re looking at the project on its own merits. We have a development pathway for the Pilbara, we are looking at a Simandou option -- it’s still early days,” Jacques said in the interview on Friday.Rio holds 45% of Simandou’s blocks 3 and 4 -- which contains an estimated 2.8 billion tons of ore -- and China Baowu Steel Group is leading a consortium to acquire Chinalco’s 40% stake, Caixin reported last month. China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission is pushing companies to move forward with the project, people familiar with the plans said in March.A separate project covering the other half of Simandou -- blocks 1 and 2 -- could be up and running within five years, producing about 60 million tons a year in an initial stage and then expanding to more than 100 million tons a year, according to Societe Miniere de Boke, part of a consortium with Singapore’s Winning Shipping Ltd. and Guinea’s government.The prospect of a rival Guinea development and a potential move by BHP Group to boost export volumes in Australia may be acting to focus Rio’s attention on its plans, RBC Capital Markets analyst Tyler Broda said in a note last week.“We would view this as a change in tack from Rio management and a potentially interesting one,” Broda said. “Rio could be making the first moves to protect its iron ore market share.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iron-ore-african-future-slowly-042517266.html?.tsrc=rss

The company reported its own production of the metal fell 3% in the second-quarter.Prices have surged as key global sites curtailed activities or operated at reduced rates as virus cases accelerated among their workforces, though there are now signs that Chile -- the top producing nation -- is slowing the rate of new infections. Quarterly output at Escondida, the world’s biggest mine, increased 2% from a year ago, even with reduced staffing levels, Rio said.Iron ore demand remains strong in China, and Rio said it is adding new customers through port-side sales. The company is also progressing the Simandou mine project in Guinea, and China-based design institutes are updating designs for a trans-Guinean rail line and assessing shipping methods.The producer said it has implemented new controls following the destruction of ancient Aboriginal heritage sites in May to make way for an iron ore mine expansion. It’s an issue that prompted concern among investors, and could impact future mine approvals in Australia, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said this month.“We will learn from it in order to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Jacques said in the interview. “Today, there are still a lot of questions, and we don’t have all the answers.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-says-threat-virus-second-041245829.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-01	2020-07-01 06:44:54	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	A Miner Blew Up Ancient Human History. An Industry May Pay	(Bloomberg) -- Scraping away delicately at the reddish-brown earth of northwestern Australia’s vast Pilbara region, a team of archaeologists uncovered a record of life dating back more 40,000 years. Buried in natural shelters at the base of a cliff were thousands of stone and wooden tools, the sharpened fibula bone of a kangaroo and braided strands of hair.They worked quickly inside the Juukan Gorge rock shelters to recover the artefacts -- and needed to. The team was a salvage squad, sent in with a tight deadline to excavate a site in the path of an encroaching iron ore mine and approved for destruction.Blasts carried out in late May by Rio Tinto Group flattened the features in the central Hamersley Range, more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) northeast of Perth. Now the fallout is mounting for the London-based producer, and new risks are being posed to an iron ore sector that produces Australia’s top export, forecast to generate earnings of A$100 billion ($69 billion) in the year ended June 30.There’s now the prospect of regulatory changes that could introduce additional costs, and make it harder to win approvals to expand existing sites or to construct new operations. Aboriginal Australians, legislators and investors managing trillions of dollars are also united in pressing Rio and its rivals to improve their relationships with Indigenous communities.“Industry-wide social license to operate will be under increasing scrutiny and this could have bearing on costs if it requires changes to mine plans, and the approvals process both here and offshore,” said Camille Simeon, a Sydney-based investment manager for Aberdeen Standard Investments, which holds Rio shares and manages assets worth about $645 billion.The 196,000-square mile Pilbara is Australia’s most valuable iron ore region -- hosting a network of major mines that act as a profit engine for companies including Rio, BHP Group and billionaire Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. It’s also home to Indigenous communities that rank among the nation’s most disadvantaged, an imbalance that’s coming into sharper focus amid a wider investor drive for improved corporate responsibility.Read more: BlackRock’s Fink Tells CEOs to Pursue Purpose Beyond Profits“We’ve seen this with climate, and we’re in the situation now with these emerging issues of First Nations people and First Nations rights,” said Kara Keys, an investment committee member at Australia’s Construction & Building Unions Superannuation fund, which manages about A$56 billion, and a descendant of the Yiman and Gangulu peoples of central Queensland. “The climate debate was a peripheral issue 10 years ago and what we’ve seen is that it’s now a key issue.”There’s likely to be far more scrutiny of mining and energy projects that require cooperation with Indigenous communities, she said. That’s an issue not only for Australia, but for other key resources producing nations including Canada and the U.S.“We want the mining companies we invest in to be companies that everyone trusts,” said Nick Stansbury, head of commodity research at Legal & General Investment Management, which manages more than 1.2 trillion pounds ($1.5 trillion) of assets, including Rio shares.Rio’s Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques has apologized for distress caused to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation, the traditional users of the Juukan Gorge sites, and a board-led internal review aims to issue a public report by October. Investors have held a series of meetings with the company’s leadership, including Chairman Simon Thompson, Rio said in a statement.The PKKP, along with four other native title groups in the Pilbara, signed agreements with Rio in 2011 offering support for existing and future iron ore operations. Rio’s detonations in the Pilbara were also legal, authorized by a Western Australia government process used to rule on cases where impacts on Aboriginal sites are deemed unavoidable.Revised laws are expected to bolster protections, and give communities rights to appeal. Of 463 requests made by mining companies since mid-2010, none have been refused, the state’s government said in May.“There are places that are of outstanding importance that really should be protected,” said Fiona Hook, managing director of heritage consultancy Archae-aus and an archaeologist who has worked in the Pilbara region, for clients including Rio Tinto and BHP. “Juukan Gorge is one of those that should have been protected and the legislative process failed.”Consent for Rio to disturb the area was granted in 2013, before excavations the following year uncovered more evidence of the area’s historical significance. Criticism from both investors, and the PKKP, has focused on whether the company should have halted plans after the heritage value became known. BHP has agreed to carry out new consultation on areas at risk of disturbance at its South Flank development.Rio declined 0.8% and BHP was unchanged in Sydney trading Wednesday, as an index of leading Australia-listed energy producers and miners gained 0.8%.All miners need to consider “their existing and future relationships with Indigenous communities,” said Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England Pensions Board, who has raised concerns with Rio’s chairman.Approaches to community relations and human rights will shape investment decisions, according to Claudia Kruse, managing director for global responsible investment and governance at APG Asset Management NV, which manages more than 500 billion euro ($565 billion) in pension money. “Company performance on social issues matters,” Kruse said.The New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council, which invests about A$650 million on behalf of its members, has asked fund managers to sell its small position in Rio shares as a result of the Juukan Gorge blasts.“We’re not anti-mining,” CEO James Christian said. “When a company acts to the detriment of Aboriginal people, our culture and heritage, we need to send a very clear message.”(Updates to add share prices in 15th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/miner-blew-ancient-human-history-190000539.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-29	2020-06-29 22:00:01	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	BHP Overstayed in Petroleum. Time to Exit	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- BHP Group’s future can do without hydrocarbons.The world’s largest digger is among the last heavyweights to mix mines with a significant presence in oil, a combination that is becoming harder to justify over the long term. Crude demand will be slow to recover after a pandemic that has kept workers home and jets grounded, and some of that appetite will never come back. Meanwhile, pressure to cut carbon emissions is only increasing. Oil giant BP Plc is the  latest to take a hit, warning it expects impairments and write-offs worth as much as $17.5 billion due to a more gloomy view of what lies ahead. The Big Australian could benefit from a dose of that realism.There is little question that the petroleum division, with assets from Western Australia to the Gulf of Mexico, has generated impressive cash over the years — if you exclude the ill-considered foray into U.S. shale, a $20 billion investment (excluding capital expenditure) much criticized by activist fund Elliott Management Corp. and eventually sold off in 2018. In the six months to December 2019, the unit accounted for about 13% of BHP’s total earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, notching up an impressive 65% margin. Only iron ore, the group’s top earner, was higher, at 69%. Add in low production costs that cushion the blow of 2020’s lackluster oil prices, and it’s easy to see why putting in more cash is tempting when, as analyst Glyn Lawcock of UBS Group AG points out, the miner has few readily available alternative investments.It’s also true that while the medium-term global appetite for oil looks far less certain than it did, there’s a more appealing argument to be made around fading supply. Indeed, the $115 billion miner’s central expectation last year of demand hitting a high point in the mid-2030s now looks bullish, compared to comments from the likes of Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP. A peak even in the middle of this decade, BHP’s low-demand scenario, may prove optimistic. On the production side, though, the miner is right to point out that the industry has been investing less, a trend that will only accelerate after a disastrous 2020 and squeeze future production. BHP has estimated ongoing natural field decline at a rate of 3% to 5% per year.None of this means boss Mike Henry and his team can afford to ignore the signs that this year will prove to be a turning point for oil.Diversification has benefits, but operating synergies between oil and mining are debatable — it’s not an accident that while majors sold out of one or the other, none have returned. As a standalone business, the petroleum division might arguably have ventured less enthusiastically into shale. And the risk today is clear: Staying on can turn into overstaying.Here, Henry can reflect on the experience in thermal coal, where BHP woke up too late. Rival Rio Tinto Group offloaded its last coal mine in 2018, wrapping up a process that began in 2013. BHP held on to decent assets, using up tax losses. It’s now trying to retreat just as Anglo American Plc prepares to hive off its South African coal mines, and interest in the dirty fuel has dwindled. Oil has fewer easy substitutes, but it's conceivable that, with significant changes in policy, crude could be left similarly stranded. Accepting the need for an exit from a business that BHP has been in since the 1960s is only the first step, of course. For one, a carve-out in the mold of coal-to-aluminium producer South32 Ltd., which BHP spun off successfully in 2015, is harder to advocate for oil. The move then was about getting more out of sub-scale operations. In petroleum, BHP is not the operator for many of the assets, making such efficiencies harder to accomplish.BHP can begin by reviewing its portfolio, starting with mature assets in Australia. Partner Exxon Mobil Corp. has said that it’s seeking a buyer for its share of the Gippsland Basin oil and gas development in the Bass Strait; a joint sale with BHP has been considered before. Chevron Corp., meanwhile,  has put  its stake in the giant North West Shelf liquefied natural gas venture on the block. That operation, Australia’s largest LNG project, is shifting from processing its own gas to opening services to new suppliers, a business known as tolling — less suited to either Chevron or BHP. The mining giant has  in any event been less enthusiastic about gas than oil.Granted, even that won’t be easy. Australia churns up a decent amount of revenue, and BHP can argue it is better to continue taking cash now, at the risk of selling for less later. Some investors may agree. A similarly short-term view in the Gulf of Mexico could see it adding to the portfolio as distressed rivals are forced out.For newish boss Henry, though, none of those would look like the decisions of a company preparing for a greener future. He has an opportunity to outline the path to net zero emissions when BHP announces full-year results in August. An exit plan for oil would be one decisive step toward that goal.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-06-23	2020-06-23 02:48:18	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Australia Sacred Sites Seen Remaining Under Threat After Mine Law Reform	(Bloomberg) -- Looming legislative changes aimed at boosting protection for Aboriginal heritage sites in Western Australia are unlikely to prevent their destruction or stymie expansion by mining companies that are under intense pressure over their preservation practices.Rio Tinto Group’s decision last month to carry out explosions that saw the destruction of a 40,000-year-old site in the centre of the nation’s iron ore industry has sparked widespread controversy, scrutiny from investors and calls for legal reform.The new laws will include more precise legal definitions of what constitutes Aboriginal heritage, modified financial penalties for misdemeanors and the encouragement of agreements between Aboriginal people and other land use proponents, according to the state government.While the proposed legislation embodies significant changes on paper, they will do little to prevent miners in practice from getting their way in land rights matters, according to Kate Galloway, an associate professor at Queensland’s Griffith Law School who specializes in land and property rights.‘Be Realistic’“We need to be realistic. I don’t think that is going to stop the destruction of sites,” Galloway said. “The framework of cultural heritage that is in Australia -- without a real shift in political will -- is not going to save these places.”Investors have held meetings with Rio’s Chairman Simon Thompson and executives to raise questions over the producer’s actions, and Australia’s First State Super, which holds about $69 billion in assets, this month removed the company from a socially responsible portfolio option. A parliamentary committee is also scheduled to report to Australia’s Senate by Sept. 30 on Rio’s decision-making. The company reiterated its support for the reform of the legislation.Also this month, rival BHP Group said it won’t disturb indigenous sites identified under a land use agreement at the South Flank iron ore mine without further extensive consultation with traditional landowners after it was granted permission to the land under the current act.“The new Aboriginal heritage legislation that is expected to be released soon for final consultation will cement the rights of Traditional Owners to make their own decisions on their ancient sites,” Western Australian Aboriginal Affairs Minister Ben Wyatt said in a statement. “While there may be rare occasions where the interests of the state exceed those of the relevant Aboriginal people, I will continue to support agreements made by Traditional Owners.”Draft BillDrafting of the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Bill 2020 is slated for completion before the end of the year. Rio’s explosions were authorized by the state government under a system used to rule on situations where impacts on Aboriginal sites are deemed unavoidable.Competing land rights, afforded to miners, and cultural rights, afforded to traditional landowners, share fundamental incompatibilities that make disputes difficult to reconcile, Galloway said. While landowners will be more involved in the decision-making process under the proposed legislation, miners can still refuse their requests because -- ultimately -- they still have the right to use that land, she said.The issue of ownership rights to the land can’t be resolved “unless you say to miners -- these parts are quarantined, you can’t blast them,” she said. “I would be extremely surprised if there were a blanket prohibition on the destruction of these sites.”Appeal AvenueThe controversial Section 18 of the original act -- that gives companies with mining rights permission to damage a site and prevents any avenue for appeal -- would have to be changed not only to give a right to appeal decisions, but to remove altogether the right to destroy sites, she said.Rio, the world’s second-biggest mining company, has voiced support for state heritage law reform following the blasts in the Juukan Gorge area to facilitate mining at its Brockman 4 operation. Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques also has apologized for distress caused to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, the traditional owners of the land.Last week, the company launched a review into its heritage management processes within iron ore business, focusing on recommending improvements to the effectiveness of its internal processes and governance.The proposed laws may introduce some procedural hurdles for miners -- if consultation processes with Aboriginal communities drag out, and if there is a greater requirement for more robust justification of destruction at cultural sites, Galloway said. “Companies are already doing that,” she said. “I don’t see that it will be that much much harder for them.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/australia-sacred-sites-seen-remaining-024818443.html?.tsrc=rss

The destruction of sacred rock shelters in the Pilbara, an area that generates two-thirds of Rio’s earnings, has turned the spotlight on the Anglo-Australian miner’s corporate culture and highlighted the growing importance of environmental, social and governance issues.  “Culture above greed,” read one of the placards at a protest outside Rio’s Perth headquarters last week over the blasting of Juukan Gorge, an area where thousands of ancient Aboriginal artefacts were recently discovered.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e588303d-8be3-3f24-a91e-b6d210924b18/rio-tinto-in-need-of.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-06-13	2020-06-13 00:00:32	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Is a 46,000-Year-Old Site Less Sacred Than Profits?	"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It seemed like an incident from another era. Rio Tinto Group last month demolished a 46,000-year-old site sacred to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples to make way for an expansion of its Brockman 4 mine in Australia’s iron-rich northwestern Pilbara region. The act has been likened to the destruction of Palmyra by the Islamic State.It wasn’t only the Juukan Gorge caves that were blasted, though. Such a blithe act, and management’s subsequent inability to explain it, has undermined the decades Rio Tinto spent presenting itself as the socially responsible face of the mining industry.How could such an event happen? If you see mining companies the way they like to present themselves — as benevolent middle men, aiding the economic development of formerly colonized peoples while providing materials for the industrial development of the planet — then it’s inexplicable that they could display such indifference at a site nearly three times as old as the Lascaux Caves.That’s mostly a story for the cover of the corporate responsibility report.While mining companies employ plenty of people sincerely committed to land rights and no doubt believe much of their own rhetoric, a middle man isn't working for the sake of his suppliers or customers —he’s trying to maximize his own returns. When you’re dividing up the pie from selling mineral products, any cash spent giving landowners just compensation is money that’s not going to shareholders.Rio Tinto has spent decades burnishing a reputation for treating landowners better than some of its peers — but it’s a lot easier to be the good guy when the deck is so heavily stacked in your favor.As in many parts of the former British Empire, ownership of land in Australia was transferred to the Crown by a legal fiction upon European invasion in 1788. Until the middle of the 20th century, Aboriginal people in remote areas often worked as ranchers or servants in return for tobacco, sugar, tea and clothing — conditions not many rungs above slavery(2). The current disparate Indigenous Australian land-rights regimes were established from the 1970s to the 1990s against that backdrop. Despite the triumphs of figures such as Vincent Lingiari and Eddie Mabo in using strikes, political appeals and legal cases to win formal rights over land, campaigners have always had to fight off the back foot. The result isn’t hard to see on a visit to an outback Aboriginal community. Despite the fact that such areas host some of the world’s most lucrative mines, Indigenous Australians die about 14 years younger than their non-indigenous neighbors in remote areas. In the most isolated regions, they’re paid just 28 cents for every dollar earned by others and four out of 10 households are overcrowded.I’m from the U.K., where landowners still form an aristocracy that includes many of the country’s richest people. It’s depressing that as a migrant to Australia, I’m better off than most of the traditional owners(3) on whom this country’s wealth was built. This manifest injustice is explained in a variety of ways. Legally, land rights for Indigenous Australians are considered to have been “extinguished” if they were driven off their land in the past to make way for ranching, mining, real estate or infrastructure. That formula, one of the cornerstones of the country’s so-called native title system, bestows a blessing on a historical act of theft, rather than seeking to redress it.Politically, the miserable conditions that prevail in many remote Aboriginal communities are blamed on social breakdown and the perception (often justified) that money spent on Indigenous advancement has been wasted on corruption and mismanagement — in essence, blaming Indigenous people for their own dispossession and exploitation.For all that such problems are attributed to a surfeit of “welfare,” though, Australia spends just A$3.3 billion ($2.26 billion) a year on Indigenous-specific government programs, with much of that budget dedicated to closing inequalities in education and health. That’s far less than the A$14 billion or so a year that state and territory governments get from mining royalty payments. A first step toward reversing this would acknowledge the immense damage that mining and industry can do to landscapes that are an essential part of the world’s cultural legacy. Aboriginal people were the first to colonize a new continent by sea, and were grinding seeds for flour and stone to make ax-heads 20,000 years before the same technologies helped kick-start the agricultural revolution in the Fertile Crescent. At Murujuga near the Pilbara iron ore port of Karratha, a nominated world heritage site hosts more than a million petroglyphs — including depictions of extinct megafauna and the oldest carved images of human faces — hard against an LNG terminal, explosives factory and fertilizer plant.The destruction of the Juukan Gorge caves wasn’t an isolated incident. The Pilbara is thick with such cultural artifacts. A few days later, BHP Group received approval from Western Australia’s government to demolish 40 sites. Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. is seeking similar permission to expand its Solomon mine, where excavated sites include a cave whose occupation dates back 60,000 years.The solution isn’t to stop mining. In communities that have suffered neglect by the state, these companies are often welcomed as the only partners in economic development — but the current regime is clearly not working for traditional owners. What resources companies have always sought is a “social license to operate.” For too long, though, those notional licenses have been handed out in return for relatively paltry royalty payments, often in the form of in-kind agreements to employ local workers and provide health, education and infrastructure that the state fails to fund properly.What's needed is legal and political change. Australia’s native title laws skew the playing field in favor of resources companies, and must be reformed to give local communities rights to a larger share of the billions of dollars their land produces. The deal that South Australia state recently handed out to mostly white farmers with little fanfare — a cash royalty on new gas production equivalent to about 1% of the sale price — is the sort of settlement that many Aboriginal groups have fought and failed to win through decades of court battles.There are signs that change may be afoot. Australia’s High Court last month denied an appeal by Fortescue against a 2017 judgment, ensuring the Yindjibarndi people would hold a form of native title close to freehold land ownership. That precedent should strengthen the hand of Indigenous groups in negotiating with mining companies in the future.A separate judgement last year also gave more guidance for how the value of native titles should be assessed, and found it to be substantially above the sort of sums that have typically gone to title-holders. If similar payments were assessed for even just 5% of native title land, traditional owners would be entitled to some A$280 billion, according to one analysis of the case by law firm MinterEllison.In the Australian context, such enormous numbers are generally regarded as evidence that Indigenous land claims are politically impractical.

2020-06-02	2020-06-02 21:01:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Blasts at Ancient Aboriginal Site Expose Widening ESG Frontline	(Bloomberg) -- Explosions that damaged a 40,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site at a Rio Tinto Group iron ore mine in Australia are focusing investor concern on the growing reputational risk companies face from social issues, widening the advocacy battlefront beyond climate change and governance.The world’s No. 2 miner is being challenged by shareholders over its decision to carry out new blasting on May 24 for production at its Brockman 4 mine in Western Australia. While the explosions were authorized under a 2013 decision by the state government, the incident has sparked widespread controversy.“It raises the question about, what is legal versus what is right? And that’s something that companies and also the investment community is under increasing pressure to consider,” said Danielle Welsh-Rose, ESG investment director for Asia-Pacific at Aberdeen Standard Investments, which holds Rio shares and manages about $645 billion in global assets.“Investors are already more focused on human rights and social issues than they have been in the past, so there’s definitely scope for something like this to trigger an investor response,” she said.They also are wielding increasing influence in markets. Norway’s $1 trillion wealth fund is doubling down in its responsible investment strategy, recently excluding Brazilian iron-ore giant Vale SA in line with its rules on environmental damage, and utility Eletrobras SA, citing the risk of human rights violations, including increased pressure on indigenous lands.Aberdeen has sought more information from Rio on the incident at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region. Two damaged rock-shelters at the site may have been occupied by humans as long as 46,000 years ago, according to the Australian Archaeological Association Inc.Rio was reviewing its plans for the Juukan Gorge and will launch a comprehensive review of its broader heritage approach, iron ore CEO Chris Salisbury said Sunday, apologizing to the traditional landowners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation. “We are sorry for the distress we have caused,” he said. The landowners, who recognized Rio had complied with its legal obligations, said May 25 that they were first advised on May 15 about the blasting.The company said May 27 it also was sorry that the recently expressed concerns of the traditional owners had not arisen through the engagements that had taken place over many years under the agreement that governs its operations on their country. Rio had been informed on numerous occasions of the land’s importance and the community’s preference for keeping the shelters intact, the PKKPAC said in a statement May 30.Debby Blakey, CEO of the Health Employees Superannuation Trust Australia, an industry pension fund that manages more than A$55 billion ($37 billion), has also written to the London-based producer seeking further explanation.“If we show our dismay, and show the company, and expect a higher bar -- and quite honestly expect them to do what they say they’re going to do in terms of their reconciliation action plan themselves -- I think other companies will be more aware,” Blakey said. “Just because something is legal, doesn’t make it right.”The firepower of socially conscious shareholders is growing. Almost $31 trillion was allocated to sustainable investing strategies in five key markets at the start of 2018, about a third higher than in 2016, according to a report by the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance. So-called impact funds, which seek to actively generate social and environmental outcomes alongside a financial return, hold about $500 billion globally, the Global Impact Investing Network said in a report last year.It’s likely investor groups will use votes against company boards at annual meetings, or table resolutions calling for action -- familiar tactics used to articulate climate concerns -- to highlight social issues, Aberdeen’s Welsh-Rose said. “The reputation risk is something that is increasing now compared to how it was, I think because of that real collaborative investor action and increased sophistication of pressure groups, advocacy groups and investor groups.”In Australia alone, investments in conservation, clean energy and other initiatives that are considered likely to have a positive impact on the environment or society will rise five-fold to A$100 billion in the next five years, according to the Responsible Investment Association Australasia.“Social issues are just as important as the environmental, critical to protecting shareholder value,” according to Hesta’s Blakey, who said surveys of the pension fund’s members found they give about equal weight to the two issues.While much recent ESG focus has been on climate and governance issues, that’s often been because there’s easier access to data in those areas, according to Aberdeen’s Welsh-Rose. “It’s a little bit more clear cut,” she said. “There’s a lot of work going on now to get companies to provide a lot more information and data on the social side.”For Rio Tinto, there are specific questions to address on internal processes as a result of last month’s heritage site blasts, said Susheela Peres da Costa, head of advisory at Regnan, which advises institutional investors on ESG risks. A Rio spokesman pointed to the company’s plans announced Sunday to review and improve its handling of heritage issues.“If this was a communication failure between the indigenous groups and Rio, it might raise questions about the stakeholder consultation process effectiveness,” she said. Alternatively, it could also be a matter of internal governance in communicating stakeholder risk properly. “It was a surprise to us, in particular because we think of Rio’s record on indigenous issues as relatively good.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blasts-ancient-aboriginal-expose-widening-210100725.html?.tsrc=rss

They would have to be cheap stocks with low price-earnings ratios and high dividend yields. The idea is that by diversifying a portion of your portfolio in non-U.S. stocks, you will enhance your overall returns.Often, foreign equities provide a return that is not correlated with U.S. stocks. At least, that is the theory. There are some significant drawbacks. I have managed non-U.S. equity portfolios on the institutional side for a good number of years and am well familiar with these issues.For one, non-U.S. stocks are subject to currency fluctuations. When the dollar rises, the U.S. dollar return on non-U.S. equities tends to lag. However, I have learned that this effect tends to recycle over a number of years and sort of washes out.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA second issue is that often, non-U.S. stocks pay dividends just twice a year. This is because the vast majority of foreign companies only report their earnings semi-annually. However, the larger U.S. listed American Depository Receipts (ADR) or American Depository Shares (ADS) tend to report quarterly and pay their dividends that way. This occurs either because U.S. holders are a big percentage of the share base, or the company perceives that its stock price is ""made"" in the U.S.Moreover, another issue is that many non-U.S. companies will pay their dividends out as a percentage of their semi-annual earnings. In other words, the dividends paid each year can fluctuate, based on profits. U.S. companies tend to pay out a steady dividend that increases over time. I have learned again that the larger non-U.S. stocks have started following the steady dividend approach.The following five cheap stocks are worthwhile investments. They all have higher-than-normal dividend yields that tend to be paid quarterly. They also have low price-earnings ratios.Here are five cheap stocks -- that pay nice dividends -- to buy now:  * BP Midstream Partners (NYSE:BPMP)  * Publicis Groupe (OTCMKTS:PUBGY)  * Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO)  * Vodafone Group (NASDAQ:VOD)  * Total (NYSE:TOT)Let's dive in and look at these foreign, cheap stocks more closely. Foreign Cheap Stocks: BP Midstream Partners (BPMP)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 12.5%BP (NYSE:BP) is a profitable foreign stock with a nice 10.9% dividend yield. But I thought I would focus on one of its spinoff companies, BP Midstream Partners. BPMP has a higher dividend yield than BP.BPMP is a U.S.-listed master limited partnership (MLP) that is focused solely on the midstream portion of the oil and gas life cycle. That involves running oil and gas onshore and offshore pipelines and terminals.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Now that more companies are looking to store oil and gas, its assets are close to fully occupied.BPMP declared a quarterly dividend on April 15 for 34.75 cents per share. That works out to an annualized dividend of $1.39. At today's price of $11, the stock yields 12.5%.  This is higher than BP's distribution yield of just under 11%.The company reported excellent results for Q1 on May 8. It says that the quarterly distribution is covered 1.17 times by its earnings. Moreover, BPMP says it is targeting a 5% increase in its distributions to shareholders in 2020 over 2019.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Have Nothing But Upside In Their Future At 7.3 times earnings, with a 16.8% free cash flow yield and a 12.5% dividend yield, BPMP is very profitable and cheap. Investors should take a close look at the company. Publicis Groupe (PUBGY)Source: shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 4.9%Next on my list of cheap stocks is Publicis Groupe. This is a French advertising, communications and digital marketing company. Publicis has its tentacles in a lot of related areas like media, technology, healthcare communications and consulting services. It owns famed companies Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett.Publicis Groupe trades on the over-the-counter market. Its dividend yield has been about 9%, and the forward price-earnings ratio is about 7. So it is a profitable company, but a cheap stock.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA On April 13, Publicis reported its revenue, which was up 17%, although it included the effects of the acquisition of Epsilon. Its organic growth was down by 2.9% over last year. The company did not report its earnings, which apparently are done on a semi-annual basis.In addition, Publicis Groupe decided to cut its dividend by 50% to 1.15 euros. This works out to about 31.12 cents per ADR.There are four PUBGY ADRs per French ordinary share. As a result, PUBGY has a dividend yield of 4.9%. The company said it will pay the dividend in September.So Publicis Groupe is a cheap and profitable foreign stock with an above-average dividend yield. Rio Tinto Group (RIO)Source: BalkansCat / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 8.4%Rio Tinto is a $74 billion mining company based in London. It produces iron ore, bauxite, copper, gold, silver, aluminum and a host of other commodities.Last year, Rio Tinto started paying dividends four times a year. It is still not clear that it will continue with this practice. I suspect it will, as there does not seem to be an announcement to the contrary. Based on last year's dividend of $3.82 per share, RIO stock yields 8.4%.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Moreover, the company has a website section showing consensus financial information, including production, revenue and earnings estimates by all its sell-side analysts. This is not allowed by U.S. regulators for U.S. stocks, for no good reason. But it is fairly common for foreign stocks under looser financial information regulations.Based on this I estimate that earnings will be $5.04 per ADR this year. The company just needs global lockdowns to relax, or at least ease up.This will increase the demand for global committees, especially iron and copper. As demand rises, the price of these commodities will increase and the company will make more money.This puts the stock at a very cheap multiple of just 9 times earnings. So, combined with the 8.4% dividend, RIO stock offers very good value for investors. Vodafone Group (VOD)Source: Photos by D / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 6.6%Vodafone is a telecom and cable TV company based in the United Kingdom. The company has a $43.8 billion market value and its ADR is listed on the Nasdaq Exchange.VOD stock has a very high dividend yield at 6.6% and is quite attractive to investors at this level. It pays the dividend twice a year. Vodafone kept its final dividend level with last year in its earnings announcement on May 12.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA This requires a little explanation. First of all, Vodafone is like most other UK stocks that report their earnings and dividends twice a year. But for some reason, even though VOD's earnings are in pounds, it pays out the dividend in eurocents.So for this fiscal year ending March 31, the Vodafone annual dividend was kept stable at 9 eurocents per share. Now since there are 10 ordinary shares for every one VOD ADR, and since the exchange rate is $1.0823 per euro, the U.S. dividend per VOD ADR is about 97 cents. That makes the annualized yield about 6.6%.To make things more complicated, the upcoming final dividend (half of the total dividend, since an interim dividend was already paid) is set at 4.5 eurocents per ordinary share. This will be paid on Aug. 7, 2020. This effectively makes the upcoming payment a dividend yield of about 3.3%. This depends on the exchange rate when the ADR payment is set.Vodafone's earnings for the year ending March were reasonably good. The bottom line is that the company expects its FY 2021 free cash flow to decline slightly from 5.7 billion pounds to 5.4 billion pounds. As a result, I expect the dividend will be kept level.This makes VOD stock very attractive as a stable, well-covered and high-dividend play for income investors. Total (TOT)Source: MDOGAN / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 8.8%Total is a French oil and gas company. Last year the company paid four dividends to its shareholders, although it calls three of them ""interim"" dividends and the last one a ""final"" dividend.This past year, the company increased its dividend 5% to 2.68 euros per share. This works out to $2.92 per ADR.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA As a result, the stock has a very attractive dividend yield of 8.8% for investors.I estimate that the stock is also cheap at just 7.4 times earnings. In its most recent Q1 earnings presentation, Total said its break-even level is at $25 per barrel of oil.So I expect the company will be able to stay profitable this quarter. As economic activity picks up, the company will be able to make more money once the price of oil rises.This is an attractively priced stock at below 8 times this year's earnings, based on the company's recent earnings results.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-05-05	2020-05-05 07:35:31	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Even Proxy Advisers Are Split Over Mining’s Emissions Debate	(Bloomberg) -- Key investor advisory groups are divided on whether Rio Tinto Group shareholders should support a demand for the world’s No. 2 miner to extend the range of its targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. is recommending Rio investors support a resolution tabled by an advocacy group calling on the producer to add additional targets, including so-called scope 3 emissions -- those generated by customers through the use of its products. In contrast, Glass Lewis & Co. advises holders to reject the plan at an annual meeting on Thursday.The division highlights a debate in the mining and energy sectors on the extent to which raw materials companies bear responsibility for emissions created when customers, such as steel mills, use their products. BHP Group has pledged to set goals for its scope 3 footprint later this year, and Royal Dutch Shell Plc last month set out plans to cut the same category of emissions by 65% by 2050.Shareholders “have a long-term interest in assessing whether Rio Tinto is adequately assessing and acting on its climate risk and opportunities,” including through “targets to work with its customers to achieve reductions in its scope 3 emissions,” ISS said in an April 30 note to clients, recommending they vote in favor of the proposal submitted by environmental campaign group Market Forces and a small group of investors. Rio has advised investors to vote against the proposal.Why ‘Scope’ Matters for Oil Companies Cutting Carbon: QuickTakeLondon based-Rio argues that unlike competitors who produce fossil fuels and can potentially supply less-carbon intensive alternatives, it has little capacity to address the emissions created by its customers. The company’s scope 3 emissions are generated mainly when its iron ore is used in China’s steel mills, or bauxite is consumed in the aluminum-making process.“Our ability to directly influence our customers’ emissions is limited,” Peter Toth, Rio’s global head of corporate development, told an investor meeting last month. “It is even difficult to accurately quantify their emissions and so our strategy is to work in partnership across these value chains.”The producer is collaborating with China Baowu Steel Group and Tsinghua University in Beijing to curb pollution in the steel sector, which accounts for about 7% of all global emissions.Read More: Rio Tinto Rejects Setting Targets for Customers’ PollutionDirect annual emissions from Rio’s operations are about 31.8 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, compared with the company’s estimate of about 491 million tons of emissions in its wider supply chain, the miner said earlier this year.Rio said in February it would seek to cut emissions from its own businesses by 15% on 2018 levels by 2030, will target net zero emissions by 2050 and spend $1 billion over the next five years on the efforts.While the producer should continue to reduce its own emissions, it’s probably not “feasible for the company to set goals based on how its customers determine to utilize its products,” Glass Lewis said in a note to clients last month. The producer has made “extensive disclosure on the steps it is taking to mitigate its environmental impact,” according to the adviser.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/even-proxy-advisers-split-over-073531750.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-23	2020-04-23 08:18:10	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Diamonds Need Some New Best Friends	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s looking decidedly somber out there for the world’s favorite sparkly stone.Diamonds were ailing even before the coronavirus came along. Now, weeks into lockdowns in the U.S. and elsewhere, all but the largest diggers, polishers and retailers are struggling for cash. Unable to sell its stones, Dominion Diamond Mines, the miner that sold luxury brand Harry Winston to Swatch Group AG in 2013, filed for insolvency protection late Wednesday. Anglo American Plc’s De Beers cut 2020 production guidance by a fifth Thursday, in line with demand.To secure their future, diamond giants may need a rebranding akin to the storytelling feat pulled off by Harry Oppenheimer, the late De Beers chairman who cultivated the engagement ring to overcome a slump after the Great Depression. In so doing, he forged a tradition that fueled sales for decades. Today, a refreshed myth-making effort could target the post-pandemic concerns of millennial consumers: marketing the diamond as a store of value in volatile times comparable to art, which is also authentic, traceable and sustainable.Since 2011, when prices peaked thanks to China’s new shoppers, diamonds have faltered. Lab-grown stones, initially priced confusingly close to the real thing, posed a challenge. To make things worse, a supply glut hit the market, pushing producers to cut prices. A 26-million-carat increase in 2017 was the largest single-year volume addition since 1986, according to consulting firm Bain & Co. Meanwhile, financing availability shrank dramatically as traditional lenders pulled away. A 2018 fraud scandal involving celebrated Indian jeweler Nirav Modi didn’t help. The coronavirus will accelerate some developments that aren’t unwelcome. In supply terms, the industry may look healthier if older or more marginal mines are obliged to stop digging. Rio Tinto Group last year had already announced the 2020 closure of its Argyle mine, which produces both low-quality gems and fabled pink diamonds, taking some 13 million carats out of global annual production of just over 140 million. The current crisis will add to that. In March, Dominion stopped work at its Ekati mine in Canada, and other pits have been closed or are working only partially. Not all will return.There will be a shakeout among polishers and perhaps more integration in some parts of the industry, of the sort demonstrated by Louis Vuitton’s purchase earlier this year of the largest rough diamond since 1905. Sales of rough and polished stones will change too, as travel restrictions in South Africa, Botswana and India push more deals online. It’s a remarkable feat for a conservative industry that thrives on face-to-face interaction, and arcane systems like De Beers’ “sights,” as its regular sales are known.Yet the scale of this health crisis, rapidly turning into an economic cataclysm, has also made other problems far worse. India’s polishers are not only strapped for credit, but also struggling with a weaker rupee, lockdowns and curfews; Thousands of workers have been forced to leave hubs like Surat altogether. Elsewhere, both diamantaires and jewelry buyers are stuck at home, making it harder to clear excess inventory. The flow of diamonds has dwindled to barely a trickle.The real concern is demand, where a grim outlook for disposable incomes suggests a hoped-for 2020 recovery is impossible, even as supply shrinks. The very top of the market may be insulated, but further down even China’s “revenge purchases” aren’t going to be enough. As my colleague Nisha Gopalan has pointed out, such splurges won’t save luxury products — especially if U.S. job losses continue to pile up. Inventory could flood the market, too.All this upheaval does makes it a good time to rethink the storytelling behind diamonds, though. Coordinated marketing, once the industry’s go-to solution, will need to make a comeback as consumers emerge from the wreckage of coronavirus. Post-pandemic values may change broadly.Three things could be highlighted. First, a store of value for the long term, especially for the largest gems where prices vary less. Like art, or fine wine, only wearable. Better yet, to appeal to the millennials that make up its consumer base, the industry can promote the stones’ authenticity, building on existing work around provenance and traceability, dating back to the Kimberley Process, the multilateral system aimed at ensuring the proceeds of diamond mining aren’t used to fund conflict. The industry is also sustainable, with relatively clean, chemical-free processes.Marketing spend has recovered after a dip in the past decade, but coordinated industry expenditure remains far below even the early 2000s. While the likes of De Beers and Alrosa PJSC may be reluctant to sponsor cash-strapped smaller rivals, it would be money well spent. Nearly seven decades after Marilyn Monroe’s immortal song, it's time for a new myth.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-04-23	2020-04-23 05:51:51	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Mine Shutdowns Plague Metals Even as Some Slowly Return to Work	(Bloomberg) -- The impact of the coronavirus pandemic continues to ripple through the global mining industry, with extended shutdowns in some regions, others allowing operations to resume, and industry giants warning they’ll rein in capital expenditure.Unprecedented disruptions to mines and supply chains have thrown the outlook for industrial and precious metals into disarray, just as demand is hit by prospects for the steepest recession in almost a century. China, the top commodities buyer, recorded its first contraction in decades.The fallout is difficult to quantify as countries extend, revise or relax measures to contain the crisis. South Africa has allowed companies to resume operations at half their normal capacity, while Peru extended its lockdown to April 26 and Canada’s Quebec classified mining as a priority to enable a return to business. Elsewhere, Zambia said it persuaded Glencore Plc to reverse what it had called an illegal decision to close its copper mines there.Miners have also had to scramble to relocate thousands of workers to comply with restrictions on movement, while industry giants Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group have flagged lower capital expenditure due to the virus. Further down the supply chain, steelmakers are suspending facilities or operating at lower capacity.Here’s how some key companies are being affected by the pandemic.

2020-04-21	2020-04-21 02:39:32	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	As Oil Crashes, Iron Ore's Still Rocking	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last year was supposed to be an aberration for iron ore, an unexpected period of sky-high prices after a fatal dam collapse in Brazil and a tropical cyclone in Australia. Instead, it continues to defy gravity. Sheltered from the worst of the pandemic upheaval, Australian diggers like BHP Group, which reported stable output for the March quarter Tuesday, can expect to benefit.Rio de Janeiro-based Vale SA warned just weeks ago that weak demand from steel mills outside China would hurt iron ore as the coronavirus spreads, industrial appetite shrinks and producers bring down the shutters. The first part of the statement has proved accurate: Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts that pandemic-linked manufacturing shutdowns, especially among automakers, will drag demand down by 10% to 15% in the U.S. and Europe this year. BHP says it expects steel outside China to contract by a double-digit percentage, as logistical difficulties and collapsing demand force customers to cut back. Yet prices remain surprisingly robust, with Singapore futures hovering around $83 per metric ton. The main explanation sits with China, where furnaces and construction projects are recovering. The country accounts for about 70% of global demand for seaborne iron ore, so a rebound there matters far more than pain elsewhere. By way of example, China’s import requirements amount to about 1.1 billion tons, against 100 million for Europe.While the risk of a second wave of infections remains, China’s return to work is real: Port stocks have been steadily reducing, while premiums for higher-quality material have been unusually high. BHP estimates electric-arc furnace utilization has recovered to 56% after falling to 12%. It’s true that exporters of finished products such as excavators will be hit by a weak global economy, but a lot more ore is gobbled up for the giant home market.Alongside that, global supply is doing worse than many expected. Granted, widespread closures aren’t just a problem for iron ore. Coronavirus stoppages are hitting other commodities like copper, where Chris LaFemina at Jefferies estimates 20% of supply is now impacted, versus 8% for global iron ore. That supply crunch is supporting base metals and other commodities to the point that China’s grim first-quarter economic data left the metal uncharacteristically unruffled Friday.For iron ore, there’s more. On top of the pandemic, there are ongoing disruptions: specifically, upheaval at Vale, which is still struggling with permits as it tries to recover from the Brumadinho dam collapse. On Friday, the company cut 2020 production expectations for iron ore fines to 310 million to 330 million tons, from 340 million to 355 million, while warning the fallout from the health crisis could get worse. The Brazilian government’s poor handling of the pandemic means it isn’t impossible to imagine a drop to 2019’s level of 302 million tons — a significant loss to a large, though tight, seaborne market.For producers Down Under, none of this is bad news. While in copper everyone is suffering as large mines from Latin America to Africa slow or stop digging, the pain in iron ore hasn’t been equally distributed. Australia’s enormous Pilbara operations have by and large kept going, with exports up significantly last month. Vale is benefiting from higher prices that may cushion output losses; by contrast, the big Australians are digging and selling more, too. BHP reported a 3% increase in production for the nine months to the end of March. Rio Tinto Group, now the world’s top producer, last week also reported higher first-quarter output and shipments, compared to a year earlier.Better yet, costs are coming down. That’s thanks to the effects of a weaker domestic currency against the U.S. dollar, rock-bottom oil prices and still-depressed shipping rates. BHP’s unit costs for Pilbara already hovered around $13 per ton. At the same time, realized prices have held — BHP says its average in the March quarter was just over $74 per ton, down just 5% on the six months to December. That will help offset damage in harder-hit commodities, particularly oil.It’s unclear how long this corner of the commodities market will continue to hold up. Other producers may well limp back, adding to supply, and China could face further virus setbacks. For now, Brazil looks vulnerable and China robust. It may be another unexpected year of grace for iron ore. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-04-17	2020-04-17 00:53:49	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Fortune Will Favor Miners with Nerves of Steel	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- After years of buying at the peak of the economic cycle and selling in the trough, could the world’s big diggers do the reverse? Compared to peers in oil and gas, Rio Tinto Group and the largest diversified miners are riding out the coronavirus storm in sheltered positions: They have low operating costs, little debt and more than $60 billion in liquidity.History matters here. Just over a decade ago, miners binged on hubristic investments like Rio’s acquisition of aluminum producer Alcan or Anglo American Plc’s Minas Rio iron-ore venture. In the hangover years between 2012 and 2016, some $200 billion was written off, and a generation of chief executives were shown the door. It was a near-death experience akin to what the energy sector is going through today, and one that left behind an industry focused on cleaning up, cutting back and returning cash to shareholders. Rio has been among the most generous, handing back $36 billion since 2016.It means the industry’s largest players went into this crisis with two things: balance sheets at their most robust in years, and a pedestrian growth outlook. Almost the opposite is true at long-coveted targets like Freeport-McMoRan Inc., with a market value of $11 billion, and First Quantum Minerals Ltd., valued at $3.5 billion. These mid-size base metal producers are beginning to look fragile, with expanding copper mines but nearly $19 billion of total debt between them. Their shares have fallen more than 40% this year. No one knows how long a recovery from the pandemic will take, or what life will look like on the other side, but miners have a little more certainty than most: Metals like copper, used for electrification and a host of consumer goods, will be needed, and will be in short supply. It’s a tantalizing state of affairs. As ever, things aren’t quite that simple, and even the heftiest miners aren’t immune to the world’s turmoil. BHP Group has to contend with the crashing oil price. Anglo American is dealing with lockdowns in South Africa, Peru and elsewhere, as governments try to contain the spread of coronavirus. Glencore Plc, long the most buccaneering of the large players, is tackling succession, trouble in Zambia and a pending U.S. Department of Justice investigation into its business practices.At Rio, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques has perhaps the strongest motivation to act. He is less exposed to many of these uncertainties, and is running a miner that still relies on iron ore for about three-quarters of its Ebitda, as steel consumption hovers at or near a peak in China. Large mainland miners, like acquisitive Zijin Mining Group or Jiangxi Copper Co., may be his competitors. There are cashed-up bullion players, too: Barrick Gold Corp.’s CEO, Mark Bristow, has said he could consider copper and even Freeport’s Indonesian Grasberg mine.The trouble is, we’re not yet at the distress levels that will prompt boards to approve a rush for checkbooks. Travel and due diligence are impossible, markets are too volatile for share deals and the next few months remain an unknown quantity. Shareholders may balk. In past crises, even distressed sellers were able to command premiums, so bargains will be tough. Copper prices are still above the depths of 2016.Worse, not even the most obvious prey would be easy to snap up: Freeport and First Quantum come with traps. Freeport, the world’s largest listed copper producer, faces the question of who will lead it when veteran Richard Adkerson retires, along with concerns over older U.S. mines and the costly move underground at Grasberg. Rio, unhappy with the environmental and political risks, sold its interest in the Indonesian mine in 2018. First Quantum, more bite-sized and so perhaps more appealing, battened down the hatches earlier this year with a poison pill, after Jiangxi Copper built an 18% stake. Its flagship Cobre Panama mine has yet to  operate through a full wet season. Chinese players eyeing miners with Australian assets, meanwhile, would also have to deal with a regulator bent on discouraging opportunistic foreign bargain-hunters.Yet the longer the pandemic lockdowns drag on, the more the pain increases, as fixed costs go out and no cash comes in. It’s visible already in lithium, with Tianqi Lithium Corp. seeking to sell part of its stake in the Greenbushes operation in Australia, as it struggles to repay debt taken on to buy a stake in Chilean giant SQM. It’s rare to see large Chinese producers in distressed sales, even if lithium prices have plummeted since 2018. Rare-earth producer Lynas Corp., meanwhile, says it may need public funds to complete an ore-processing plant. Buyers won’t pounce yet. A global economic recovery isn’t in sight and will be slow; most will need a little more confidence that growth is coming back. That will mean a wider improvement than China’s stimulus and return to work, as encouraging as State Grid Corp.’s 2020 investment plans may be. They’ll also need travel restrictions to lift. Wait too long, though, and the opportunity to buy cheap will pass — again. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-04-06	2020-04-06 05:34:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Canned Food Sprees Won’t Save Aluminum	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Aluminum isn’t the worst-performing base metal this year, an honor that goes to copper. Yet that’s only because it had less far to fall: Demand was ailing well before the coronavirus forced some three billion people to stay home. Add the near-total shutdown of the world’s auto and aviation industry, crunching more than a third of demand, and the lightweight metal is fast heading for levels last seen during the global financial crisis. That should translate into some of the mining industry’s deepest cuts as the pandemic forces producers such as Alcoa Corp. and Rio Tinto Group to take long-overdue decisions.Aluminum is a serial underperformer, having racked up the biggest real losses for any base metal since 1913, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Demand has slowed for a decade, and a surplus was expected this year even before the current crisis. Prices have declined for eight consecutive weeks to below $1,500 per metric ton. That’s made most of the world’s production unprofitable.The metal has never been good at responding fast to a changing market. That’s partly because it’s inexpensive to mine the raw material bauxite. At the same time, smelters that produce aluminum metal from its oxide are slow and expensive owing to fixed costs such as power. As a result, the industry is still working through the stockpile accumulated during the last crisis. In this context, it’s less surprising that China’s aluminum production increased in the first two months of the year.The scale and speed of the demand drop caused by the coronavirus will test the industry’s elasticity. Aircraft makers are pondering production cuts, while automakers have shut down from Japan to Germany. The premium paid by Japanese buyers over the London Metal Exchange price is at its lowest in over three years. Car sales in locked-down economies have dropped by around 80%. Other sources of demand, like machinery, have been little better. While shoppers have hoarded canned food, this accounts for a small fraction of aluminum usage.Analysts at BMO LLC estimated late last month that worldwide primary aluminum demand could fall 6% in 2020 from a year earlier — similar to 2008, but larger in absolute volume terms. That’s not the steepest estimate out there, yet they suggest it already entails an unsustainable surplus of 4.2 million tons, roughly 5% of global demand. Aluminum giants cut back during the global financial crisis, and a few years later in 2015, when cheap Chinese metal flooded the market. China won’t help much to soften the blow this year, even when the full extent of Beijing’s stimulus plan is unveiled. In 2009, when consumption dropped 17% outside China, it rose 15% inside the country, according to a Boston Consulting Group report. This time, even Chinese appetite could take years to recover fully.There are some welcome signs of realism. Norsk Hydro ASA said last week it would postpone the restart of its Husnes plant. Analysts at CRU Group estimate some 365,000 tons of Chinese capacity has already been taken out. More should be on the way, even if low-cost production from the likes of China Hongqiao Group Ltd. is spared: Russian giant United Co. Rusal estimated in mid-March that at prices below 13,000 yuan ($1,830) per metric ton, more than a quarter of China’s smelters, equivalent to 10 million tons of annual capacity, were losing money. Less environmentally friendly operations will suffer disproportionately.Rio Tinto, meanwhile, had already been reviewing its Tiwai Point smelter in New Zealand and its ISAL smelter in Iceland, and now needs to think hard about the capital allocated to its least profitable division.All of those cuts and more will be needed, especially if demand weakness lingers. BMO forecasts 4.2 million tons per year of idled capacity by the third quarter, rising to 10 million tons by 2025. There are plenty of unknowns, from how long the downturn lasts to the level of demand from traders seeking to bet on stronger markets down the road. For now, absent a significant reduction to supply, it’s hard to see anything but a dim future.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-03-23	2020-03-23 08:14:29	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Metals Buckle Under Virus Double Whammy	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Lockdowns imposed to control the coronavirus have battered China’s appetite for everything from coal to copper, pushing stockpiles of raw materials higher and global prices lower. The next crunch could come from supply. The risk of an outbreak is growing in ill-prepared producer countries, with mandatory quarantines and border shutdowns threatening to choke off production.Prices of bulk commodities are already seeing some support from such disruptions, as ports and mines close. Coking coal in particular has outperformed owing in part to Mongolia’s decision in late January to seal its border with China, which cut off a key source of supply. The impact may be only short term. With factory shutdowns spreading through the U.S. and Europe, the reduction in wider metals supply would need to be dramatic to offset crumbling global demand. Upheaval could provide some price support regardless.Appetite for virtually all commodities has slumped since January, when the extent of damage from the novel coronavirus became clear. Even where mills, smelters and factories stayed open, that largely translated into crammed warehouses. China’s industrial production, investment and retail sales for the first two months of the year plunged across the board, with construction particularly weak. China’s economy is now all but certain to contract in the first quarter from a year earlier.With European automakers and other manufacturers shuttering operations, the drop in commodity demand in the first three months is likely to be even worse than during the global financial crisis. Steel demand will fall more than a fifth, copper will slide 14% and aluminum almost a third, analysts at BMO Capital Markets estimate.It hasn’t helped futures prices that the latest wave of closures is coming as we head into the second quarter, usually a peak period for demand. China, by contrast, was worse hit during the quieter Lunar New Year. Copper, a bellwether of confidence in global manufacturing, has tumbled to four-year lows of around $4,800 per metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.Travel and quarantine restrictions have already damaged supply, making it harder for miners to fly employees in and out and impeding projects under construction. Peru’s quarantine has already prompted Anglo American Plc to stop all nonessential work at its $5 billion Quellaveco project and withdraw most of the site’s 10,000 staff and contractors. Canada’s Teck Resources Ltd. has suspended work at its Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 in Chile, while Rio Tinto Group says work has slowed on its underground mine at Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia.Lockdowns may be even more severe. Copper mines are among the worst affected as Chile and Peru, the world’s top two producers, scramble to contain the virus, prompting Anglo American, Antofagasta and others to send staff home. Chilean state behemoth Codelco will work at reduced capacity for two weeks, while workers at BHP Group’s Escondida, the world’s largest copper mine, threatened action to compel the company to take more preventative steps. The miner said Saturday it would reduce the number of contractors onsite. Analysts at Bank of Nova Scotia estimate a two-week halt in operations in those two countries would amount to 325,000 tons of lost production — roughly 4% of their combined annual output. This serves to underline the geographical concentration of a handful of key materials. Lithium is produced mainly in Chile and Australia, while iron-ore exports are dominated by Australia and Brazil. The price surge after last year’s Vale SA dam disaster shows what a port closure could do to the iron-ore market, though such a move appears unlikely given the huge budget contribution that the material makes to Brazil and Australia.Many producer countries are developing economies and ill-equipped to handle an epidemic that has floored even the world’s richest nations. In Brazil, the response has been patchy at best, with some states taking measures that are increasingly at odds with the federal government. Poorly implemented lockdowns, as seen in the Philippines, could push thousands of casual workers out of cities in search of work in more remote areas — potentially extending the spread.If more drawbridges are raised, expect supplies from explosives and tires to heavy equipment to get blocked, hampering even mining operations that could otherwise keep going. In the meantime, low prices will hurt some higher-cost projects, though rock-bottom prices for oil, a significant input, will cushion the blow. This will affect smaller producers first, given the healthy balance sheets of big miners. Still, operations like Rio’s Pacific Aluminium, or pricey U.S. copper mines, look vulnerable.Demand was the first part of an unprecedented crunch for the global commodities industry. The second act is only beginning. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-03-14	2020-03-14 00:00:07	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Countdown to Zero Challenges Big Polluters	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Oil majors and big miners have been falling over themselves to promise better behavior when it comes to greenhouse gases. A significant number now say they are targeting zero emissions. Unfortunately, not everyone agrees on exactly what that means. It leaves investors clear on good intentions, but far less so on how to price transition risk, compare strategies and judge success.The real trouble sits with the widest and most significant category of emissions — those that don’t come directly from operating a well or mine, but are produced indirectly when oil, gas, iron ore or coal is burned or processed by customers. For outfits like BP Plc and BHP Group, these so-called Scope 3 emissions can add up to as much as 90% of their total footprint. They’re also far harder to control, as they aren’t produced by the reporting companies themselves.Resources giants, even poorly performing oil majors, have the scale and financial clout to manage a transition to a carbon-light economy — should they choose to. The rapid destruction of value in segments of the coal sector has left few in doubt of how quickly they could be left behind if they ignore such downstream emissions. This week's collapse in oil prices is another memento mori for carbon-intensive businesses.That doesn’t mean everyone has embraced the idea of targeting Scope 3 emissions. Rio Tinto Group, for one, has said it can’t set targets for its clients, though it will engage in as yet unspecified projects with the likes of China Baowu Steel Group Corp. BHP will produce numbers later this year. Others, like BP, have promised to eliminate Scope 3 emissions where they’ve drilled the oil, but won’t commit to doing the same if they’re only doing the refining. Spain’s Repsol SA is among the few to be promising an absolute zero target for all three sets of emissions.In this flurry of green activity, what should investors be demanding?The first thing should be transparency. Many of the biggest emitters have yet to make full Scope 3 disclosures, including such pillars of developed-market stock indexes as Exxon Mobil Corp., Anglo American Plc, and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. At this point, that decision is almost churlish: It isn’t hard for investors to do their own calculations. Those that don’t face up to the reality of decarbonization will increasingly be treated like any other business that’s careless about its medium- and long-term liabilities.A second point is comparability. Although the overwhelming majority of Scope 3 emissions for resources companies come from the processing and combustion of their products, the standard incorporates a range of other activities such as waste disposal, product distribution, and even business travel and staff commuting.To add to that complexity, companies can replace the standardized emissions factors used to produce the figures with bespoke ones if their customers operate particularly efficient plants. Without full transparency about where those savings come in, companies could reduce their footprint by leaning on overly generous assumptions, and claim credit that more rigorous competitors would miss out on.There is also the unsolved question of how to manage double-counting, when, for example, coking coal and iron ore are sold to a  producer that will use both in making steel.Investors should demand the means to measure progress, and success. Laying out ambitions for emissions 30 years hence is all but meaningless unless you’re also describing a path to get there. If investors are to take these numbers seriously, they’ll want to see plans for the steps along the way.That won’t be easy. For oil majors, it will require nothing less than a reinvention of their entire businesses, moving into industries that have historically produced lower returns than fossil fuels, as former BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley has pointed out.Mining giants that have depended on revenues from high-volume bulk commodities such as coal and iron ore will have to either push their customers to switch to new technologies such as hydrogen-reduced steel, or depend on less lucrative base metals, specialty commodities and agricultural inputs.Providing too much detail about the road ahead risks disclosing a company’s business strategy, too, or tilting the market. How much of the reductions will come, as with Glencore Plc, from allowing mines and wells to deplete naturally as their reserve base is used up? How much will depend on selling assets, such as BP’s near-20% stake in Rosneft? How much will rely on technology that exists, but is not yet used on a wide scale, like carbon capture and storage?The last point on fund manager wish lists should be consistency. Investors will benchmark talk of long-term ambitions against performance on actual, shorter-term activity.Gabriel Wilson-Otto, head of stewardship, Asia Pacific, at BNP Paribas Asset Management, suggests that will mean keeping an eye on capital spending: Projects that generate downstream emissions decades into the future should be attracting more scrutiny. Similarly, corporate lobbying will be monitored for evidence it is allowing organisations to flash up green ambitions but still campaign against action on climate.None of this should be a burden on good governance. The CDP, a nonprofit research group that pushes for greenhouse disclosure, found in 2014 that the return on investment for companies that do so was 67% higher than for those that didn’t.The winds of decarbonization are blowing through the commodities industry. Companies that don’t bend in the face of these changes will break. To contact the authors of this story: Clara Ferreira Marques at cferreirama@bloomberg.netDavid Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-03-05	2020-03-05 11:14:21	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	China to Approve Developing Guinea’s Giant Simandou Iron Ore Mine	(Bloomberg) -- China is close to giving the go-ahead for some of its biggest state-owned companies to develop the giant Simandou iron ore mine in Guinea, potentially paving the way for the project to be built after years of legal wrangling.China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, which oversees the biggest government-owned enterprises, is actively pushing forward with the project, the world’s biggest untapped iron ore deposit, according to people familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified as the talks are private.For years, it seemed the super-rich ore under a jungle-covered mountain range might never be dug up. Simandou was practically forgotten by the wider mining industry as owners including Rio Tinto Group, Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz and authorities in the West African nation fought over rights to develop it.That all changed in 2019 after Steinmetz ended a seven-year dispute with Guinea’s government that saw him relinquish claims on half of the mine. It’s now in the hands of a Guinean-led and Chinese-backed consortium that wants production to start within five years.The reemergence of Simandou has spooked executives at the top iron ore miners. Half of the project could deliver more than 100 million tons a year of the highest quality ore just as the outlook for the material sours and Chinese demand plateaus.Rio Tinto shares fell 2.2% in London, adjusted for the stock trading without the right to its latest dividend, amid broad declines among mining companies. BHP Group lost 2.5% on the same basis.Simandou is divided into four blocks, with blocks 1 and 2 controlled by a consortium backed by Chinese and Singaporean companies, while Rio Tinto Plc and Aluminum Corp. of China, known as Chinalco, own blocks 3 and 4.China is keen to help develop the deposit as it looks to secure more high-quality supplies, and also wants to expand its footprint in West Africa, according to the people. SASAC hasn’t formally approved the project, but is working out the details on how it will proceed and how the project will be funded, the people said.Chinalco will be involved in the development and SASAC is talking to other state-owned enterprises about building costly port and rail infrastructure, the people said. China Development Bank is likely to provide some of the funding and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is also being considered, the people said.Nobody immediately answered faxes or calls to SASAC, Chinalco or China Development Bank seeking comment.The cost of building a 650-kilometer (400-mile) railway stretching across Guinea has always been a roadblock for developers, with estimates reaching as high as $13 billion. With Chinese funding, the project becomes much more feasible.Chinese involvement in Simandou would create a dilemma for Rio. A rival developing the deposit would threaten the market for Rio’s most important commodity. Yet it could struggle to win shareholder support to pour billions of dollars into Guinea if it wanted to join the development.Rio Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques in January in Beijing met with SASAC’s chairman to discuss bolstering cooperation between the mining giant and China’s state-owned groups, according to a statement from SASAC.The largest iron ore exporters, including Vale SA, expect a long-term shift by China’s mills to favor higher-quality raw materials, even as growth in steel output plateaus. Using premium grade ores can allow plants to boost efficiency and comply with tougher curbs on pollution. Simandou’s ores contain 65% to 66% iron, above the industry’s benchmark 62% iron content products, according to Rio filings.(Updates with shares in sixth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from David Stringer, Sarah Chen and Alfred Cang.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.net;Steven Yang in Beijing at kyang74@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Nicholas Larkin, Liezel HillFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-plans-approve-developing-giant-035839110.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-03-05	2020-03-05 09:18:22	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	China Gives Global Miners an African Headache	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China is poised to let some of its biggest state-owned entities help develop a giant West African iron-ore deposit that’s been tantalizingly promising and painfully problematic for two decades. Whatever happens next, this watershed moment for the steelmaking commodity is bad news for big producers, particularly Rio Tinto Group.The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission is actively pushing forward with the Simandou mine in Guinea, Bloomberg News reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. The project may cost more than $20 billion.Simandou, tucked away in the south of Guinea, has near-mythical status in the industry, having been coveted by everyone from Ivan Glasenberg of Glencore Plc to Andrew Forrest of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. and the late Roger Agnelli, former head of Vale SA. After 2007 and 2008, when Rio Tinto used Simandou’s promise to ward off BHP Group’s advances, it was heralded as the project that would open up a new, high-quality iron ore frontier in West Africa to rival Australia’s Pilbara. Instead, it’s been caught in years of expropriation rows, corruption investigations and political disputes. Not a ton has been dug up.A lot is still unclear about what Beijing’s blessing would mean in practice for the deposit, divided into four blocks. The first two were handed last year to SMB-Winning, a consortium backed by Chinese and Singaporean companies, while blocks 3 and 4 are held by Rio Tinto and Aluminum Corp. of China, known as Chinalco. In all likelihood, it will involve financing and practical support for the project’s logistics, the lion’s share of the total cost because of its complexity: 650 kilometers (404 miles) of railway, plus tunnels, roads and a port.Approval would be a significant bet on iron ore, and in some ways, a surprising one. Simandou is at least five or six years away from producing anything. It will miss the bulk of China’s latest infrastructure splurge and could well collide with slowing steel demand. Indeed, in 2018, Chinalco passed on the opportunity to buy Rio’s stake.Two years is a long time in commodities markets, though. China, squeezed by the trade war, has put the focus back on self-reliance for key commodities, and even half of Simandou’s deposit could deliver more than 100 million metric tons a year of high-quality ore, roughly 10% of Beijing’s annual imports. That would help buffer China against events such as a supply squeeze in 2019 caused by a disaster at a Vale dam in Brazil, which drove up iron-ore prices. For China, whose seaborne imports total more than 1 billion tons a year, that output crunch may have added roughly $20 billion or more of extra expenses, not far off the cost of Guinean infrastructure.All of this is a headache for the handful of miners that dominate iron ore production, none more so than Rio. It isn’t as if Pilbara will cease to be profitable. Brazil, with higher freight costs, looks more vulnerable on that front.But China’s newfound enthusiasm for Guinea, if confirmed, leaves Rio in an unwelcome quandary: It can’t ignore a project that could flood the market, especially with the high-quality ore that steel producers increasingly favor. Joining in might give it some control over timing, and the ability to blend Simandou ore with its existing output. Yet it will struggle to convince investors, who can see the miner’s technical and political struggles in Mongolia, and recall that it is still involved in an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice over corruption allegations in Guinea.Then there's the risk that enthusiasm for West Africa could help secure funding for smaller projects, or prompt those already looking at the region, like Fortescue, to invest in destructive volumes.Simandou is still years away at best, and its complex logistics have defeated earlier pretenders. Yet China’s track record in digging up Guinean bauxite suggests it can be done. If nothing else, Beijing has sounded an iron ore warning.  To contact the author of this story: Clara Ferreira Marques at cferreirama@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

That after hundreds of new cases were reported worldwide, and U.S. authorities said a pandemic was now inevitable.  After sharp falls for Asian stocks, European markets also tanked.  Benchmark indexes were all down over 1% in early trade, before recovering a little ground.  The regional Stoxx 600 approached a four-month low.  A slew of corporate warnings about the virus didn't help the mood.  Among the big names: Diageo says the outbreak will snip up to $260 million off profits this year.  Its shares fell as much as 3%.  Food group Danone also cut its sales forecast for the year, estimating the hit at over $100 million.  And miner Rio Tinto reported its best earnings since 2011, but warned that the coronavirus could make the next six months a challenge.  Luxury brand Hermes was one of the few to strike a positive note.  It said it saw signs of a return to normal trading in China.  Just four of its stores there are now shut, down from 15 earlier in the year.  But its shares still sank over 1%.  Investors, it seems, are focused on the negatives.  Wednesday morning saw traditional safe havens all rise.

2020-02-26	2020-02-26 09:52:46	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio CEO Says World Must Sacrifice Growth to Meet Climate Goals	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group’s chief executive officer said the world must be prepared to sacrifice growth to achieve climate goals as the natural resources industry comes under increasing pressure to curb emissions.“The challenge for the world, and for the resources industry, is to continue the focus on poverty reduction and wealth creation, while delivering climate action,” Jean-Sebastien Jacques told investors on Wednesday. “This will require complex trade-offs.”Jacques said consumers, governments and shareholders must all be willing to make sacrifices -- in the form of lower consumption, growth and returns -- if climate targets are to be met. The mining industry, a key pillar of growth in many developing countries, is facing investor demands to cut the scale of emissions created by its products, from thermal coal to iron ore.“There are no easy answers,” Jacques said. “There is no clear pathway right now for the world to get to net zero emissions by 2050. The ambition is clear but the pathway is not.”Earlier, Rio reiterated its position on refusing to set any targets for reducing the carbon emissions generated by its customers, taking a firm stance on an issue that’s quickly dividing the natural resources industry.Instead, the world’s No. 2 mining company put the focus on its own operations. In a presentation on Wednesday accompanying its full-year earnings, Rio said its own business will be carbon neutral by 2050 and promised to spend $1 billion over the next five years to make that happen.The announcement draws a sharp line between Rio and other extraction companies amid a debate about who bears responsibility for Scope 3 emissions -- the pollution created when customers burn or process a company’s raw materials. The producer can take a different approach on addressing Scope 3 emissions because it sold off coal mines and doesn’t have oil assets, according to Jacques.“People are totally mixing drinks, because Scope 3 for a company like Shell and for a company like Rio Tinto is completely different,” Jacques said. “I’m not selling coal, I’m not selling carbon, and I’m not selling oil and gas -- and therefore we’re not starting from the same point.”Still, Rio has huge iron ore operations that create the vital ingredient for steelmaking, a highly polluting industry that involves adding coking coal to make carbon steel. It was a surge in iron ore prices last year that helped Rio post an 18% increase in underlying earnings to the highest since 2011.Rio argues any targets on its Scope 3 emissions would be impossible to meet because it has no control over how steelmakers use iron ore.It’s a stance that sets Rio at odds with its biggest rival, BHP Group, which has urged the industry to take responsibility. Both BHP and Vale SA have promised to introduce targets on Scope 3 emissions. In the oil industry, BP Plc has vowed to cut almost all its customer emissions by 2050.Yet, no one is providing much detail about their plans and the deadlines are usually decades away.While Rio’s refusal to set targets may draw the ire of some investors who have been pushing for concrete plans, the company may find support elsewhere. Last week, the CEO of Glencore Plc, the biggest coal shipper, criticized BP’s announcement.“2050 is a long way to go, and we don’t want to come out with wishy-washy ideas,” said Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg. Instead, Glencore said its Scope 3 emissions would fall as coal mines are depleted.Rio has previously said it will work with China’s top steel producer, China Baowu Steel Group, to find methods to lower the sector’s emissions and improve its environmental performance.On Wednesday, the company also said that any future growth projects between now and 2030 would also have to be carbon neutral. It plans to expand the electrification of equipment and use more renewable energy.To contact the reporters on this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.net;David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Dylan Griffiths, Nicholas LarkinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-rejects-setting-targets-064704508.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-02-26	2020-02-26 09:21:13	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Tinto Is Digging Mostly Into Its Pocket	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A combination of hefty dividends and contracting output is turning the world’s second-largest miner into the poster child for a $1.5 trillion industry’s growth quandary.Rio Tinto Group announced a record $3.7 billion final dividend Wednesday, adding to $11.9 billion of cash returns already paid in 2019. Yet it produced less iron ore, copper and aluminum, leaving market prices to lift underlying earnings by 18%. Rio’s Pilbara operations stumbled early in the year. Its Mongolian copper mine, a key source of future production and the basis of a greener portfolio, is now not only sorely overdue and over-budget, but also tangled in international tax arbitration. The $86 billion mining giant isn’t alone. High dividend yields and pedestrian output have begun to define resources heavyweights that used to be known for the exact opposite. Diversified groups relied on their varied sources of cash to expand, but large-scale opportunities are scarcer than ever, and portfolios look far less diverse too, once coal and other less appealing assets have been carved off. At Rio, iron ore now accounts for three-quarters of its underlying Ebitda.For investors, it hasn’t been all bad news. Since Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques took the helm in 2016, Rio’s total return including reinvested dividends adds up to an impressive 112%, outpacing most rivals.Yet much of that is due to generous payouts. For a company that digs stuff up for a living, this may not be sustainable — especially for one that aims to build a portfolio better aligned with a carbon-light global economy. It may also be an indication of just how hard it is to change. Rio paid shareholders in 2019 more than double its capital expenditure budget for the same year.One priority has been copper. Under Jacques, head of that unit until he became CEO, Rio has said it wants to add more of the red metal as its existing mines age, and will look at other green ingredients, those for rechargeable batteries and the like. Yet a unit set up to consider just such deals hasn’t sealed a single one despite considering more than 200 opportunities, and the company has suffered blow after blow in Mongolia. Its Oyu Tolgoi mine in the South Gobi accounts for only a fraction of Rio’s value today, but could dictate the company’s fortunes. So far, it’s mostly an unhelpful headache. The mine, which Rio holds through Canada-listed Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd., is one of the largest copper deposits around, and could produce an annual 550,000 metric tons of copper, almost as much as Rio produced last year, plus 450,000 ounces of gold. In the parlance of big miners, it moves the needle.Unfortunately, it also encapsulates everything that makes such projects so challenging: tough geography, messy local politics and complex geology. The cost of the largest, underground, portion has swelled to as much as $7.2 billion, and could rise again when a final estimate is published later in 2020. First production may now be be 30 months later than predicted. Fears of a cash call have dragged down Turquoise Hill shares.In the latest development, Rio announced last week it would begin arbitration proceedings to solve a tax dispute. Few arbitration deals yield significant victories —  ask Barrick Gold Corp. and Antofagasta Plc, which won a $5.8 billion ruling against Pakistan last year — and  they tend to irk host governments, so it’s a worrying sign. The risk is that Oyu Tolgoi becomes Rio Tinto’s own version of Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s Indonesian pride and joy, Grasberg – wonderful in theory, nearly impossible in practice.Rio won’t drop Mongolia, and not just because of Jacques’ own attachment to the project. A copper option, however long-dated, is valuable, even if the company doesn’t yet jump in to buy out Turquoise Hill minority shareholders.But what then? Rio has manageable debt and ample cash — $9.2 billion in free cash flow in 2019, the highest level in almost a decade — and deals look cheaper as shares in copper-heavy Freeport and First Quantum Minerals Ltd. have roughly halved since 2018. Perhaps, though, not cheap enough to warrant wrestling with Freeport’s U.S. liabilities or First Quantum’s Zambian operations.Rio isn’t shrinking quite yet. It has exploration projects, and iron-ore production already did better in the second half, albeit still short of the company’s ultimate target. Yet with Oyu Tolgoi mired in arbitration and geological complexities, and the economy swiftly shifting, it might be time for Rio to consider just how creative it can get.To contact the author of this story: Clara Ferreira Marques at cferreirama@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-02-26	2020-02-26 06:39:42	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Mining Giant Rio Tinto Flags Virus Uncertainty Threat	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group warned the coronavirus outbreak could “create significant uncertainty” in the short-term as it Wednesday reported a windfall from iron ore’s price surge in 2019 that spurred profits to an eight-year high.The No. 2 miner is seeking to both reward investors and fund new growth, even as rivals like Anglo American Plc cut back on returns to pivot more decisively to M&A and project spending. Rio paid out a total of $7.2 billion in full-year dividends, compared to 2019 capital expenditure of $5.5 billion.Key InsightsRio, which wins about half of its revenue from China, said all “operations are looking at opportunities to adjust to the impact of the COVID-19 virus on market conditions,” according to a statement. The Oyu Tolgoi copper operation in Mongolia earlier flagged it was experiencing a slowdown in exports to China.The company will “adjust production levels and product mix to meet customer requirements,” if the global growth outlook worsens, and teams in Singapore and Shanghai are closely monitoring the impacts of coronavirus on China.Rio aims to make its own operations carbon neutral by 2050 and pledged to spend $1 billion on the plans over the next five years. However, Rio won’t set targets for pollution caused by customers using its products, known as scope 3 emissions. That sets the producer at odds with peers like BHP Group, and BP Plc.To read more on the debate on Scope 3 emissions, click hereThe producer said it had “benefited from robust demand” for higher quality iron ore and from supply constraints in the export market last year. The company this month cut guidance on annual shipments to between 324 million and 334 million tons amid damage to infrastructure caused by a cyclone. That raises the prospect of Rio’s shipments falling for a second straight year.Rio will target first production at the Winu copper project in Western Australia in 2023, the company said.Market ReactionRio’s Sydney-traded shares have declined 2.8% in the past year, as BHP has fallen 5.3%.

2020-02-24	2020-02-24 02:28:28	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Markets Are Waking Up to the Virus Reality	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Sharp falls in Asian markets and U.S. stock futures Monday suggest investors are starting to catch up to the disconnect between the coronavirus’s widening impact and hopes of a V-shaped recovery.It’s a gap that has been particularly visible in metals. China, where much of the economy remains in lockdown, accounts for about half the world’s appetite for materials from iron ore to copper. That makes the sector highly vulnerable to a coronavirus-induced slowdown, and a helpful gauge of how well the reality of economic activity is being reflected in financial markets. The answer? Not enough.While some larger mills and smelters are working, disrupted transport and absent workers mean physical demand is in the doldrums. Domestic inventories of everything from steel to copper are high. Bloomberg Economics calculated last week that the world’s second-largest economy was running at 50-60% of capacity in the week ended Feb. 21. That is better than the week before and could well improve over the coming days. Still, it’s a level that seems hard to square with the way shares in miners such as BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group and others have been trading.Almost all major mining stocks bounced back after February lows, with BHP and peers falling below that only on Monday. They remain well above their troughs last year, when concerns over the U.S-China trade war rattled the market. Even copper futures on the London Metal Exchange, a reflection of confidence in the global economy rather than just physical demand, have rebounded.It’s not that investors are brushing off risk. There’s evidence of nervousness to be found in haven assets like gold, which last week broke through $1,600 an ounce. Yields on long-dated U.S. Treasuries have tumbled. More pessimistic commentary is also emerging from company executives.Investors appear to have been betting on three things. First, that the virus will be contained in the coming weeks. Second, that Beijing will unleash hefty fiscal and monetary stimulus. Finally, that demand impacted by the virus will be deferred, and not simply lost. Unfortunately, none of these things is certain. For metals and the resilient equity valuations of their producers, the coming days will be critical, as it becomes clear just how many workers emerge from quarantine and how much the Chinese government’s push to restart production is paying off. So far, the number of people on any form of transport is still a fraction of where it was a year ago, according to Bloomberg Economics.There are risks even if people do return. It’s much harder for face masks and hand sanitizer to offer protection in construction projects, which may well push back the start of the spring season, hurting steel and ingredients like iron ore. Domestic prices for steel used in manufacturing and building are still at their lowest in almost three years. BHP, which expects Chinese real GDP growth of around 6% for 2020, said last week that it would revise its forecasts lower if construction and manufacturing don’t return to normal in April.So how does that square with what equity investors are pricing in? The hope for a hefty stimulus from Beijing, which underpins much of the equity market’s buoyancy for miners and beyond, seems broadly to match what China has already said and done. There is already monetary easing and other forms of support, from help with social security payments for small companies to busing in workers in some provinces. But it’s still unclear what shape the bulk of the fiscal stimulus will take and how heavy it can be in sectors such as property, where the government remains wary of bubbles. China is also well aware that splurging on debt to get the economy moving will mean pain in the not-too-distant future. That creates plenty of uncertainty.The other two assumptions are even more problematic.Whether China can contain the virus will be hard to tell for some time, not least given Beijing’s changes to the way cases are reported. It’s unclear what will happen once sealed-off areas begin to open, given epidemics can have more than one peak. Mass quarantines at this scale are also untested in the age of supply chains. Assuming everything bounces back swiftly is optimistic. The emergence of substantial clusters outside Hubei and indeed beyond China — in South Korea, Iran and Italy — is worrying.Then there’s demand for everything from washing machines to takeaway coffee and bigger-ticket items like cars, where sales have dropped 92% in the first half of February. It’s unclear how much will be pushed back. The underlying economic uncertainty is greater than during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, when growth rebounded quickly.That all makes mining stocks and the wider equity markets look a little lofty. During SARS, Hong Kong’s market fell almost a third from its 2002 high to the trough of 2003. This time, the Hang Seng Index, admittedly with different components, is down just 6% from its pre-virus 2020 high, as of Friday. It may all blow over. For now, the risks are to the downside. To contact the author of this story: Clara Ferreira Marques at cferreirama@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-02-21	2020-02-21 12:31:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	How an Iron-Ore Billionaire Escapes ESG Scrutiny	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Australia’s richest man Andrew Forrest cherishes his reputation as one of the good guys. That makes his intimate involvement in one of the world’s most polluting industries a problem.The founder of the world’s fourth-biggest iron-ore miner Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. has done spectacularly well from riding the Chinese steel boom of the past two decades. Net income at Fortescue increased nearly fourfold to $2.45 billion in the first half of the year, the company said Wednesday, delivering A$828 million ($554 million) of interim dividends to Forrest and Minderoo Group Pty., which he controls. The financial bonanza has been blessedly free of the scrutiny that ESG-focused investors such as BlackRock Inc. and Norges Bank Investment Management have devoted to thermal coal in recent months.That's rather remarkable. For all the attention on thermal coal, producing a metric ton of steel in a blast furnace releases almost as much carbon as burning a ton of coal for energy. Globally, the steel industry accounts for about 2.8 billion metric tons of annual emissions, compared to 10.1 billion tons for thermal coal. The world’s major iron ore producers are responsible for some of the largest volumes of end-use emissions globally, equivalent to those of the very biggest independent oil companies.While Fortescue doesn’t disclose such Scope 3 emissions (unusual for a company that values its reputation for responsible business practices), a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests it accounts for around 250 million tons of carbon pollution each year. That puts the company somewhere between Rosneft Oil Co. and Glencore Plc. The 35% stake held by Forrest and Minderoo equates to annual emissions similar to those from the entire country of Bangladesh.How have steelmakers and iron miners evaded the attention of climate-focused investors? A large part of the explanation may be the perception that there’s no alternative to carbon-intensive blast furnaces to provide the world’s steel needs, rendering measures to reduce this emissions burden futile. That’s increasingly not the case, though. Electric arc furnaces making recycled metal from scrap have swept through the U.S. steel industry in recent decades to push dirtier blast furnaces aside. The same technology can be adapted to make non-recycled steel, too, and using hydrogen to burn off the oxygen from iron ore can potentially almost entirely decarbonize the steelmaking process.Swedish steelmaker SSAB AB this month announced plans with miner LKAB AB and utility Vattenfall AB to develop just such a fossil-free steel plant. While the product would cost 20% to 30% more than traditional blast furnace steel, it would be competitive at a carbon price of 40 euros ($43) to 60 euros a metric ton, according to a 2018 study — not that much more than current prices of around 25 euros in Europe’s carbon market. That would look still more attractive if falling prices for renewable electricity and hydrogen, plus wider deployment of electric furnaces, further drove down costs.Forrest is in a unique situation to push miners, steelmakers and governments to accelerate this transition. Unlike the boards and management of BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group and Vale SA, he’s the founder and chairman of his company and has a dominant shareholding.Forrest has made similar stands in the past. When he found at least 12 suppliers employing forced labor — an obvious conflict with his campaign against modern slavery — he promised to drum them out of business if they didn’t change.To date, that same principled approach hasn’t extended to the role that Fortescue and its customers play in climate change. Despite donating A$70 million to aid recovery from the bushfires which have swept Australia in recent months, he’s vacillated between citing the role of global warming in the disaster, repeating bogus claims that arson played the “biggest part” in the fires, and making questionable arguments around reducing forest litter.Pressed repeatedly in an interview with CNN last month to clarify what more he could be doing, he denied, implausibly, that the mining industry had “lobbied hard” against climate policies and said that “the science has to be done” on how to mitigate the fires. In a subsequent article for the Sydney Morning Herald, Forrest said that climate change is real and is intensifying natural disasters.Fortescue is unusually well-placed to benefit from any shift in the steelmaking industry toward a lower-carbon route. The big loser from a move away from blast furnaces would be coking coal — but unlike BHP and Vale, Fortescue doesn’t produce any. Its iron ore is of lower quality than its larger competitors, so would have most to gain from being upgraded to the iron briquettes that would be consumed by electric primary steel mills. Forrest has invested A$20 million to develop hydrogen export capacity for Australia. Using that gas for upgrading ore would represent a much better use of the technology.The risk for iron ore miners like Fortescue is that they’re betting everything on the odds that blast furnaces continue to dominate global steel production. With demand approaching a plateau, a glut of Chinese scrap looming, and rising attention on industrial carbon emissions, that’s no longer such a sure thing. A decade ago, miners were similarly full of confidence that wind and solar power could never supplant the role of thermal coal in electricity generation. How did that prediction turn out? (Corrects the second paragraph of column first published Feb. 19 to show that Minderoo Group Pty. is the entity that receives dividends; clarifies Forrest’s position on climate change in the 12th paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

That laudable result was fueled by iron ore, a steelmaking ingredient. BHP Group’s promised climate targets remain a work in progress. It’s a striking contrast with BP Plc’s Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney, who started in the top job this month with a green splash. BHP would do well to seize the initiative as details unfold in the critical months ahead.Looney and Henry are, in a way, brothers in arms. Both are company veterans, at the top of $120 billion-plus resources heavyweights. Both took over this year from chief executives who came in to tackle crises, and start in a better financial position than their predecessors. Both are trying to juggle competing demands for stable production, generous payouts and the need to prepare for a carbon-light future. For both, that’s how success will be measured.The bar is low in the resources industry, which has long avoided tackling its responsibilities for the grim reality of a warmer climate. In that context, BHP and BP are both ahead of the pack. Melbourne-based BHP said last year it would hit net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 for its own operations, and announced it would begin to tackle carbon produced by its customers. It had already said 2022 emissions from its mines and wells would be at or below 2017 levels. Plus, the Australian company plans to tie executive compensation more closely to climate goals. London-based BP, meanwhile, has set net-zero targets by 2050 for a wider set of emissions, partly encompassing its supply chain. Only Spain’s Repsol SA, far smaller, has been more ambitious.Lofty vision is the easy bit. Assuming they stay in place as long as their predecessors, Henry and Looney will preside over a decade that will determine the success or failure of efforts to address climate change. They, and their companies’ stock valuations, will stand apart if their efforts help investors price risk appropriately, and shed light on the future shape of the companies. Details matter more than early headlines. That means clear, measurable targets for all categories of emissions. It means a plan for fossil fuel-heavy portfolios. It means a commitment to justify spending decisions with green goals in mind, as BP and Glencore Plc have agreed to do. It’s a gargantuan challenge. First, because investors want everything: bumper earnings, hefty dividends and a future-proof business. That may not be possible. BHP’s interim figure Tuesday already disappointed some.Then, consider much of the environmental damage is done beyond the mine gate, and is therefore harder to control. For BP, those wider emissions amount to just under 90% of the total. For BHP, it’s even worse: For the 2019 financial year, it said the processing of non-fossil fuel commodities added as much as 305 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, and fossil fuel use added up to 233 million. There’s some double counting here, so the figures can’t be combined, but Australia’s total, for comparison, was just under 540 million metric tons for the year through March 2019.That means credible efforts to turn BHP’s operations greener, like the use of electric cars at its Olympic Dam project in Australia or the move to renewable energy at the Escondida copper mine in Chile. While welcome, such moves aren’t sufficient. The same goes for a $400 million, five-year climate investment program.The task over the coming months will be to come up with with measurable ambitions for the short, medium and long term, for both operational emissions and beyond. Those will need to link back to remuneration packages that also tie executives in for longer.In tandem, Henry will have to tackle BHP’s portfolio. The former head of BHP’s Minerals Australia arm said Tuesday that he wanted more options in “future facing” metals, specifically copper and nickel, used in wind turbines, solar power and rechargeable batteries. That’s encouraging, but competition is tough and scale may be smaller than the miner would prefer. Henry will also have to make a decision on the company’s Jansen potash project in the coming months.The remaining assets are a pricklier problem, including the future of oil and coal. BHP has lagged behind rivals like Rio Tinto Group, which sold its last thermal coal mine in 2018. Buyers for its thermal assets, including Mount Arthur Coal and a third of Cerrejon in Colombia, are proving scarce. It may not want to make the same mistake with metallurgical coal, even if for now margins are sounder, and substitution is difficult.All of this needs to be done against a challenging background for the commodities industry, buffeted by the coronavirus epidemic sweeping China, the world’s biggest importer of coal, iron ore and oil. BHP, with a lucrative copper business and a healthy balance sheet, has options. Henry can afford to be bold. To contact the author of this story: Clara Ferreira Marques at cferreirama@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-02-12	2020-02-12 10:00:09	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Iron Ore’s Brazilian Rain Dance Looks Premature	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Good news has been in short supply for iron-ore markets since China began shuttering swathes of the economy to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Prices gained after Vale SA offered a thin salve Tuesday, saying first-quarter output will be lower than previously anticipated because of heavy rains in Brazil. The market may be cheering a little too soon.Iron-ore supply was supposed to return to normal this year, after 2019 was marked by disruptions including a fatal accident at one of Vale’s dams and a tropical cyclone in Australia. The Brazilian heavyweight and Rio Tinto Group, which vie to be the world’s biggest shipper of the steelmaking ingredient, both plan to increase production. The prospect of higher supply was reflected in Australia’s quarterly forecasts, published in December, which saw prices easing to $60 per metric ton by 2021 — more than a fifth below 2019’s elevated average.The coronavirus epidemic has accelerated that trend by slashing demand in the world’s largest consumer of iron ore, pushing prices in Singapore below $80 by early February.The picture isn’t encouraging. China’s return to work is proving gradual, even with official encouragement. Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, accounts for about 2% of Chinese steel production, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Some mills are working, but downstream demand has been hit across the country. Iron-ore stockpiles are building at China’s ports. Inventories of rebar, a benchmark for steel used in building work, stand at their highest level for early February since 2012. Carmakers also expect a production and sales hit: About 70% of dealers polled by the local industry association said earlier this week they had seen almost no customers since the end of January. Worse, the country’s role in global supply chains means there will be ripples.All of this will still be fine in the long run if two things happen next: first, if supply eases alongside demand; second,  if China regains its appetite fast, perhaps aided by stimulus.The trouble for the market is that the current iron-ore price appears to have built in both assumptions. Optimism around the incremental number of virus cases, combined with Vale’s outlook, means Singapore futures are now down about 9% from when the epidemic began to look serious in mid-January. Domestic futures on the Dalian exchange have risen for two consecutive days, alongside stocks in steelmakers, cement companies and developers, encouraged by comments from President Xi Jinping.The output picture does offer some hope. There is consolation in Vale’s rain-hit first quarter, and indeed minor disruption around Cyclone Damien in Australia. Vale’s full-year output target of 355 million tons involves assumptions around permits that could yet see delays. Yet Rio Tinto, BHP Group and others expect higher output in 2020. Chinese production may also be less sensitive to weaker prices than it once was, ticking higher despite the virus.Demand is  harder to forecast. There will be fits and starts, and the long incubation period for the novel coronavirus makes its path far harder to predict outside Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei. Supply chains will take months to repair even if the virus is contained.The biggest unknown is the shape of China’s post-virus stimulus. Undoubtedly, it will lean on infrastructure, but that will take time to feed through. And don’t expect a repeat of the swift post-SARS recovery — in 2003, China was on an expansion path. That was also the case during the global financial crisis, when China splurged the equivalent of $586 billion on bridges and the like.China in 2020 has to weigh the need to crank up growth, with the end of its current five year plan looming, against the risks of causing a further buildup of debt and creating property bubbles. Infrastructure and construction, which traditionally account for most of China’s steel and iron ore consumption, may benefit far less than in past crises. Much will become clear after the legislature’s annual meeting in March (assuming it goes ahead on schedule). A sugar rush may well be on the way; it just may not be sweet enough. To contact the author of this story: Clara Ferreira Marques at cferreirama@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

Another case at nearby Clifford Centre, in the heart of the central business district, is an employee of United Industrial Corp, according to an advisory to tenants in the building where UIC is located.The affected premises in both buildings have been disinfected and all tenants informed, the property managers said in the notices dated Feb. 9.Singapore last week raised its disease response level to the same grade used during the SARS epidemic, as it braced for what Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said was a “major test for our nation.”There are 45 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Singapore -- the largest number of infections outside China, excluding a quarantined cruise ship in Japan. Of the total, 23 cases are locally transmitted infections, according to the city-state’s health ministry. Seven people have fully recovered from the infection and been discharged from hospital, while seven are in critical condition.The city-state has cautioned residents to avoid shaking hands in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. Panic buying had sparked a run on toilet paper, rice and instant noodles in stores, echoing scenes of long lines and bare shelves seen last week in Hong Kong and mainland China. Government officials warned against hoarding supplies, while the Monetary Authority of Singapore told banks to be prepared for an increased demand in cash withdrawals.Read how virus fallout from Singapore conference spreads across EuropeBusiness Continuity PlansStandard Chartered Plc is the anchor tenant at Tower 1, leasing the lion’s share of the 33-story building that has 620,000 square feet.

2020-02-04	2020-02-04 05:00:11	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	The Race Is On for Iron Ore Riches Buried Under an African Jungle	(Bloomberg) -- For years, the massive iron deposits under Guinea’s mountainous jungle were practically forgotten by the mining industry. Caught up in wrangles between owners and authorities in the West African nation, it seemed the super-rich ore might never be dug up. That all changed last year, as investors from billionaire promoter Robert Friedland to legendary dealmaker Mick Davis converged on the country in a modern day resource rush. For the first time in years, projects like Simandou—Guinea’s crown jewel deposit—might finally be developed.That would have huge implications for both Guinea, which is facing political upheaval as President Alpha Conde pushes for a third term, and the global iron ore industry. The new tons threaten to arrive just as steel demand is cooling, and the high-quality iron ore buried in Guinea will pile pressure on existing miners.Here’s a run-down on the biggest names circling Guinea’s iron ore riches: The Bauxite Tycoon:  Fadi WazniThe story: Wazni is chairman of the SMB-Winning consortium, a group that’s rapidly developed a bauxite mining business in Guinea in just half a decade. It’s won the right to develop parts of Simandou, but it will require a lot of money to make it happen.The plan: The group plans to eventually mine 100 million tons a year—making Guinea the world’s third-biggest iron ore shipper, behind just Australia and Brazil. The plan will require spending of $14 billion.The catch: An initial $8 billion project, including a 650-kilometer railway stretching across the country, still needs to be financed. Nonetheless, Wazni says the company plans to start work on the rail as soon as April and is in talks with partners for funding. “The SMB consortium have transformed the bauxite market in a matter of two years,” said Tyler Broda, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “This is a big deal. This is something that can significantly change the dynamic for iron ore.”The Mining Legend: Mick DavisThe story: The former Xstrata CEO was one of mining’s most successful operators and dealmakers, but struggled to re-establish himself since selling to Glencore Plc. The plan: Davis’s Niron Metals is studying development of the Zogota iron ore mine, a smaller project that could produce about 20 million tons a year. An assessment of the mine’s economic viability is expected to be completed soon.The sweetener: Davis has already agreed on an export route through Liberia with both governments.“Mick’s involvement rang a bell,” said Marcos Camhis, whose private equity fund owns 25% of Niron. “This market is now open, serious people are looking at it again.”The Billionaire Promoter: Robert FriedlandThe story: Friedland has been involved in some of the biggest mining discoveries in the past three decades. In September, Friedland’s High Power Exploration Inc. won rights to develop the Nimba deposit. The plan: HPX plans to build a “starter” mine of 1 million to 5 million tons per year as quickly as possible, while feasibility studies are being completed for an expanded operation of at least 20 million tons annually.“Mr. Friedland certainly has the track record and reputation to garner investment interest,” said Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum. “But this will certainly be a stretch.”The Miner: Rio TintoThe story: Rio Tinto owns the other half of Simandou not controlled by SMB. The latest: Rio has begun looking at new ways to develop the mine, with a focus on options to export ore out of the country. Wazni says he’s had talks with Rio and sees it as a natural customer for his rail line.The dilemma: The SMB plans pose a challenge for Rio. A rival developing the deposit will threaten its position as one of the largest producers. Yet shareholders are unlikely to welcome any plans to pour billions of dollars into Guinea. “Rio is completely in a dilemma,” said RBC’s Broda. “It doesn’t make sense for them to put more tons into the market just to protect their market share.”To contact the author of this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Liezel HillFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/race-iron-ore-riches-buried-050011714.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-01-29	2020-01-29 07:00:16	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	The Big Dirty Secret of the World's Biggest Companies	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Lots of companies talk a good game about cutting planet-heating greenhouse emissions but their disclosures and targets have tended to focus on the emissions over which they have direct control and which are easiest to measure. That’s fine in an industry such as cement, where the bulk of carbon pollution occurs during the production process. From an environmental perspective these direct, or “Scope 1,” emissions are the main problem caused by these particular companies.But the approach falls down in companies working in oil, mining, carmaking, finance, and even fashion, because oftentimes most of their carbon footprint is contained in the products they sell or help finance — not their own operations.An oil giant can boast all it likes about how it’s reduced gas flaring; if car drivers are still filling up with its gasoline, the planet will keep getting hotter. The same goes for an iron ore producer that touts how its mining trucks are incredibly fuel efficient but whose main product is the basis for steel production. Luxury goods suppliers may run the greenest workshops imaginable, but use fabrics and materials that are deeply damaging to the planet.In the past, so-called “Scope 3” emissions — the pollution contained in products sold to customers or in goods and services purchased from suppliers — either weren’t calculated or were seen as someone else’s problem. Thanks to pressure from institutional investors and activists, plus leadership from a few enlightened chief executives, corporate attitudes about this subject are evolving fast. “Scope 3 is the elephant in the room,” Mark van Baal of investor advocacy group Follow This told the Norwegian oil major Equinor ASA’s annual meeting last year.The new impetus is welcome because unless companies try to reduce the environmental damage of their products and purchasing decisions, efforts to limit catastrophic climate change will fail. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last week the bosses of some of the world’s biggest oil producers debated setting targets for Scope 3 emissions, which typically make up about 90% of their carbon footprint. BP Plc’s new boss Bernard Looney is poised to abandon his predecessor Bob Dudley’s opposition to targeting customer emissions, according to Reuters. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Repsol SA and Total SA have already set Scope 3 targets.In mining, Rio Tinto Plc argued it had “very limited control” over customer emissions but later bowed to pressure by promising to work with its customer (and China’s top steel producer) Baowu Steel Group on lowering the steel sector’s emissions. BHP Group Ltd. and Vale SA have gone further by promising to set goals for Scope 3 emissions. In BHP’s cases these are almost 40 times greater than its direct pollution.The European Union’s new guidelines on climate reporting also recommend that large companies disclose customer and supplier emissions. Banks and insurers, whose direct emissions are typically pretty negligible, should focus on their counterparties’ emissions, the guidelines say. Unfortunately, this is not yet legally binding.Reluctance to target this stuff is hardly surprising because the numbers can be huge. Volkswagen AG acknowledged last year that its vehicles are responsible for about 2% of all the CO2 produced by humans.(3)Among the largest Scope 3 polluters are companies that the public probably don’t immediately think of as big climate sinners. It’s no surprise that Shell and Petrobras make the list, but I hadn’t thought about Cummins Inc., which sells truck engines and industrial power generators, Nexans SA, whose cables transport electricity and data, and Daikin Industries Ltd, which builds air-conditioning units.I’m not knocking these companies; at least they’re disclosing these emissions and some are setting targets to reduce them. Cummins plans to reduce absolute lifetime emissions from newly sold products by 25% by 2030, for example.Calculating the emissions from sold products is a pretty complicated exercise too. ThyssenKrupp AG’s massive Scope 3 emissions include those contained in the steel in the cars we drive around, the cement plants its factory construction unit helped build and the elevators in office buildings. Daikin has to consider the probable lifespan of its air conditioners, their energy consumption and what kind of electricity they’re powered by, plus probable leakage rates of planet-heating refrigerants.Fortunately there’s no shortage of organizations and methodologies to help compile these data. (Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg News and its parent Bloomberg LP, chairs the FSB Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures).Regrettably, not all large manufacturers have seen the light through the smoke. The copious sustainability reports of some companies still don’t spell out the total emissions of the products they sell. Volvo AB told me there’s no globally harmonized standard on how to calculate and disclose Co2 from heavy duty trucks, but that it’s evaluating opportunities to report on this in future. Daimler AG, which wants a completely CO2 neutral truck fleet in key markets by 2039, plans to start disclosing Scope 3 emissions for trucks in its next sustainability report.(1) You know something’s up when it takes a hedge fund to tell a company to clean up its act. The shortcomings in aircraft maker Airbus SE’s Scope 3 emissions reporting were highlighted in a critical letter late last year from Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management, the world’s most profitable activist fund. Airbus and rival Boeing have committed to halving the aviation industry’s net emissions by 2050. It would help focus minds on that urgent task if they fully accounted for their own role in flight pollution.(2) If Shell can do it, why not them?(1) Like other truck manufacturers, VW doesn't report Scope 3 emissions for heavy trucks but made the estimate based on its market share andthe truck sector's contribution to global emissions (plus its carbon footprint from cars)(2) It already does so for cars.(3) Boeing's environment reportonly counts Scope 3 emissions from business travel. Airbus has urged the aviation sector to develop a common methodology for Scope 3 emissions to aid consistency in reporting.To contact the author of this story: Chris Bryant at cbryant32@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.

2020-01-28	2020-01-28 07:25:40	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	The Horse Breeder, the Novelist and the $60 Billion Mine	(Bloomberg) -- Australia has some big decisions to make about its future. For insight into the stories that matter, sign up for our new weekly newsletter.John Kuhns has been many things: an investment banker, a silicon smelter operator in China and a novelist. His sights are now set on an abandoned mine with an estimated $60 billion of gold and copper.Kuhns is among a handful of people exploring for minerals and courting landowners on the Pacific island of Bougainville. His rivals include an Arabian-horse breeder, a hedge fund investment manager who keeps wallabies on his estate and a former Australian defense minister.The involvement of such an eclectic mix of entrepreneurs is a reflection of the fact that this is no ordinary mineral reserve. Rio Tinto Group operated the Paguna mine for 17 years through subsidiary Bougainville Copper Ltd. The global mining behemoth shut it in 1989 as local protests over mine revenue degenerated into a civil war that killed as many as 20,000 people.The mine has been in limbo ever since. But that may be about to change as the Autonomous Region of Bougainville moves toward independence from Papua New Guinea after a referendum showed an overwhelming majority of the population on the small group of islands wants to establish a new nation.While the political uncertainty may deter major mining companies from making an immediate investment, the mine’s riches attract entrepreneurs hoping to develop the asset to a point where they can deliver it to a big operator for a fee, said Peter O’Connor, a Sydney-based analyst at Shaw and Partners Ltd. “They have to create a story with a vision,” he said.Success will depend on earning the trust of thousands of poor, customary landholders, many of whom remember the civil war that was triggered by communities demanding greater compensation from the mine.“The landowners want to reopen the mine but they are divided by the interested developers,” said Sam Akoitai, a member of the island’s parliament who represents central Bougainville, an area that includes Panguna. “It’s really up to the landowners to come together to understand that the land belongs to the clan and not to some individuals.”Bougainville Copper, which is no longer associated with Rio, has estimated it would take seven to eight years and $5 billion to $6 billion to rebuild the mine and resume full operations. The company is blamed by many locals for contamination attributed to the mine.“We retain strong levels of support among customary landowners within the project area,” Bougainville Copper said in a statement. “We have a trusted local team on the ground that continues to engage with project area communities.”The Bougainville Mining Act 2015 strengthened landowner control and was designed to increase compensation to local communities and the island’s government from future mining to avoid a repeat of the bloodshed of the 1980s and 1990s. The government also decided not to renew Bougainville Copper’s exploration license, which the company is challenging in court.In June 2019, Kuhns flew several landowners to the U.S. to meet potential investors, including representatives from Barrick Gold Corp. At the Harvard Club in Midtown Manhattan, where stuffed moose, bison and even an elephant head adorn the rooms, the landowners heard Kuhns deliver a PowerPoint presentation introducing potential investors to Bougainville.Barrick declined to comment.“Panguna mine can be rejuvenated and can be resuscitated for a couple of billion dollars,” said Kuhns in a follow up phone interview. “It’s going to take a major to do that.”Among those also interested in Panguna is Jeff McGlinn, who made his fortune in mining and construction services through Western Australia-based NRW Holdings Ltd., which he co-founded. McGlinn, who resigned from NRW in 2010, is part of the glamorous world of Arabian horse breeding, mixing with models and celebrities at parties on the French Riviera and promoting luxury brands. He once gave an Arabian colt to Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli.McGlinn’s roots in mining give him valuable experience for Panguna -- one of NRW’s businesses was constructing dams that hold mining waste. He’s also linked to a recent effort by the island’s government to kick start development, when it created Bougainville Advance Mining. The government’s Executive Council proposed last year an amendment to the 2015 mining act that would give all available mining rights to the new company, in which McGlinn’s Caballus Mining would hold a stake.That amendment drew criticism from landowners, as well as Bougainville Copper, the former mine operator, which says the proposal undermines its rights to mine Panguna. The bill was later shelved. A representative of Caballus said McGlinn was unavailable to comment.Another interested party is Richard Hains, son of the Australian billionaire David Hains. Richard, famous for keeping wallabies on his Gloucestershire estate, has helped develop mines in some of the world’s most difficult places. He’s the largest shareholder of RTG Mining Inc., whose management team has financed, built and operated mines across Africa and Asia, including the Boroo gold mine in Mongolia.“Some of the best opportunities in the mining business in the 21st century are now in the more difficult commercial environments,” Hains said in a phone interview.RTG believes it can restart production at Panguna through a staged process in as little as 18 months for about $800 million.“It’s far smarter to start with a smaller footprint,” said RTG Chairman Michael Carrick. “Then in consultation with the community, we can turn up the mine’s operation.”RTG operates a joint venture with the Special Mining Lease Osikaiyang Landowners Association, a Panguna landowners group. The JV employs 15 people, including Philip Miriori, the chairman of the landowners group.Why a Part of Papua New Guinea Is Eyeing Independence: QuickTakeThere are bigger fish too. Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. said in an emailed statement it has sent representatives to Bougainville to learn about the region and potential opportunities, confirming earlier reports. Founder Andrew Forrest is Australia’s second-richest person with a $10.2 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Shaw and Partners’ O’Connor said Chinese miners may also have a chance of redeveloping Panguna because they have a greater risk appetite and access to cheap financing.But the Panguna landowners group Chairman Miriori said the people he represents aren’t interested in working with Chinese developers because of their poor environmental track record.If anyone wins the right to develop Panguna or other parts of the autonomous region they will need to do so cautiously. Violence remains a constant threat in a community that is still fiercely divided.A geologist working for Perth-based Kalia Ltd. was killed and seven others were injured in an attack in northern Bougainville in December, according to the local government and the company, whose chairman is former Australia Minister forDefence David Johnston. Authorities subsequently suspended Kalia’s exploration expeditions and geological field work.There’s also a moratorium on work at Panguna because of sensitivity to restarting the mine, said Raymond Masono, Bougainville’s vice president and minister for mineral and energy resources.“We are no longer talking with any investors about Panguna until the moratorium is lifted, and we don’t know when” that will be, he said by phone. “The government is treading very carefully on this particular mine.”Bougainville Copper lost 5% to close at 28.5 Australian cents in Sydney trading on Tuesday.But prospects for restarting Panguna and allowing for the development of new mines are bolstered by the idea that Bougainville would need revenue to have any chance of financing an independent state. Many hope the mineral wealth could ultimately help reduce poverty for the region’s 300,000 people where estimated per capita GDP is only about $1,100.That would depend not only on clearing the way to restart production, but a government able to make sure that enough of the proceeds are used to fund development. “Given the failure of mining in PNG to deliver really anything like sustainable development, those hopes may end up being disappointed,” said Luke Fletcher, executive director of Jubilee Australia, a group that has tracked the effect of resource extraction.But the lure of riches mean miners aren’t likely to give up.“Bougainville had almost no exploration for nearly 40 years,” said Mike Johnston, executive director of Kalia. “There’s no other place like it on the planet.”(Updates with share price in 5th paragraph from end.)&#92;--With assistance from Justina Vasquez.To contact the reporter on this story: Aaron Clark in Tokyo at aclark27@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Adam MajendieFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/horse-breeder-novelist-60-billion-200000535.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-01-28	2020-01-28 05:10:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	The Coronavirus Won’t Wreck the Commodities Market	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A rampaging epidemic in the country that consumes about half of the world’s metals has to be bad news for mining stocks, right?Investors are certainly making that bet. The week started with the Bloomberg World Mining Index falling the most in nearly six months, and a six-day losing streak continued Tuesday on expectations that a slowdown in economic activity will cut China’s voracious appetite for commodities.Australian shares of Rio Tinto Group fell as much as 5.9% when trading resumed after a public holiday Monday, on track for their biggest slide in three-and-a-half years. Those of iron-ore producer Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. slumped as much as 8.7% in early trading.That looks overdone. In the grip of an epidemic, it can feel like the sky is falling — but most such viruses die down in a matter of months, and people shouldn’t underestimate how much industrial stimulus Beijing will inject in the economy to keep growth on-target in the aftermath.Consider Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which swept through southern China and east Asia in the early months of 2003. Like most coronaviruses — and indeed, most infections of the nose and throat, such as influenza — it exhibited a pronounced winter seasonality, with infections beginning in November and dropping rapidly through April, before approaching zero in June.Even Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, a coronavirus associated with parts of the world where winter weather is less extreme, showed a relatively similar pattern, with a peak in the early months of the year.Combined with this natural decline is the fact that, despite early surveillance and response lapses, China and other countries are already employing extreme measures to halt the spread. While quarantining of the entire city of Wuhan may not be sufficient — given the disease appears to have spread unchecked until it was too late — that probably won't be the last attempt to isolate the virus. China’s government, property developers and businesses are likely to implement further measures such as canceling public events and closing commercial and retail spaces.If things play out this way, it’s not impossible that the epidemic could start to subside in April, just as China’s industrial machine is revving up from its normal winter slumber. Cold weather and the long shadow of the Lunar New Year holiday typically lead to very low levels of industrial activity in January and February, before picking up to full speed between March and June.In the five years through 2018, for instance, daily pig iron production in March was about 7.4% higher on average than it was in January. Cement output ramps up even more rapidly, as warming weather makes it possible to mix concrete on building sites again: While January and February figures are often too weak to be reported by China’s statistical agency, May output over the same period averaged about 23% above the levels just two months earlier. That cycle could be particularly pronounced this year. China’s consumers are staying home during what’s traditionally been high season for shopping, dining, seeing films or traveling. A 10% fall in services consumption could cut gross domestic product growth by about 1.2 percentage points, according to S&P Global Ratings.That could, in theory, put a serious dent in output over the full year, which economists already expect to fall below the government’s target of “about 6%.” It might also violate a long-term pledge to double the country’s GDP by 2020, delivered on the eve of Xi Jinping’s accession to the Communist Party's highest leadership in 2012.Beijing is unlikely to take that sort of blow lying down. Just recall the responses to the 2003 SARS outbreak, the 2008 financial crisis, and the overzealous economic rebalancing toward consumption in 2015. As on those occasions, fixed-asset investment (particularly by state-owned companies) is likely to surge to fuel fresh industrial activity. China’s yearlong credit diet — no less serious, in its way, than the one that preceded the 2016 boom — will be loosened to inject some fresh life into a virus-hit economy.That’s likely to further defer China’s shift to an economy more dependent on consumption and less on mounting debt and carbon emissions — but it will also be bullish, not bearish, for commodities. China’s coal imports in the 12 months through June 2017 were nearly a third higher than in the preceding year; copper rose 12%, oil by 13% and iron ore by 7.7%.As the virus dies down, don’t be surprised to see that pattern play out one more time. What exactly is it about a country vowing to build two hospitals in a fortnight that makes investors think industrial commodities are heading for the sick bay?To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2020-01-25	2020-01-25 06:00:36	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Vale Will Keep Paying for Its Dam Disasters	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A year ago, I sat with Vale SA’s then-Chief Executive Officer Fabio Schvartsman in Davos, sipping lukewarm coffee. He chatted amiably about the next stage of the turnaround at the Brazilian mining giant, unaware that within 24 hours a river of sludge from one of his dams would take 270 lives in the town of Brumadinho. This week, he was among executives and former employees charged with homicide.The disaster on Jan. 25, 2019, a human and environmental catastrophe that’s been compared with BP Plc’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill, was supposed to be a moment of reckoning. It was, after all, Vale’s second such accident in just over three years. Yet 12 months on, shares in the $70 billion group are back at pre-Brumadinho levels, pointing to something less dramatic. The rebound also suggests investors are struggling to grasp the painful longer-term costs of such accidents for the company and the industry, in the era of stakeholder capitalism.The dam at the Corrego do Feijao mine was a problem from the beginning. It dated back to 1976, when it was started by a company later acquired by Vale. The dam was built over decades, using the tailings, or mining waste. New layers were added on top of old ones, until 2013. Unfortunately, such dams require water to drain out if they are to remain stable; the technical investigation found this one was too steep, and allowed to get too wet. High iron content made it brittle, too.In the end, there was no warning. After heavy rainfall in late 2018, it simply collapsed, releasing 10 million cubic meters of mud – roughly 4,000 Olympic swimming pools – in under five minutes.The timing for Vale was painful. It found itself accused of negligence and worse, just as the miner was emerging from another accident, the 2015 collapse of a dam owned by Samarco Mineracao SA, its joint venture with BHP Group. Schvartsman, a former pulp and paper executive, had stepped into the top job in 2017 vowing “never again.”The market’s immediate reaction was strong. Vale lost nearly a quarter of its value, almost $20 billion. Investors’ calculations of the ultimate cost were then obscured, though, as the hit to supply at the world’s largest iron-ore exporter eventually drove prices of the steelmaking ingredient well above $100 per metric ton.The cost is still unclear. That shouldn’t be startling. BP was still raising estimates for outstanding claims for Deepwater Horizon years after the event. In the end, the British oil major sold more than $70 billion of assets to remain in business; its shares haven’t recovered.The scale and jurisdiction are different here. Still, it’s surprising that Vale’s shares have bounced back.That doesn’t mean that no costs have been priced in. Compare Vale with iron ore-focused rival Rio Tinto Group. Rio’s London shares have risen almost 18% in the past 12 months thanks to surging iron-ore prices. Add in the impact of reinvested dividends, and the total return is more than 30%. The share increase alone implies a gap of some $16 billion with Vale.Some of that sum reflects the impact of lost revenue, given the 93-million-ton hit to production during a year when the price of high-quality Brazilian iron ore fines delivered to northern China averaged more than $100 a ton.The remainder, though, isn’t too far from what Vale itself has already set aside, handed out or had frozen for potential liabilities from Brumadinho: It paid $1.6 billion for reparations and compensation in 2019, and has provisioned $5.4 billion. Some 7.5 billion Brazilian real ($1.8 billion) of assets are frozen by the courts.  The trouble is, that covers mostly first-order costs, like payouts for workers and families, the wider clean-up and some fixes to similar facilities elsewhere. Vale plans to spend $1.8 billion over five years shifting to dry stacking, a safer method to dispose of mine waste. By 2023, it says 70% of its production will use this.The wider impact of Brumadinho and the 2015 disaster on Vale and the industry will be more profound. Risks to tailings dams and other mining installations are already increasing, and there may be more monitoring in some corners. Extreme weather including heavy rainfall is far more frequent, and declining ore grades, or the percentage of minerals in rock that’s dug up, mean more waste to deal with. This coincides with increased concern among shareholders for the environmental impact of investments.Higher bills for more inspections might be manageable for large miners, but what about significantly slower permits, higher costs of closure, or projects that get blocked entirely by disgruntled communities? During a high tide for populism in Brazil and elsewhere, that’s harder than ever to estimate. It’s unlikely Brumadinho will be forgotten by governments and communities as disasters like Mount Polley in 2014 largely were.According to a report by the Church of England Pensions Board, 40 of the top 50 mining companies had made disclosures on their websites about tailings dams as of late December, as requested by campaigners and shareholders. That’s a solid three-quarters of the mining industry by market capitalization, but leaves plenty of laggards. Schvartsman, in the aftermath of Brumadinho, said Vale was a “Brazilian jewel” that could not be condemned because of an accident. His gross underestimation of the seriousness of the situation cost him his job,  and moreInvestors and rivals would be wise not to make the same mistake. To contact the author of this story: Clara Ferreira Marques at cferreirama@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-01-21	2020-01-21 09:34:17	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	The Iron Ore Party Is Drawing to a Close	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Iron ore had a carousing 2019 — for all the wrong reasons. A fatal dam collapse in Brazil, followed by a tropical cyclone in Australia, battered production and sent prices to their highest level in five years. Early figures from BHP Group and Rio Tinto Group show just how much benefit both have reaped. With supply coming back, Chinese mills under pressure and Beijing’s infrastructure investment looking inadequate to keep the music going, prepare for a more sober 2020.Production figures from BHP on Tuesday, as with Rio Tinto last week, will cheer investors and fuel hopes of one-time payouts. The average price at which BHP sold a metric ton of iron ore in the six months through December was just over $78, more than 40% higher than a year earlier. Considering unit costs that probably hover around an underlying $13 per ton, the level reported for its last financial year, that’s quite a margin — and quite some cash flow. It’s a similar story at Rio.Unfortunately, it’s hard to see how such gravity-defying market levels can hold up. Iron ore futures in Singapore are currently trading above $90. While that’s below July highs, it’s still well above prices touched even after Vale SA’s Brumadinho disaster and Cyclone Veronica, which struck Western Australia in March.Consider supply. Vale, a critical piece of the steel ingredient jigsaw, won’t report fourth-quarter production until February, but third-quarter output was already up 35% on the previous three months, and the Brazilian giant could return to pre-Brumadinho levels by 2021. All three of the big iron-ore suppliers — BHP, Rio and Vale — are working toward incremental though ambitious supply targets. In 2020, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates the three will add 44 million tons — a not insignificant 3% of the year’s projected output. China’s production, meanwhile, has also edged higher.Demand isn’t quite as rosy.Granted, there were some signs of stabilization in the world’s biggest steel producer and consumer at the end of last year. China’s industrial output in December beat forecasts to rise 6.9%, the strongest in nine months and a decent showing even accounting for work brought forward to compensate for an early Lunar New Year. Steel production hit another record last year.The detail is less inspiring, as growth in the world’s second-largest economy cools to its slowest pace in almost three decades. While monetary policy remains helpful, there are signs that private companies are still struggling for funds. Key sources of demand for steel remain weak, from property and cars to manufacturing. Building starts, for example, were up 8.5% in 2019 while completions, an indicator of confidence, increased far more slowly. Even after a phase-one trade deal between Washington and Beijing, heavy tariffs remain in place, weighing on manufacturing. All of that means iron-ore bulls need China to start splurging on infrastructure. Beijing has taken some measures to encourage spending, approving more projects and lowering capital ratio requirements. This isn’t a return to the bumper stimulus efforts of the past, though, judging by indicators such as fixed-asset investment. Local governments are saddled with plenty of debt, which remains a concern. Moreover, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates China’s public investment per capita is almost as high as that of advanced economies, suggesting it’s becoming harder for spending to have an impact.Producers of high-grade ore, like the big three, may also find the premium that local mills will pay comes down as their margins come under pressure.China’s economic priorities — including the size and scope of further stimulus — will be outlined in March, when the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference meet. Miners can expect that, whatever the speed of decline, the only way is down.  To contact the author of this story: Clara Ferreira Marques at cferreirama@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2019-12-11	2019-12-11 15:48:17	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Gold’s Deal Blitz Could Draw In the Rest of the Mining Sector	(Bloomberg) -- A torrent of deal-making among gold producers that’s pushed M&A in the sector to an eight-year high is seen spilling over into the wider mining industry -- if there’s a rally in global growth.Pending and completed gold acquisitions have reached about $33 billion so far in 2019, the highest since 2011, according to data complied by Bloomberg. That’s as deals among all mining companies have declined about 29% from last year to $60 billion, the data show.A revival in the economic outlook, with higher interest rates and inflation, would prompt other metals producers to rethink their current strategy of cutting debt and lifting shareholder returns -- and focus again on pursuing growth, according to Christopher LaFemina, a New York-based analyst at Jefferies LLC.“Until now, the market has rewarded companies for austerity” amid a chase for yield, LaFemina said in a phone interview. “We will see a significant acceleration of M&A activity when global growth recovers.”In recent times, the biggest miners, including Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group, have made only some small investments in undeveloped projects and authorized new spending on expansions at existing operations.Larger-scale M&A could be an option for Rio next year, UBS Group AG analysts, including Glyn Lawcock, said in a report this month. “Will 2020 see the shackles come off? Growth in the portfolio is limited,” they said.Rio has a “watching brief for attractive M&A opportunities,” though intends to remain “absolutely disciplined,” Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques told investors at an October seminar. The company has said its ventures team is evaluating opportunities in battery materials, including in nickel. There would be “plenty of logic” for Rio in adding copper producer First Quantum Minerals Ltd., according to Barclays Plc.BHP is also seeking to add oil, copper and nickel, and could consider deals that offer an early entry into high-quality resource bases, particularly before the value of a project is fully understood, Chief Financial Officer Peter Beaven said in May.Still, large companies and their investors continue to be chastened by past failed deals, according to Paul Mitchell, EY’s global mining and metals leader, and they remain cautious after a multi-year effort to repair balance sheets in the wake of the 2015 price collapse.Sectors such as base metals have fewer opportunities for consolidation than precious metals, and a price downturn hasn’t yet forced companies into distress, according to David Harquail, chief executive officer at Franco-Nevada Corp., a mine streaming and royalty company.Since January’s $10 billion gold mega-merger between then Newmont Mining Corp. and Goldcorp Inc., companies in the sector including Newcrest Mining Ltd. have added individual mines, while Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. and Zijin Mining Group Co. acquired smaller rivals. Barrick Gold Corp. and a partner on Tuesday agreed to a $430 million deal to sell a 90% stake in a project in Senegal to with Teranga Gold Corp.Gold’s rally means there’s been “a slightly improved environment to be able to finally do transactions,” Harquail said. There’s a prospect of further activity among gold producers into next year, with investors ready to back proposals that reduce overheads and combine assets, he said.One possibility would be M&A activity between gold and base metals companies but Joe Foster, a New York-based portfolio manager at VanEck, says it’s not a good idea. Gold companies trade at higher multiples to base metals and that benefit would be diluted by consolidation between the sectors. VanEck likes its gold investments to have less than 20% exposure to base metals, and hopes gold miners will stick to their knitting.“I want to see smart consolidation, not the same thing that we’ve seen in the past” among gold producers, said Foster said. “There’s value to be created by consolidating some of these single-asset companies.”(Updates with additional comment from VanEck in penultimate paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.net;Danielle Bochove in Toronto at dbochove1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Keith Gosman, Jake Lloyd-SmithFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-deal-blitz-could-draw-215942122.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-11	2019-12-11 00:23:56	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	First Quantum Says No Takeover Bid from Rio Tinto or Jiangxi	(Bloomberg) -- First Quantum Minerals Ltd. says it hasn’t received any takeover approaches -- including from Rio Tinto Group -- since it last refuted “speculation” it had been in talks about a bid in September.The company’s president said that while executives were caught off guard by this week’s share purchase by Jiangxi Copper Co., there’s no chance that will lead to a takeover bid either.The Vancouver-based miner has been in talks with Jiangxi for roughly a year about selling a minority stake in its Zambian operations to the Chinese company, but there’s no deal on the table yet, Clive Newall said Tuesday in a phone interview.“It came as a bit of a surprise when they appeared on the shareholder register, but their intentions still seem to be genuine and we’re continuing our discussions,” Newall said of the report this week that Jiangxi paid $1.1 billion to acquire an 18% stake in First Quantum.First Quantum’s shares extended losses to an intraday low of C$13.03, down 3.6%, following the comments. The stock fell 2.7% Tuesday to close at C$13.15 in Toronto.Jiangxi initially approached the Canada-based miner about acquiring a minority stake in its Zambian assets, Newall said. As part of those talks, the company required Jiangxi to sign a non-disclosure agreement that restricts it from buying more than 20% of First Quantum’s shares, he said.‘Couple of Years’The share-buying restriction won’t expire for “at least a couple of years” and was negotiated to eliminate any possibility of a takeover play by the Chinese miner, he said. “We wanted to make sure they couldn’t do that by restricting the number of shares to 20%.”First Quantum has been the subject of takeover speculation, including the possibility it could be a target for Rio. Newall refused to discuss Rio directly but said the talk is just “scuttlebutt” and the company hasn’t received any takeover interest, from any company, since September when it previously denied takeover interest.On Monday, a Rio spokesman had no comment on the matter.‘No Great Desire’In September, First Quantum said “there has been speculation of a takeover bid.” It added that it “has not engaged in any discussions regarding a take-over bid or other change of control transaction and has no knowledge of potential take-over bids, change of control transactions or proposals.”If someone were to make a takeover play for the company “we would resist,” Newall said in the interview Tuesday. “There’s no great desire to be taken over, but under the circumstances where you haven’t got much choice then it’s all about price,” he said. Nor is First Quantum interested in making any acquisitions as its focus for the next two to three years will be reducing debt by at least $2 billion.The company also won’t be selling off assets, or majority stakes in assets, Newall said. “Our only intentions are to sell minority stakes for a variety of reasons: partly deleveraging and, in Zambia, to share some of the political risks with a partner,” he said.Talks with Jiangxi over a minority purchase in Zambia are set to resume in the New Year, he said.First Quantum controls the Kansanshi and Sentinel copper mines in Zambia, where it has been in protracted talks with the government over issues from royalty increases to the planned introduction of a sales tax. Its major focus for 2020 will be ramping up production at the giant Cobre Panama copper mine in the Central American country, Newall said.To contact the reporter on this story: Danielle Bochove in Toronto at dbochove1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven Frank, Joe RichterFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-quantum-quashes-rio-rumor-185536275.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-04	2019-12-04 21:00:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Buying Iron Ore Is Getting More Like Shopping on Amazon	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest iron ore miners are looking for novel ways of satisfying their customers and protecting market share in the $150 billion global industry.From selling through a mobile app to portside sales, the likes of BHP Group, Rio Tinto Group and Vale SA are looking for an edge with buyers of the steelmaking raw material in China, the top customer. The need to retain their business is becoming ever more critical amid forecasts that the market is around its peak.“For miners, Chinese import volumes are basically not going to grow the way they used to,” said Tomas Gutierrez, analyst at Kallanish Commodities Ltd. “Any increase in value for iron ore will come from either adding service to mills or from cutting out the traders.”Rio and rivals -- who have spent more than a decade pumping billions into expansions to keep pace with China’s fast-rising appetite for iron ore -- are now preparing for an era of slower growth and an eventual high point in the nation’s steel output.They are introducing a range of initiatives to retain existing sales and add new customers -- from Rio’s development of a mobile app, to portside sales, and selling directly from China’s ports in yuan instead of shipping cargoes from Australia or Brazil that are sold in dollars.New Strategies“Our China portside customers will be able to order via a mobile app,” Rio’s Chief Commercial Officer Simon Trott told an investor seminar in October. “You can order a few tons of ore, in the same way you’d place an order on Amazon.”Rio has started portside sales, while BHP also has been testing “spot sales during transport to China as well as sales in smaller quantities with shorter lead times from bonded stockpiles in China,” Rod Dukino, vice president for sales and marketing iron ore, said at a conference in September.Selling at ports allows miners to blend different types of ore, and means “more money in the miners’ pockets,” according to UBS Group AG managing director and global head of mining, Glyn Lawcock. “We have seen over the last few years increasing sales to traders and now the miners are clawing back some of that lost margin essentially.”In particular, the use of the Chinese yuan is a breakthrough for an industry dominated by the dollar. For mills, this eliminates currency risks. For miners, this broadens their customer base and again cuts out the traders, said Lawcock.In June, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. set up a sales office in China, offering direct supply of smaller volumes in the yuan. “This represents a new sales channel for Fortescue to complement our existing seaborne trade,” Chief Executive Elizabeth Gaines said in an email.BHP sees “huge potential in the digitization of our post-trade processes across our portfolio, both for customers and suppliers alike, through increased visibility and traceability of goods” Dukino said in an email.Large and medium-sized steel mills in China generally support the miners’ new sales strategies, according to a survey by Bloomberg of five executives at mills and industry groups.“As producers get closer to a diverse range of end customers, they understand their needs more, to facilitate an evolution in interaction and even digitalization,” according to Andrew Glass, founder of Avatar Commodities Pte and formerly head of iron ore financial trading at Anglo American Plc.Still, launching new sales channels also has its risks, and companies need to be mitigating them at the same time as extending their supply chain, Glass warned.Tight RaceThe initiatives follow similar strategies adopted by Vale since 2015. The Brazilian miner, which is still grappling with the effects of a fatal dam disaster earlier this year, blends and sells from 16 ports in China. It also has a center in Malaysia, where ore can be stored and blended.In the first for a foreign miner, Vale signed a deal with a Chinese steel mill based on prices of iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.While Vale has had a headstart in sales efforts, Rio is catching up, according to Kallanish’s Gutierrez. “Now that the port stock market is more developed, and the sales mechanisms are developed, then all the miners will need to compete in this area.”“The enhancement of having things like port stocks and port trade allows flexibility, and allows smaller parcel deliveries to customers,” Rio’s iron ore Chief Executive Officer Chris Salisbury said in a interview last week.&#92;--With assistance from David Stringer, Winnie Zhu and Alfred Cang.To contact the reporter on this story: Krystal Chia in Singapore at kchia48@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Phoebe Sedgman at psedgman2@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buying-iron-ore-getting-more-210000086.html?.tsrc=rss

The stoppage will further sap investor sentiment in a country where business confidence is near the lowest level in two decades.The freezing of the Zulti South project comes as President Cyril Ramaphosa battles to stimulate growth and retain the nation’s last investment-grade credit rating. South Africa’s economy contracted for a second quarter this year in the three months through September as farming, mining and factory output slumped.The decision to halt operations was preceded by weeks of community protests in the area around the mine, causing “on-and-off disruptions,” said RBM Managing Director Werner Duvenhage. The demonstrations aren’t related to the company, but endanger employees’ lives and require government intervention, he said.Losses will be “significant,” according to Duvenhage, who said he doesn’t know when RBM will resume operations.Community disruptions around mines are leading to huge losses for producers, Anglo American Platinum Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Chris Griffith said in October. Many protests relate to the provision of municipal services and housing, while some communities also complain they get few benefits from mines, even as their lives are disrupted by relocations and pollution.Crime WaveSouth Africa has also been plagued by xenophobic attacks and violence against women. While Ramaphosa has made combating crime a top priority since taking office, the number of murders climbed to the highest level in at least a decade in the 12 months through March.Smelters at the site in the KwaZulu-Natal province are operating at a reduced level after an escalation of criminal activity directed at staff, London-based Rio said Wednesday in a statement.Rio shares were little changed in London trading.Output for 2019 is expected to be at the low end of a guidance range of 1.2 million to 1.4 million tons and Rio is contacting customers to minimize disruptions. RBM employs about 5,000 staff and contractors, and exports titanium dioxide slag, used to create ingredients for products including paint, plastics, sunscreen and toothpaste.“We have taken decisive action to stop operations to reduce the risk of serious harm to our team members,” Bold Baatar, Rio’s CEO for energy & minerals, said in the statement.To contact the reporters on this story: Felix Njini in Johannesburg at fnjini@bloomberg.net;David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Dylan Griffiths, Liezel HillFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-shuts-south-african-065138691.html?.tsrc=rss

Operations are expected to return to normal Wednesday after the union reached a tentative deal with the company.“Rio Tinto declared force majeure on contracts prior to Canadian National Railway confirming the strike was ending,” the company said in an email to Bloomberg News Tuesday. “We are working closely with customers to minimize any impacts as services resume.”The force majeure notice confirms the warning last week by supply-chain management and consulting company Mercury Resources that aluminum deliveries from Quebec into the U.S. will likely be delayed as the strike results in backlogs.Last week, the Union Pacific Corp., the largest freight rail provider in the U.S. West region, said it stopped accepting shipments into or from CN Railway’s Canada locations until CN operations return to normal.To contact the reporter on this story: Joe Deaux in New York at jdeaux@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-declares-force-majeure-050001731.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-11-27	2019-11-27 04:41:06	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Spending $4 Billion on Iron Ore Pipeline Amid China Demand	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group lifted its spending on new iron ore projects in Australia to more than $4 billion with the approval of a replacement mine at a key hub, providing a further sign of the industry’s confidence in demand led by China.London-based Rio will invest $749 million to bring the Western Turner Syncline Phase 2 project into production from 2021, according to a statement Wednesday. It will help extend the life of operations around the Tom Price mine, which began exporting in 1966.While the new project is aimed only at replacing output that’ll be lost from aging pits, Rio will have options to boost volumes from its $2.6 billion Koodaideri development, Chris Salisbury, iron ore chief executive officer, said in a phone interview. The Western Turner project was accounted for under capital expenditure guidance outlined last month, he said.Australia’s top miners continue to see potential to leverage low production costs and a dominant position in the seaborne trade to generate strong profits from iron ore, even as they forecast China’s steel output to reach a peak.Demand for ore is being supported by infrastructure projects in China launched earlier in 2019 and by ongoing property development, Salisbury said. There’s also been a more limited impact from the nation’s traditional winter output curbs on steel mills intended to limit pollution, he said.“We haven’t seen significant effects of those so far in the season,” Salisbury said. “We are pleased with the level of demand at the moment.”Rival BHP Group is spending about $3 billion on its South Flank mine and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. is investing more than $3 billion in two developments, including the Iron Bridge project that’ll add output of higher-quality materials. Rio last year approved the Koodaideri project and also $820 million of spending for its share of work to sustain output from the Robe River joint venture.The latest investment by Rio highlights “the ongoing commitment toward capital required to maintain existing” volumes and product quality in Australia’s Pilbara region, RBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Hissey said in a note. Potential for an iron ore surplus from 2020 and the prospect of continued slowing in China’s economy mean RBC was cautious about the market over the medium and long term, he said.Rio forecasts its iron ore shipments to rise as much as 5% in 2020 and expects to have capacity to hit a long-standing target for annual cargoes of 360 million tons by 2022. Iron ore accounts for about 43% of its revenue.“Our iron ore business does continue to deliver industry leading margins,” Salisbury said. The investments are “a commitment to the importance of iron ore to the overall Rio portfolio,” he said.Rio’s investment in the Western Turner project will add a new crusher and a 13-kilometer (8-mile) long conveyor belt, trimming the need for road haulage and helping cut the mining hub’s greenhouse gas emissions, the producer said. The plan will also protect the future of the company’s flagship Pilbara Blend iron ore product. The investment means Rio’s approved spending on new iron ore projects is more than A$6 billion ($4 billion), according to Salisbury.To contact the reporter on this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Keith Gosman, Jason RogersFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-lifts-iron-ore-spending-002704143.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-19	2019-11-19 14:38:34	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Tinto’s Giant Mongolia Project Dealt Another Blow	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group has another headache to deal with in Mongolia, as the government looks set to lose a legal challenge to its agreement with the world’s second-biggest miner.Rio is building a giant underground copper mine, known as Oyu Tolgoi, in the country. Yet the project has been beset by delays, legal probes, cost overruns and government pressure.Rio said Tuesday that early reports suggest an administrative court has upheld claims by the Darkhan Mongol Nogoon Negdel non-governmental organization that Mongolia didn’t follow due process on the agreement that underpins its development of the asset.The group, which promotes ecological balance and economic independence, had disputed the Dubai agreement signed in 2015, as well as the authority of Mongolian government officials involved in the negotiations.It’s not yet clear what the implications will be. But with the court’s formal written ruling expected to be released in the coming weeks, it adds a fresh element of uncertainty to an already difficult project.“The Dubai agreement is not annulled by the court decision. However, this decision raises questions about due authorization and capacity of those who signed the Dubai agreement,” said lawyer Solongoo Bayarsaikhan, a managing partner of Avinex Partners LLP in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, who is not involved in the case. “We need to see the actual court decision.”Earlier this year, Rio warned that its flagship growth project could cost as much as $1.9 billion more than forecast and faces potential delays to full production of as long as two and a half years. The expansion of the mine has run into difficulties after potential stability risks were identified within the planned underground operation, and it could now cost as much as $7.2 billion.The overruns will mean Mongolia must wait longer before profits start flowing from the mine to the government.On top of the actual problems building the project, there have been numerous controversies in the country. A parliamentary working group recommended in April that Mongolia review the 2009 deal that launched construction and revoke a 2015 agreement allowing for an underground expansion to tap into most of its mineral wealth. The mine has also been at the center of tax disputes and a probe into allegations of corruption.Rio said that it “strongly refutes” any suggestion that its agreement is illegal.(Updates with lawyer comment in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.net;Terrence Edwards in Ulaanbaatar at tedwards100@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Liezel Hill, Dylan GriffithsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-giant-mongolia-project-114921841.html?.tsrc=rss

BHP and its rivals, Rio Tinto and Anglo American, all appointed dealmaking bosses as the commodities supercycle ramped up in 2007.  Twelve years ago, with the fast-rising resources prices appearing super-cyclical, there was little concern about anything going up in smoke — be it coal, iron ore or shareholders’ money.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6a371902-3b9e-3016-8660-dc200f7feb53/bhp%E2%80%99s-new-boss-shows-miners.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-11-14	2019-11-14 04:44:17	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	BHP’s New Boss Shows Mining Is Still Nervous	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When times are good, focus on the top line and the bottom line will look after itself. When times are bad, you should do the reverse.That looks a lot like the strategy the world’s biggest miner, BHP Group, has followed over the years in appointing its chief executive officers. The question the resources sector should ask in looking at Thursday’s appointment of Mike Henry to succeed Andrew Mackenzie is whether his focus is the top line, or the bottom.Henry has spent the last three years as the operations chief for BHP’s Australian assets, where he’s focused on improving efficiency and bringing down costs — resolutely bottom-line work. The bulk of his experience, however, is in the top-line marketing side of the business — finding ways to get the best possible prices for the minerals BHP digs and pumps. That resume harks back to Mackenzie’s predecessor.With an upswing in prices for its key commodities of iron ore, coal and oil under way in 2007, BHP appointed Marius Kloppers, a South African veteran of its manganese business, to the chief executive role. Kloppers pushed hard to shift the pricing of first manganese, and then iron ore and coal, toward spot markets that more closely track supply and demand.That helped BHP and its competitors extract additional revenues from their customers as spot prices surged in the years before and after the 2008 financial crisis — but when the market started to turn six years later, the emphasis started to look misplaced. After the demand growth that had supported the capital spending boom of the Kloppers era started to ebb, BHP's operations looked bloated and wasteful.Mackenzie, with a background running petrochemicals for BP Plc and mines for Rio Tinto Group and BHP, was brought in as an operational wizard to fix the rot. He slimmed down the business, spun off the less attractive assets as South32 Ltd., and reduced expenditure to a level that could survive in the new, leaner environment.At first blush, Henry looks like a swing of the pendulum from Mackenzie’s operations focus back to Kloppers’ marketing background.He sold first coal, then energy and freight and petroleum for BHP before being appointed as Kloppers’ marketing president and then chief marketing officer in 2010. Only after Mackenzie took over the top job and Henry was entering the frame as a potential eventual successor was he shifted over to round out his experience on the operations side.There’s reason to think that a more bullish focus is finally due. The resources sector has never really climbed out of the slump it entered around 2014, but the S&P 500 breaks new records on a daily basis. Forecasters could be underestimating the potential of a strong economic rebound in 2020, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Bloomberg’s indexes of energy and industrial metals are still at subdued levels, but the run-up in iron ore prices this year put Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.’s index of bulk materials such as iron and coal at its highest level since 2013. That should be good news for BHP, since its share price tends to track that benchmark closely.At the same time, it seems to have been as much Henry’s recent experience managing mines that’s recommended him for the top job. He’s been responsible for rolling out autonomous trucks at the Jimblebar iron ore mine in northwest Australia and for setting up operations centers in Perth and Brisbane to run the company’s iron and coal mines remotely. Costs of late have been sharply lower in both divisions, although those for Queensland coal are creeping back up.If anything, it’s a sign of how things have changed for the mining industry that even scions of the marketing business like Henry have turned into born-again operations experts. BHP still has Elliott Management Corp. hanging around as a major shareholder. While its activist campaign will have been quiet for almost two years by the time Henry assumes the top job in January, it remains a constraint on any chief executive in a bullish mood.More to the point, a stronger outlook for the U.S. economy isn’t the medicine that can revive BHP’s boom years. China still consumes about half of almost every major mined commodity and accounted for about 55% of BHP’s revenue last year — and all the evidence is that the economy there is slowing. BHP’s key commodities could be heading for an even rougher patch if China’s car market continues to crater and its still-buoyant conditions in real estate fall to more normal levels.Should that be the case, the pendulum won’t be swinging back from the bean-counters to the marketers. If anything, it will have further to go in the other direction.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

Operations in Australia have, at times, operated at a run rate of 360m tons, though not on an annual basis.The company was forced to trim production in Western Australia earlier this year after falling behind with mine plans. The exporter was producing too much lower-quality iron ore and forced to reduce total volumes. Work to make improvements is on track, CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques told reporters on a media call.Total capital expenditure in 2019 will be lower at $5.5b, with guidance raised to $7b in 2020, Rio said. Guidance for 2021 and 2022 is for expenditure of about $6.5b, Rio said.Work to redesign the mine at Oyu Tolgoi is continuing and a final estimate of cost and schedule is still expected to be delivered in the second half of 2020.Market ReactionRio declined 0.4% Thursday in Sydney trading to trim its advance this year to about 16%.

2019-10-28	2019-10-28 13:01:40	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Miner Seeks Answers Amid Indonesia Nickel Shock: LME Week Update	(Bloomberg) -- LME Week, the biggest annual event of the London metals world, kicks off Monday.Conversation topics for traders, miners and investors gathering around the city will include the recent turmoil in the nickel market, especially after Indonesia accelerated a ban on ore exports, and the protests in Chile that have disrupted copper operations.This year’s event takes place against the backdrop of weak demand for most key metals.Highlights:Copper demand will probably decline slightly this year, before increasing 1.4% in 2020, according to CRU Group.Nickel and gold were seen as having the most upside potential in a poll of attendees at an LME seminar.Mining companies are going to have to get used to being smaller and more nimble, according to Rio Tinto Group chief Jean-Sebastien Jacques.Here are the latest developments, updated throughout the day. (Time-stamps are local time in London.)Norilsk Seeks Answers (12:30 p.m.)The nickel industry is digesting the news that Indonesia suspended exports of nickel ore with immediate effect, but producers need more details, said Denis Sharypin, head of market research at MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC.If the ban is implemented immediately, it will result in tighter supplies in the next two months amid demand from China, which will be positive for prices, he said.Zinc Seen Declining (11:20 a.m.)Zinc prices are likely to fall further in the near term on subdued demand, said Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics Ltd.Prices may reach $2,300 a ton by year-end with potential for a small revival to $2,400 by the end of 2020. Futures on the LME traded around $2,535 on Monday.While risk appetite in general may start to pick up in the second half of next year, zinc threatens to remain a relative underperformer, Bain said.Nickel Deficit (11:15 a.m.)The nickel market remains in “fundamental deficit,” said Edward Meir, president of Commodity Research Group and senior commodity consultant at ED&F Man Capital Markets.Stainless steel will remain the main consumer and driver for the metal, he said. “Some caution is in order” for expectations about the price impact on nickel and other metals from electric vehicle demand.Meir sees nickel prices averaging $14,500 a ton next year, compared with Monday’s price of $16,950.Copper Consumption (10:45 a.m.)Copper demand will probably decline slightly this year, before increasing 1.4% in 2020, said Vanessa Davidson, head of base metals research and strategy at CRU Group.CRU sees world copper mine output rising 1.3% in 2020 and refined copper production expanding 1.4%.This year, the lower demand will be balanced out by flat refined production and a 1% drop in mine output.Bearish Aluminum (10:40 a.m.)Sentiment in the aluminum market is “extremely bearish,” said Jorge Vazquez, managing director of Harbor Aluminum. He sees a price rally in the next six months.The aluminum surplus will widen as production capacity increases and demand growth is unlikely to increase substantially, he said.Nickel, Gold Are Favorites (10:30 a.m.)Nickel and gold won the most votes as the metals with the most upside potential in a poll of attendees at the LME seminar Monday.Citi on Outlook (10 a.m.)While there’s no clarity among traders and investors on demand growth and commodity prices next year, it is obvious that global trade is in retreat near-term due to tariff fights, said Catherine Mann, global chief economist at Citigroup.It’s not only a bilateral war between China and the U.S., she said, “it’s a global war.”Trafigura on Sourcing Plan (9:46 a.m.)Trafigura Group’s head of corporate responsibility, James Nicholson, said the London Metal Exchange’s responsible sourcing strategy is a positive step forward for the sector.The plan “shows an industry coming of an age,” he said. “The possibility of consolidation under an exchange as important as this one is a really significant step.”Nicholson said he’s seen a dramatic shift over the past decade in the attention that Trafigura’s banks pay to social and environment issues.Chile Effect (9:20 a.m.)The unrest in Chile means that some delegates from the top copper-producing nation are missing LME Week this year. Codelco Chairman Juan Benavides canceled his trip and a scheduled event on mining in Chile will no longer take place. Some mines were disrupted last week and others were halted as the largest demonstrations in the country in decades wreaked economic havoc.Rio on Growth (8:30 a.m.)After losing billions on mega deals and projects, mining companies are going to have to get used to being smaller and more nimble, according to Rio Tinto Group chief Jean-Sebastien Jacques.“In the past, most major miners have pushed for bigger mines, using bigger machinery, processing ever greater quantities of material,” Jacques said in a speech. “As demand for some materials remains flat or declines, and the circular economy takes hold, the push for scale will change.”&#92;--With assistance from Thomas Biesheuvel.To contact the reporters on this story: Elena Mazneva in London at emazneva@bloomberg.net;Mark Burton in London at mburton51@bloomberg.net;Jack Farchy in London at jfarchy@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Liezel Hill, Nicholas LarkinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-ceo-says-bigger-083759547.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-22	2019-10-22 13:32:25	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio to Produce Lithium in California, Joining Electric Car Battery Race	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group is starting pilot production of lithium in California and will consider an expansion to become the top domestic supplier in the U.S. as the world’s biggest miners look to boost their exposure to the electric car battery revolution.Work to reprocess waste piles from a 90-year-old mining site in Boron has successfully produced lithium carbonate -- needed in rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles and consumer technology, Rio said Tuesday in an emailed statement. Efforts are now focused on improving quality and lifting volumes, the company said.Rio is the first top diversified miner to add lithium output to its portfolio and comes ahead of a looming decision on development of its mine project in Serbia that analysts estimate could account for about 5% of world demand. Demand for lithium will advance about eight-fold to 2030 as EV adoption increases and the battery sector expands, BloombergNEF said in a July report.“If the trials continue to prove successful, this has the potential to become America’s largest domestic producer of battery-grade lithium -- all without the need for further mining,” Bold Baatar, chief executive officer of Rio’s energy and minerals division, said in the statement. Currently the only supplier in the U.S. is Albemarle Corp.’s Silver Peak operation in Nevada, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.Rio, the world’s No. 2 miner, has held discussions on the EV sector with key companies in the supply chain and executives have visited China’s battery producer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. and electric automaker Tesla Inc., according to people familiar with the producer’s plans, who spoke on condition of anonymity as details of the talks are private. CATL declined to comment. Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.A pilot plant being assembled at Boron -- about 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles -- under a $10 million first phase will produce about 10 metric tons a year of lithium carbonate equivalent by chemically processing material from the pile of decades-old mining waste.Boron is part of a unit in California’s Death Valley that’s produced borates, materials used in laundry soap to components for nuclear reactors, since 1872. There’s at least 80 minerals to be found in material from the site, and staff had initially been combing the waste for gold and other elements when they discovered lithium, according to Rio.Rio will next consider a $50 million investment to build an industrial-scale lithium plant with capacity for 5,000 tons a year that could begin making sales into the battery market. That volume would be sufficient for batteries needed in about 15,000 Tesla Model S cars, the company said.While Rio’s competitors are also gearing up for forecast rising battery demand, their focus is on other commodities. Glencore Plc is aiming to add copper, nickel and cobalt output, while BHP Group is developing specialist nickel and battery cathode products and sees lithium as a less attractive option, Chief Financial Officer Peter Beaven said in May.Lithium prices have sunk since mid-2018, ending a three-year surge, as new operations have added supply and amid some signs of demand weakness. There’s probably currently enough capacity to supply the global market until the mid-2020s, according to BNEF.Rio previously weighed an offer for a stake in Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA, one of the world’s top lithium producers, before deciding last year not to proceed.Separately, Rio has signed an agreement to enter the rare earths supply chain with the sale of monazite, a raw material that contains the critical elements, the company said. The material is part of the waste stream at Rio’s mineral sands operation in Madagascar.President Donald Trump has flagged concerns over the global supply of rare earths and a suite of other so-called critical minerals amid worries China, the dominant supplier of many of the materials, could restrict exports.Rio is also using a $3 million Defense Logistics Agency grant to boost recovery of rhenium, needed for jet-fighter engines, at a copper operation in Utah. It’s also working on a project to boost U.S. supply of indium, used in touch screens and solar panels.To contact the reporter on this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, ;Edward Johnson at ejohnson28@bloomberg.net, Keith GosmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-produce-lithium-california-joining-010000309.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-21	2019-10-21 14:22:41	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Norway’s $1 Trillion Fund Builds Rio Stake After Dirty Mine Sold	(Bloomberg) -- After freezing out Rio Tinto Group for more than a decade for owning a highly polluting copper mine, one of the world’s biggest sovereign wealth funds has brought the company back into the fold.Norway’s $1 trillion wealth fund built a 1.4% stake in the world’s No. 2 miner by the end of September, according to Bloomberg data. That puts the fund among the top 10 holders of Rio Tinto shares, the data show.The investment demonstrates the value of meeting the increasingly aggressive environmental goals set by some of the largest money managers. Norway’s wealth fund is at the forefront of those efforts, and said earlier this year it would stop investing in companies that mine more than 20 million tons a year of thermal coal, the most polluting fuel. Miners including Glencore Plc and Anglo American Plc are set to fall foul of this rule.Norway refused to buy Rio Tinto stock for more than a decade because of the environmental damage caused by its Grasberg mine in Indonesia, one of the world’s biggest copper and gold projects. In June, the fund said it had revoked that exclusion, after a recommendation from its Council on Ethics.Rio agreed to sell its stake in Grasberg last year for $3.5 billion. The mine, operated by U.S. company Freeport-McMoRan Inc., is highly contentious. Every year it dumps tens of millions of tons of mining waste into an Indonesian river system and will continue to do so for years to come.Rio has sought to burnish its environmental credentials, becoming increasingly vocal on the subject. After offloading its last coal mine in 2018, the company has sought to distinguish itself from rivals that still have fossil-fuel exposure.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Dylan Griffiths, Nicholas LarkinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norway-1-trillion-fund-builds-142241863.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-27	2019-09-27 16:00:06	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Businesses Finally Think Big About Cutting Emissions	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s recent announcement that its operations will be carbon neutral by 2040 stands out for its sheer size. But Amazon is only one among dozens of companies that announced new carbon-intensity benchmarks ahead of this week’s United Nations General Assembly.It’s hardly a new phenomenon. Eighty-one percent of S&P 500 companies had set emissions-reduction or energy-use targets by at least four years ago. But many of these amounted to business as usual; the goals were set according to existing regulations, or emission-abatement projects already underway. Today’s targets are more ambitious, because they’re based on science.That is, the targets are set to enable companies to do their share to lower emissions enough to keep warming under 2 degrees Celsius, the scenario outlined in the UN Paris Agreement. They’re the first targets to align the private sector with the larger fight against climate change.And that’s important, because companies have so much work to do. New research from BloombergNEF has found that the 237 companies that had approved science-based targets through July 2019 (with a cumulative market cap of $6.5 trillion) will need to collectively reduce their emissions by 139 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2030.This is equivalent to eliminating half of Spain’s annual emissions. And the total will only grow as hundreds more companies set targets.Certain industries will have an easier time than others hitting their marks. Utilities, for example, which are expected to account for 60% of the emission reductions in BNEF’s analysis, have already been switching to clean energy from coal and natural gas. On the other hand, materials manufacturers, which produce emissions via energy-intensive chemical processes, will have a harder time achieving their goals.Unfortunately, science-based targets have yet to be set for several of the world’s heaviest-emitting businesses — including agriculture, which produces 24% of global emissions, and the oil and gas industries, which produce 10%.   All this adds context to a recent announcement from Rio Tinto Plc that it will work with China Baowu Steel Group and Tsinghua University to lower the steel sector’s emissions. Rio Tinto does not actually have any emissions from steel-making; it produces only the coal and iron ore inputs. Its steel-making customers are the emitters, but Rio Tinto can help by exerting influence on their activities. That matters, because steel production accounts for 7% of all carbon emissions. Those emissions are hard to account for, and hard to abate — and therefore, all the more worth addressing with science-based targets.To contact the authors of this story: Nathaniel Bullard at nbullard@bloomberg.netKyle Harrison at kharrison17@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mary Duenwald at mduenwald@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nathaniel Bullard is a BloombergNEF energy analyst, covering technology and business model innovation and system-wide resource transitions.Kyle Harrison is a BloombergNEF analyst focused on corporate energy strategy.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/businesses-finally-think-big-cutting-160006672.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-29	2019-08-29 04:01:13	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	There May Be a Fortune Buried in a Forgotten Corner of Europe	(Bloomberg) -- The ancient scooter gurgling through a languid summer afternoon brought groceries and a fistful of cash to Sasa Antic’s house. Like many of his neighbors, the 30-year-old Serb hasn’t had a job for some time so the family relies on the arrival of his mother’s pension.Yet buried in the ground beneath this forgotten corner of former Yugoslavia is the prospect of becoming a new European front in the economic battle with Asia. Geologists are exploring the hilly landscape for the metal that’s become ubiquitous in modern technology: lithium.“It would be a godsend if they can prove lithium reserves,” said Antic, as his mother counted out the dinars handed to her by a merchant who also delivered milk, rolls and butter to them in Klinovac, a hamlet of barns, stone houses and more goats than cars. “This is the least developed part of Serbia and we are at a dead end.”The global hunt for lithium is afoot as companies look to cut fossil-fuel use. BloombergNEF estimates battery demand for lithium material will grow eightfold over the next 11 years.Serbia’s estimated deposits are the largest in Europe and the insatiable appetite for batteries that power everything from iPhones to Tesla cars is prompting the likes of Rio Tinto Group to study the viability of mining it.President Aleksandar Vucic in February called it “one of the biggest hopes for Serbia” and urged companies to speed up work to start production. At the heart of Serbia’s lithium dreams is the terrestrial equivalent of kryptonite—the fictional rock from Superman’s home planet—discovered in 2004. The mineral, dubbed “jadarite”after the Jadar Valley, has a similar chemical structure to the compound that can be used to erode the superhero’s powers. It contains lithium and boron, which is used in ceramics, fertilizers and insulation.In central and eastern Europe, the Czech Republic and Austria are also studying the potential of lithium mining. Romania is re-opening mines for rare earth minerals. And international companies are expanding battery production in the region, including Daimler AG and Johnson Matthey Plc in Poland.But Serbia’s lithium lode, if it can be profitably extracted, is big enough to help the continent compete with Asian development, especially in China, the world’s third-largest producer of lithium and the top maker of lithium-ion batteries. Rio Tinto, one of the world’s largest mining companies, and Australia-based explorer Jadar Lithium Plc are testing just how much lithium there is in Serbia. Rio Tinto declined to comment. Jadar Lithium, which includes a group of unknown investors represented by JPMorgan Chase & Co., declined to pinpoint exactly where they are looking.Optimistic government estimates and preliminary exploration suggest there may be as much as 200 million tons of deposits in Serbia, while the U.S. Geological Survey said there were 1 million tons of identified reserves in the country, making it one of the richest sources of lithium in Europe.With global lithium production up by about 25% in 2018, according to the USGS, assigning an accurate ranking for Serbia may be difficult, as there is still little concrete data on the country as exploration continues, said BNEF’s Sophie Lu. Bolivia, for example, has no production despite what might be the world’s largest reserves.And a concern over a glut in lithium supplies that has sent prices tumbling. That prompted Albemarle Corp., the biggest producer of the metal, to put the brakes on plans to boost production. A worsening downturn in China could also deter potential investors—the prospects are bad enough that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has cut recommendations for six mining companies in its coverage. Though any extraction is still at least three years away, Serbian authorities are also advocating for the development of downstream activities, such as refining and battery production.Opening a battery factory would be key to raising living standards, said Nenad Antic, the deputy mayor of Vranje, the closest city to the Jadar Lithium exploration.He estimates that production would cut the unemployment rate in the city of 80,000, where about 10,000 have no jobs. Rio Tinto, on its website, called Jadar a “significant value for Serbia,” and said lithium and boron “play important roles in a more energy-efficient future.”Jadar Lithium, a company with A$4 million ($2.7 million), is in the south, studying an area between the Vranje and the border. The company has completed two phases of soil sampling and has detected a “number of areas with elevated lithium and borate values,” it said in a July filing to the Australian Securities Exchange.Luke Martino, Jadar Lithium’s chairman, said that Serbia could become a hub for the industry, from extraction to refining and battery production.“We are really on the quest over the next three to five years to explore and make a discovery and then link in with downstream producers and expand the company that way,” Martino said in a phone interview from Sydney. “We know China has locked up a lot of supply. So it’s Europe’s challenge here to start to centralize its own production of batteries and lithium hydroxide plants.”Across the hills and down a farming road several kilometers from Klinovac, Zoran Filipovic stood at his ramshackle gate and surveyed what is left of the dying village of Panevlje.“Opening a mine here would breath in new life,” Filipovic said. Right now “there’s absolutely nothing for young people. There is some manual labor to do around here, but otherwise it’s desolate.” &#92;--With assistance from Irina Vilcu, Lynn Thomasson and Patricia Suzara.To contact the authors of this story: James Gomez in Prague at jagomez@bloomberg.netMisha Savic in Belgrade at msavic2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Balazs Penz at bpenz@bloomberg.net, Rodney JeffersonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/may-fortune-buried-forgotten-corner-040113586.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-20	2019-08-20 06:22:23	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	BHP Should Stand Pat on Copper	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- All major miners agree that copper has a bright future. The trouble is how to get at it. Take BHP Group, set to be the world’s biggest producer this year after Freeport-McMoRan Inc. sold down its stake in Indonesia’s Grasberg mine. Costs at BHP’s massive Escondida pit in Chile, which accounts for about one in 20 tons of copper mined globally, keep on disappointing. They’ll rise from the current $1.14 a pound to a range of $1.20 to $1.35/lb next year, the miner said in annual results Tuesday, well above its ambitions to keep them shy of $1.15/lb.When the copper price is trading close to three-year lows at $2.61/lb, that still makes for a pretty profitable business. But with  production for the whole copper business seemingly capped at around 1.75 million metric tons a year, it isn’t clear where volume growth will come from. Miners love copper because it’s seen as a way to make a bet on a clean-energy future. Electric cars contain between four and 10 times as much copper as conventional ones, and wind and solar generators are forecast to consume 813,000 tons annually by 2027. It’s not clear that projects currently in the pipeline will be sufficient to produce enough metal to keep the market supplied once those sources of demand start ramping up around the middle of the next decade.BHP’s main expansion at the moment is an extension of its Spence mine in Chile, which is set to go into production by December next year. That should add about 185,000 tons of annual production – barely enough to offset the the gradual exhaustion of the Cerro Colorado and Antamina pits, which have less than a decade of reserve life left in them.Beyond that is the potentially massive, geologically difficult expansion of South Australia’s Olympic Dam mine. That pit has long been a challenge. Its significant uranium content would make BHP a major and low-cost producer of the atomic fuel. The risk, though, is that such a large influx of supply would crash the uranium oxide market and weaken the high-stakes economics of the project itself. In theory, there ought to be interesting opportunities for M&A in the current environment. Freeport, for instance, could almost double BHP’s copper production, and has a lot less political risk attached now the long tussle with Jakarta over Grasberg is over.With return on capital employed of about 11%, it’s outperforming the underlying 6% return in BHP’s copper business and could be bought for about nine months’ cashflow. But with Elliott Management Corp. still a lingering presence on the shareholder register, management are unlikely to want to do anything too splashy. Indeed, BHP’s rivals are prime examples of the risks that can be run from being too bold around copper. Rio Tinto Group’s Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia could cost as much as $1.9 billion more than forecast, with first production from the expanded project delayed until the middle of 2023, the company said last month. Glencore Plc this month announced plans to shut its Mutanda copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo due to rising costs and weak pricing for cobalt, an important by-product from the operation.There may be a lesson in that. For all the billions BHP has spent on copper over the past decade, its returns from the red metal are still among the worst in the group. Rather than chasing volume, it might be better off watching the pennies, letting the market tighten and hoping prices rise to justify the money that’s already been spent. When the cards on the table look weak, there are worse things to do than just stand pat.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-08-08	2019-08-08 17:36:04	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Tinto CEO Defends Company as ‘Cash Machine’ Amid Stock Retreat	(Bloomberg) -- As plummeting iron ore prices weighed on Rio Tinto Group’s stock for a seventh-straight trading day, CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques defended the miner as a “cash machine” that will keep rewarding shareholders.“We have a cash machine,” the chief executive officer said Thursday in an interview on Bloomberg TV. The “strong quality of the asset portfolio will generate cash no matter where we are in the cycle.”The world’s second-largest miner had been on a roll this year, with a strong first half anchored by surging prices for iron ore more than offsetting operational setbacks at its top-earning business. But prices for the key steelmaking ingredient have tumbled this month, and taken Rio with it. The London-based company’s shares have fallen 12% since July 30.Another looming hurdle for Rio has been slowing growth in China, by far the world’s biggest steel producer. Jacques tried to ease those concerns by saying that the Asian nation would use stimulus spending to maintain steel production, including by rebuilding older cities.“One thing that maybe people don’t see clearly is China is launching, or is going to launch, a program to renew the cities, the buildings that were constructed 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago,” Jacques said. “We fully acknowledge that China is slowing down, but as expected China is managing the slowdown pretty well.”&#92;--With assistance from Thomas Biesheuvel.To contact the reporters on this story: Matt Townsend in New York at mtownsend9@bloomberg.net;Joe Deaux in New York at jdeaux@bloomberg.net;Jonathan Ferro in London at jferro10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-ceo-defends-company-173604039.html?.tsrc=rss

The yuan's move on Monday was viewed as a clear sign China would not back down in the face of President Trump's threat of new tariffs on imports, meaning the trade conflict may get worse.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-miners-hit-china-woes-083659726.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-08-05	2019-08-05 00:53:15	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	The Top Miners Are Split on How to Chase the EV Battery Boom	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest miners, including BHP Group and Glencore Plc, are finally firm believers in the electric vehicle battery revolution -- what they don’t agree on is which metals will deliver the best long-term exposure to the developing global market.BHP has revived a declining nickel unit in Western Australia to target the sector, while Rio Tinto Group is accelerating work to enter the lithium market. Glencore is focusing on cobalt and copper and Anglo American Plc is examining prospects for platinum and palladium to be deployed in future battery technologies.“We did a review of all the battery input materials -- nickel, cobalt, lithium,” said Eduard Haegel, asset president at the BHP’s Nickel West unit. “We think that in the medium-to-longer term there will be a margin that will be sticky for nickel -- we think it’s an attractive commodity.”BHP, the biggest miner, this year reversed long-term efforts to seek a buyer for the division, opting to retain Nickel West to benefit from forecast growth in lithium-ion batteries and a scarcity of high-quality nickel supply. From the second quarter of 2020, the unit will begin production of bright-turquoise colored nickel sulphate -- a premium raw material for the battery supply chain -- from a nickel refinery south of Perth, with plans to potentially carry out the industry’s largest expansion.The outlook for battery materials is firming as governments set targets on phasing out combustion engine vehicles, and as automakers commit to expanding line-ups of electric models, according to Angela Durrant, a Sydney-based principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “The demand profile is certainly becoming more clear,’’ she said.Deployment of more than 140 million electric vehicles by 2030 will require 3 million tons more copper a year, 1.3 million tons of nickel and about 263,000 tons of cobalt, according to Glencore Plc’s forecasts. By 2040, almost 60% of new vehicle sales and about a third of cars on the road will be electric, BloombergNEF said in a May report.BHP sees an abundant global supply of lithium, and regards cobalt as at risk of substitution, reducing the attractiveness of both commodities, Chief Financial Officer Peter Beaven said in a May speech. Rio also remains wary over cobalt, while Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg said in 2017 the company has “zero interest’’ in lithium, in part because of a lack of arbitrage opportunities.Picking winners hasn’t been helped by price gyrations. Key battery metals have faltered in the past year after dramatic gains. That’s chiefly been on concern that incumbents and new producers have added too much volume too quickly, as well as on short-term worries over a slower pace of growth in China’s electric vehicle market, the world’s largest.Lithium prices tripled between mid-2015 and May last year on fears of shortages and have since slumped more than a third as new mines started up. Cobalt in London quadrupled in the two years to March 2018 before tumbling by almost three-quarters.Even as they warm to the battery theme, major mining companies aren’t yet prepared to move beyond familiar commodities and remain cautious on acquisitions, said Robert Baylis, managing director at Roskill Information Services Ltd. “They don’t want to stray too far from the nest,’’ he said. “Some miners have instead concentrated on developing their own existing projects.’’Base metals are more traditional ground for the largest producers, and nickel is increasingly in focus. Vale SA’s Indonesian unit and partners have outlined plans to invest about $5 billion on nickel projects, in part aimed at the battery market, while Rio has expanded exploration work to find new deposits in nations including Uganda and Finland.BHP’s sales to the battery sector of nickel products now account for more than 75% of the unit’s total production, up from less than 5% in 2016, according to Haegel, who will speak Monday at the Diggers and Dealers mining forum in Kalgoorlie, alongside Rio’s head of growth and innovation, Stephen McIntosh.“It makes sense that these companies are primarily focused on copper and nickel,” said Sophie Lu, Sydney-based head of mining and metals for BNEF. The companies typically already have producing assets and both metals “display significant growth potential in the future from batteries,” she said.Nickel has jumped about a third this year as global inventories decline amid better demand in traditional stainless steel markets and expectations for longer-term battery growth. Battery-grade nickel may face a deficit by 2024 as demand rises, according to BNEF.“We’ll always say they are a lithium battery, but actually the weight is in the nickel – that’s the biggest volume of material,’’ said Wood Mackenzie’s Durrant.To contact the reporter on this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Keith Gosman, Phoebe SedgmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-miners-split-chase-ev-005315012.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-31	2019-07-31 10:30:56	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Glencore’s Troubles Pile Up While Rivals Get Rich on Iron Ore	(Bloomberg) -- The bad news just keeps coming for Glencore Plc -- this time out of Africa.The commodities giant has had a tough few years, from corruption probes to getting caught up in the fallout from U.S. sanctions on Russia. This year, it’s been forced to watch from the sidelines a breathtaking rally in iron ore, a metal Glencore doesn’t produce at all, while rivals like BHP Group and Rio Tinto Group cash in.The list of headaches got a little longer Wednesday, as the company warned it will take a $350 million hit to its fabled trading business when it reports first-half earnings next week, after prices for cobalt plunged. Glencore also signaled it’s likely to cut the target for copper production this year as it struggles with mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Glencore has underperformed its major rivals this year, even after announcing bumper share buybacks. While other producers benefit from the rally in iron ore, the pressure on Glencore’s shares from probes by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Department of Justice has been compounded by a rout in prices for thermal coal, one of the company’s major profit drivers.“With still no certainty on the DoJ investigation, a lack of momentum in operations, with lower coal prices eroding cash flows, the current discount in Glencore shares is likely to persist in the absence of more significant management action,” said Tyler Broda, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “The cobalt price drop continues to wreak havoc on the marketing books.”Cobalt has quickly transformed from a star performer to a headache for the world’s biggest producer of the key battery ingredient. After quadrupling in two years, prices have now collapsed back to the lowest since 2016 as new supplies pour into the market. With few hedging tools available, that’s left Glencore exposed.Excluding the cobalt loss, Glencore expects first-half trading profit of about $1.3 billion. It said previously that full-year profit for the unit would be toward the middle of its $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion long-term range.Glencore has cut its cobalt sales in response to falling prices, but is still mining the metal from its African copper mines. The company said the loss from cobalt will be principally non-cash and described the inventories it’s holding as an “unrealised profit lag.” Effectively, the company’s marketing business has bought the cobalt from its mining unit, but has yet to sell it.Read: Cobalt’s Drop to 2-Year Low Tarnishes Glencore’s Trading JewelThe disappointing trading performance is a blow for Glencore, which has always said its traders can make money in any kind of market. The company touts the unit as a differentiator from other big miners, cushioning the ups and downs of the commodities cycle. The marketing unit deals in almost 100 raw materials including oil and agricultural products.Last year’s trading profit was $2.4 billion, the lowest since 2013, with Glencore pointing to weak results from cobalt and alumina trades.The cobalt losses aren’t Glencore’s only headache from its African copper business, which operates mines across the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia.Glencore’s Katanga Mining Ltd. unit, where the company has taken tighter control after Canadian regulators fined and banned executives, is reviewing its mine plans and is likely to lower output expectations. Glencore’s Peter Freyberg, who has joined Katanga’s board, will discuss the turnaround plan at the company’s earnings next week.“Our African copper business did not meet expected operational performance,” billionaire Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg said in a statement. “We have moved to address the challenges at Katanga with several management changes as well as overseeing a detailed operational review.”While African copper is a relatively small part of Glencore’s overall business, the unit gets a disproportionate amount of interest from investors given both its role as one of the company’s key drivers of growth and a source of legal and operational risks.When the company reports earnings next week, analysts are expecting sharply weaker results.It’s been a different story for Glencore’s rivals this year. Even though Rio Tinto has struggled at its giant iron ore mines in the Pilbara, it’s been bailed out by the surge in prices and is expected to report a big jump in profits tomorrow. Anglo American Plc last week reported bumper earnings, driven by iron ore.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Liezel Hill, Nicholas LarkinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/glencore-troubles-pile-while-rivals-103056706.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-25	2019-07-25 10:04:29	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Mining Executives Split on Who Bears Burden of Climate Change	(Bloomberg) -- The mining industry is starting to split on who bears responsibility for all the carbon emissions caused by smelting iron ore into steel.The debate came to the forefront this week after BHP Group’s chief said miners need to tackle their role in global warming through the products they sell. The core of BHP’s business, digging up iron ore in Australia, is a key part of making steel, an energy-intensive process that accounts for about 7% to 9% of all man-made carbon emissions.It’s a controversial view in the industry and opposed by Rio Tinto Group, which has argued that targets for indirect emissions are beyond its control. Anglo American Plc weighed in for the first time on Thursday, saying it’s too early to address pollution created by customers.“We’re somewhere in between the two,” said Anglo Chief Executive Officer Mark Cutifani, referring to the stances taken by BHP and Rio Tinto. “There is a bit more work to be done on our side before we decide whether we can commit.”“Once you take a position you’re committed. We want to make sure it’s exactly the right position to take,” he said.Read: BHP Pledges $400 Million in Climate Change InvestmentThe debate among the world’s top miners shows how climate and global warming is becoming a bigger issue facing all companies. Executives face growing pressure from investor groups, who argue for more stringent targets on emissions, and the threat of divestment if they don’t comply.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Liezel HillFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mining-executives-split-bears-burden-100429687.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-21	2019-07-21 22:00:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Iron Ore Market Looks to Top Miner for Clues on End to Shortages	(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA’s second-quarter production due next week may offer clues on whether the world’s largest iron ore producer could provide some relief to a market reeling from shortages that sent prices to a five-year high.Analysts, on average, expect the Rio de Janeiro-based miner to report Monday that output of the steelmaking ingredient rebounded to 74.6 million metric tons, from 72.9 million in the three months ended March, according to five estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s still below the 96.8 million tons Vale produced in the second quarter last year.A dam collapse in January forced the company to halt operations with capacity equal to almost a quarter of this year’s original production target of 400 million tons. While Vale has managed to bring its 30-million ton Brucutu mine back to normal operations, that hasn’t halted the surge in prices. Rivals BHP Group and Rio Tinto Group also saw their output decline, deepening the supply shortfall.&quot;The focus should be around plans for restarting any additional capacity,&quot; Scott Schier, an analyst at Clarksons Platou Securities, said in an interview. &quot;There’s been some chatter about a potential restart of some more operation in September-October.&quot;Iron ore prices have surged more than 60% this year in Singapore this year amid the supply disruptions in Brazil and Australia. Futures closed 3% higher at 916 yuan ($133.10) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange Friday, the highest since December 2013.In May, Vale Chief Financial Officer Luciano Siani Pires said the company expects to bring back online another 30 million tons in shuttered capacity over the next six to 12 months, after Brucutu returns to normal operations. Reviving the remaining 30 million tons would take another two to three years. The miner has maintained its 2019 sales guidance for iron ore and the semi-processed material called pellets at 307 million to 332 million tons.HSBC Holdings Plc analysts expect a tighter iron ore market longer-term because of &quot;significant supply disruptions,&quot; and better demand prospects through 2021. The bank raised its 2019 price forecast for iron ore to $95 a ton, from $82.80 in mid-July.Rio Tinto’s iron ore production fell 7% to 80 million tons in the second quarter from a year earlier, as a result of a cyclone and operational challenges at its mines. Annual output from BHP’s Australian mines slipped about 2% to 269.6 million tons, missing an average forecast of 272 million tons among five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Vale’s iron ore and pellets sales likely rebounded to 70.6 million tons in the second quarter, from 67.7 million three months earlier, according to the average of five analyst estimates. That’s still down from 86.5 million tons a year earlier.&quot;We expect supply will take at least two to three years to normalize given the magnitude of the tragedy at Vale,&quot; HSBC analysts including Jonathan Brandt said in a note July 14. &quot;A combination of supply disruption from the major iron ore producers and better-than-expected steel production in China has led to a significant rally in iron ore prices.&quot;To contact the reporters on this story: Vinícius Andrade in São Paulo at vandrade3@bloomberg.net;Sabrina Valle in Rio de Janeiro at svalle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, ;Brad Olesen at bolesen3@bloomberg.net, Joe RichterFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iron-ore-market-looks-top-171755279.html?.tsrc=rss

The country owns 34% of the mine, Mongolia's biggest foreign investment project, but lawmakers claim delays and cost overruns have meant it has run up more debt from the project than income thus far.  Ending the 2015 ""Dubai agreement"" that launched Oyu Tolgoi's underground expansion would likely reduce Rio's future profits in Mongolia's favour."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-under-fire-mongolia-100555720.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-16	2019-07-16 23:09:25	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	BHP Forecasts Iron Ore to Rebound After Annual Output Declines	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group forecasts iron ore production will rise as much as 6% this fiscal year after output slumped to a first annual decline because of a train derailment and a cyclone that deluged Australian ports.Total production from Australia is estimated to jump to between 273 million and 286 million tons in fiscal 2020 after recording its first annual decline since China’s steel boom began at the start of the century. Annual output fell to 269.6 million tons in fiscal 2019, missing an average forecast of 272 million tons among five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Key InsightsBHP expects the impact of higher operational costs and other productivity setbacks to total $1 billion in annual results to be published next month, a figure which includes $835 million of losses from unplanned production outages in the first halfWeaker output in iron ore will be offset by this year’s surge in prices that’ve jumped on strong demand and supply outages in Brazil and Australia. The steel-making material advanced 71% in the first six months, and is trading close to a five-year high, Mysteel Global data shows. BHP’s rival Rio Tinto Group on Tuesday reported quarterly shipments fell 3% on a year earlierWork to improve car dumpers in the iron ore unit will impact output this quarter, while BHP will carry out a major maintenance program at the Port Hedland export hub through the year under plans to lift capacity to 290 million tons. China’s steel industry is defying a bearish outlook on the nation’s growth, posting record daily production rates in June. Crude steel output rose 10% from a year earlier and run-rates were equivalent to more than a billion tons a year, according to data published MondayBHP forecasts copper output to rise as much 8% this fiscal year, while the producer’s oil and gas unit is projected to see production fall as much as 9% on maintenance at Atlantis and natural field decline.The producer expects an increase in the total cost of its provision for the 2015 Samarco dam failure in Brazil and is currently reviewing assumptions. BHP sees a $260 million charge for its share of work to decommission Samarco’s upstream tailings dams, as the asset won’t generate cash flow to cover the work.Market ReactionBHP’s Sydney-traded shares have gained 27 percent in the past year, compared to a 30 percent advance by rival Rio Tinto Group.

2019-07-14	2019-07-14 14:00:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Could Fast-Track Key Australia Copper Find Before U.S. Asset	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group’s much-followed copper discovery in remote Western Australia could leapfrog a key U.S. project to be fast-tracked into production by the world’s No. 2 miner, according to a senior executive.Work is progressing to assess the size and quality of the Winu exploration project in the Paterson province in the state’s north, Copper and Diamonds Chief Executive Officer Arnaud Soirat said after visiting the discovery for the first time this month.Dependent on further exploration work, the discovery -- where Rio now has as many as 190 staff, about 12 drilling rigs and is constructing a gravel airstrip -- could move ahead of the Resolution project in Arizona in the producer’s pipeline.The company is already advancing an underground expansion of the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia that’s scheduled to boost production from the early 2020s and expects key studies on Resolution to be completed by 2021. Rio has been working on the Resolution project — a joint venture with BHP Group — since 2004, and disclosed the first key details about Winu in February.“If the deposit is right, and the metallurgy is right, then potentially” Winu could come before Resolution, Soirat told reporters Friday at the Argyle diamond mine, also in Western Australia. The site looks “not that difficult to mine from what we have seen so far, and so potentially it’s a mine that could come in between” Oyu Tolgoi’s expansion and the development of Resolution, he said.Demand GrowthCopper demand is seen growing about 2-3% a year, driven by urbanization, greater adoption of renewable energy generation and rising demand for electric vehicles. Rising global living standards as developing nations urbanize will require about an extra 428 million tons of copper by 2050, or about two-and-a-half times the current amount of the metal installed today, according to Glencore Plc.While the Winu find, about 350 kilometers (220 miles) southeast of Port Hedland, has excited investors and competitors -- prompting some to pour over satellite imagery to gauge the project’s potential -- more assessment is still needed, Soirat said. Additional drilling this year should allow Rio to understand “how rich the deposit is, and how big it is as well,” he told reporters.Exploration staff are also ready to begin studying potential other targets nearby, according to Soirat. There’s potential that the Winu discovery could be part of a much a larger system that may eventually host multiple different mines, Rio’s CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in May.“This is also a very big mining license, so we will also be looking at other potential sites in the region,” Soirat said. “There are some signs where our exploration team are saying it would be worth going to having a look.”Soirat also said:In Mongolia, Rio is continuing to review the schedule and construction costs of Oyu Tolgoi’s underground development amid difficult ground conditions that have slowed the planned $5.3 billion projectCo. is “looking at potential options” for copper acquisitions, but doesn’t regard M&A as a “must” and hasn’t found options that represent value Co. is studying options to further extend the life of the Kennecott mine in Utah, and investigating potential options to carry out selective underground mining at the siteRio’s projects are “nicely timed to come online at a time when everyone expects the market to start becoming under-supplied,” he said To contact the reporter on this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Keith GosmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-could-fast-track-key-140000499.html?.tsrc=rss

China will report its second-quarter gross domestic product level on Monday — and the economy’s year-on-year growth rate could easily slow to the weakest pace since Beijing began publishing quarterly readings in 1992.

2019-07-12	2019-07-12 06:03:01	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Australian Thermal Coal Leaves Investors Cold	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When you’re in the business of buying and selling, timing is everything.That’s the costly lesson facing BHP Group, which is looking at options to divest its thermal coal assets according to a report Thursday by Thomas Biesheuvel of Bloomberg News that cited people familiar with the matter.Arch-rival Rio Tinto Group raised $2.7 billion selling mines in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney to Yancoal Australia Ltd., in a process that started in 2016. BHP could get far less: Macquarie Group Ltd. estimates $1.6 billion. That’s despite the fact that BHP’s Mount Arthur and Cerrejon mines, in the Hunter Valley and Colombia, post roughly the same Ebitda as as the ones Rio Tinto sold. BHP has had good reasons to keep operating these mines. They’ve produced several years of good earnings, for one. Mount Arthur has probably been even more profitable than it looks on paper, thanks to its ability to utilize tax losses that will now be running low.Still, it will be galling to sell at a discount when the long-term price for the high-energy coal mined in the Hunter Valley is now about a third higher than the $63 a metric ton level at the time Rio Tinto’s deal was announced.What’s changed? More or less everything.Back in 2016, coal was still the lowest-cost way of delivering new generation in most major markets. The slumping price of wind and solar generation since then has changed the game. Thermal coal will fall to 11% of U.S. generation by 2030 from the mid-20s at present, S&P Global Ratings wrote in a report Wednesday; outside of Spain and Germany, most European coal-fired plants will be retired by 2025.North Asian markets supplied by Mount Arthur look like an exception, with Japan, South Korea and China making up about 80% of Australia’s thermal coal exports. The first two countries are rare cases where falling renewables costs have failed to undercut the black stuff.Even there, though, the picture is dimming: Japan’s coal-fired capacity will go into to decline starting 2023, and actual demand should fall faster since its most recent plants use fuel more efficiently, according to a report this week by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a research group opposed to fossil fuels. South Korea now has taxes on coal amounting to $60 a ton and imports will fall by half by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency.The group of potential buyers looks thin, too. Anglo American Plc, which has a one-third stake in Cerrejon alongside BHP and Glencore Plc, doesn’t seem in the mood for bulking up. The Japanese trading houses that have historically been major investors in Australia’s mining industry, meanwhile, have been quietly divesting strategic coal stakes for several years. What does that leave? Glencore, despite a promise in February to cap coal output, shouldn't be ignored. In that announcement, the commodities trader noted it may still buy out some minority stakes, which seems to anticipate a deal on Cerrejon. Glencore could also, in theory, get rid of its South African operations and replace them with Mount Arthur, keeping total output within limits and swapping in a more profitable mine. That would depend on finding a buyer for those South African mines, though, and there’s enough turmoil in that country’s coal and energy sector as it is.China is another possible buyer for Mount Arthur. The pit is adjacent to Yancoal’s existing operations, suggesting possible synergies. Still, 2019 isn’t the best year to be doing this. Since February, the country has been holding up shipments of Australian coal for ill-defined reasons that have a whiff of geopolitics about them. Any Chinese business looking for government approval to buy an Australian coal mine will have to reckon with that.Beyond that, there’s even the possibility that smaller local miners will have a go. In the old days, the idea that a relative minnow like Whitehaven Coal Ltd. could absorb a pit the size of Mount Arthur would have seemed absurd, but at Macquarie’s estimate of a $600 million price tag it’s not impossible. Based on BHP’s latest results, a buyer could pay off that sum in 18 months or so and run the mine for cash, assuming rehabilitation costs weren’t too high. Still, how times have changed. Back when Rio Tinto was hawking its coal assets, the company could plausibly argue that it still saw a bright future for the stuff. Nowadays, BHP is warning that it could be “phased out, potentially sooner than expected,” even as it’s trying to tempt buyers. Those M&A bankers are going to have their work cut out to get a good price.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-07-12	2019-07-12 05:50:20	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	The World’s Biggest Diamond Mine Is Closing	(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest diamond mine⁠—famed more for the fistful of coveted pink and red gems it yields each year than being a major producer of lower-quality stones—is being shuttered by Rio Tinto Group after almost four decades. Rivals from Russia to Canada hope that can help turn around the beleaguered industry.Rio’s Argyle mine in remote Western Australia has transformed the sector since 1983 when the operation began supplying gems for both ends of the market. RBC Capital Markets and Panmure Gordon are among brokers, banks and competitors forecasting the closure could kick-start prices that have waned since 2011, according to PolishedPrices.com, an industry data provider.Production at Argyle, about 2,600 kilometers (1,600 miles) northeast of the state capital Perth, is scheduled to end before the end of next year after finally exhausting its supply of economically viable stones, said Arnaud Soirat, Rio’s head of copper and diamonds. “There is going to be a fair bit of supply which is going to come out of the market,” Soirat said in an interview Friday at the mine site. “In late 2020 we’ll be stopping operations and will start the rehabilitation of the site.”Argyle is best known as the source of about 90% of the world’s prized pink diamonds—rose-to-magenta hued stones that command among the sector’s highest prices. Sotheby’s auctioned the 59.6 carat “Pink Star”, mined by Rio’s rival De Beers, for $71 million in April 2017, a record auction price for any gem. While they attract most attention, the pink stones account for less than 0.01% of Argyle’s total output. The mine also is the biggest diamond producer by volume and that’s what has put the operation at the center of global oversupply. More than three-quarters of Argyle’s output is composed of lower-value brown diamonds, and the mine’s overall output sells for an average of between $15-$25 a carat, Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. estimated in 2017. That’s far less than the $171 a carat average price realized last year by De Beers.A glut of cheap and small diamonds has eroded profits for nearly every miner and made it increasingly hard for the industry’s cutters, polishers and traders to make a profit. In December, some of Rio’s customers refused to buy cheaper stones, while De Beers has been forced to cut some prices and offer concessions to buyers.Yet, with consumer appetite for diamonds stable, and major mines including Argyle scheduled to shutter, “the rational offset between supply and demand should lead to price growth,” Stornoway Diamond Corp. Chief Executive Officer Pat Godin said in March. Declining output, led by Argyle’s closure, will help revive prices, Toronto-based producer Mountain Province Diamonds Inc. said in May. About 21 million carats a year of global diamond production—including about 14 million a year from Argyle—are scheduled to exit the market by 2023, a volume that’ll only partially be offset by the addition of new mines, according to Russia’s Alrosa PJSC, the world’s diamond biggest producer. The shortfall between annual demand and supply could be between 11 million and 35 million carats by 2023, the company said in a presentation last month.“In terms of the pink diamonds, the impact is going to be even more dramatic” from Argyle’s closure, Rio’s Soirat said in the interview. “You can imagine the laws of supply and demand will apply, and you can imagine the impact that will have on those very rare pink, red, blue and purple diamonds.”The producer estimates Argyle has only about 150 colored diamonds of sufficient quality left to extract and make available for its annual tender, a sale to invited buyers that showcases 50-to-60 of the year’s most valuable gems, he said. Prices of pink diamonds have already as much as quadrupled over the past 10 years, and buyers are “now just waking up to the potential impact that Argyle’s closure will have” in lifting values further, said Frauke Bolten-Boshammer, proprietor of Kimberley Fine Diamonds, a retailer based in the town of Kununurra, about 200 kilometers north of the mine. She has traded the gems since the 1990s.Overall, the diamond sector probably also needs a boost to downstream demand, according to Richard Hatch, a London-based analyst at Berenberg. Mine closures that tighten supply “will help, but is it the shot in the arm that the industry really needs? Probably not,” Hatch said.Buyers have been hit by a shortage of finance and stagnant end markets, while a weaker rupee has made gems more expensive for Indian manufacturers, who cut or polish about 90% of the world’s stones.The closure of Argyle will remove about 75% of Rio’s diamonds output, yet the impact on the producer’s earnings will be negligible. Diamonds bring in only about 2% of earnings, while iron ore—the company’s top commodity⁠—accounts for almost 60%.Rio in 2016 shuttered the Bunder development project in India and in 2015 exited the Murowa mine in Zimbabwe. The producer’s only other producing diamond asset, Diavik in Canada, is scheduled to close in 2025, though exploration work is continuing to potentially extend that site’s life, Soirat told reporters Friday at Argyle.Still, the company aims to retain a presence in the sector. While it could consider acquisitions to add new output, Rio’s main focus is on exploration⁠—an option that’ll take longer to deliver new output growth. Work is advancing on the Fort a la Corne project in Saskatchewan, a joint venture project that potentially could enter production within five to 10 years, Soirat said.Diamonds is “not a big business in Rio, however it is a very profitable business,” he told reporters, adding that the company has advantages in the sector that it can look to continue to exploit, including technical expertise and branding. “It’s not a commodity, it is luxury goods, and so the market dynamics are completely different.”  To contact the authors of this story: David Stringer in Melbourne at dstringer3@bloomberg.netThomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Keith Gosman at kgosman@bloomberg.net, Alexander KwiatkowskiFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-biggest-diamond-mine-closing-055020671.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-11	2019-07-11 12:38:37	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	BHP Is Latest Giant Miner to Plan Exit From Thermal Coal	(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group is moving ahead with plans to exit thermal coal, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest move by the world’s biggest miners to retreat from the dirtiest fuel.BHP is looking at options to divest the business that includes assets in Australia and Colombia, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the development has not been made public. There’s no guarantee the company will go ahead with a sale, the people said.The decision demonstrates how growing climate-change pressure from investors and regulators is reshaping the future of extractive industries. Rival Rio Tinto Group has already removed all exposure to thermal coal and other producers including Anglo American Plc have been cutting output amid growing pressure from investors. Even Glencore Plc, the biggest shipper, has said it will look to limit production.BHP had already signaled cooling interest in thermal coal. Earlier this year, Chief Financial Officer Peter Beaven said the company had no appetite for growth in the commodity.While thermal coal makes up a fraction of BHP’s profits, it’s led to some investors saying they can’t hold the stock.Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund last month got the green light to dump more than $13 billion in stocks linked to fossil fuels, including companies that mine more than 20 million tons of thermal coal, pushing Anglo American and BHP out of reach. Climate Action 100+, which has the backing of more than 300 investors managing $32 trillion, has already forced reforms from extractive giants such as BP Plc and Glencore.For BHP, thermal coal has become increasingly hard to justify. The company’s profits are driven by iron ore, oil, copper and coking coal (used to make steel) and thermal coal is likely to contribute just 1% of profit this year, according to Liberum Capital Markets.BHP’s move comes as its biggest rival, Rio, has become increasingly emboldened on climate change after offloading its last coal mines last year. The company has started promoting itself as the only major miner without exposure to fossil fuels.The move is also likely to put further pressure on Anglo, which, despite dramatically cutting its coal output, still mines almost 30 million tons a year.Still, exiting coal is unlikely to be easy for BHP. Its Colombian mine stake, which it owns with Anglo and Glencore, feeds the European market where demand is weak right now. Capacity could be cut in the country to balance an oversupplied market, Liberum estimated.Macquarie Group Ltd. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are seen as frontrunners to run a sales process for the BHP assets, the people said.Macquarie said earlier this year that BHP’s Australian thermal coal business had a net present value of about $600 million and estimated the figure for its Cerrejon business in Colombia at about $1 billion.(Updates with charts and context.)&#92;--With assistance from Dinesh Nair.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Liezel HillFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bhp-latest-giant-miner-plan-123837318.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-04	2019-07-04 08:24:24	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Iron Ore's ‘Disconnected From Fundamentals’ After Huge Rally	(Bloomberg) -- First, iron ore hit $100 a ton, then it raced straight to $110, and now spot prices are well north of $120: the commodity’s rally has been so strong it’s triggering warnings that the gains have taken the market beyond fundamental drivers and prices are likely set for a pullback. Futures tanked.“Prices are disconnected from fundamentals at the moment,” CRU Group Senior Analyst Erik Hedborg said in an interview from London, citing improving global supply and expectations that mainland steel consumption may soften. “We are rather bearish on Chinese steel demand for the second half.”Iron ore has skyrocketed this year, hitting the highest level in more than five years, after a dam disaster at Brazil’s Vale SA and bad weather in Australia curtailed shipments just as Chinese demand expanded. The steelmaking material made another dash higher in recent weeks after Australian miner Rio Tinto Group cut output guidance again following operational problems. The ascent has spurred concerns the advance may prove to be unsustainable.“Supply is looking pretty decent, with the exception of Rio,” Hedborg said. Exports from Australia in June should be strong as some miners ramp up in the last month of their financial year, he said. In Brazil, Vale has also restarted its Brucutu mine, a major operation that was suspended after the dam collapse.Benchmark spot ore hit $127.15 a ton on Wednesday, the highest since 2014, according to Mysteel Global. Prices have risen for the past six days, the best run since 2017, after surging 18% in June. They are expected to hold near $100 this half and average $95 over the full year, according to Hedborg.Rally in DalianIn the futures market, there are signs gains may be excessive. On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, prices have surged more than 75% this year, and the most-active contract’s 14-day relative-strength index had held above 70 for the past four days, a figure that suggests the rally may be overdone. On Thursday, futures in both Dalian and Singapore lost more than 4%.There are also indications that seaborne supplies are picking up, with Hedborg emphasizing the restart in Brazil of Anglo American Plc’s Minas Rio operation, which had been shuttered for most of last year after two pipeline leaks.Top miners including BHP Group are estimated to have shipped 301 million tons in the second quarter, up 14% from the January-to-March period, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., which tracks vessels. In Australia, exports from Port Hedland -- the main maritime gateway in the top shipper -- set a record in May for that month. June figures are due in the coming days.Other forecasters have flagged expectations for a softening of prices this half and into 2020. In its latest global market outlook, Australia’s Department of Industry, Innovation and Science forecast that free-on-board prices would average $80.10 a ton this year and decline to $61.40 in 2020. Morgan Stanley has predicted a gradual drop back to $90 a ton in the fourth quarter.“The price now is very, very high,” said Hedborg.(Updates Bernstein shipment estimate in eighth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Krystal Chia in Singapore at kchia48@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Phoebe Sedgman at psedgman2@bloomberg.net, Jake Lloyd-SmithFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iron-ores-disconnected-fundamentals-huge-055425176.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-01	2019-07-01 06:45:12	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Australia's Iron Exports to Drop for First Time in 18 Years	(Bloomberg) -- Iron ore exports from Australia are set to post the first annual drop in almost two decades following bad weather and output setbacks, worsening a global shortage and bolstering prices that have already surged to a five-year high. Futures advanced.The world’s top shipper cut its 2019 forecast to 814 million tons from 867 million in March and boosted its estimate for this year’s average price by almost 20%, according to a report by the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science on Monday. That would be the first contraction since 2001. Last year, Australian exports totaled 835 million tons.Iron ore has soared above $100 a ton, driven by the twin forces of supply disruptions in Brazil and Australia and strong demand from steel mills in China. This will push the value of Australia’s exports to A$79 billion ($55 billion) in fiscal 2020, reflecting higher prices that are largely due to Vale SA’s dam disaster in January, the department said.“The iron ore price is expected to be higher than previously forecast -- and for a longer period -- due to the limited capacity of other operations in Australia and elsewhere to ramp up and replace Vale’s production loss of high-grade supply, at least in the short term,” the report said.On Monday, futures on the Singapore Exchange surged as much 6.3% to $120 a ton, the highest since 2014, while the contract in China jumped 4.1%. Benchmark spot ore was last at $118.05 a ton, according to Mysteel Global. In Sydney, miners’ shares rose.Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group both revised down their annual production outlooks in the wake of Cyclone Veronica in the first half, and Rio in June further lowered its output target after problems at its sprawling operations in Western Australia.“The seaborne iron ore market is thus likely to stay tight, and prices elevated, out to at least 2021,” the report said.Global seaborne iron ore supply is forecast to decline by 4.1% to around 1.5 billion tons in 2019, driven by events stemming from the dam collapse, the report said. Vale’s production is expected to gradually recover over the next three years, with the full recovery in its production hinging on 60 million tons of production associated with the use of tailings dams, the department said.At the same time, steel production in China is heading for a record year, the department said. Infrastructure stimulus and good margins will aid the sector, although production will gradually decline through 2021. The world’s largest steelmaker had pushed run-rates to a record above 1 billion tons a year, according to Bloomberg calculations based on official statistics.An expected slowdown in global economic growth in 2019 and 2020 is a key risk to the outlook, and will likely to lead to less demand for steel-making inputs — metallurgical coal and iron ore, the report said. However, China is expected to respond to slowing growth and U.S.-China trade tensions by loosening monetary policy and increasing government spending on infrastructure and construction projects, it said.(Updates prices in fifth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Krystal Chia in Singapore at kchia48@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Phoebe Sedgman at psedgman2@bloomberg.net, Keith Gosman, Jake Lloyd-SmithFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/australias-iron-ore-exports-drop-140000537.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-25	2019-06-25 10:29:53	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Walmart Is Now Ethical Enough for Norway’s $1 Trillion Wealth Fund	(Bloomberg) -- Norway’s $1 trillion wealth fund revoked its more than decade-long exclusion on Walmart Inc. after the U.S. retailer tightened control over potential human rights abuses in its supply chain.Walmart has made “positive developments” in monitoring its suppliers, the fund’s Council on Ethics said in a statement released Tuesday.“Furthermore, the company engages actively in selected, high-risk areas in order to help bring about improvements in working conditions,” the council said in a letter. “There seem to be fewer reports of poor working conditions in Walmart’s supply chain now than there were before.”The fund also decided to revoke exclusions to Grupo Carso SAB de CV, General Dynamics Corp., Nutrien Ltd., Rio Tinto Ltd. and Rio Tinto Plc, as well as Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB de CV, according to a statement.General Dynamics was let in from the cold after discontinuing the production of cluster munitions while Grupo Carso is no longer involved in tobacco, according to the fund. The exclusion of Nutrien was revoked after it ceased purchases from Western Sahara and Rio Tinto was taken off the list after it agreed to sell its Grasberg mine in Indonesia, reducing the risk of “severe environmental damage.”Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, takes into account ethical rules encompassing human rights, some weapons production, corruption, the environment, coal and tobacco when deciding on its investments.Runar Malkenes, a spokesman at Norway’s central bank, said the recommendations to revoke the exclusions were made over time, but the bank found it “appropriate” to publish all seven decisions at the same time. It’s part of the council’s mandate to regularly reassess exclusions, he said in an email.

2019-06-21	2019-06-21 05:00:00	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	The Winners and Losers From Surging Iron Ore Prices	(Bloomberg) -- In the world of metals and mining, sometimes it’s better to sell the raw product rather than the finished one.This seems to be a lesson for investors who chose to hold shares in ArcelorMittal rather than Rio Tinto Group this year. Despite nagging trade tensions and fears about global growth, Rio is up 30% in 2019, while the world’s biggest steelmaker has dropped 16%.Global diversified miners have rewarded investors with record payouts and benefited from soaring iron-ore prices due to the supply concerns that followed Vale SA’s dam disaster in January. At the same time, Chinese mills have continued to set new production records, consuming more of the steelmaking ingredient.Rio Tinto was carried by a “perfect storm,” said Arnaud du Plessis, a senior portfolio manager at CPR Asset Management in Paris, citing iron ore’s gains of about 75% in a year, the star performer among commodities. “Rio, which is highly exposed to iron ore and which benefits from very low production costs, has been the clear winner.” The London-based miner draws investors because of its strong balance sheet and high free cash flow generation, he said.The gains might not be over. Jefferies analysts including Christopher LaFemina said in a June 12 note that Chinese iron-ore inventories continue to dwindle and should reach critically low levels in the second half of the year. Further economic stimulus from the Asian giant is also likely to support demand, with Rio Tinto among the main beneficiaries, they said.Iron ore scaled new highs this week after Rio Tinto cut its production guidance, piling more pressure on supplies despite Vale’s authorization to restart a shuttered site.Weak AutosThe forces that have made Rio Tinto a winner have partly been the cause of ArcelorMittal’s woes. The rising cost of its key raw material have pressured the steelmaker’s margins, while higher production in China and U.S. tariffs on imports have pushed European manufacturers into overcapacity, further weighing on prices.Du Plessis noted that U.S. steel prices have fallen by more than 40% over the past year. “As a highly leveraged company, ArcelorMittal has not been in a good position at all,” he said. “As it’s highly exposed to the automotive market, the weak environment for that industry over the recent period has also affected ArcelorMittal.”ArcelorMittal has responded by cutting production, while the industry is lobbying the European Commission for further safeguard measures to stop cheaper Chinese steel from flooding the market. Goldman Sachs analyst Eugene King this month upgraded European steelmakers, saying margins are showing signs of inflection, while a decline in iron ore prices could provide further relief.A positive outcome in China-U.S. trade talks planned around the G-20 meeting in Japan at the end of June could be the ultimate catalyst steelmakers need to start outperforming again. Further dovishness from central banks could also support global growth, as well as a recovery in the carmaking industry, among the biggest consumers of steel materials.“Trade war resolution will be key for the rest of the year,” said Du Plessis. The fund manager prefers Rio Tinto over ArcelorMittal as long as the crisis remains unresolved. Under a positive outcome, ArcelorMittal could outperform initially, with Rio Tinto lagging behind it, especially after its recent outperformance, he said.ArcelorMittal’s current trading levels suggests it may be an attractive value proposition, offering 46% return potential over 12 months, according to the consensus of analysts tracked by Bloomberg. In contrast, the average analyst consensus sees Rio Tinto as fairly priced. The problem might be that at the moment, few investors are keen to bet on value.To contact the reporter on this story: Michael Msika in London at mmsika4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Blaise Robinson at brobinson58@bloomberg.net, John Viljoen, Jon MenonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/winners-losers-surging-iron-ore-050000506.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-20	2019-06-20 08:29:49	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Rio Tinto Renews Work on Giant Guinea Iron Ore Deposit	(Bloomberg) -- Rio Tinto Group is looking at new ways to develop the giant Simandou iron ore deposit in Guinea that it almost sold last year, according to people familiar with the matter.Simandou is one of the world’s biggest untapped mineral deposits, but has a controversial past. For more than a decade, it has been the center of a bitter dispute that includes Vale SA and Israeli mining tycoon Beny Steinmetz. An agreement to sell the project collapsed last year, and Rio now appears increasingly committed to finding a way to build it.The second-largest miner has rehired consultants to work with its own team to study how the mine can be developed, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The work also focuses on how to export material out of the country, they said. The company all but shelved the project three years ago, so much of the work is based around updating its old plans.A spokesman for Rio declined to comment.Simandou has caused much trouble for Rio -- the company is subject to criminal probes, two executives were dismissed over payments and it’s still refusing to pay bonuses to its former chief -- but the potential riches are too high to easily walk away from. The miner has been exploring the asset since the 1990s, attracted by a resource that’s now estimated at more than 2 billion tons.The deposit came to prominence in 2007 as Rio fought off a hostile takeover bid from larger rival BHP Group. At the time, Rio used the resource to argue that the company was undervalued. Yet within a year, Rio was stripped of half its rights to the deposit and they were handed to Steinmetz. They were then stripped from the Israeli billionaire in 2014.Part of the deposit’s allure is that it contains some of the highest quality ore, a product in high demand from steelmakers as it’s less polluting. Rio views this as a long-term structural change in the market and that ore from Simandou will be in demand for decades.Still, there are huge challenges to navigate. The biggest is that under Rio and Chinese partner Aluminum Corp. of China’s original agreement with Guinea, the company committed to building a $12 billion rail line across the country, more than doubling the mine development cost. The government has long insisted the track is essential for national development. Any updated plan to develop the mine must be agreed with Chinalco and the government.Guinea has since said some smaller projects can exit through neighboring Liberia, where ArcelorMittal operates a railway. The steelmaker has said that rivals can only use capacity it doesn’t need and it’s working on plans to expand its own production.Rio’s latest work on the project could also make it easier to sell should it decide against development. The trouble with exporting ore has made the asset less attractive to buy, as shown by the collapse last year of a planned sale of Rio’s stake to its Chinese partner.Guinea has some of the world’s richest iron ore deposits, but has never exported anything. Yet there’s renewed interest in the country. Earlier this year, Steinmetz and Guinea agreed to end their dispute in a deal that’s led mining dealmaker Mick Davis to try and develop a project there. Billionaire mining investor Robert Friedland is in talks with BHP about taking control of another asset that has sat dormant for years.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Nicholas Larkin, Liezel HillFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-renews-giant-guinea-082949904.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-19	2019-06-19 13:46:01	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Investors Whipsawed as Iron Ore’s Dramatic Year Continues	(Bloomberg) -- Iron ore’s dramatic year continued Wednesday as investors were whipsawed by two big pieces of news with conflicting implications.First, Brazil’s Vale SA said it won court approval to revive operations at one of its biggest projects, a development that’s likely to help ease global supply concerns that had sent prices to a five-year high. But just a few minutes later, No. 2 miner Rio Tinto Group said it’s not going to be able to hit an already lowered output target this year after problems at its sprawling operations in Western Australia.The iron ore market has been on a roar since January after the fatal collapse of a dam in Brazil resulted in steep reductions in supply from Vale, the biggest shipper. Those supply concerns have been compounded by operational problems in Western Australia, where Rio and BHP Group mine.Today’s announcements come after iron ore prices renewed a surge in recent days, hitting the highest levels in five years. Prices have been driven higher as the effects of supply disruptions in Brazil ripple through to China, where port inventories have tumbled and steel mills are churning out record volumes.London-based Rio now expects to produce 320 million to 330 million tons this year. That’s less than an earlier goal of 333 million to 343 million tons. Vale’s restart could bring on an additional 5.4 million tons this year, according to BMO Capital Markets.Vale said today that Brazil’s Superior Court of Justice revoked the injunction stopping the iron ore miner from using its dam in Brucutu, clearing the way for the company to reopen the mine within 72 hours.That’s the third time the Rio de Janeiro-based miner signaled the return to normal operations at facilities that accounted for almost a third of the capacity that’s been shuttered since the fatal tailings dam disaster in January.“The net impact of Rio Tinto and Vale’s announcements is a further reduction in iron ore supply in an already tight market,” BMO analyst Edward Sterck said. “Price spikes in iron ore probably cannot be ruled out, but we still think that pricing is sufficient to stimulate swing supply.”Rio cut its guidance in April after a cyclone hit its operations in Australia, lowering an original target of 338 to 350 million tons. BHP Group, the No. 3 producer, also cut its target, adding to supply concerns.Rio shares fell as much as 5.4% in London trading. The stock is still near the highest level in more than a decade because of the rally in iron ore, the most important commodity for the company.To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Biesheuvel in London at tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Liezel Hill, Dylan GriffithsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-whipsawed-iron-ore-dramatic-134601537.html?.tsrc=rss

While some of the Anglo Australian company’s contracts are already publicly available — including the investment for the giant Oyu Tolgoi copper project in Mongolia — others are more difficult to find.  To solve that problem, Rio, a founding member of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, has created an online disclosure table with links to its development contracts, weighty legal documents that can be difficult for non-specialists to read.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9c5b9dfc-a326-3957-9e21-7ba38002a913/rio-tinto-reveals-government.html?.tsrc=rss

Today, the price of iron ore has jumped to a two-year high above $90 a ton after Vale, the world's top producer of the raw material used to make steel, was ordered to stop production at its mines following a horrific dam collapse in Brazil last month.  Iron ore is up 20% so far this year and is one of the best performers in the commodity spectrum.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5abfe0cd-54f4-3d3f-9d61-16b45f6ce774/why-iron-ore-is-up-20%25-this.html?.tsrc=rss

The world's largest iron ore miner is facing public ire and tougher regulation after the collapse of its tailings dam in the Brazilian region of Brumadinho killed at least 84 in one of the country's worst ever industrial disasters.  Vale on Tuesday said it would take up to 10 percent of its  output offline as it decommissions a total of 19 dams over three years, a move that would cut up to 40 million tonnes of iron ore production a year.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vales-brazil-disaster-prompt-buyers-104618974.html?.tsrc=rss

In the previous part, we noted that Alcoa’s (AA) 2019 earnings estimates look elevated.  Aluminum prices (RIO) are hovering near $1,800 per metric ton, while the Alumina Price Index is ~$400 per metric ton.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/76b36531-3ce5-376b-a6dd-d875488093af/alcoa-stock%3A-analysts-might.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-01-14	2019-01-14 14:50:02	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Alcoa: 2019 Might Be the Real Test	"Alcoa: Could There Be a Surprise in Its Q4 Earnings?

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Alcoa

As we noted previously, aluminum producers, including Century Aluminum (CENX), fell sharply last year and aluminum prices fell. Alumina was relatively strong in 2018 amid supply disruptions. While Alcoa (AA) stock also fell last year, its earnings were actually strong due to higher alumina prices (AWC). Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Alcoa to post an adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 billion in 2018, which is ~30% higher than its 2017 EBITDA.

## Fourth-quarter estimates

Looking at the fourth-quarter estimates, Alcoa is expected to post revenues of $3.35 billion in the fourth quarter. The company posted revenues of $3.39 billion in the third quarter and $3.17 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Alcoa’s adjusted EBITDA is expected to fall to $717 million in the fourth quarter from $795 million in the third quarter.

While Alcoa’s fourth-quarter numbers don’t look that bad, the real test could be in 2019. Analysts expect Alcoa’s adjusted EBITDA to fall to $531 million in the first quarter of 2019. Although analysts expect the company’s EBITDA to rise in the following quarters, the estimates seem to be assuming higher aluminum prices from the current levels.

## Key drivers 

Falling aluminum prices (RIO) have dented Chinese aluminum smelters’ profitability. Later in 2018, Chinese smelters decided on capacity curtailments. The situation is particularly bleak for smelters that don’t have captive alumina refineries. The alumina-to-aluminum ratio is elevated, which hurts standalone smelters’ earnings.

While alumina has come off its highs and the alumina-to-aluminum ratio has come down, it’s still high compared to historical averages. Alumina prices might fall more in 2019, which could hurt integrated producers like Alcoa. Alcoa’s fiscal 2019 estimates appear to be on the higher side compared to other metal prices.

Next, we’ll discuss how analysts are rating Alcoa before its fourth-quarter earnings release.

2019-01-09	2019-01-09 14:41:13	RIO	Rio Tinto Group	Why Goldman Sachs Expects Iron Ore Prices to Drop to $60	"Why Goldman Sachs Expects Iron Ore Prices to Drop to $60

## Resilient iron ore prices

As we noted in Is the Party Over for Commodities as China Steel Feels the Heat? in November, iron ore prices started collapsing after Chinese steel mills’ margins gave way.

In iron ore’s typical price pattern, prices once again started rising and increased ~11% in December. Prices have rallied back to over $70 per ton.

## Goldman Sachs says prices could drop to $60

According to Bloomberg, in a note released today, Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts, including Hui Shan, stated that while the industry’s fundamentals have improved, more supply is on the way, which should restrict the rise in prices.

The bank expects iron ore prices to fall to $60 per ton in the next six months. Goldman’s analysts argue that $75 per ton for iron ore is not sustainable for two reasons: “First, part of the rally was fueled by mills restocking ahead of the Chinese New Year. Second, supply is set to increase in 2019.”

## Downside ahead for iron ore?

Morgan Stanley (MS) also expects to see losses in the commodity (XME). On January 7, it said, “We’re iron ore bears from here, though, expecting falling crude steel output and growing seaborne supply to ultimately bring price back to the mid-low-$60s/ton.”

Moreover, big miners such as Vale (VALE), BHP (BHP), and Rio Tinto (RIO) have been enjoying higher premiums on higher-grade ore due to China’s switch in a bid to control pollution. This switch was supported by higher margins. As margins have waned, it seems like the party might be over for iron ore miners, at least in the short term. The producers of metals such as copper (FCX) and aluminum (AA) have also been under pressure due to China’s muted demand outlook.

The Oyu Tolgoi project is central to Rio Tinto's push to diversify its portfolio away from iron ore, but it has faced a series of challenges as Mongolia's fragile government wrangles over how to maximise benefits for the country.  The government of Mongolia owns 34 percent of Oyu Tolgoi with the remainder held by Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ.TO), which in turn is 51 percent owned by Rio Tinto.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-mongolia-sign-power-141904380.html?.tsrc=rss

BHP, Rio Tinto and a host of other miners are ramping up their exploration programmes in Australia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru as they race to replenish their existing copper resources.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/bfa92d1b-cd14-34df-a2ee-26ae35d9c8e7/%5B%24%24%5D-bhp-flags-potential-new.html?.tsrc=rss

Copper’s supply dynamics are also different from some of the other metals like steel and aluminum that face structural and chronic overcapacity, especially in China.  Most observers expect copper markets to enter into a structural supply deficit in the next decade as existing mines fail to churn out enough metal to meet the demand.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f08fc6b7-ca20-329f-91e7-528e39128bc6/copper-might-not-have-a.html?.tsrc=rss

In this article, we’ll look at China’s iron ore port inventories and what they suggest for iron ore prices. These inventories reflect the difference between demand and supply. Usually, if iron ore isn’t used up by steel mills, it piles up at ports. Therefore, increasing inventories reflect weak demand, and vice versa.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/c6b1644f-9690-37d5-a784-08936ce11875/iron-ore-inventories-stay.html?.tsrc=rss

Rio Tinto has come under scrutiny from officials in the U.S., U.K. and Australia over the handling of coal assets it purchased in Mozambique for about $4 billion in 2011, but which faced substantial writedowns and were later sold at just $50 million, a fraction of that price.  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission said Tuesday that it’s lodged new allegations against Rio Tinto, its former Chief Executive Thomas Albanese, and former Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott posing that the assets should have been impaired in the company’s 2012 interim financial statements.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0fe623a0-d0b8-3b96-92c4-965672c08c63/%5B%24%24%5D-australia-broadens-legal.html?.tsrc=rss

According to CNBC, Codelco CEO Nelson Pizarro stated that the world’s largest copper miner expects to produce “slightly more than 1.7 million tonnes of copper in 2018.” Codelco produced 1.7 billion pounds of copper last year, and the company expects its 2018 copper production to be similar.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3385207d-7dd1-387f-8989-8f8a66e1eab8/could-copper-markets-reach-a.html?.tsrc=rss

The US Commerce Department has recommended actions including a tariff and quota against aluminum imports under the Section 232 imports probe that was completed earlier this year.  While the news triggered buying interest in Century Aluminum (CENX), Alcoa (AA) actually closed with a marginal loss after the news broke out.  There is significant aluminum overcapacity in China, and the country’s exports have been on the rise, despite the much-publicized winter month capacity curtailments.	http://finance.yahoo.com/r/dafd654f-e2a5-3a5c-95bf-5eb6b2bec47d/whats-core-issue-facing-global-aluminum-industry?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=feed&yptr=yahoo&.tsrc=rss
