The regulator (CER) said in a written ruling that the change would have dramatically changed how shippers gain access to the 70-year-old Mainline, benefiting some with contracts while hurting others who lack them.

2021-05-11	2021-05-11 20:46:09	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Enbridge Vows to Keep Oil Moving as Michigan Deadline Nears	(Bloomberg) -- Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer says Enbridge Inc. has until Wednesday to shut a huge crude pipeline that crosses the Great Lakes. The Canadian company says it’s got the law on its side, and the oil will keep flowing.The standoff is the latest milepost in the increasingly tense dispute over Line 5, a 540,000 barrel-a-day line that supplies half of the oil and propane used by parts of the U.S. Midwest and Ontario.Whitmer argues the pipeline, built in 1953, is too exposed to potential accidents where it crosses at the Straits of Mackinac in the northern part of the state. But the two sides are in a court-ordered mediation, and Enbridge plans to keep the line running while that plays out -- prompting Whitmer to threaten to sue to take any profits it makes. The stakes are significant. Shutting the pipeline would require tens of thousands of trucks and hundreds of rail cars to transport oil and fuel by road, Enbridge has warned. Homeowners that rely on propane to warm their homes in Michigan could see prices increase. Airports in Detroit and Toronto receive jet fuel from local refineries supplied by Line 5.As the cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline has shown, the loss of a major pipeline, even temporarily, can roil markets for crude and refined products. Whitmer, who faces a potentially difficult re-election fight next year, is trying to shut the Enbridge line years before a replacement can be built.Canada submitted an amicus brief to a U.S. federal court in Michigan on Tuesday in an effort to boost Enbridge’s case. The document “coveys Canada’s belief that the U.S. federal court is the proper jurisdiction to hear the case between Michigan and Enbridge,” Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan said in an emailed statement.“We intend to continue to operate the line and certainly we’re in compliance with the easement and the law,” Al Monaco, Enbridge’s chief executive officer, said on an earnings call Friday. “Courts are reviewing the state’s challenge to the pipeline and that’s going to take a while. So no decisions, in our view, are imminent.”Read more: Gas Stations Run Dry as Pipeline Races to Recover From HackingThe dispute has soured relations between the U.S. and Canada three months after President Joe Biden, a Whitmer ally, angered Canadians by revoking a permit to the build cross-border Keystone XL pipeline. While the Keystone decision was disappointing, the continued operation of Line 5 is “nonnegotiable,” O’Regan said in an interview last month.The state of Michigan “intends to assert claims for trespass and unjust enrichment” and if it wins, the company will have to disgorge its future Line 5 profits, Whitmer said in a letter to Enbridge on Tuesday. Pipelines have become a major battlefront in the fight between the fossil fuel industry and environmentalists concerned about climate change and the impact of oil spills on waterways and indigenous communities. If Whitmer eventually gets her way, a Line 5 shutdown could mark the first time a major in-service oil pipeline is forced to shutter because of environmental concerns.A U.S. judge isn’t expected to rule on whether the case belongs in state or federal court until later this year, so don’t expect the pipeline to stop operating any time soon, Matthew Taylor, an analyst at Tudor Pickering & Holt, said in a note. “We view a near-term shutdown unlikely,” he said.Enbridge plans to address concern about Line 5 by building a tunnel under the straits to house a new pipeline. Should the existing one be shut, the company has some capacity on an alternate line that bypasses the Great Lakes “but it’s not going to make a difference,” Monaco said.The governor’s order is unenforcible without a separate order by a judge and there is “no way that’s going to happen” by the May 12 deadline, Joe Comartin, Canada’s consul-general in Detroit, said by phone. What’s more, the case is already before a federal court; any decision supporting the governor’s move would would be appealed in a process that would take years.On Wednesday, pro- and anti-Line 5 protesters are expected to gather in Michigan and there will probably be an exchange of harsh words between Enbridge and Whitmer, but nothing more, Comartin said. Even if the governor’s order were eventually upheld, Canada could invoke a 1970s-era treaty with the U.S. that prevents either government from blocking petroleum flows, he said.(Updates with Michigan warning to Enbridge about profit in third and ninth paragraphs.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-vows-keep-oil-moving-173030404.html?.tsrc=rss

Both governments are working to accelerate the energy transition, but their oil industries are interdependent, so a policy shift in one country can affect energy supply, and the political balance, in the other.  The United States imports more crude from Canada than any other nation, at about 3.7 million barrels per day, or about 80%of Canada's crude output.	https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/frustrated-canada-presses-white-house-050455651.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-13	2021-04-13 18:49:48	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Enbridge’s Great Lakes Pipeline Is ‘Nonnegotiable’ for Canada	(Bloomberg) -- Enbridge Inc.’s contentious oil pipeline crossing the Great Lakes is “nonnegotiable” for Canada, and Justin Trudeau’s government spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden to defend it.With the Canadian pipeline giant and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer locked in a legal battle over the state’s efforts to decommission Enbridge’s Line 5, Canadian Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan said he has reached out to all levels of government in the U.S. Legislators on both sides of the border have also held over 20 meetings to seek an agreement, he said. He declined to say what Canada would do if a court orders the line to be shut.“We have signaled very clearly that this is nonnegotiable,” O’Regan, 50, said in an interview. “We have made our case extremely clear directly to the President of the United States.”Tensions over cross-border energy projects have cast a shadow over the relationship between Biden and Trudeau. While the two leaders share many of the same values and have pledged to collaborate on the fight against climate change, they remain divided on the role of oil and gas in transitioning to a greener economy. On his first day in office, Biden canceled the permit for TC Energy Corp.’s Keystone XL pipeline, which would have transported over 800,000 barrels a day of crude from oil-rich Alberta to refineries in the U.S.“Line 5 is very different from Keystone XL and we fully support it, and we will defend it,” O’Regan said. “We made our case with Republicans as well as Democrats.”A mediation in the dispute between Michigan and Enbridge is scheduled to start on April 16.Originally built in 1953, Line 5 ships as many as 540,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids and serves as a key energy provider in Michigan, Ontario and Quebec. Its shutdown would disrupt jet fuel supplies for international airports in Toronto and Detroit.To address concerns over a potential spill, Calgary-based Enbridge is building a tunnel for the pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac between Michigan’s upper and lower peninsulas. In a recent interview, Chief Executive Officer Al Monaco argued the tunnel project is exactly the kind of infrastructure upgrade Biden is pushing for, and said that Enbridge is also lobbying the U.S. government on the matter.Enbridge to Biden: Lake Michigan Pipeline Tunnel Fits U.S. PlansScientists and environmentalists have raised concerns about the aging pipeline’s possible impact on the environment. A 2016 study from the University of Michigan found an oil spill could devastate as much as 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) of shoreline around Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.The Canadian minister said he’s “very clear-eyed” about the alternative to the pipeline, which he predicts would see thousands of long-haul trucks on a major highway between Canada and the U.S. The oil and gas “will get to market but I don’t think that’s in anyone’s best interest.”Despite their divisions on pipelines, O’Regan stressed that the Biden and Trudeau administrations agree on most issues. The U.S. and Canada are currently working on a joint initiative to lower emissions and coordinate climate policy.“I don’t want to take away too much from the fact that we are so well aligned with this administration on just about every front,” added the minister, who is from the eastern province of Newfoundland and Labrador.Critical MineralsCanada’s mining wealth is another important part of O’Regan’s portfolio as natural resources minister. Western allies are concerned about China’s domination in the critical minerals and rare earths, which are used to produce everything from batteries and cellphones to computers and solar panels.“Where we have seen some developments of critical minerals in the U.S. and in Canada, the Chinese have flooded the market and those operations have no longer been tenable, so we have to work with the Americans and with the European Union on this as well to make sure that we have a secure and profitable supply line,” the minister said.Canada is looking to position itself as an alternative supplier given its vast mineral resources. The government created a list of 31 minerals found in Canada to attract investor interest in its mining sector. The U.S. and Canada are working together to develop a cross-border plan on critical minerals, according to the minister.“You are going to see some significant movement between Canada and the U.S. on critical minerals,” he said. “I’d say watch this space.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-great-lakes-pipeline-non-184948480.html?.tsrc=rss

Enbridge to Biden: Lake Michigan Pipeline Tunnel Fits U.S. Plans	(Bloomberg) -- Enbridge Inc. wants to show the Joe Biden administration that the tunnel the Canadian company is building for its oil pipeline under Lake Michigan is exactly what the U.S. president’s plan for better infrastructure is all about.The tunnel project for the company’s Line 5, opposed by Michigan Governor and Biden ally Gretchen Whitmer, is the kind of upgrade that will make a crucial piece of infrastructure safer, Enbridge Chief Executive Officer Al Monaco said in an interview. The Calgary-based pipeline giant is engaging with the Biden administration to get that message across, he said.“Under the theme of ‘Build Back Better’ that the president has been talking about, it fits exactly,” Al Monaco said. “That’s what we are doing: We are modernizing an existing piece of infrastructure with a tunnel that reduces the risk to as close to zero as humanly possible, and we are doing it on our dime.”Enbridge is fighting Whitmer’s move last November to revoke an easement that permitted the pipeline to cross the lake bed, a decision that could force the system to shutdown by May. Meanwhile, Enbridge is pushing ahead with the tunnel project approved by Whitmer’s predecessor.Line 5 crosses the Straits of Mackinac between Michigan’s upper and lower peninsulas and supplies light oil and fuel to refineries and consumers in the U.S. Midwest and Canada.While the new U.S. president is aggressively seeking to promote spending on infrastructure, he has also canceled a key permit for the Keystone XL pipeline that would have carried Canadian oil sands crude from Alberta into the U.S.Al Monaco argues that blocking the existing Line 5 would trigger a crisis given its importance to Midwest refineries. The tunnel addresses concerns about potential oil spills into the water posed by ship anchors, for instance. A court-ordered mediation is scheduled to start on April 16.“It doesn’t make much sense to create a crisis when we have a solution there in the tunnel,” he said. “Protecting the Great Lakes is exactly what we’re doing.”Another project that Monaco says fits well with Biden’s goals is its Line 3. Enbridge is currently building a replacement to the aging cross-border pipeline with a new one that can pump increased volumes of Canadian crude into the U.S. Construction of the project in the U.S. only began in December after years of regulatory and legal delays. Protesters, including some indigenous groups, have regularly tried to disrupt construction, but Enbridge plans to finish the line on schedule, by year end. Horizontal directional drilling planned for the summer and eight pump stations are “on track,” he said.Canadian oil sands producers have struggled for years with a shortage of export pipelines, a situation that’s depressed prices for local crude oil. Projects to build new pipelines have faced environmental opposition and delays. But new pipelines such as the Line 3 replacement are being built, and large new project’s aren’t going to be needed, Monaco said.“We are going to see fewer projects generally in the next two to three years,” he said. “That’s less about opposition in my view and more about the fundamentals of energy. We’ve gone through a massive build in pipelines across North America, and so I think we’ve got enough capacity to keep us going for a while.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-biden-lake-michigan-pipeline-110000053.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-04-06	2021-04-06 10:00:00	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Enbridge Seeks Tax Credits for Push Into Hydrogen, CO2 Capture	(Bloomberg) -- Enbridge Inc.’s push into new frontiers of the energy transition such as carbon capture and clean hydrogen production could use Canadian tax credits similar to those in the U.S., the company’s CEO said.North America’s biggest oil pipeline company, which for years has invested in wind and solar power projects, is also looking at gaining scale and becoming competitive in technologies such as hydrogen production using renewable electricity. To get there, it’s seeking incentives in Canada like the $35 to $50 per metric ton of credits for CO2 sequestration and storage that exist in the U.S. under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code, Chief Executive Officer Al Monaco said in an interview.“It’s all about scale, and in order to achieve scale, you need some initial investment, and initial incentives,” Al Monaco said through video conference, adding that 45Q could be more generous. “We’re talking about it in Canada.”Enbridge last year became the first major company in the North American oil and gas industry to set a goal of eliminating all net emissions from its operations by 2050, joining European producers such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc, Total SE and Repsol SA. The industry, long the target of environmental groups, is under increasing pressure from shareholders managing trillions of dollars to address greenhouse-gas emissions such as methane.“From a capital markets perspective, if you’re not world class in ESG, it’s going to impact your cost of equity,” Al Monaco said of the growing investor push for environmental, social and governance policies.Critics say steps the oil and gas industry is taking won’t be enough to fight climate change because most of them don’t address the emissions from cars, homes and factories that burn fossil fuels.The Calgary-based pipeline giant’s efforts include building solar power generators to run pump stations along its oil and gas conduits, including the Alberta Solar One project that’s scheduled to start operating Tuesday. The company is already a major investor in offshore wind in Europe and on-shore wind farms in the U.S., and is talking with Canadian oil-sands producers about capturing carbon emissions and injecting the greenhouse gas back into the groundAt a power plant in Ontario, Enbridge is using excess electricity when demand is low to make hydrogen that can be burned when consumption increases, and it’s experimenting with blending hydrogen into the natural gas pool to make it cleaner.Hydrogen has emerged as a promising fuel in global efforts to cut emissions at industrial facilities, shipping and aviation. One of the biggest challenges is that, while hydrogen fuel cells only emit water when generating electricity, large-scale production of the clean gas itself still relies on coal-fired power plants in some parts of the world. Making hydrogen using renewable energy can cost as much as six times more than simply burning natural gas, the cleanest fossil fuel.In wind power, after starting years ago as a partner of developers like Electricite de France, Enbridge has already acquired development and operational capabilities, Al Monaco says.“We started participating more and more in management and construction with EDF,” he said. “We’re ready to compete with the best.”While outlining ambitions to become a major player in the renewables market, Enbridge’s primary focus continues to be on hydrocarbons, specifically building out its natural gas network. Al Monaco says gas will be key in the energy transition because it’s helping displace coal and it’s a good complement to renewables when there’s not enough sunshine or wind.He cautions that growing resistance to natural gas pipelines in the northeast of the U.S. could lead to price spikes such as those faced by California and Texas recently.“Natural gas is going to be a great enabler generally. We’ve got to keep hitting home the realities of the importance of natural gas, and importantly how it’s going to fit with reducing emissions, how it’s going to support green hydrogen, how it’s going to support blue hydrogen,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-green-push-could-canadian-233004697.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-24	2021-03-24 14:08:17	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	2 “Strong Buy” Stocks With at Least 7% Dividend Yield	President Biden ran for office on a platform that included, among other issues, a sudden shift in direction from his predecessor’s fiscal policy. Biden’s plans included sharp increases in spending – as exemplified by the $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill passed this month – and addressing the inequality gap. Part of the strategy could mean higher tax rates for those at the top – a reverse of Trump’s corporate and wealthy individual friendly 2017 tax law. As part of the plan, Biden and the Democrats are looking to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. The worry is, increases in taxes will put pressure on future corporate profits, perhaps by as much as 7%. That, in turn, will put downward pressure on stock values, as investors pull back in response and seek returns elsewhere. The easiest way to mitigate such concerns is to simply shift portfolio priorities from growth to dividends. While usually regarded as defensive stocks, dividend plays can make up an important part of any portfolio. Bearing this in mind, we’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up the latest scoop on two dividend stocks that offer investors more than just a dividend. Yes, the yield is there – at almost 7% or higher – but these stocks also offer Strong Buy ratings from the Street’s analysts and considerable upside potentials. In fact, some analysts see that upside exceeding 40%. Let’s dive in and look at the details. Enbridge, Inc. (ENB) We’ll start our look in the Canadian energy sector, where Enbridge is that country’s largest distributor of natural gas. Enbridge boasts a series of ‘bigs’ in the energy transport industry, including a 25% market share in the movement of North American crude oil, and the distribution of 20% of the natural gas used by US consumers. Enbridge also operates the third-largest natural gas utility in North America, counting by total customers. Enbridge saw big gains in earnings in its Q4 report, showing GAAP EPS increasing by 138% year-over-year to 88 cents per share. The C$2.25 billion in cash from operations was also a significant year-over-year gain. These strong quarterly results came even as the full-year results showed declines from the end of 2019. Enbridge finished Q4 with C$2.2 billion in distributable cash flow, up 10% from C$2 billion in 4Q19. For the full year 2020, this metric – which is used to fund the dividend payment – came in at C$9.4 billion, a modest gain from the 2019 value of C$9.2 billion. These funds were put to good use; the company raised its quarterly dividend in 1Q21 by 3%, to 83.5 Canadian cents per common share. For US investors, this comes to 65 cents per share. Enbridge has a long history of reliable dividend policy, and has made 26 consecutive annual increases. The current dividend yields 7.27%. No company exists in a vacuum, and Enbridge has gotten a boost from a recent transaction in the western Canadian oil sands. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners made a large purchase of midstream oil capacity from that region, in what was taken as a vote of industry confidence. Evercore ISI analyst Todd Firestone wrote of the transaction, “…it should boost other Canadian operators, in particular ENB (O/P). We also would add an important caveat in that it is clear ‘moat’ type assets will be increasingly valued and this is all the more clear given where political/environmental challenges are set to evolve; this should favor long haul pipes (NGLs at the top), fractionation, and export, and on the down the line with gathering assets at the other end of the spectrum.” In other words, Enbridge’s exact niche should see a boost. In line with this stance, Firestone rates ENB an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $55 price target suggesting room for 52% upside growth in the year ahead. (To watch Firestone’s track record, click here.) Firestone’s upbeat outlook on this stock is no outlier – Enbridge has received 12 Buy ratings, for a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus. The shares are selling for $36.82 and their $42.91 average price target implies a one-year upside of ~17%. (See ENB stock analysis on TipRanks) Brigham Minerals, Inc. (MNRL) For the second dividend stock, we’ll stick with the energy industry. The oil and gas companies have a long reputation for paying out strong dividends. Brigham Minerals owns mineral rights to several of the United States’ most productive hydrocarbon production regions, including the Bakken Shale of North Dakota and the Delaware and Midland basins of Texas. The company is also active in Colorado and Oklahoma. In its most recent quarterly report, Brigham showed a 10% quarter-over-quarter increase in mineral and royalty revenues, to reach $23.8 million. This supported an increase in the dividend, to 26 cents per common share. The current dividend increase is the second since the company had to lower the payments in response to the COVID epidemic and is indicative of returning confidence. At the new rate, the dividend yields 7.05%. Despite running a net loss, Brigham has seen strong share appreciation over the past year. In the last 12 months, the stock is up by 92%. The share gains, plus the high dividend yield, give investors two sources of return on this stock. Brigham is in the process of adjusting its dividend to hit a targeted payout ratio – a move that management is using to ensure the payment’s reliability, while also allowing a cash allowance for operations. Raymond James analyst John Freeman spells this out in his recent note on the stock, saying, “As we expected, the company reduced its payout ratio another 5% to 90%, resulting in an in-line distribution of $0.26/share. Recall that the long-term payout ratio target is unchanged at 75-80% range as MNRL seeks to retain cash flow to fund future acquisitions.” Freeman believes this is a positive move for the company, and adds, “Barring any extraneous circumstances, our base case assumes additional 5% step downs in each quarter until reaching the 75% target in 3Q21.” The analyst puts a Strong Buy rating on MNRL shares, and his $20 price target implies an upside of 45% for the next 12 months. (To watch Freeman’s track record, click here.) This is another stock with a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, this one based on 4 recent Buy-side reviews. Brigham Mineral shares are trading for $14.47 and have an average price target of $18.75; this gives a one-year upside potential of 32%. (See Brigham’s stock analysis at TipRanks.)

Enbridge Warns of Oil Shortages If Michigan Shuts Key Pipeline	(Bloomberg) -- Enbridge Inc. warned that refiners in central Canada and the U.S. Midwest would see crude supplies cut in half and propane costs surge for some homeowners if Michigan’s governor succeeds in shutting a key oil pipeline that crosses the state.Refineries in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania as well as those in Ontario and Quebec would have to find alternative means for securing crude oil should Line 5 be shut, requiring the building of new rail terminals and rail cars, Vern Yu, the company’s president of liquid pipelines, told Canadian lawmakers Tuesday. Michigan homeowners that rely on propane to warm their homes would see prices increase by 38 cents a gallon and airports in Detroit and Toronto would face jet fuel shortages.Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced in November that she is revoking an easement that permitted the pipeline to cross the lake beds in the Straits of Mackinac, a move that could force the systems to shutdown by May. The pipeline is a key conduit for the state’s fuel and a critical source of oil for refineries in both the U.S. and Canada. The move has drawn protests from Canada’s government, which has vowed to fight to keep the pipeline operating.“A shutdown of Line 5 would cause an immediate shortage of energy in the region,” he said. “It would drive up prices significantly, and the replacement would be years away.”The governor’s office didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. The case is currently in U.S. federal court and Yu said he doesn’t expect the line to be shut in May, but the risk remains that a court could eventually take such action. Yu said that the Canadian government needs to make the U.S. state and federal officials understand that the pipeline is a very important bi-national issue.The Line 5 dispute has highlighted Canada’s dependence on the U.S. for its energy needs. The only pipeline system that connects the oil fields of Alberta to Canada’s refineries in the east is Enbridge’s Mainline system, which transits through the U.S. before reentering Canada at Sarnia, Ontario.A total of 15,000 daily truck trips and 800 rail cars would be needed to supply fuel and oil to those reliant on the pipeline, Yu said.“We believe the pipeline is critical for the entire Great Lakes region,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-warns-oil-shortages-michigan-221220102.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-17	2021-02-17 19:27:36	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Campaign to Kill Off Libor Is Boosted by Landmark Bond Sale	(Bloomberg) -- A Canadian energy firm became the world’s first non-financial issuer to sell debt linked to the main Libor alternative, a boost for policy makers in their struggle to encourage market adoption of the new financial benchmark.Enbridge Inc., which operates oil and gas pipelines as well as other energy infrastructure, sold floating-rate notes on Tuesday pegged to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a U.S. replacement for Libor.Analysts predict more companies could now follow suit as regulators continue their multiyear battle to phase out the London interbank offered rate following global manipulation scandals.It remains entrenched in the financial system, even as key tenors are likely to retire at year-end. Only a fraction of the $200 trillion derivatives market has moved over to SOFR, making it harder to build a forward-looking term structure.The sale “represents an important milestone,” said Tom Wipf, vice chairman of institutional securities at Morgan Stanley and chairman of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, the Federal Reserve-backed body guiding the transition. “As market participants move away from Libor, we can expect a deterioration in Libor liquidity, and so we encourage everyone to prepare for the inevitable by moving to SOFR now.”Enbridge saw big demand. The order book was nearly six times oversubscribed, significant for a floating-rate deal. A representative for Enbridge did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“It’s absolutely a significant event,” said Marcus Burnett, director of SOFR Academy, which runs classes for banks and investors. “We know we can’t have a successful and broad-based transition unless non-financial corporates take part.”Investor appetite for floating-rate notes is picking up. Traders like interest payments that increase in line with the market, especially if inflation rises. The supply of floating-rate notes reached $10 billion in January, more than double the monthly average for 2020, according to data compiled by analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:“Eventually every firm will have to issue SOFR-linked debt, or use another index for its floating-rate debt. This is likely only the beginning as the transition away from Libor toward SOFR accelerates throughout 2021.”-- Ira F Jersey, Chief U.S. Interest-Rate StrategistInvestors are now watching for the U.S. Treasury to issue its first notes pinned to SOFR, which could provide an official seal of approval and set a wider market standard. The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee urged the department to get involved earlier this month, saying a SOFR-linked bond would increase liquidity.“We need the non-finance sector to embrace SOFR -- that will be critical for it to go mainstream,” said Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities in New York. “Non-financials have been reluctant and have been waiting for term SOFR. This is a sign that it can be done without.”While Tuesday’s issuance marks progress, there’s still very little SOFR-linked debt that exists. Recent high-grade deals from the banking sector include a $1 billion note from UBS Group AG and another from Credit Suisse Group AG.“I still feel banks will keep using Libor for long-dated contracts,” said Rajul Sood, senior director and head of commercial lending at Acuity Knowledge Partners, a financial research firm. “There’s still a lot of apprehension in accepting SOFR.”(Adds comment from Bloomberg Intelligence after eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/campaign-kill-off-libor-boosted-141143387.html?.tsrc=rss

Get the latest predictions in Benzinga's essential guide to the company's Q4 earnings report. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Enbridge EPS will likely be near $0.55 while revenue will be around $10.14 billion, according to analysts. Enbridge reported a profit of $0.47 per share when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $9.51 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin. View more earnings on ENB If the company were to report earnings in line when it publishes results Friday, earnings would be up 17.02%. Sales would be up 6.61% from the same quarter last year.

2021-01-26	2021-01-26 14:00:00	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Gas Pipeline Companies Pledge to Plug Leaks Amid Biden Threat	(Bloomberg) -- Major natural gas pipeline operators are committing to pare their carbon footprint and make their operations emissions-free by 2050, a pledge that could help ward off political attacks.The promise from the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America and its member companies -- which operate some 200,000 of the 300,000 miles of transmission pipes crisscrossing the U.S. -- is the latest industry pivot as Democrats take over the White House and Congress with vows to phase out fossil fuels.It is the deepest climate commitment yet by the group, building on a 2018 pledge to keep a better lid on methane, the primary ingredient of natural gas. INGAA companies embracing the 2050 goal include Kinder Morgan Inc., Williams Cos. and Enbridge Inc.The voluntary commitment applies to direct greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas transmission and storage facilities -- such as leaks from pipelines, tanks and compressor stations -- known as Scope 1 emissions. It also applies to so-called Scope 2 emissions, those generated from the energy INGAA companies consume as part of their transmission and storage operations.Click here to see Bloomberg Intelligence’s data on carbon emissionsIt does not, however, go further to encompass Scope 3 gas emissions generated when the natural gas is burned to generate energy.“One third of U.S. energy consumption travels through natural gas infrastructure today, and we don’t see that changing significantly in the foreseeable future,” INGAA president Amy Andryszak said by phone. The move is a recognition that natural gas plays an important role “in delivering affordable, reliable cleaner energy,” as well as “helping achieve overall, global climate goals,” Andryszak said.The group’s chief new net-zero goal means its member companies are committed to abolish or fully offset emissions from the power they use and their storage and transmission operations. It is aligned with existing pledges by some pipeline operators, including Williams, Enbridge and DTE Midstream LLC.It also dovetails with INGAA’s previous support for direct federal regulation of methane emissions from oil and gas wells -- despite opposition from some other segments of the industry. Under former President Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency abolished explicit limits on methane leaks from the oilfield.Now that the Biden administration is preparing to reverse Trump’s move, the American Petroleum Institute and Chamber of Commerce have said they will back the approach.INGAA’s pledge is part of a broader industry pitch to promote natural gas and fossil fuel infrastructure as an essential part of even a warming world -- not just enabling the transition to emission-free renewable power sources. Pipeline operators are highlighting how their equipment can be used to carry cleaner fuels -- including hydrogen-blended natural gas and renewable natural gas captured from landfills and hydrogen-blended natural gas.“We view natural gas as a foundational fuel. It’s not a bridge fuel” and “isn’t something that we see going away,” said INGAA Vice President Sandra Snyder. “It’s so important to have natural gas available because we need fast-ramping power generation so that we have consistent and reliable service.”INGAA’s new effort comes as President Joe Biden promises new policies to slash greenhouse gas emissions and aims to make U.S. electrical grid emissions-free by 2035. Without advances in carbon capture, that’s a potential death sentence for natural gas.Environmentalists also have warned against building more natural gas pipelines and export facilities, arguing that those investments lock in longer use of the fossil fuel.The association is not singling out specific technologies to help pare greenhouse gas emissions nor outlining explicit emissions-reductions benchmarks before 2050. But it is highlighting how greater energy storage can buttress renewable power. And it is looking more closely at the fuels carried inside its pipes -- including the potential for transporting new, lower-carbon fuels through existing or re-purposed infrastructure.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gas-pipeline-companies-pledge-plug-140000194.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-18	2020-12-18 18:23:26	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	7 Canadian Stocks That Are the Feather in America’s Hat	"As someone who lives and breathes the Canadian way of life, I often get called on by InvestorPlace to write about Canadian stocks to buy. 
Some obvious names that trade on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq come to mind. Many of them depend on America for much of their livelihood. It’s why the latest U.S. election cycle has been mesmerizing television for Canadian business executives. 
In November, CEOs across Canada and those operating from within the U.S. were definitely sweating the details. After all, when the U.S. sneezes, Canada catches a cold. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
As professor Richard Leblanc notes, “There really isn’t an industry that’s immune from what happens south of the border. What goes on, goes right to the top very quickly.” Leblanc teaches governance, law and ethics at York University in Toronto.
Well, Joe Biden won and Donald Trump lost. Canada will now get ready to see how the relationship shifts — and it always does after a change in presidents.


					7 Growth Stocks You Don't Want to Sleep On				

So, for this article, I’m recommending seven Canadian stocks that generate a significant amount of their revenue in the United States. As the headline reads, each one could be considered the feather in America’s hat.
Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU)
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)
BRP (NASDAQ:DOOO)
Enbridge (NYSE:ENB)
Toront0-Dominion (NYSE:TD)
Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI)
FirstService (NASDAQ:FSV)

Canadian Stocks to Buy: Lululemon (LULU)
Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com
	
I remember when I first recommended this apparel brand back in August of 2016. I called LULU stock a top 50 S&P 500 investment over the next decade. The only problem was it wasn’t part of the index — and still isn’t. 
At the time, Lululemon’s sales in the U.S. accounted for over 60% of its fiscal 2015 revenue of $$2.1 billion (Page 61). In the company’s fiscal year 2019, U.S. sales accounted for over 71% of its $4 billion in annual revenue. 
Despite an increase in the percentage of sales generated in the U.S. over these four fiscal years, the company also did an excellent job of growing sales in its home market of Canada and overseas. 
As big a deal as this pick of the Canadian stocks was four years ago, it’s an even bigger deal today. 
On Dec. 10, it reported Q3 2020 sales that grew 22% year-over-year (YOY), despite a serious downturn in walk-in traffic due to Covid-19. CNBC reports that Neil Saunders, the Retail Managing Director at GlobalData, said, “While a V-shaped recovery may not be materializing for most of apparel retail, Lululemon has bounced back from the weak start to its year with a stunning set of third-quarter numbers […] Our data also show that Lululemon has picked up plenty of new shoppers, especially in womenswear.”
So, when it comes to retail, Lululemon is one of the best stocks to own — and it just happens to be run out of Vancouver.

Shopify (SHOP)

Given the returns of tech stocks in 2020, Shopify’s performance — a year-to-date (YTD) total return of 195% through Dec. 18 — seems almost pedestrian. 
The reality is, though, that SHOP stock is having a good year and (barring some major change in consumer shopping habits) the company’s e-commerce platform will remain in demand for companies of all sizes. 
As InvestorPlace’s Faisal Humayun stated recently, Shopify is crushing it. 
“From a financial perspective, the company reported cash and equivalents of $6.1 billion [as of the end of September],” Humayun wrote on Dec. 14. He added, “In addition, with improving operating leverage, I expect operating cash flows increase in the coming years. This will allow the company to continue aggressive investments in growth and research and development.”
The last time I covered SHOP on a single-stock basis was in April, when it traded around $525. At the time, I wondered if the stock would be heading to $650 or back to $350, where it traded during the March correction. 
I concluded that if you were holding Shopify stock for the long haul — say 2-3 years — buying in the $500s wasn’t a bad call. Now, it has doubled from April prices to over $1,170 per share.


					The 7 Worst Performing Stocks of 2020				

Heading into 2021, I don’t know if SHOP will double again. However, solid returns definitely appear to be in the cards for this one of the Canadian stocks, given its business model’s undeniable strength. 

BRP (DOOO)
Source: faak/shutterstock.com
	
BRP stands for Bombardier Recreational Products, but you probably better know its brands — Ski-Doo, Lynx, Sea-Doo, Can-Am, Alumacraft boats and more. While the company’s heritage is in snowmobiles, it has also grown to become a big seller of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and side-by-side vehicles (SSVs). 
In the third quarter ended Oct. 31, BRP had sales of over 1.67 billion CAD (over $1.31 billion), 1.9% higher than in the same quarter a year earlier. However, on the bottom line, it had operating profits of 284.3 million CAD (about $223 million), nearly 37% higher YOY. 
As a result of a more profitable sales mix in fiscal 2021, the company is expected to grow its normalized earnings per share (EPS) by about 37% this year, despite an overall 1.4% decline in sales. Consumers are paying top dollar for its year-round products (ATVs, SSVs) and that’s showing up on the income statement. 
In November 2018, I recommended investors buy Polaris (NYSE:PII), BRP’s biggest rival. Right now, it’s up marginally over the two-year period. At the same time, DOOO stock is up 177% over the same period.   
As it continues to gain global market share, I expect BRP to keep delivering strong double-digit returns for shareholders in 2021, earning its place on this list of the best Canadian stocks.

Enbridge (ENB)
Source: Shutterstock
	
In 2019, Enbridge generated 30.1 billion CAD ($23.6 billion) in the United States, accounting for roughly 60% of its overall revenues (Page 120). In the past two fiscal years, ENB’s sales in Canada have grown by 10.4%. South of the border, however, they grew by a more robust 14.4% over the same period. While that might not seem like a big difference, when you’re talking about over 50 billion CAD in annual revenue, it’s noticeable. 
Now, most of the Canadian stocks on this list are growth-oriented stocks. But Enbridge — whose energy infrastructure helps keep North America running — is a combination of value, growth and income. 
On Dec. 8, the company declared a 3% increase in its quarterly dividend to 83.5 cents CAD. The annualized dividend rate of 3.34 CAD yields a very healthy 7.8%. Plus, with 3.95 billion CAD ($3.1 billion) in free cash flow over the past 12 months and growing at a healthy clip, ENB stock has plenty of cash to make the annual payments. 
Its total return YTD is -16%. As long as the oil and gas industry continues to sputter, Enbridge might experience the same result in 2021. However, with the company expected to begin construction on the Line 3 pipeline project in Minnesota in the year ahead, Enbridge’s growth plans are starting to look up.

So, get paid by waiting on Enbridge to inevitably grow its business south of the border. 

Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)

It’s not been a good year for most Canadian banks, although Toronto-Dominion’s most recent quarterly results suggest the pandemic’s wrath may be coming to an end. Recently, TD stock has come on in recent months, gaining over 18% in the past three months alone.
The bank reported its Q4 results on Dec. 3. On an adjusted basis, TD earned 2.97 billion CAD (over $2.32 billion) in net income, slightly higher than the 2.95 billion CAD ($2.31 billion) it made a year earlier. For the entire year, it earned 9.97 billion CAD (roughly $7.8 billion), a little more than 20% lower than the year before.
What’s more, Toronto-Dominion’s U.S. retail banking business accounted for roughly 30% of its overall net income during the fourth quarter, raking in 871 million CAD ($658 million). Unfortunately, it was 27% lower than a year earlier. However, its Canadian retail banking was 3% higher YOY. 
The most important figure in the bank’s Q4 report, though, was the steep drop in its provision for credit losses, which fell to 971 million CAD ($760 million) from 2.19 billion CAD ($1.72 billion) at the end of the third quarter ending on July 31 (Page 7). 
Also, on a positive note, analysts expected TD to earn $1.27 during the quarter. It beat that estimate by 33 cents. 
Once the U.S. economy returns to normal, Toronto-Dominion’s U.S. retail business ought to make a bigger contribution to the bank’s bottom line. And, let’s not forget that the bank also owns 13.5% of Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW).
In the meantime, enjoy its 4.3% dividend yield. Out of all of the Canadian stocks on the market, TD is definitely a solid pick.

Thomson Reuters (TRI)

Next on my list of some of the best Canadian stocks is TRI stock. In a challenging operating environment, Thomson Reuters reported excellent Q3 results on Nov. 3. 
On the top line, sales grew by 2% during the quarter to $1.44 billion — and 3% if you exclude currency. On the bottom line, it earned 39 cents a share, 44% higher than a year earlier and 48% higher if you exclude currency. 
In fiscal 2019, Thomson Reuters generated 79% of its $5.9 billion in revenue in the United States. So, even though TRI is controlled by Canada’s richest family — the Thomsons, who own 66% of the company’s stock — much of the company’s wealth has been earned in the U.S. 
Recently, Thomson Reuters also completed a large-scale migration of its business information services to AWS, Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud-computing service. The company’s digital transformation will enable it to become a more agile business in the future. As part of the migration, it moved thousands of servers to AWS.

While I don’t think you’re going to hit a homerun owning TRI stock the same way you will with Shopify, you can’t go wrong with this name if preservation of capital is important to you.

FirstService (FSV)
Source: Shutterstock
	
Last on my list of Canadian stocks is FirstService, a leader in outsourced property services in North America. It’s definitely the smallest of the seven stocks listed in this article. But what it lacks in company size, it makes up for in outsized shareholder returns. So far in 2020, it’s having a great year with a total return of over 41% YTD. 
FSV is divided into two operating segments: FirstService Residential, which manages residential communities, and FirstService Brands, a provider of “essential property services” like painting, property damage restoration, flooring, closets and home inspections. 
In the trailing 12 months ended Sep. 30, FSV had $2.67 billion in sales, 90% of which was generated in the United States. The rest was made in its home base of Canada. Employing approximately 24,000 people, it had trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA of $268 million, roughly 10% of its top-line sales. 
In 1995, the company had $37 million in revenue. Some 24 years later in 2019, revenue was $2.41 billion. That makes for a compound annual growth rate of 19% (Page 5).
You can’t go wrong with businesses that make or save customers time and money. FirstService does both. It’s an excellent long-term buy.

2020-12-01	2020-12-01 20:01:02	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Enbridge Pipeline Linking Oil Sands to Midwest Wins Approval	(Bloomberg) -- An Enbridge Inc. pipeline that will help ship more Canadian crude to the U.S. Midwest received final approval, paving the way for construction to start soon on a third key export project for the oil sands after years of delays.Minnesota approved the stormwater pollution plan for Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline replacement and expansion, the project’s last pending permit, the company said on Monday. Construction is expected to take six-to-nine months on a line that will add 370,000 barrels a day of capacity.Producers in Alberta, which holds the world’s third-largest crude reserves, have seen growth ground to a halt in recent years after a lack of enough export pipelines caused local crude prices to plummet in value. Now, three projects could allow them to ship an extra 1.8 million barrels a day when built.Work is underway on TC Energy Corp.’s Keystone XL after a decade-long saga for approval, though it’s still unclear if U.S. President Elect Joe Biden will maintain an authorization from the Trump administration for the pipeline to cross the border. Meanwhile, the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion to the Vancouver coast is proceeding in Alberta and British Columbia, despite fierce opposition from environmental and indigenous groups.“Line 3 is potentially unique among the three in that it has the potential to be the soonest online,” as early as late 2021, IHS Markit Ltd. Vice President Kevin Birn said by phone.Line 3 could still encounter state and federal legal hurdles, as well as the prospect of protests that slow construction, delaying the start of service until 2022, Height Commentary said in a note last week. The same day that the pipeline received its final approval, a lawsuit was filed by environmental and indigenous groups challenging an earlier authorization from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, known as 401 permit.Another of Enbridge’s pipelines in the U.S., the Line 5 that crosses the Great Lakes into Michigan, was dealt a blow last month when the state’s government took legal action to shut it down. The pipeline supplies Central Canadian refineries with oil from Alberta.“Until the barrels are freely flowing, we should take nothing for granted,” Tim McMillan, chief executive officer of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said by phone.Two years ago, Canadian export pipelines became so congested that heavy Western Canadian Select crude’s discount to benchmark U.S. prices widened to about $50 a barrel, prompting Alberta’s government to impose mandatory output limits. Those curbs were only lifted recently as the Covid-19 pandemic crippled demand for Canada’s oil, temporarily leaving extra space on some pipelines.(Adds new lawsuit in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-gets-approval-pipeline-linking-225536520.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-13	2020-11-13 21:25:41	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	3 Oil Stocks To Buy And Bull Trade For Big Gains	"To be a longer-term oil investor is to know a thing or two about pain. It’s been a terribly challenging market for the commodity and other fossil fuels the past several years. But 2020 has taken the proverbial cake.
Production wars, a global pandemic wrecking further havoc on weakening demand trends and Wall Street’s optimistic knack to price in an alternative energy future utopia have crushed oil stocks. One need look no further than the spring’s sub-zero futures pricing for a product once known as black gold.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). In oil’s place, these stocks and many others within the broader alternatives market have flourished. Some like Tesla have even rightfully become household names. And it could always get worse for fossil fuels and oil stocks, but extinction?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Despite increasingly possible and more competitive greener alternatives, even with wider consumer approval of a carbon free energy market, the reality is oil, even in a pandemic, is still everywhere. Petroleum-based products drive more than just our cars, it’s in all sorts of household goods, including our toothpaste.
The arguments against oil investment are well known. But when it comes to the fossil fuel industry right now, off and on the price charts, hedged spread strategies look like a solid opportunity for today’s investors entering 2021.


					7 Retail Stocks That Will Benefit From 2020’s Holiday Shopping Season				

Here are 3 big oil stocks to bull trade today:
Chevron (NYSE:CVX)
Total SE (NYSE:TOT)
Enbridge (NYSE:ENB)
I wouldn’t say it’s time to back up the truck in oil stocks. But given Pfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) and Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) very promising Covid-19 drugs, tomorrow may be a bit more like yesterday, in a good way. And along with encouraging price charts and a partisan Congress intent to stop any packaged Green New Deal dead in its tracks, hedged contrarian positions in the following three oil stocks looks like a good cause bullish investors can get behind.

Oil Stocks to Buy: Chevron (CVX)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The first of our oil stocks to buy is Chevron. The blue-chip is now the only Dow Jones component with exposure to the energy sector following an August decision by index administrators to reduce industry exposure and replace Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) with software giant Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).
The Dow decision was in large part based on XOM’s lower stock price as the index’s construction is price-weighted. But it’s also common knowledge CVX stock has slightly superior fundamentals. CVX has also helped its shareholders by making a smart decision this year to reduce its dividend and move more aggressively to cut costs.
Technically, Chevron’s advantages are now being complimented by a price chart demonstrating sure signs of bottoming. After a somewhat iffy undercut double bottom which broke trend support in March, shares of this oil stock have formed a well-supported higher-low pattern. Coupled with a monthly candlestick price confirmation this month and bullish stochastics setup, CVX is an oil stock to buy today.
Favored Strategy: January $72.50 / $90 collar

Total SE (TOT)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The next stock of our oil stocks to buy is Total SE. U.S. investors may not be familiar with Total; unlike Chevron, you won’t find this French-based, ‘supermajor’ oil company’s gas stations in your neighborhood. But if investors are interested in parking some capital in the energy space, it may prove a big mistake to exclude TOT stock.
Aside from a fairly strong balance sheet and well-supported dividend like Chevron, Total has shown a genuine commitment to making renewables part of its energy business. Notably, the company wants to generate 15% of its energy sales vis-à-vis “electrons” rather than fossil fuels by 2030. It also maintains a long-term interest as the largest investor in U.S. solar outfit SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR).
In lieu of Total’s greener ambitions, TOT offers a modest hedge away from the fossil fuel market and maybe even larger exposure towards renewables for investors buying this particular oil stock today. Technically, Total is fairly interchangeable with what’s transpired in CVX this year. And again, that price action is looking bullish for investors with an eye on the road ahead.


					7 Retail Stocks That Will Benefit From 2020’s Holiday Shopping Season				

Favored Strategy: Long February $35 / $45 collar

Enbridge (ENB)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The last of our oil stocks to buy are shares of Enbridge. ENB is another international outfit, and a less familiar but very influential player in the industry.  Based in Canada, this company is one of the largest midstream outfits in North America. And by the looks of last week’s stronger-than-expected Q3 results, in spite of the challenging environment, Enbridge is doing a lot of things right, which has both analysts and investors paying attention.
Technically, shares of ENB have weathered a battered fossil fuel market better than most and performed decidedly stronger than CVX and TOT the past few years. It hasn’t always been pretty of course and as with its peers, March was particularly ruthless for shareholders. But this oil stock has formed a more commanding bullish high-level double bottom base on the price chart since peaking in late 2014 alongside the top in the oil market.
One minor cause for concern right now is how Enbridge’s stochastics have turned lower in oversold territory. Price action has also pulled back inside a monthly pullback pattern that was confirmed this month. However, given the larger pattern’s bullish tendencies, a slightly shorter-term collar, which can be restructured to offset some of today’s technical uncertainty, looks like a good way to approach this oil stock.
Favored Strategy: December $27.50 / $30 collar

Enbridge Faces New Fight as Michigan Seeks Line 5 Shutdown	(Bloomberg) -- Enbridge Inc.’s battle with Michigan escalated on Friday as the governor took new legal action to shut down a key pipeline that supplies Central Canadian refineries.Governor Gretchen Whitmer filed a complaint in Ingham County Circuit Court seeking to “revoke and terminate” a 1953 easement that allows Enbridge to operate under the Straits of Mackinac, which connect Michigan’s upper and lower peninsulas. Line 5 is a key conduit of crude for Canadian refineries in Ontario and Quebec.“Enbridge’s Line 5 is a grave and unreasonable risk to the state’s residents and natural resources and requires the pipeline to be shut down 180 days from now, on May 12, 2021,” the state said in a release Friday.Pipelines across the U.S. have been mired in legal challenges as environmental opposition mounts. Energy Transfer LP’s controversial Dakota Access crude line made headlines again this year after a federal judge said it must be shut down and the company appealed the ruling. The future of the Mountain Valley natural gas conduit linking West Virginia and southern Virginia is now uncertain amid lawsuits over endangered species assessments.Enbridge shares erased earlier gains following news of the latest legal action and were down 1.4% to C$37.44 at 3:20 p.m. in Toronto.The company has been in a long-running battle over the pipeline with Michigan’s Democratic administration, which views the line as an environmental threat to the Great Lakes. In June, a judge ordered Enbridge to temporarily halt operations of Line 5 amid concern about possible damage.The Calgary-based pipeline giant said it’s confident Line 5 will continue to operate safely.“This notice and the report from Michigan Department of Natural Resources are a distraction from the fundamental facts,” Vern Yu, an executive vice president at Enbridge, said in an emailed statement. “Line 5 remains safe, as envisioned by the 1953 Easement, and as recently validated by our federal safety regulator.”A temporary shutdown of both the eastern and western segments of the pipeline in June prompted Imperial Oil Ltd. to warn of possible production cuts at its Sarnia and Nanticoke refineries. The western segment was restarted in July and the eastern one in September. While Michigan’s governor wants to shut the pipeline, Enbridge is seeking to make the line more secure by building a tunnel under the strait to house the line.Unlike nearly all other pipeline projects, Michigan’s state government plays an integral role in authorization for Line 5, according to Liz Kirkwood, a long-time opponent of the conduit and executive director of Michigan’s environmental group For Love of Water.Line 5 carries as much as 540,000 barrels a day of Canadian light crude oil, light synthetic crude, and natural gas liquids from Superior, Wisconsin, to Sarnia, Ontario, where it links to a pipeline that runs as far north as Montreal.(Adds comment from company in seventh and eighth paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-faces-fight-michigan-seeks-184229658.html?.tsrc=rss

Gretchen Whitmer filed legal action to shut down the Line 5 pipeline that transports oil under the Straits of Mackinac.What Happened: Whitmer's office notified the company it has 180 days and then the flow must stop, according to WOOD-TV.Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a lawsuit to carry out Whitmer's decision.Why It's Important: The Line 5 pipeline owned by Enbridge Inc (NYSE: ENB) carries 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas daily between Superior, Wisconsin and Sarnia, Ontario.Enbridge spokesman Ryan Duffy said the company was ""looking it over,"" referring to the lawsuit, reports The Detroit News.In 2018, Enbridge built a $500-million utility tunnel to protect the pipeline, which could end up being not enough to save the pipeline's flow going forward.Experts told The Detroit News that Michigan consumers could see an increase in the price of fuel, natural gas and propane.Related Link: 10 US Oil Stocks To Buy At Cyclical LowsWhat's Next: The news from Michigan comes shortly after The Star Tribune reported Minnesota regulators approved permits for Enbridge's Line 3 replacement, which could begin construction in December.

In March and April, there was a massive number of companies that slashed or entirely suspended their dividends. This year has been a period of devastation for income-focused investors, particularly in sectors like real estate investment trusts (REITs). And while things have gotten better since this spring, we’re still seeing more dividend cuts and profit warnings even now.
That makes stock selection of the utmost importance. So, which current high-yield dividend stocks will be able to make it through the current downturn and come out stronger on the other side?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips


					7 Augmented Reality Stocks To Buy Now For The Future				

When looking for dividends of 5% a year or greater, you’re going to have to sort through a lot of value traps and low-quality companies. Fortunately, though, these seven companies have what it to takes to prosper as the economy comes back to life. Here are seven high yield companies to invest in now:
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC)
Enbridge (NYSE:ENB)
Altria (NYSE:MO)
Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP)
Omnicom (NYSE:OMC)
Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO)
People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT)

Dividend Stocks to Buy: KraftHeinz (KHC)

Dividend Yield: 5%
This food giant has fallen on hard times in recent years. Kraft loaded up on debt a few years ago in order to complete its monumental merger with Heinz back in 2015. It turned out that results fell short of expectations, though — the company never managed to generate sufficient cash flows to justify the deal.
As a result, KHC stock had to cut its dividend previously and the stock price plunged from around $90 to as low as $25 in 2019. However, a new era is forming for Kraft Heinz.
Right before the pandemic, the company had already stabilized its business and returned to positive organic growth. Then the novel coronavirus hit, which caused a big rush of people to stock up on packaged foods. Even now, the sales boost continues as people continue to prefer cooking at home over going out to eat.
With profits now moving higher, it appears Kraft Heinz has turned the corner. And at this price, KHC stock is going for just 12.9 times earnings while paying a greater than 5% dividend.
A lot of people are still mad at Kraft Heinz for its disastrous decline over the past few years. But people who take a more forward-looking outlook have the opportunity to cash in. Kraft Heinz is in the early innings of a dramatic multi-year comeback story, making this pick of the dividend stocks certainly worthwhile.

Enbridge (ENB)

Dividend Yield: 8.6%
Some investors absolutely hate energy stocks right now. And that’s a reasonable reaction, given the dreadful performance of crude oil and related oil and gas producers in recent years. However, those traders risk throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
That’s because the pipeline companies are in a much better position than the oil and gas producers themselves right now. While low energy prices can quickly crush an exploration and production company, pipeline operators generally have a great deal of leeway. At the end of the day, the pipeline owner still has a monopoly — and if customers like power utilities and gas stations want to function, they still have to pay the “piper.”
We’ve seen this in recent years. Despite the extended downturn in prices, Enbridge has kept its business on a steady keel. In fact, it’s held its dividend in tact — something not all dividend stocks have been able to do.

What’s more, the business is continuing to grow. Management sees mid-single-digit annual distributable cash flow (DCF) going forward. That, in turn, should allow ENB stock to offer shareholders a small annual dividend increase on top of the already bountiful 8.6% dividend yield.

Altria (MO)
Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com
	
Dividend Yield: 9.2%
Altria stock has gotten hammered over the past few years, setting up a compelling high yield dividend stock opportunity here and now.
It’s not hard to see why MO stock has dropped. The company infamously paid a huge price tag for its stake in vaping company Juul. After that, Juul ran into stiff government regulation. Now it appears to be a massive loss for Altria in terms of its original investment.
More broadly, it’s no secret that Altria’s core tobacco business remains a declining industry. Altria has offset falling cigarette sales with price hikes, leading to stable profits and revenues. Ultimately, though, its long-term future is not secure.
The company’s efforts at diversification have been a mixed bag as well. In addition to Juul, Altria’s investments in the marijuana and alcohol sectors have seen uneven results.
While the bearish talking points are reasonable on their own, however, they miss the bigger picture. Altria is trading for just 8.2 times earnings — and earnings are going up. In fact, analysts see earnings growing at around 4% to 5% per year going forward. Needless to say, if a company can merely maintain flat earnings at that price-to-earnings ratio, you’re going to make good money.
Add growth on top of that and the returns should be excellent. By my estimation, an 8 times price-to-earnings ratio translates into a 12.5% annual earnings yield on your capital. With that yield, Altria can easily pay out its 9% dividend yield to shareholders and still have profits left over to pay off debt or buy back stock.
In the case of Altria, investors have gotten too caught up in the negative points about the company. They’ve missed just how cheap and compelling MO stock really is — a standout among the dividend stocks.

Boston Properties (BXP)
Source: Halfpoint/shutterstock.com
	
Dividend Yield: 5.2%
Boston Properties is one of the nation’s leading office owners. Admittedly, that sounds like a messy business given the current work-from-home trend. However, BXP stock more than reflects that risk. Shares are down a little under 50% from their 52-week highs, creating a great bargain.
And, unlike many office companies, Boston Properties is significantly insulated from the current unfavorable trends. That’s in large part because the firm has focused on trophy buildings in Tier 1 cities. For example, the company has developed real estate in San Francisco focused on life sciences. Specialized facilities like these are set-up for doing laboratory work that simply isn’t possible over a video call.
More broadly, Boston Properties generally owns high-end buildings. Therefore, while lower-quality office space can go vacant or have to lower rent to attract tenants, BXP’s holdings should remain in high demand. We saw that this relatively recently. Despite everything going on with the economy right now, Boston Properties managed to collect 98% of its June office rent, for instance. In the face of this pandemic, the company continues to collect.


					7 Top Stocks to Buy for November				

Of course, BXP stock may remain bumpy in the short-term given all of the uncertainty around Covid-19 and the work-from-home trend. But for long-term income-seeking investors, this pick of the dividend stocks — at a 5.2% dividend — is quite the treat.

Omnicom (OMC)
Source: VectorKnight/shutterstock.com
	
Dividend Yield: 5.3%
Omnicom is one of the world’s leading advertising agencies, making it stand apart from other dividend stocks. However, its stock — along with the other industry players — has gotten walloped in recent years. There’s a logical reason for that.
For one, the novel coronavirus has hurt the advertising business in particular in 2020, with so much of the economy temporarily shut down. And on a longer-term basis, digitalization threatens the cozy way the industry operates.
But — while the internet has certainly changed advertising — some investors may be overstating the impact on ad agencies like Omnicom.
Omnicom doesn’t just buy ads for its clients. It’s also a full-service public relations and customer relations shop. The company has had decades-long relationships with many of the world’s leading brands — it handles marketing, crisis management, field research, and more for these leading firms on top of executing their marketing campaigns.
Sure, the internet has disrupted pure advertising in some large ways. But for a big food or car company, buying some internet search ads is hardly a replacement for having Omnicom by their side. OMC stock reflects this: even with the rise of online advertising, the company has managed stable profits and revenues in recent years.
Yet, thanks to the novel coronavirus, shares have fallen from about a 12 times price-to-earnings ratio to a forward ratio of 8.9. That offers notable value for interested investors — in addition to the 5.3% dividend yield.

Valero Energy (VLO)
Source: Shutterstock
	
Dividend Yield: 10%
Like many energy stocks — and dividend stocks in general — Valero has gotten pummeled this year. However, the prognosis for VLO stock is much better than most of its peers. That’s because Valero doesn’t have significant exposure to the actual price of oil or natural gas. After all, the company isn’t producing or transporting crude oil. It merely refines it.
Valero turns crude oil into end products like jet fuel, gasoline, heating oil and asphalt. Understandably, given the novel coronavirus, the demand for these products has dropped in 2020. Over time, however, the proverbial engine is starting up again. International air travel, for example, is showing a steady — if modest — increase after virtually stopping earlier this year. As travel comes back, demand will return and Valero will be able to charge normal premiums on its refined oil goods.
In the meantime, as the biggest independent refiner in the country, the company has a ton of scale. This gives it the strength to ride out the current downturn in a way that smaller refiners have struggled to do.


					7 Hot Stocks To Buy With Mega-Cap Status				

Additionally, the recent election results give Valero an unexpected benefit. If things hold up as they are projected now, it appears we will have a President Joe Biden along with a Republican-led Senate. This gridlock will likely prevent Democrats from passing a Green New Deal-type structure that would phase out Valero’s refined products. On the other hand, we’re almost certain to not see new refineries built under Biden, keeping VLO’s competition modest.
This “not too hot, not too cold” dynamic should work favorably for Valero — and its investors — in the coming years.

People’s United Financial (PBCT)
Source: Shutterstock
	
Dividend Yield: 6.5%
Rounding out my list of dividend stocks, People’s United Financial is one of largest independent bank franchises in the northeastern United States.
Now sure, I know there are a ton of high-dividend banks at the moment. I also know that people largely don’t want to invest in them, given the economic downturn and low interest rates. However, PBCT stock is worth making an exception.
Why? For one, People’s United sailed through the 2008 financial crisis with hardly any loan losses, as the bank’s management is highly conservative. It makes low-risk moderate-reward loans, and doesn’t lever up the balance sheet. The bank also grows at a modest clip — primarily by acquisitions — which allows it to spend the majority of its profits on the large dividend to shareholders. In fact, People’s United is one of the rare banks that has managed to increase its dividend every year, dating back to the early 1990s.
Maybe People’s United is not an exciting bank — the stock price is usually quiet from week to week and its earnings reports rarely surprise. However, every three months, it kicks out another fat dividend payment.
With shares in a correction at the moment, investors now have a nice opportunity to get into PBCT stock.

2020-11-06	2020-11-06 12:04:20	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Pipeline Giant Enbridge Joins Shell, BP With 2050 Emissions Goal	(Bloomberg) -- Enbridge Inc. became the largest company in the North American oil industry to set a goal of eliminating all net emissions from its operations by 2050, joining major European producers in providing climate-conscious investors with a plan to tackle global warming.The pipeline giant also established an interim target of reducing the intensity of greenhouse-gas emissions from its operations by 35% by 2030, according to environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, targets it outlined Friday. It follows similar or tougher pledges by Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc, Total SE and Repsol SA, while top U.S. producers Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. have made clear they are not following suit.“It’s a very public demonstration of our level of commitment to making progress on these important criteria and issues that matter to society and to our stakeholders,” Peter Sheffield, Enbridge’s chief sustainability officer, said in an interview.The oil and gas industry, which has long been the target of environmental groups, is under increasing pressure from shareholders managing trillions of dollars to address greenhouse-gas emissions such as methane. Those investors include AllianceBernstein Holding LP and California State Teachers’ Retirement System.Enbridge’s plan doesn’t include a net-zero target for so-called scope 3 emissions -- the ones stemming from the combustion of fossil fuels by cars, airplanes, homes and factories. For now, the Calgary-based company said it will address those by helping suppliers and customers to cut emissions in line with the recommendations of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The Canadian company with a vast pipeline network in the U.S. has invested in several wind and solar energy projects over the years. That means it already has the capacity to deliver more than 2,000 megawatts of net-zero power to customers in the U.S., Canada and Europe -- equivalent to the consumption of about 950,000 homes or a city about the size of San Francisco, the company said.In addition to investments in renewable energy, Enbridge said it will pursue improvements to its infrastructure, carbon offset credits and renewable energy certificates.For Bloomberg’s ESG rankings of oil and gas companies, click here.Enbridge’s goals don’t apply to joint ventures such as DCP Midstream, a partnership with Phillips 66 that operates more than 15,000 miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines in the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.DCP has had 187 unauthorized emissions events that resulted in flaring in the region so far this year, mostly due to power failures, weather and third-party issues, filings with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality show.Gas flaring in the Permian Basin remains a key concern for environmentalists and many Asian and European liquefied natural gas buyers.“While these are assets we don’t control, we can and will have conversations with our partners to ensure they have a deeper understanding of the importance of reducing emissions to address climate change,” the company said in an emailed statement.Enbridge also holds a 10.5% stake in the proposed Annova LNG project at the Port of Brownsville in Texas and a 100% stake in the proposed Rio Bravo Pipeline to support NextDecade Corp.’s nearby Rio Grande LNG project.The Port of Brownsville projects face staunch opposition from environmentalists and other opponents who have fought for more than five years to keep the projects from being built.Citing concerns over flared gas and other issues, the French government sided with opponents and intervened to block a long-term LNG supply deal between Engie SA and Rio Grande LNG.Enbridge has pledged to reduce carbon intensity in its gas stream, which would apply to the company’s LNG projects. The company’s ESG plan also includes a commitment to having 40% women and 20% ethnic and racial minorities on its board by 2025, as well as several other steps to promote diversity. Performance-based compensation of its employees will include ESG metrics, Enbridge said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pipeline-giant-enbridge-joins-shell-120420654.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-28	2020-10-28 20:03:45	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	New Orleans Braces for Most Powerful Hurricane Since Katrina	(Bloomberg) -- Zeta rapidly strengthened to a near-Category 3 hurricane with winds of 110 miles (177 kilometers) per hour and is threatening to be the worst storm to hit New Orleans since Katrina devastated the city in 2005.While Zeta isn’t as powerful as Katrina, it will pass directly over the Crescent City, bringing the harshest winds in 15 years, said Jim Rouiller, chief meteorologist at Energy Weather Group LLC. The storm’s track could cause as much as $3 billion in damages, but New Orleans will likely escape massive flooding.“The center of circulation is going to pass directly over the the New Orleans metro area,” said Ryan Truchelut, president of commercial forecaster Weather Tiger. “New Orleans has had six or seven hurricane warnings in a row and nothing has happened but their number is definitely up.”Zeta, poised to become the record 11th named storm to hit the U.S. this year, is poised to make landfall at about 4 p.m. local time in the vast wetlands south of New Orleans. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards and New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell have declared emergencies. Hurricane warnings extend from Morgan City, Louisiana, to the Mississippi-Alabama border.After landfall, Zeta will rapidly move inland knocking down trees and powerlines across the South, even potentially knocking out power in Atlanta, Truchelut said.It will then slingshot into the Mid-Atlantic where it could leave a path of darkness straight through to Delaware, Rouiller said.“I think everyone is so tired of hurricanes, no one wants to think about what it can do, but it is going to be a major nuisance,” Truchelut said.Zeta is expected to make landfall between the sites where hurricanes Delta and Laura came ashore, to the west, and Hurricane Sally struck to the east. The larger storms all missed the area, but it was struck by Tropical Storm Cristobal in June. The multiple strikes have left residual damage throughout the Gulf Coast.“Any vulnerable structures -- specifically roofs or infrastructure that were lightly damaged from the past two storms and not repaired -- will be at risk,” said Lou Gritzo, vice president and manager of research with FM Global, a commercial insurer. “Hurricane Sally was less than six weeks ago, so it’s not likely that the damage has been fully repaired.”Zeta is the 27th named storm in a supercharged Atlantic hurricane season, just one short of the record reached in 2005. So many storms have formed this year that the hurricane center has run out of official names and is using Greek letters to designate systems.Chevron Corp., BP Plc, Enbridge Inc., Equinor ASA and other companies have evacuated Gulf installations. Noble Corp. moved its Globetrotter II rig out of the way. Nearly 67% of oil production and 45% of offshore natural gas has been shut in, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.Close to 36% of platforms have been evacuated and 30% of rigs, the agency said. Chevron has also begun preparations to shut a coastal Mississippi oil refinery, according to a person familiar with the operations, and a key seaport that serves deepwater oil installations is under a mandatory evacuation order.Zeta’s track is shifting to the east and it’s continuing to strengthen, so it may cause as much as $3 billion in damages and losses as it makes landfall later Wednesday, up from earlier estimates of about $1 billion, said Chuck Watson, a damage modeler at Enki Research. Its stronger winds bring more dynamic pressure on everything it hits, and there are simply more targets in the way the closer to New Orleans it gets.The storm surge, a wall of water that hurricanes drive onto land, could hit 9 feet (2.7 meters) in areas between the Pearl River in Louisiana to Dauphin Island, Alabama, the hurricane center said.As Zeta comes ashore and moves across Mississippi, Alabama, and northern Georgia, it will interact with a winter storm that’s brought snow to Texas and is now moving east, said Don Keeney, a meteorologist with commercial forecaster Maxar. The moisture from Zeta will enhance that storm, bringing heavy rains throughout the Midwest and eastern U.S.The U.S. Weather Prediction Center warned that as much as 5 to 7 inches may fall across the central and eastern states over the next few days. The confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, southern Appalachian Mountains and southern Mississippi may be hit hardest.There are some indications a 28th storm could form in the Caribbean in the next week, however the forecast isn’t completely clear yet, said Phil Klotzbach, hurricane researcher with Colorado State University. That would tie the record set in 2005.(Updates wind speed in first paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tropical-storm-zeta-south-cuba-062619014.html?.tsrc=rss

While this year has been tough on dividend stocks as many companies opted to reduce or suspend their payouts because of COVID-19, others have continued to thrive.  Three of those prospering payouts are from Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIP)(NYSE: BIPC), Camden Property Trust (NYSE: CPT), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB).	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/435538ef-4f39-3354-bf39-cd00e081586f/3-dividend-stocks-perfect-for.html?.tsrc=rss

However, U.S.-based equity income investors have experienced a high degree of volatility in recent years. In our view, investing in international income stocks is one way to increase portfolio diversification while reducing sensitivity to volatile U.S interest rates. Investing in overseas stocks carries its own set of risks, including the impact of currency exchange and geopolitical turmoil. But there are also a number of positives in this segment for U.S. investors. One is a more robust selection of high-quality names. Yields also tend to be higher in overseas markets in general. And finally, valuations can be more attractive.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0e35d1e7-a99f-3d25-8d9a-ff88e618b583/the-argus-global-dividend.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-16	2020-10-16 09:16:53	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	5 High-Yield Stocks for 5%-Plus Dividend Payouts	"It’s a difficult time to be an income investor. The S&P 500 index has rallied off of its 2020 lows and has returned to near-record highs, pushing the average dividend yield in the index below 2%. In addition, with interest rates near zero, fixed income yields are suppressed as well. The end result is that investors have to look deeper for high-yield stocks.
Fortunately, there are still many dividend stocks with yields of 5% or more. And even better, investors do not have to sacrifice quality.

Multiple high-yield stocks have sustainable dividends with room for dividend growth in the future. The following five stocks have yields above 5%, with durable competitive advantages and long-term growth potential that provide safety to their dividends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

High-Yield Stocks: Philip Morris International (PM)
 Source: defotoberg / Shutterstock.com
	
Philip Morris International is one of the world’s largest tobacco companies, with a market cap of $123 billion. PM sells its products outside the United States. The cigarette maker’s product portfolio includes its flagship Marlboro brand.
On July 21, Philip Morris reported second-quarter operating results. For the quarter, the company generated net revenue of $6.65 billion, which was down 14% as reported and down 9.5% excluding currency fluctuations. Shipment volume was down 14.5%, with cigarette shipment volume down 17.6% year-over-year.
The company has been hurt by a strong dollar, which has negatively affected the conversion of international sales into dollars. It has also dealt with the global economic downturn as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. To add to its struggles, it has to combat declining smoking rates across multiple countries.
In response, PM has invested heavily in its new product line called IQOS. This is a revolutionary product which heats tobacco instead of burning it. According to the company, this produces fewer harmful effects than traditional cigarettes. IQOS has seen early success through rapid adoption and high market share in multiple international markets such as Japan and Korea. Heated tobacco product sales increased 24% last quarter, and represent PM’s biggest future growth catalyst.
In the meantime, PM stock yields 6.1%. The company is likely to distribute virtually all of its earnings-per-share in dividends this year, but future earnings growth from new products and share repurchases should provide for modest dividend increases each year.

Enbridge (ENB)

Enbridge is an integrated oil and gas company based in Canada. It operates a variety of businesses including Liquids Pipelines, Gas Distributions, Energy Services, Gas Transmission & Midstream, and Green Power & Transmission. The company has a market capitalization of $60 billion.
ENB stock has declined 26% year-to-date, as the oil and gas producer has struggled under the weight of low oil and gas prices, as well as the coronavirus pandemic which has sent the global economy into recession. In Q2 2020, Enbridge saw its revenue decline approximately 40%. However, Enbridge’s adjusted EBITDA increased 3% from the previous year’s quarter, as revenue declines were more than offset by lower costs.
Despite the coronavirus crisis, Enbridge maintained its guidance for distributable cash flow-per-share of $4.50 CAD-$4.80 CAD ($3.41-$3.63) for 2020. At the midpoint of guidance, Enbridge expects to increase DCF-per-share by approximately 2% in 2020. The company expects to maintain a dividend payout ratio of 70%, based on DCF-per-share guidance. This indicates the current dividend payout is secure.


					7 Value Stocks To Buy in an Overvalued Market				

Another important factor helping to secure Enbridge’s dividend is its quality balance sheet. With more than 40 diverse sources of cash flow and a BBB+ credit rating, Enbridge has a manageable level of debt. The company has $14 billion of available liquidity and its debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains within its target range of 4.5x to 5.0x.
Management has a target forecast of 5-7% average annual DCF growth through 2022. This growth will be achieved partly through rate increases, cost cuts, and new projects coming online. If the company reaches this forecast, it will have little trouble maintaining its dividend, and continuing to increase the dividend on a regular basis.
Enbridge has increased its dividend for 25 consecutive years. With a high dividend yield above 8%, Enbridge is an especially attractive stock for income investors.

Unum Group (UNM)

Unum Group is an insurance holding company providing a broad portfolio of financial protection benefits and services. The company operates through its Unum US, Unum UK, Unum Poland and Colonial Life businesses, providing disability, life, accident, critical illness, dental and vision benefits to millions of customers. Unum generated revenue of approximately $12 billion in 2019.
Unum has been negatively affected by the coronavirus pandemic to start 2020, but only to a mild effect. In the second quarter, Unum generated $3.0 billion in revenue, a 0.3% increase from the same quarter last year. The core Unum US segment reported a 9% decline in adjusted operating income. Premium income for the segment increased 1.2% while net investment income fell 3.9%. On an adjusted basis, earnings-per-share of $1.23 for the quarter declined 9.5% year-over-year.
Unum has developed a top position in its industry with a long track record of providing reliable service and establishing deep relationships with customers. These qualities have served the company well during recessions.
UNM stock performed surprisingly well in the Great Recession of 2008-2009. Unum posted earnings-per-share of $2.19, $2.51, $2.57 and $2.71 from 2007 through 2010, respectively. Furthermore, the dividend was increased during this time as well. Therefore, we expect Unum’s profits and dividend to hold up again in the current downturn. Unum has a 6.1% dividend yield, with a secure payout.

AbbVie (ABBV)

AbbVie is a pharmaceutical manufacturer spun off by Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in 2013. AbbVie’s most important product is Humira, which alone represents nearly half the company’s total revenue. This is a challenge, because Humira has already lost patent exclusivity in Europe, and will lose that status in the U.S. in 2023.
Fortunately, AbbVie has prepared for this by investing in new therapies, both organically and through acquisitions. Adjusted research and development expense totaled $5 billion in 2019, and the investment is already paying off.
AbbVie has received 14 major approvals since 2013, with 10 of those coming in the core categories of Immunology and Oncology. AbbVie has multiple growth opportunities to replace Humira. One example is Imbruvica, a treatment for the most common type of leukemia in adults, which generated 21% growth in the most recent quarter.
Growth from new products led to a strong performance in the second quarter. Revenue of $10.4 billion increased 26% year-over-year, while adjusted earnings-per-share increased 4% year-over-year to $2.34 for the quarter.


					7 Value Stocks To Buy in an Overvalued Market				

The $63 billion acquisition of Allergan will also boost AbbVie’s future growth. Allergan is a leader in aesthetics products such as Botox. The combined company will have annual revenues of nearly $50 billion.
ABBV stock qualifies as a Dividend Aristocrat, as its former parent company Abbott was on the list at the time of the spin-off. AbbVie has continued to increase its own dividends each year since. The stock now has a 5.5% yield, and with a projected payout ratio near 50% of adjusted EPS for 2020, the dividend is secure with room for continued increases.

International Business Machines (IBM)

It is rare to see tech stocks with high yields, but IBM is a unique stock within the tech sector. IBM is a global information technology company that provides integrated enterprise solutions for software, hardware and services. In the services business, IBM is the world’s largest IT provider with 5.5% market share. The company has five business segments: Cloud & Cognitive Software, Global Business Services, Global Technology Services, Systems, and Global Financing. IBM generated revenue of approximately $77 billion last year.
Earlier this month, the firm announced it will spin off its Global Technology Services division into its own publicly traded company. Its goal in doing so is to shift the focus at IBM on cloud services.
IBM reported better-than-expected results for Q2 2020. For the quarter, companywide revenue decreased 5.4% while diluted adjusted earnings per share declined 31%. However, revenue was significantly impacted by divestitures and currency fluctuations, which are generally non-recurring items. Excluding divestitures and currency, adjusted revenue declined a milder 1.9% for the quarter.
IBM continues to see declines in certain legacy segments, like consulting and application management services, but underneath the surface the company is making big strides in major growth areas such as the cloud. Total cloud revenue increased 34% on an adjusted basis for the quarter. Cloud revenue has increased 23% in the trailing four quarters. Lastly, Red Hat generated 18% revenue growth for the quarter.
These growth segments provide IBM with the ability to pay a generous dividend to shareholders. IBM stock currently yields 5.2%. The company has increased its dividend for 25 consecutive years, meaning it will join the list of Dividend Aristocrats in 2021.

<meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" /><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Bob Dylan sang, “There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief,” and that is a good way to describe the condition of the markets right now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Investors must interpret a range of conflicting signals. Macroeconomic data is rising – unemployment is falling, consumer confidence and spending are up – and indications are, the economy is recovering quickly from the sharp recession we experienced earlier this year. That goes hand-in-hand with a perception that COVID-19 is beginning to face back, and there are signs that another lockdown may be coming. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will there be a national policy? Or will we see a state-by-state reaction. In that case, the blue states are more likely to double down on lockdowns, with California leading the way, while the red states try to maintain current conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And speaking of blue and red, there is always the election looming over everything.  While Democrat Joe Biden appeared to hold a comfortable lead through the summer, the race is tightening and incumbent President Trump is narrowing that gap, especially in the key swing states that will decide the electoral college. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s an investment environment that is made for dividend stocks. These are the classic defensive plays – reliable dividend payers provide a steady stream of income no matter whether the portfolio gains or loses. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Writing from Jefferies, which earns the top spot on TipRanks’ list of Top Performing Research Firms, three analysts show us why high-yield dividends are on their minds. These are their picks for proactive investors looking to buy into the market now, while prices are low – and the yields start at 8% and go up from there. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve pulled the details on these three picks from the <a href=""http://www.tipranks.com"">TipRanks database</a>, to find out who else recommends them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Compass Diversified Holdings</strong> <strong>(<a href=""https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/codi/forecast"">CODI</a>)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First on the list is Compass Diversified, a holding company with a varied portfolio of middle-market businesses. The company’s portfolio generated over $1.5 billion in revenue last year. Compass has built its portfolio with a goal of long-term cash generation, and has a 22-year record of success. They use the cash to fund a generous dividend for their own shareholders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That dividend yields 8.14%, more than 4x the average yield found among S&P-listed companies. Compass has kept its payment reliable for the past 14 years, an enviable record, and saw no need to make changes to the payment during the corona crisis. The current quarterly payout is 36 cents per common share, annualized to $1.44.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

2020-09-21	2020-09-21 15:50:55	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	3 Big Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 8%; Jefferies Says ‘Buy’	Bob Dylan sang, “There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief,” and that is a good way to describe the condition of the markets right now.Investors must interpret a range of conflicting signals. Macroeconomic data is rising – unemployment is falling, consumer confidence and spending are up – and indications are, the economy is recovering quickly from the sharp recession we experienced earlier this year. That goes hand-in-hand with a perception that COVID-19 is beginning to face back, and there are signs that another lockdown may be coming. Will there be a national policy? Or will we see a state-by-state reaction. In that case, the blue states are more likely to double down on lockdowns, with California leading the way, while the red states try to maintain current conditions.And speaking of blue and red, there is always the election looming over everything.  While Democrat Joe Biden appeared to hold a comfortable lead through the summer, the race is tightening and incumbent President Trump is narrowing that gap, especially in the key swing states that will decide the electoral college. It’s an investment environment that is made for dividend stocks. These are the classic defensive plays – reliable dividend payers provide a steady stream of income no matter whether the portfolio gains or loses. Writing from Jefferies, which earns the top spot on TipRanks’ list of Top Performing Research Firms, three analysts show us why high-yield dividends are on their minds. These are their picks for proactive investors looking to buy into the market now, while prices are low – and the yields start at 8% and go up from there. We’ve pulled the details on these three picks from the TipRanks database, to find out who else recommends them.Compass Diversified Holdings (CODI)First on the list is Compass Diversified, a holding company with a varied portfolio of middle-market businesses. The company’s portfolio generated over $1.5 billion in revenue last year. Compass has built its portfolio with a goal of long-term cash generation, and has a 22-year record of success. They use the cash to fund a generous dividend for their own shareholders.That dividend yields 8.14%, more than 4x the average yield found among S&P-listed companies. Compass has kept its payment reliable for the past 14 years, an enviable record, and saw no need to make changes to the payment during the corona crisis. The current quarterly payout is 36 cents per common share, annualized to $1.44.The company funds the dividend with strong revenues and earnings. The highly diverse portfolio helped insulate Compass from losses in the crisis atmosphere of 2020. In the first half, CODI reported EPS of 29 cents and 36 cents in the first two quarters. This was down 50 cents from 4Q19, but compares well with the 1H19 quarterly results of 18 cents and 36 cents.Analyst Kyle Joseph covers this stock for Jefferies, and he is impressed.“We view the anticipated recovery in portfolio company sales/EBITDA encouragingly and highlight that some businesses saw improving demand, highlighting portfolio diversification benefits. CODI has significant levels of dry powder to take advantage of recent market dislocation… we like CODI's unique structure as a publicly-traded PE shop with permanent capital that affords the company enhanced investment flexibility/patience and competitive advantages,” Joseph opined.Accordingly, Joseph rates CODI a Buy along with a $22 price target. That target implies an upside potential of 30% for the coming year. (To watch Joseph’s track record, click here)Overall, CODI has a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus rating, with 2 Buys and 1 Hold given in recent weeks. The stock’s share price is $16.91, and the $21 average price target suggests room for 24.5% upside growth in the next 12 months. (See CODI stock analysis on TipRanks)Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)Next up is an oil and gas company, part of the midstream sector that connects the wells with the customers. Enterprise controls a network of pipelines, for both oil and natural gas, totaling over 50,000 miles, along with storage facilities adequate for 160 million barrels of oil and 14 billion cubic feet of gas, and shipping terminals located in the hydrocarbon-rich Gulf coast of Texas.Even with revenues and earnings slipping in the first half of this year, Enterprise finished 1H20 with solid liquidity. The company reported having $7.3 billion in available cash and credit. Q2 earnings were down 22% sequentially, but were inline with the analyst consensus.The company has used its earnings and liquidity to maintain its dividend. The payment, at 44.5 cents, has been increased gradually over the past 12 years. The current payout annualized to $1.78 per common share, and yields an impressive 10.72%.Jefferies analyst Christopher Sighinolfi was careful to note EPD’s liquidity strength in his note.“…better than anticipated 2Q results illustrate the resiliency & flexibility of EPD's assets and personnel, mgmt commentary underscores a continued recovery in operating conditions in 3Q… At quarter-end, EPD had $7.3B in consolidated liquidity, including $6.0B of available capacity under its credit facilities, and $1.3B in unrestricted cash,” Sighinolfi noted.To this end, Sighinolfi rates EPD a Buy along with a $24 price target. This figure implies a strong 47% one-year upside from current levels. (To watch Sighinolfi’s track record, click here)Overall, Enterprise gets a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, and it is unanimous, based on 7 recent Buy reviews. The shares have an average price target of $23.33, suggesting a 43% upside from the current share price of $16.28. (See EPD stock analysis on TipRanks)Enbridge, Inc. (ENB)Last up is Enbridge, Canada’s largest natural gas distributor – and the operator of the longest crude oil transport pipeline system in North America. Enbridge is a giant of the midstream sector, with over $60 billion in market cap.As the corona crisis started and first took hold, in Q1, Enbridge saw little difficulty. The company reported high sequential gains in earnings for the 1Q20, with EPS rising from 46 to 62 cents (61 cents to 82 cents Canadian) and revenue stable at $9 billion ($12 billion Canadian). Q2 saw a reversal, as the effects of the pandemic hit Enbridge. Revenue fell to $5.9 billion ($7.9 billion Canadian), and EPS dropped to 41 cents (54 cents Canadian).Through all of this, Enbridge has kept up its dividend payments – not missing any, even though the company did adjust payouts to keep the dividend sustainable. The current payment is 61 cents US (81 cents Canadian), and gives a yield of 8.2%.Jefferies analyst Vikram Bagri notes several positive developments for ENB in recent months.“ENB sanctioned $1B of new growth projects including four gas utility projects and another European offshore wind project… ENB extended approximately $10B of 364 day extendible credit facilities by one year bringing total liquidity to ~$14.6B, sufficient for ENB to execute on its plans,” Bagri explained.Bagri rates ENB a Buy along with a C$49 price target (US$37.18), implying a 26% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Bagri’s track record, click here)The analyst consensus rating on ENB is a Strong Buy; the stock has 12 Buys and 2 Holds set recently. Shares are selling for $29.57 (C$39.27), and the average price target of $39.63 ($52.23 Canadian) indicates room for a 34% upside potential.

2020-07-07	2020-07-07 18:38:46	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Pipeline Setbacks in U.S. Rattle Oil-Sands Producers in Canada	(Bloomberg) -- This week’s escalation of American pipeline setbacks is heightening concerns among Canadian oil producers who export almost all of their crude to the U.S.Alex Pourbaix, the chief executive officer of Cenovus Energy Inc., called a ruling temporarily shutting down the Dakota Access pipeline on Monday “pretty disturbing” in its implications that existing conduits may now be at risk. His concerns were echoed by the CEOs of Suncor Energy Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Imperial Oil Ltd.“If that would be the new standard, I think it’s going to be incredibly difficult for anybody to invest in any kind of infrastructure,” Pourbaix, who formerly served as chief operating officer of pipeline giant TransCanada Corp., said Tuesday during a Toronto-Dominion Bank conference. “If there’s an opportunity to come back on those regulatory decisions years after the fact, I think that’s a real significant problem.”Crude from the oil sands, a landlocked area of northern Alberta that holds the world’s third-largest crude reserves, is almost entirely shipped through U.S. pipelines to refineries in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. The lack of enough shipping capacity has been the dominant problem facing the industry for the past several years.On Sunday, U.S. power company Dominion Energy Inc. and partner Duke Energy Corp. said they’re killing the controversial Atlantic Coast gas pipeline, citing ongoing delays and uncertainty on costs. The next day, a U.S. district court ruled that Energy Transfer LP’s Dakota Access pipeline will have to shut down in about a month because a federal permit for the line fell short of environmental requirements. Later that day, the U.S. Supreme Court left in force a lower court order that blocks construction on TC Energy Corp.’s Keystone XL pipeline.Also See: Grim Day for Pipelines Shows They’re Almost Impossible to BuildCanada’s oil-sands industry was counting on recent momentum on key projects like the Trans Mountain expansion that links the oil sands to the Pacific Coast, and the replacement and expansion of Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3, which links Hardisty, Alberta, to Superior, Wisconsin. While producers had grown used to delays on new projects, the ruling on the Dakota Access line was particularly worrying because it had already been operating for three years.Similarly, Canadian producers have also had to deal with a temporary shutdown of Enbridge’s Line 5, which helps carry crude and natural gas liquids to refineries in eastern Canada. A Michigan judge ordered the full line shut down last month after damage was found on a portion of it running through the Great Lakes. While Enbridge was allowed to restart the line a week later, Michigan’s governor and attorney general still are working to force the line to cease operations.Imperial has been looking at using ships and rail to supply Ontario refineries in case the line has an extended shutdown, CEO Brad Corson said Tuesday at the TD Securities conference.“The team worked quite proactively over the last couple of weeks to make sure we had adequate contingency plans in place should Line 5 be interrupted for an extended period of time,” he said.Suncor CEO Mark Little said his company also relies on Line 5 to supply its refineries in Sarnia, Ontario, and Montreal. The company can use rail, ships or a Maine pipeline to supply those facilities, but those are costlier methods, and a shutdown of the line would be a “huge potential threat” and could increase the price of oil products like gasoline in the U.S. and Canada, Little said.“This is something that would impact consumers in all of those markets,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pipeline-setbacks-u-rattle-oil-183846389.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-25	2020-06-25 22:09:59	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Enbridge to Shut Oil Pipeline in Win for Michigan Officials	(Bloomberg) -- Enbridge Inc. was ordered to temporarily halt operations of its Line 5 crude oil pipeline by a Michigan judge, handing a victory to state officials who have sought to shut down the conduit.Circuit Court Judge James Jamo ruled Thursday against the continued operation of the conduit’s west line and prevented it from restarting the east line. The shutdown must happen within 24 hours, and the orders will remain in effect until a hearing on the state’s request for a preliminary injunction.It’s a win for Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel, who have tried to shut down the pipeline since taking office last year over concerns about a potential spill in the Great Lakes. Enbridge had planned a $500 million project to replace the line and enclose the segment that runs under the lakes in a tunnel to improve its safety.Enbridge confirmed that it has shut down the pipeline’s west segment, as required by the court, but said its inspections have determined that portion of the line is safe to operate. The company is committed to protecting the environment in the Great Lakes and plans to provide the court with the information it requested, spokesman Michael Barnes said in an emailed statement.Line 5 runs along a 645-mile (1,040-kilometer) route from Superior, Wisconsin, to Sarnia, Ontario, transporting as much as 540,000 barrels a day of light crude and synthetic crude, and natural gas liquids that are refined into propane. The pipeline was built in 1953 and consists mostly of 30-inch diameter pipe. It splits into two 20-inch diameter lines for the 4.5-mile section that runs under the Straits of Mackinac, which connects Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.The most recent tussle over Line 5 started last week, when Enbridge discovered that a screw anchor support for the segment in the straits had shifted from its original position. The company says it shut down the line and notified the state the day it found the damage.Whitmer wrote to the company asking for all its information on the incident, and Nessel later filed court motions asking to shut down the line until the state had fully reviewed the information. Enbridge said it would fight the request, which it called “legally unsupportable.”Enbridge closed up 1% at C$41.38 in Toronto after the judge’s order caused it to give up earlier gains of as much as 1.7%. Canadian heavy crude prices also slipped on the news.(Updates with Enbridge response in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-told-shut-pipeline-victory-182423636.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-24	2020-06-24 20:01:36	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	3 “Strong Buy” Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 7%	The coronavirus pandemic hasn’t gone away; there’s a growing realization that the virus will be with us, at least, for some time to come. An increase in cases has revived fears of a lockdown – although US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has tried to allay those fears, stating that the US cannot afford another national lockdown. The month of May saw great news in the jobs report and the retail sales numbers, but international travel restrictions are still in place. While we’ve started reopening, it’ll be a long road back to normal.Which all makes dividend stocks a logical play. Return-minded investors can find a degree of safety in high-yielding equities, as the dividend will insulate the portfolio’s income stream. And even though dividend stocks tend to return less on share appreciation, there are still plenty out there that are showing high upside potential.We’ve turned to TipRanks database to find three dividend stocks with yields starting at 7%, high by any standard, and with potential upsides starting at 13%. These are stocks that will both grow the portfolio and provide a steady income – and success on multiple fronts is a key strategy to surviving a difficult market environment. Enbridge, Inc. (ENB)We’ll start in the energy industry. Enbridge the largest natural gas distributor in Canada, and the owner/operator of North America’s longest network of crude oil transport pipelines. With a $62.6 billion market cap, Enbridge had both the deep pockets and the essential niche to weather the coronavirus crisis.The company saw earnings rise sequentially during Q1, the ‘corona quarter.’ EPS, at 62 cents per share, was up 34% from Q4, and beat estimates by 21%. Quarterly revenues were down year-over-year, at $8.96 billion, but beat the estimates by 5%. Looking ahead, Enbridge is expected to gross more than $32 billion on the top line this year.Enbridge also improved liquidity during the coronavirus crisis, adding a new $3 billion credit facility an issuing notes worth $4 billion. The company reports it now has access to $14 billion in cash and credit. The strong liquidity has allowed the company to maintain its dividend, which it declared on May 5 at 81 cents per common share. ENB dividend yield is 7.4%, a strong return when compared to the average dividend, just about 2%, found among S&P-listed companies.Evercore ISI analyst Durgesh Chopra is bullish on the stock, noting “Perhaps not previously fully appreciated by the majority of US based equity investors, ENB offers surprisingly little sensitivity to volume fluctuation and overall supply dynamics of Western Canadian heavy and light production… ENB is set to emerge post COVID in a much better position. It has streamlined ownership as well as its portfolio and paid down debt. We expect ENB to trade at a premium…”The analyst gives ENB shares a Buy rating, with a $55 price target indicating a robust 82% upside potential for the coming year. (To watch Chopra’s track record, click here)Wall Street agrees that ENB is a buying proposition. The stock has a Strong Buy analyst consensus, based on 10 Buy and only 3 Holds. Enbridge shares are selling for $30.16, and the $42.06 average price target suggests it has room for 39.5% growth this year. (See Enbridge stock analysis on TipRanks)Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure (FTAI)The next company on today’s list, Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure, is an interesting investment. The company is structured as a REIT, but instead of investing in real estate, Fortress invests mainly in transportation assets. More than half of the company’s portfolio is composed of aviation equipment – meaning Fortress leases high-end commercial aircraft to operators. The company also has an oil refinery and terminal facility on the Texas Gulf coast, in addition to a number of smaller assets.Fortress boasts a high level of lease activity, with 69 of 76 aircraft and 108 out of 168 aircraft engines currently on lease agreements. The average remaining lease term for planes is 33 months and for engines is 14 months, giving Fortress a high level of stability due to recurring revenue.Steady recurring revenue allows Fortress to keep a reliable dividend. The company has paid out 33 cents per share quarterly without missing a beat since 2015. The annualized payment, at $1.32, makes the yield 11.1%. The high yield and solid reliability combine to make this an attractive equity for income investors.5-star analyst Devin Ryan of JMP Securities is sanguine about Fortress’ future, writing of the company: “[We] appreciate the firm will need to navigate some pretty meaningful headwinds in the near term (specifically within Aviation), we do believe it is better positioned than most to ride out the storm, from a capital and business model perspective, following substantial de-levering and improved liquidity in late 2019/early 2020. Importantly, in conjunction with earnings, the company declared its regular quarterly dividend of $0.33, and management was clear that it fully expects to continue to pay this dividend unless the operating backdrop deteriorates significantly further from its current view.”Ryan gives the shares a Buy rating, and his $20 price target implies room for a hefty 77% one-year upside. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)The Strong Buy consensus rating on FTAI is unanimous – Wall Street’s analysts have given the stock 6 Buy ratings. The average price target is $15.83, which indicates room for 40% upside growth from the current share price of $11.31. (See Fortress stock analysis on TipRanks)Two Harbors Investment Corporation (TWO)Two Harbors, the last stock on our list, is a more tradition real estate investment trust. The company invests in real property, but its focus is on residential mortgage-backed securities. Management described the coronavirus crisis as ‘unprecedented,’ and used liquidity measures to shore up the company portfolio during Q1. As a result, TWO reported 25 cents per share earnings in the first quarter of 2020, steady from the previous quarter.Steady earnings allowed the company to pay out 14 cents per common stock share in the quarterly dividend. This annualizes to 56 cents, and gives a yield of 10.4%. TWO has a history of adjusting its common stock dividend to maintain it at affordable levels; the result is a payout that may sometimes change from quarter to quarter, but which the company is committed to paying out to shareholders.Trevor Cranston, 4-star analyst with JMP, was impressed by Two Harbors’ ability to manage the COVID-19 hit. He wrote, “Despite difficult market conditions, TWO was able to meet all margin calls during the first quarter, and sold substantially all of its non-agency credit assets in order to limit further risk going forward.” Of the company’s forward prospects, Cranston is optimistic: “However, we believe returns on new investments are attractive in the agency MBS paired with MSR strategy, which should result in improved earnings once peak advancing requirements are past.”A $6 price target suggests a 16.5% upside to the stock, in Cranston’s view, and he accordingly rates the stock a Buy. (To watch Cranston’s track record, click here)Two Harbors is currently selling for $5.15 and the average price target is in line with Cranston’s, at $6.07. This implies a 16% upside for the stock in the coming year. The analyst consensus here is another Strong Buy, based on 6 Buys and 2 Holds set in recent weeks.

2020-06-23	2020-06-23 22:55:07	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Enbridge Fight With Michigan Over Oil Pipeline Flares Again	(Bloomberg) -- Enbridge Inc.’s yearlong battle with Michigan officials over a pipeline that runs through the Great Lakes is flaring up again after damage to a support structure prompted the state to try to shut down the conduit.The most recent skirmish started last week, when Enbridge discovered that a screw anchor support for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan connect, had shifted from its original position. The company says it shut down the line and notified the state and federal regulators the day it found the damage.Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer then wrote the company asking for all information it has on the damage, including engineering reports, photos and videos. Days later, the state’s attorney general, Dana Nessel, asked a court to order the pipeline’s operations suspended until the state conducts a full review of that information. The east leg of the line, where the damage occurred, remains shut down while the west leg has resumed operation.“One close call with Line 5 is one too many, which is why I am calling on Enbridge to proceed with the utmost caution and care,” Whitmer said in a statement on her website. “At this point in time, Enbridge has provided no reason to think this damage could not happen again, but next time with oil gushing into the Great Lakes.”Enbridge plans to fight the request to shut down the whole line, which it called unnecessary and “legally unsupportable.” The company said it’s working closely with the Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Administration on the incident and that it has provided engineering assessments and other materials to the state.Line 5 runs along a 645-mile (1,040-kilometer) route from Superior, Wisconsin, to Sarnia, Ontario, transporting as much as 540,000 barrels a day of light crude, synthetic crude and natural gas liquids that are refined into propane. The pipeline was built in 1953 and consists mostly of 30-inch diameter pipe. The line splits into two 20-inch diameter lines for the 4.5 miles it runs under the straits.Enbridge and Whitmer have fought over the line since shortly after the Democrat took office at the start of last year. Her attorney general has sued the company, saying that its 1953 easement was unconstitutional, and challenged a law passed by the previous administration that gave Enbridge permission to replace the segment of the line in the straits and enclose it in a tunnel. Whitmer ordered work on the $500 million tunnel project stopped.Enbridge won the challenge to the replacement project, as well as an appeal of the lower court’s ruling. Nessel’s office will seek to have the Michigan Supreme Court review the matter.The lawsuit over the 1953 easement remains active.(Updates status of appeal in eighth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-fight-michigan-over-oil-185544725.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-06-23	2020-06-23 10:00:00	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	After Years of Angst, Canada’s Oil Pipeline Problem May Be Over	(Bloomberg) -- The shortage of pipeline space that has hamstrung Canada’s oil producers for years may finally be over -- just not in the way they had hoped.The pandemic-induced oil crash prompted Canadian companies to cut about 1 million barrels of daily crude output, freeing up space on the country’s previously congested pipelines. With that production likely slow to return and as many as three new conduits slated to be built in the next three years, the industry may have years of cheap, plentiful shipping capacity ahead.That’s a significant turnabout for a country where, until Covid-19 hit, the lack of pipelines out of Western Canada was a central political and economic issue, often pitting the oil-rich province of Alberta against the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.But the pipeline relief came only because oil producers had to adapt to a dramatic drop in demand and low prices that are causing mounting financial losses. Some had spent heavily to ramp up their ability to ship crude by rail and now find themselves stuck with idled tanker cars and loading terminals.The industry “achieved the dream of going long pipeline in Western Canada but for all the wrong reasons,” said Kevin Birn, IHS Markit’s director of North American crude oil markets.Enbridge Inc., which typically has to ration space on its Mainline pipeline system, had spare capacity in recent months, a rare occurrence. Shipments of crude by train, the main alternative to pipelines, have plunged as well. April crude-by-rail exports fell 55% to about 156,000 barrels a day, according to the Canada Energy Regulator. That trend appears to have continued into May, with about 49,000 barrels a day moving by rail, according to Genscape.Until recently, the problem had been just the opposite. The lack of enough shipping capacity forced producers to sell their crude at wide discounts to benchmark U.S. prices, hurting Alberta’s economy. The industry accounts for about a 10th of Canada’s gross domestic product and a fifth of its exports.Trudeau’s approach to the issue has varied. On one hand, he shelled out C$4.5 billion ($3.3 billion) to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline and save a key expansion from being scrapped. On the other, he rejected Enbridge’s proposed Northern Gateway project and implemented regulations that industry groups have said will make it impossible to build new pipelines. Those moves contributed to Trudeau’s Liberal party losing all of its parliament seats from Alberta and Saskatchewan in an election last year.But through all the turmoil, and many delays, three major pipeline projects are expected to enter service by the end of 2023: TC Energy Corp.’s Keystone XL, Enbridge’s expansion of its Line 3, and the Canadian government’s expansion of the Trans Mountain line. The projects would add a combined 1.79 million barrels of daily shipping capacity out of Alberta, an almost 50% increase.For now, with producers reducing output because of the pandemic, the current pipeline system should be able to handle flows, Birn said. Oil-sands companies will be slower to bring production back online until they have more certainty that a recovery is underway, bridging the gap until the new lines are running, he said.“The need for the pipelines in the immediate term has been deferred or delayed because of the dramatic reduction in demand,” he said. “Covid-19 may have bought the industry some time.”To be sure, those start dates are by no means certain. Line 3 already was stalled by a year because of permitting delays, and the project continues to face opposition in Minnesota. Keystone XL, after more than a decade since it was first proposed, is still facing legal challenges in Montana, and Trans Mountain also continues to face resistance from some indigenous communities in British Columbia.In the meantime, some companies are stuck with investments in rail that they won’t need.Cenovus Energy Inc., which suspended crude-by-rail shipments in March, had signed three-year deals in 2018 to transport 100,000 barrels of oil a day, and it also owns the Bruderheim rail-loading facility near Edmonton. Executives said on their first-quarter conference call that the idled crude-by-rail program costs them about C$18 million a year, including the expense of storing unused rail cars.Rail continues to be a part of the company’s “portfolio approach” to transporting its crude over the long-term, said Sonja Franklin, a Cenovus spokeswoman. The majority of the costs associated with the rail program are variable, she said.Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Canadian unit, Imperial Oil Ltd., is in a joint venture on a rail terminal next to its Strathcona refinery in Edmonton. The roughly C$170 million facility can load trains with 100 to 120 cars, for about 210,000 barrels of daily shipping capacity. Imperial executives said on the company’s first-quarter earnings call in May that rail volumes for April had plummeted to 10,000 barrels a day, less than 5% of the facility’s capacity.Imperial declined to comment.With crude demand and oil-sands production likely to remain reduced until new pipelines come online, those rail facilities could stay underused for some time, barring a major technological advancement that makes oil-sands crude cheaper to produce, said Fernando Valle, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.“We could be pretty much set for most of this decade unless there’s a breakthrough,” Valle said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/years-angst-canada-oil-pipeline-100000811.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-15	2020-05-15 14:21:53	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	3 Big Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 7%; JPMorgan Says ‘Buy’	With unemployment rising to 15%, and the grim corporate earnings seasons wrapping up, investors may struggle to keep up the relatively buoyant mood that has boosted markets in recent weeks. They may find some support from the Federal Reserve, where Chairman Jerome Powell this week urged Congress and the White House to agree on additional stimulus packages. The Fed has already cut rates down to 0 to 25 basis points; they have no further ammunition, so if more help is to come, it will need to come on the spending side. Urging action, Powell said that an economic recovery “could come more slowly than they would like.”Viewing the situation for investment bank JPMorgan, quant strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas sees further aid as inevitable: “[This] crisis is a consequence of an exogenous shock, and is unique given the absence of ‘bad actors.’ This makes policy response much less contentious, more proactive and essentially unconstrained.” In his view, there is no ceiling on any action Congress or the Federal Reserve may take – and that may be the bottom line, as far as investors are concerned.Turning to a micro-level view, the stock analysts at JPM are making some concrete recommendations – and they are targeting the dividend stocks. We’ve pulled three of JPM's bullish calls, and ran them through TipRanks database to see what other Wall Street's analysts have to say about them.Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NLY)First up is a real estate investment trust, a niche well-known for its high dividends due to corporate tax code requirements. Annaly focuses its efforts on mortgage-backed securities, the lending side of the REIT sector, and holds an asset portfolio worth $133 billion.Like most companies, Annaly saw a sharp earnings drop in the first quarter. EPS, at 21 cents, was down 19% sequentially, although it did come in just over the 20-cent forecast. The true rough spot was that earnings did not fully cover the company’s Q1 dividend. At 25 cents quarterly, the dividend payment annualizes to $1 even and gives a fantastic yield of 16.9%. Annaly has a long history of maintaining reliable dividend payments, including adjusting the payout if needed to keep it viable. That the company did not make such an adjustment in Q1, despite a payout ratio of 119%, suggests that the company expects earnings to turn upwards in the near term.NLY shares have underperformed in the current bear cycle, losing as much as 59% from peak to trough. Since bottoming out, the stock has regained 40% from its low point – but share prices remain mired in penny-stock territory.Writing for JPM, 5-star analyst Richard Shane sees the low share price here as an opportunity. He writes, “We reiterate our preference for NLY’s large agency MBS portfolio, which consists predominately of specified collateral that performed well in the lower rate environment leading up to the pandemic. We continue to see upside to shares at current levels…”Backing his optimistic stance on NLY, Shane gives the stock a Buy rating. His $8.50 price target implies a strong upside of 45% in the next 12 months. (To watch Shane’s track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street is in cautious agreement with Shane on Annaly. Of 9 recently published stock reviews, the Buys outweigh the Holds 6 to 3. The stock’s current share price is low, at $5.86 even after gains in today’s session, and the average price target of $7.33 suggests room for 25% growth this year. (See Annaly stock analysis on TipRanks)Blackstone Mortgage Trust (BXMT)Sticking with REITs, we turn to Blackstone. This company invests mainly in original senior loans, backed by collateral, in the North American, European, and Australian markets. Blackstone’s real estate portfolio holds $161 billion in assets under management.Like NLY above, Blackstone shares felt a hard hit when the market turned sour in Q1. From peak to trough, BXMT lost an eye-opening 68% of its share value. Even after gains in recent weeks, the stock is still down 46% from its high point in February – this is serious underperformance, as the S&P 500 is only down 15% from its peak.Blackstone’s underperformance comes even as the company beat the earnings forecast in Q1. While EPS was down year-over-year, it did beat quarterly expectations by 5.4%, coming in at 58 cents. Revenues missed the forecast, but still came in at a solid $100.6 million.For income investors BXMT offers a solid dividend payment that has been held steady – regardless of quarterly earnings – for the past three years. The 62-cent quarterly payment gives an annualized value of $2.48 and a yield of 11.7%. This is nearly 6x the average dividend yield among S&P listed companies, and an impressive return by any standard.Richard Shane covers BXMT, too, and he is satisfied that the company can weather the coronavirus storm. Shane says of Blackstone, “BXMT remains a market leader best positioned to negotiate optimal terms with both financing counterparties and well-capitalized institutional borrowers… the overall impact of COVID-19 to quarterly earnings was minimal as all loans have paid interest through April… BXMT noted approximately $821M in liquidity…”In his note on the stock, Shane reiterates his Buy rating, along with a $25.50 price target that suggests an upside potential of 22%. (To watch Shane’s track record, click here)What do other analysts say about Blackstone? It’s almost split. TipRanks analytics shows out of 5 analyst, 3 are bullish on the stock, while 2 remain sidelined. The consensus price target of $24.50 shows a potential upside of 17.22%. (See Blackstone stock analysis on TipRanks)Enbridge, Inc. (ENB)Last up is Enbridge, a major player in the North American energy industry. While oil prices collapsed during Q1 as economies were shut down, that did not negate the need for oil and other hydrocarbons. Even limited economic activity, along with such essentials as home heating and power generation, maintained some demand. Enbridge, which is Canada’s largest natural gas distributor and the owner of the longest crude oil transport network in North America, was well positioned to remain profitable.And it did. The company’s Q1 earnings came in at 62 cents per share, beating the forecast by 21.5% and showing impressive 34.7% sequential growth. Quarterly revenues, of $8.96 billion, beat the estimates by 5.2%.Enbridge has an interesting dividend history. The company has kept up its quarterly payments reliably for the past three years, in part by adjusting the payout to match earnings. The current dividend, which was declared earlier this week, is 57.75 cents per share. The annualized payment of $2.31 puts the yield at 7.5%, not as high as the REITs above but still far better than average – and enormously higher than the badly depressed Treasury bond market.JPM’s Jeremy Tonet believes Enbridge holds a strong business position. He writes of the company, “In addition to the strong results, we view reiterating guidance as a significant positive for ENB, especially considering Mainline concerns. Furthermore, ENB continues to progress several key initiatives, including Mainline recontracting…”In line with this view, Tonet sets a price target of $56 Canadian ($39.86 US at current rates), implying a 29% upside potential for the coming year. Tonet’s bullish upside backs his Buy rating. (To watch Tonet’s track record, click here)The analyst consensus view here is another Moderate Buy, based on 16 ratings that include 12 Buys, 3 Holds, and a single Sell. ENB shares are currently priced at US$30.98, and the average price target of $38.02 indicates a 23% upside potential.

Oil Slips With Glut Concerns Reversing Saudi Price Hike Boost	(Bloomberg) -- Oil fell in a day of wild price swings as investors weighed supply-and-demand fundamentals against Saudi Arabia’s global price hike.Futures in New York dropped 1.8% Thursday. State-run Saudi Aramco raised prices on almost all grades for June, sending futures surging. But the market remains glutted after the kingdom exported record amounts of crude in April. The level of excess global supply averaged 21.3 million barrels a day last month, according to Standard Chartered Plc analysts.“With the prices going up the way they have the last couple of days, I think they are going to pause around here,” said Phil Streible, chief market strategist for Blue Line Futures LLC.The OPEC+ coalition that includes Russia started implementing output cuts of 9.7 million barrels a day this month. While the Saudi pricing brought brief relief to the market, a robust demand increase is what’s needed to sustain higher prices, according to Will Rhind, chief executive officer at GraniteShares.“It has to be demand driven at the end of the day,” Rhind said. “Whether it’s higher prices or a cut in supply, ultimately that has to be met by real demand.”There are signs that oil demand is recovering, and may even exceed supply by as early as the start of June, according to Goldman Sachs Head of Commodities Research Jeff Currie. Gasoline demand is gaining steam in the U.S. with the premium for fuel over diesel at its highest since 2017. On top of that, weekly gasoline supplied, an indicator of consumption, rose by 804,000 barrels a day last week, the biggest bump since June 2018, according the U.S. Energy Information Administration.View the latest market-moving news and analytics surrounding volatile crude prices from Bloomberg.Genscape Inc. also reported on Thursday that stockpiles in Cushing, Oklahoma, fell more than 350,000 barrels since Friday, according to market participants. It will be the first contraction since late February if the U.S. government reports a decline for the full week on Wednesday.However, Rhind cautioned that, if a potential second wave of the virus returns people back to their homes and off the roads, demand could swiftly reverse.“That’s a big question mark on the oil demand,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-claws-back-supply-concerns-221652771.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-04	2020-05-04 23:07:03	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Canadian Heavy Crude Is in High Demand With Output Cuts	(Bloomberg) -- Canadian heavy crude surged to its strongest price versus futures since at least 2008 as producers curtailed output and Enbridge Inc. agreed to open part of its pipeline system for storage.Enbridge on Monday said it would use a section of an old oil pipeline running between Saskatchewan and Manitoba to temporarily store more than 900,000 barrels of crude starting in June, before the pipeline is decommissioned.The announcement came as oil-sands companies were curtailing production in response to pandemic-related demand losses.Heavy oil production from Imperial Oil Ltd.’s Kearl mine will be reduced to about 150,000 barrels a day in the second quarter versus a capacity of 220,000 barrels a day after the company advanced maintenance to May and June. Other oil sands production cuts include:ConocoPhillips cut output on its 150,000 barrel a day Surmont oil sands wells by about 100,000 barrels a daySuncor Energy Inc. is operating just one of two production units at its Fort Hills oil sands mineAthabasca Oil Corp., which shut entirely its Hangingstone oil sands wells, said last week it would reduce production from its Leismer oil sands site to about 8,000 barrels a day from its 20,000 barrel a day capacityCenovus Energy Inc. cut Christina Lake oil sands output by 60,000 barrels a dayFacing bigger discounts for their crude and higher costs compared to oil producers nearer the U.S. Gulf Coast, Alberta’s oil sands companies were quick to curtail output in response to the collapse in demand for motor and jet fuel as people sheltered at home amid the pandemic.The fast response kept inventories at about 32 million to 33 million barrels, Keith Chiasson, Cenovus Energy Inc. executive vice president for downstream, said on a call last Wednesday.Western Canadian Select’s June discount in Alberta to U.S. benchmark futures shrank to $3.80 a barrel, according to NE2 Group. The gap hasn’t been that narrow since at least 2008, compared to data compiled by Bloomberg extending back that far.WCS at Cushing was at a 75-cent discount to futures, according to NE2 Group, putting the difference between Alberta and the U.S. supply hub far below the cost of transport.(Updates prices in last two paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canadian-heavy-crude-high-demand-230703117.html?.tsrc=rss

Enbridge to store crude in Mainline as coronavirus slashes refinery demand	Pipeline operator Enbridge Inc said it has reached a deal with shippers to temporarily store crude in North America's largest oil pipeline network, according to a filing, as Canadian producers scramble to respond to weak refinery demand and low prices.  Enbridge said the agreement would temporarily provide roughly 912,000 barrels of storage on its Canadian Mainline system starting June 1, according to a May 1 filing with the Canadian Energy Regulator.  The Mainline, Canada’s longest oil pipeline system, has capacity for nearly 3 million barrels per day, moving western Canadian oil to U.S. refiners.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-store-crude-mainline-coronavirus-175138237.html?.tsrc=rss

The notice by Enbridge for its Mainline pipeline is the latest sign of dislocation in Canada's hard-hit energy sector as producers scramble to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has severely cut fuel demand and led refiners to reduce purchases of crude.  Constraints on major export pipelines have plagued the Canadian industry for years, leading to steep price discounts for the country's heavy crude against U.S. West Texas intermediate oil.	https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-wont-ration-mainline-deliveries-181908204.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-15	2020-04-15 20:59:56	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	U.S. Oil Glut Turns Canadian Pipeline Problem on Its Head	(Bloomberg) -- The world-wide coronavirus pandemic that’s caused oil demand to plummet has turned the Canadian oil patch’s biggest problem on its head. Rather than having too few oil pipelines, the province now has too many.The collapse in oil demand caused by people staying home has reduced U.S. demand for Canadian crude, leaving pipelines struggling to stay full. After more than a year of rationing space, Enbridge Inc. announced it had additional space on its Mainline pipeline system for both heavy and light crude in April. TC Energy Corp. also issued a call for crude on its Keystone pipeline running from Alberta to the U.S. Midwest.At the same time, the small price difference for crude from Canada makes it unprofitable to ship the country’s crude down pipelines to the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast. Heavy Western Canadian Select oil is trading at a $13.00-a-barrel discount to West Texas Intermediate crude in Hardisty, Alberta. That’s compared with about $9.25 a barrel in Cushing, Oklahoma, as of Wednesday, according to NE2 Group data.The situation is a significant change from just a month or two ago when Canadian producers were struggling to get their oil to U.S. refineries as new pipelines, including the Trans Mountain expansion to the Pacific and Enbridge Line 3, met repeated delays. The situation grew so severe in late 2018 that the Alberta government imposed production curtailments that remain in place.(Updates prices in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/america-oil-glut-turns-canadian-110000639.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-14	2020-04-14 13:02:46	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	RBC: 3 Big 8% Dividend Stocks With Massive Upside Potential	"All the news right now is about the coronavirus and its effect on the economy – and rightly so. The damage – from lockdowns, quarantines, trade and travel restrictions – is unprecedented. US unemployment claims have rocketed in recent weeks, and government data indicates that between 14 and 17 million Americans are unemployed due to the shutdowns. There is no longer any question about hitting a recession – it’s here. What matters now is, how deep will it go, how long will it last, and how steeply will it recover.Stock markets plummeted when the lockdowns began, but last week was Wall Street’s best since 1974. Markets bottomed out on March 23, and what seemed at first to be a ‘bear market rally’ has turned into something more substantial. Traders are taking advantage of low stock prices to position themselves for what the inevitable economic recovery. Of particular interest are dividend stocks, a segment that is showing high upside potential. Dividend stocks offer investors more than just potential for price appreciation – the dividend payout also offers a steady income stream, in good times and bad. These stocks are commonly used as defensive plays, to protect a portfolio’s income qualities when share prices fall.RBC Capital, one of the major names on the Street, sees signs that the markets be starting to heal. Institutional investors have, for the second consecutive week, pushed up their positioning, buying more than selling. And retail investors, in the weekly survey of sentiment, may be showing a return to bullishness. In the latest survey results, bearish sentiment slipped from 52.07% to 49.73%, the first time in three weeks that bearish views had slipped below 50%.So, despite a general sense that the coronavirus impact has pushed us into recession, there are initial signs that we have turned the corner. In line with that, and with the cautiously optimistic tone the bank has taken, RBC’s stock analysts have highlighted three high-quality dividend stocks also offering investors over 20% upside potential. We’ve looked at those stock picks through the lens of the TipRanks database, to find out why they are so compelling. Here are the results.Enbridge, Inc. (ENB)The energy sector is well known for strong cash flows and reliable dividends. Enbridge occupies transport niche, owning and operating North America’s longest transport network for crude oil and other hydrocarbons. The company is flat-out Canada’s largest distributor of natural gas, and provides gas for utilities in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and the US state of New York. The company has three main divisions: liquids pipelines, natural gas pipelines, and utility and power services.Enbridge ended 2019 on a mixed note, with high natural gas pipeline volumes failing to compensate for lower Mainline distribution. Quarterly revenues gained 7% yoy, reaching US$6.7 billion, but missed the forecasts by almost 2%. On a clearly positive note, distributable cash flow – which funds the company’s dividend – rose from US$1.33 billion to US$1.47 billion.For the current quarter, Q1 of calendar 2020, the company has already paid out the dividend – at new rate of 61 cents (US) per share to stockholders of record as of February 14. The dividend annualizes to $2.44, making the yield an impressive 8.5%. This compares favorably to the S&P average dividend of just about 2%, and it is far higher than US Treasury bonds, traditionally a ‘safe haven’ investment but currently yielding less than 1% on average.Covering ENB for RBC, 5-star analyst Robert Kwan sees some risk, but also a company in a powerful position to weather a storm. Kwan writes, referring to the COVID-19 impact, “We expect lower volume on Mainline to be relatively short lived and with that, the financial impact does not appear to be overly material.” Looking ahead, Kwan adds, “…while liquidity questions have more recently come into focus, we note that Enbridge has enough liquidity to fund its 2020 capital plan more than two times, which mitigates exposure to dislocations in the capital markets.” the analyst concluded, ""We believe the stock represents significant long-term value with an attractive, well covered dividend.""The company’s solid position leads Kwan to maintain his Buy rating, along with a CAD61.00 (US$42.94) price target that implies an upside of 50% from current levels. (To watch Kwan’s track record, click here)Overall, ENB stock has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. This is based on 17 reviews, including 13 Buys balanced against 3 Holds and 1 Sell rating. In New York, shares are selling for $28.70, and the $38.44 average price target suggests room for a 34% upside in the coming 12 months. (See Enbridge’s stock analysis at TipRanks)Altria Group, Inc. (MO)Sin stocks – alcohol and tobacco – are another traditional defensive stock play. It’s long been known that, in hard times, people will give up luxuries – but hang on to the smaller comforts like beer and cigarettes. Altria, the owner of the best-selling Marlboro brand, is an old name in the tobacco industry.The company is also not putting all of its eggs into a single basket. As social pressures have eaten into cigarette sales over recent decades, the company has diversified, taking stakes in JUUL brand e-cigarettes, the Canadian cannabis company Cronos, and the Belgian brewing company ABInBev. Altria has shifted from a pure tobacco giant to a veritable one-stop shop for common vices.It remains a viable business strategy, however. E-cigs, while controversial, are widely touted as a probable successor to traditional cigarettes. Cannabis is a growing niche, now fully legal in Canada and fully or partly legal in a growing number of US states. And by owning both a brewer and a cannabis grower, Altria is positioned to move when the cannabis-infused beverage market opens up.On the negative side, Altria is facing potential Federal Trade Commission litigation, under anti-trust laws, related to its 35% stake in JUUL. The government is contending that the stake unlawfully eliminates competition. It will be at least 9 months before any court hearings even begin, however, and the process will almost certainly be long and drawn out. It remains to be seen if Altria will fight or simply sell back all or part of its stake in JUUL.Heading into the coronavirus quarter, Altria finished 2019 with solid earnings. EPS was $1.02 for Q4 2019, and revenues came in at $4.8 billion. Both numbers were modestly higher than the forecasts. The company held its 84-cent quarterly dividend steady, for the third quarter in a row. The next payment is due out at the end of this month. With an annualized payment of $3.36 per share, MO’s dividend is considered high in absolute terms – but the 8.37% yield is the real attraction.RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi sees the FTC issue as minor in the short-term, saying that it should not impact the stock. Modi writes, “Altria intends to fight the ruling... It should, however, buy them some time to get a more favorable valuation.” He also adds that the company has a firm foundation going forward: “Altria’s core tobacco business (which generates all of the company’s profit) is performing well and cigarette volume declines are moderating, while pricing remains solid.”Modi’s Buy rating on MO stock comes with a $68 price target indicative of a 68% upside potential. (To watch Modi’s track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street is pretty upbeat about the tobacco giant. TipRanks analysis of 11 analyst ratings shows a consensus Moderate Buy rating, with 8 analysts Buying and, 2 recommending Hold, and only 1 saying Sell. The average price target among these analysts stands at $49.36, representing a 22% increase from current levels. (See Altria stock analysis on TipRanks.)Coty, Inc. (COTY)With the third and final stock on this list, we turn to the cosmetics industry. Coty currently holds the largest position globally in the fragrance niche, is the world’s second largest hair care product company, and the third largest cosmetic maker. The company owns well-known brands such as Covergirl, Calvin Klein Fragrances, Clairol, Max Factor, and Wella.A strong stable of popular brand names is a true asset, giving the company a solid position in its niche. COTY brought in 27 cents per share in its fiscal Q2 report, beating both the forecast and the year-ago numbers by 12.5%. Revenues edged over the estimates, reaching $2.35 billion, but were down year-over-year.For such a large company, COTY shares are priced low. The easy cost of entry, however, is paired with an 8.3% dividend yield and a 3-year history of dividend growth. The shares currently pay out 13 cents quarterly, and the 46% payout ratio indicates that the dividend is both affordable and has plenty of room for further growth.Nik Modi covered this stock for RBC, too, and sees it as a net positive in the long run. He writes of COTY, “Coty is constantly innovating and bringing new products to market. The success of these new products is a catalyst for growth… We believe improvements to its leverage ratio and an increase in capital deployment to shareholders through increased share repurchases or dividend payouts could be inflection points for Coty’s multiple.”Modi’s Buy rating here is backed by his $9 price target, which implies a hefty 55% upside potential for the company this year. (To watch Modi’s track record, click here)According to TipRanks, the consensus on Wall Street is that COTY stock is a “hold” for investors. But TipRanks might as well have said “buy” — because analysts, on average, think the stock, currently at $5.79, could zoom ahead to $7.33 within a year, delivering nearly 27% profits to new investors.

2020-03-27	2020-03-27 21:59:15	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Canadian Crude Is So Cheap It Costs More to Ship Than to Buy	(Bloomberg) -- Canadian heavy crude has become so cheap that the cost of shipping it to refineries exceeds the value of the oil itself, a situation that may result in even more oil-sands producers shutting operations.Western Canadian Select crude in Alberta dropped to a record-low close of $5.06 a barrel on Friday, according to Bloomberg data going back to 2008, cheaper than a Starbucks venti-sized pumpkin spice latte. WCS is composed of bitumen mixed with light condensate so it can flow through pipelines. The bitumen’s value was at about $1.42 a barrel. Synthetic crude, produced from oil-sands bitumen that’s been run through an upgrader, fell to $9.56 a barrel.Canadian heavy crude now costs less than the price paid by a company with long-term contracts to ship it down Enbridge Inc.’s Mainline and Flanagan South systems to Texas. That’s a problem for oil-sands producers like Cenovus Energy Inc., which has commitments to ship 75,000 barrels a day down the system. MEG Energy Corp., another heavy oil producer, has contracts to ship 50,000 barrels a day and has plans to expand to 100,000 barrels a day in the second half of 2020.Enbridge charges between about $7 to a little over $9 a barrel to ship heavy oil to Texas, excluding additional charges such as for power, according to tariff documents. Cenovus declined to comment and MEG didn’t return an email for comment.Due to its relative isolation and the limited availability of pipelines for export, Canada’s oil patch has been among the first to experience the full weight of the global crude price collapse, caused by the massive contraction in oil demand due to the coronavirus outbreak and a pledge by Saudi Arabia to unleash record amounts of supply. Some of the largest oil-sands producers, like Suncor Energy Inc. and Athabasca Oil Corp., have been forced to react to benchmark crudes hitting historic lows, and have limited or shut down operations.Production cuts for the second quarter in Western Canada will be in the mid-300,000 barrel-a-day range, with reductions predominantly in the oil sands, Kevin Birn, IHS Markit’s director of North American crude oil markets, said by phone.“We are not at the bottom,” he said. “The pressure on the upstream sector will continue to build.”About 125,000 barrels a day of production is currently shut-in and nearly all oil-sands operations are underwater, which “will likely trigger additional production shut-ins,” TD Securities said in a note.“We are expecting most operators to revert to some form of dynamic storage for in-situ projects in order to defer bitumen sales while simultaneously maintaining reservoir integrity,” TD said.(Updates prices in second paragraph, adds IHS projection in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canadian-crude-cheap-costs-more-203212801.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-05	2020-02-05 11:00:00	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Pipelines Are About to Join the ESG Trend, National Bank Says	(Bloomberg) -- Pipeline and midstream energy companies may be about to join the sustainable investment trend.The sector has often been a target of environmental opposition, but their “impressive” safety track records and relatively low environmental footprints could make them a focus for investors who favor environmental, social and governance factors, according to National Bank of Canada.Enbridge Inc. and TC Energy Corp. topped National Bank’s pipeline-ESG ranking, with Inter Pipeline Ltd garnering a positive mention. Compared to power and utility companies, the group has to do a lot of work to develop sustainability reports and targets but that provides an attractive entry point, according to National Bank.“As more companies comply with globally recognized environmental reporting standards and establish attractive ESG goals, we anticipate increased fund flows from sustainability investors,” National Bank analyst Patrick Kenny said in a note to clients this week, predicting the group can close its valuation gap versus utilities.Shares of pipeline and midstream companies haven’t needed a lending hand this year with Enbridge, Pembina Pipeline Corp., and TC Energy leading the Canadian energy index with gains of over 5%. Low interest rates and their defensive nature amid roiling markets have been support while oil producers have dropped alongside the commodity.Indigenous RelationshipsPipeline companies are no strangers to environmental controversy. TC Energy’s Keystone XL line and the Trans Mountain project, now owned by the Canadian government, have both faced numerous delays by those opposed to them as conduits for output from Alberta’s oil sands.Oil spills remain a concern, but the pipeline companies on National Bank’s coverage list have delivered 99.99% of volumes without a spill, Kenny said. Social and governance standards can be increased through areas such as indigenous relationships and board oversight, respectively, he said.Meanwhile in the U.S. market, a similar theme was echoed at Credit Suisse, where most of the midstream names that have been picked up by ESG ETFs have published sustainability reports, the bank said.“Screening well on ESG metrics can attract new investors and provide ‘sticky ownership’ which could drive higher stock valuation,” Credit Suisse analyst Spiro Dounis told clients in a note last month. One of BlackRock’s ESG ETF’s, the iShares ESG MSCI USA Leaders ETF, has pipeline holdings including Kinder Morgan Inc. and Williams Cos.To contact the reporter on this story: Michael Bellusci in Toronto at mbellusci2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jacqueline Thorpe at jthorpe23@bloomberg.net, ;Brad Olesen at bolesen3@bloomberg.net, Divya BaljiFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pipelines-join-esg-trend-national-110000206.html?.tsrc=rss

Enbridge Says Mainline Foes Are Stalling for Time in Pipe Saga	(Bloomberg) -- Enbridge Inc. said opponents of its plan to convert the Mainline oil pipeline network to a contract system may be stalling for time, hoping to see what happens on other lines that are in the works before making long-term commitments on its system.Opponents of Enbridge’s proposal, including Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and the Explorers & Producers Association of Canada, have asked that the Canada Energy Regulator split the approval process for the plan into two. The first part would address whether the conversion should even be allowed.That scenario would be unique, and would likely make the entire regulatory process longer, said Vern Yu, the head of Enbridge’s liquids pipelines business. Pipeline projects including the Trans Mountain expansion, TC Energy Corp.’s Keystone XL and Enbridge’s Line 3 expansion face key obstacles this year that could affect their timelines or even their ultimate fate.“It might be strategic from some of these shippers because it would help them gain more clarity on what’s happening on some of the other pipelines that are under development,” Yu said in an interview. “It would be a way for them to gain an advantage as they make decisions going forward.”Yu reiterated that Enbridge’s plan to lock shippers on the Mainline into contracts of as long as 20 years -- a change from the current system, in which space is allocated on a monthly basis -- has the support of customers accounting for more than 70% of the volume on the system. The plan will provide shippers with certainty on tolls and market access.Oil-sands producer Cenovus Energy Inc. and LyondellBasell Industries NV, which owns a Houston refinery that receives crude from the Mainline, were among companies noting their support of the change in filings on Thursday.The Mainline is Canada’s largest oil pipeline network, with the capacity to ship about 2.85 million barrels a day.To contact the reporter on this story: Kevin Orland in Calgary at korland@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net, Carlos Caminada, Dan ReichlFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-says-mainline-foes-stalling-100000876.html?.tsrc=rss

PennEast sought the FERC decision after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in September that the company could not use federal eminent domain to condemn land controlled by the state.  FERC in January 2018 approved PennEast's request to build the pipeline from Pennsylvania to New Jersey, and the company promptly sued in federal court under the U.S. Natural Gas Act to use the federal government's eminent domain power to gain access to properties along the route.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-ferc-sides-penneast-natgas-201919495.html?.tsrc=rss

Enbridge plans to allow shippers to book 90% of space under contracts on the nearly 3 million barrel per day Mainline, Canada's biggest oil pipeline system, rather than continue to ration space on a monthly basis.

2020-01-29	2020-01-29 11:00:00	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Enbridge Mainline Contract Plan Hits Pushback From Top Producer	(Bloomberg) -- Enbridge Inc.’s proposal to convert its Mainline crude pipeline network to long-term contracts is hitting a fresh round of opposition, with Canada’s largest oil producer asking regulators to reject the plan.Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. said in a filing with the Canada Energy Regulator on Tuesday that Enbridge’s bid to change the Mainline from monthly service to long-term contracts is an abuse of market power and isn’t in the public interest. The producer asked the regulator to split its review of the proposal into two parts, with the first addressing whether the conversion should even be allowed.The opposition signals that Enbridge hasn’t yet sold some producers on its plan, which already has been delayed after drillers persuaded regulators to a halt a bidding process for space on the line. That halt required Enbridge to submit its full plan for review by regulators last month, and Canadian Natural is now asking the CER to reject it outright.“The proposed conversion of the Mainline from common carriage to contract carriage is unprecedented and inconsistent with the common carriage obligations established in the CER Act,” Calgary-based Canadian Natural said in the filing.Enbridge said in an emailed statement it’s reviewing the filing submitted by Canadian Natural and will provide a response to CER by Feb. 7, adding that its proposal has received support from companies representing over 70% of the Mainline’s current throughput. The pipeline operator has previously said its proposal to the CER represents 18 months of discussions with a variety of shippers and is the best compromise of their competing views.Enbridge is seeking to be able to lock customers on the Mainline into contracts for as long as 20 years, a shift from the current system in which space is allocated on a monthly basis. The company has said long-term contracts will provide shippers with certainty on tolls and market access.The Explorers & Producers Association of Canada, which represents mostly small- and mid-sized producers, also asked the CER on Tuesday to split the review process in two. The regulator should address other matters in Enbridge’s application, such as tolls, only once the fundamental issue of a switch to contract service is decided.“The Enbridge Application is proposing a monumental change that has the potential to change the face of Canadian oil markets for decades,” EPAC President Tristan Goodman said in its filing. “Therefore, the preliminary issue of the appropriateness of converting the Enbridge Mainline to firm service should be carefully considered as a threshold question by a process that is efficient, inclusive and consistent with the public interest.”&#92;--With assistance from Stephen Stapczynski.To contact the reporter on this story: Kevin Orland in Calgary at korland@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net, Carlos Caminada, Dan ReichlFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-pipeline-contract-plan-hits-003943534.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-01-28	2020-01-28 17:32:31	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Alberta Cuts Funding While Virus Hampers Oil, Spreads Widen	(Bloomberg) -- Alberta is pulling back on borrowing, a move that could contain the recent widening of the province’s debt risk spreads as the coronavirus slams oil prices, a key revenue source for the western Canadian territory.“Our current cash flow forecasts suggest that less financing will be required than what was previously forecast, due in part to actions taken by the government to improve cash management,” Jerrica Goodwin, Edmonton-based spokeswoman at Alberta’s finance ministry, said in an email. “There are a number of measures related to cash management including a reduction in deficit,” she said, adding that further details will be disclosed when the next budget is released.In October, Alberta released a budget plan that called for C$12.2 billion to be raised in the long-term debt markets for the fiscal year ended March 31 -- of which C$5.5 billion was remaining as of today. Ontario, by comparison, completed its C$31.6 billion borrowing plan last week, according to Laurentian Bank Securities Inc. data. Meanwhile, Quebec began pre-funding for the following fiscal year in late 2019.Investors demand 10.2 basis points more to hold Alberta’s bonds maturing in September 2029 over similar-duration Ontario securities. That’s near the widest since mid-December. The gap was as tight as 6.9 basis points on Aug. 2 before pushing out to as wide as 12.2 basis points after the federal election.Alberta had already been playing catch-up to other Canadian provinces, selling C$700 million of bonds earlier this month -- its first domestic currency debt offering in almost four months. Since that Jan. 14 note sale, Alberta’s bond spreads over those of Ontario and Quebec widened.“We will continue to monitor the domestic and global markets and will borrow when we feel it is in the province’s best interests, not to time the market,” said Goodwin.While Alberta bond spreads may widen further in the short term, in the medium term pricing for the province may improve, according to Hosen Marjaee, senior managing director at Manulife Investment Management.That’s because, “pipelines that Enbridge and TransCanada are building are getting close to completion and once they are up and running, there will be much more Alberta oil going through them and more royalties,” he said.(Updates with investor quote in last two paragraphs.)To contact the reporter on this story: Esteban Duarte in Toronto at eduarterubia@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Jacqueline ThorpeFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alberta-cuts-funding-plan-while-144137312.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-13	2019-12-13 11:00:00	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Pipeline-Starved Canadian Energy Shines as Permian Cools Down	(Bloomberg) -- Canadian energy firms have quietly outperformed their U.S. counterparts this year and, even after the run, a chorus of positive outlooks on the sector to the north continues.Canada’s energy index has risen about 12.7% in 2019 versus 5% for the comparable U.S. gauge, led by pipeline firms including TC Energy Corp. and Enbridge Inc., which have risen about 39% and 19% respectively. Meanwhile, the Permian Basin and U.S. shale boom has decelerated.“The Canadian industry has been starved of capital for four years now,” Rafi Tahmazian, senior portfolio manager at Canoe Financial, said in an interview on BNN Bloomberg Thursday. He sees the U.S. just beginning to enter a phase that Canada was in, and thinks Canada’s industry is “on the edge of extreme profitability.”As a result, at least one Wall Street bank has been vindicated in its call for oil-sands companies to outperform shale. Bank of America said earlier this year that shorter cycle projects have attracted investment in recent years, making U.S. shale a “victim of its own success” as production growth has continued while in Canada it’s moderated.Meanwhile, Canaccord Genuity added Canadian Pipelines to one of its 2020 “contrarian investment themes.” The firm thinks that a lack of transportation options should allow pipeline operators to maintain pricing power. In a note to clients, strategist Martin Roberge also cited the pipelines’ defensive characteristics.U.S. political risks and shale production concerns are additional reasons for a potential shift of funds back into Canadian energy stocks, according to Toronto-based investment bank Eight Capital. These trends are “helping to create a shift in tide which should put Canadian oil sands/heavy oil in favor over U.S. E&Ps,” the firm said.Additional catalysts may come from the continued construction of the Trans Mountain pipeline and a decision on Enbridge’s Line 3 project. Enbridge recently said it needs to see “further clarity” on the regulatory and permitting process before making an assessment of when the U.S. segment can come online.To contact the reporters on this story: Michael Bellusci in Toronto at mbellusci2@bloomberg.net;Divya Balji in Toronto at dbalji1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brad Olesen at bolesen3@bloomberg.net, Scott Schnipper, Catherine LarkinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pipeline-starved-canadian-energy-shines-110000820.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-10	2019-12-10 22:39:27	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Oil Holds Near 3-Month High Despite Surprise U.S. Crude Build	(Bloomberg) -- Oil eased gains after a surprise build in U.S. crude stockpiles contrasted with analyst expectations for a draw.Futures in New York edged lower after closing at the highest in nearly three months. The American Petroleum Institute reported a 1.41 million-barrel build in crude inventories last week, according to people familiar with the matter. That runs counter to a Bloomberg survey of analysts predicting a draw. The U.S. government will release its weekly inventory report Wednesday.“API’s report for a build in crude stocks, and the large builds in gasoline and distillates probably caused crude futures to fall,” said Michael Loewen, director of commodity strategy at Scotiabank in Toronto.Seasonally, U.S. crude inventories are higher than the five-year average. Industry-backed API reported that gasoline and distillate supplies rose by over 8 million barrels combined. The gasoline build would mark the fifth consecutive rise if government data confirms it.Demand concerns stemming from the prolonged U.S.-China trade war persist. President Donald Trump’s administration is set to put tariffs on a further $160 billion of Chinese goods Sunday, although Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said they’re unlikely to be implemented. Chinese officials also expect the higher levies to be postponed, according to people familiar with the matter.West Texas Intermediate for January delivery traded at $59.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:57 p.m. local time. The contract settled at $59.24.Brent for February settlement was down 8 cents at $64.14 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange. The contract settled at $64.34. The global benchmark crude traded at a $5.20 premium to WTI for the same month.“For the market to push even higher, the key element is the signing of a trade agreement” between China and the U.S., said Gene McGillian, manager for market research at Tradition Energy. “That will rekindle expectations of economic growth and fuel demand growth.” Nevertheless, “we don’t have proof that there’s actually going to be a trade agreement,” he said.On Friday, oil closed at the highest level since mid-September after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies surprised the market with deeper-than-expected output cuts. But there are lingering concerns on adherence to the latest agreement, given under-compliance by some members in the previous round of reductions.To contact the reporter on this story: Sheela Tobben in New York at vtobben@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Catherine Traywick, Carlos CaminadaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-steady-near-12-week-075930870.html?.tsrc=rss

In a highly unusual move, the regulator halted the auction after major producers in the country protested Enbridge's plans to switch to longer-term contracts from monthly allocation.  Enbridge, which also reported better-than-expected third quarter profit on Friday, said it expects to place the Canadian portion of the Line 3 replacement into service on Dec.1 after delays due to tribal and environmental challenges.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-enbridge-posts-quarterly-profit-122338983.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-18	2019-09-18 09:00:00	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Enbridge Oil Pipeline Avoids Minnesota Supreme Court Challenge	(Bloomberg) -- Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 oil pipeline replacement and expansion project won’t face a challenge in front of the Minnesota Supreme Court from groups opposing it, removing one potential roadblock for the already-delayed proposal.The court on Tuesday denied a petition for further review from the non-profit group Honor the Earth and the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, who had been seeking to challenge the project’s approval by state regulators. The court also denied a similar request from Friends of the Headwaters.The decision removes one possible obstacle for Line 3’s replacement and expansion, a key project for Canadian crude producers suffering from a lack of pipeline capacity. The proposal already had been set back by a year because of permitting issues, a delay that ultimately prompted the Canadian production hub of Alberta to extend its mandatory output cuts for a year to prevent a glut of oil from overwhelming the province.Enbridge said the ruling will allow the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to start addressing a deficiency that was found in the project’s environmental review, and the company is confident the regulator will soon provide guidance on the next steps in that process.“Having clarity on the remaining process and schedule will allow us to start making real commitments with contractors, labor and other partners in local Minnesota communities who are eager to see the economic impacts,” Todd Nogier, an Enbridge spokesman, said in an emailed statement.The roughly C$9 billion ($6.7 billion) Line 3 project would add 370,000 barrels of daily shipping capacity along a 1,031-mile route from the Alberta oil hub of Hardisty to Superior, Wisconsin.Enbridge shares rose 0.1% to C$46.68 at 2:44 p.m. in Toronto. Shares of the Calgary-based company had risen almost 10% this year through Monday.&#92;--With assistance from Andrew Harris, Rachel Adams-Heard and Joshua Fineman.To contact the reporter on this story: Kevin Orland in Calgary at korland@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net, Christine BuurmaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-oil-pipeline-avoids-minnesota-090000084.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 21:24:49	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Oil Rally Peters Out as Demand Concerns Counter Inventory Draws	(Bloomberg) -- Oil rose to a one-week high on signs that OPEC supply cuts are draining U.S. oil inventories, before running out of steam amid ongoing concerns that trade disputes will curb demand growth.Futures in New York advanced as much as 3.3% just after the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday reported a 10 million-barrel crude draw, in line with an earlier estimate by the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute. Prices shed about half those gains after follow-through buying failed to materialize and investors turned their attention back to broader trade concerns.“The market is still very concerned about the tariffs and trade wars” and their effect on oil demand, said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC. Investors aren’t just grappling with President Donald Trump’s trade fracas with Beijing but also a growing row between South Korea and Japan, which could potentially mar oil demand, he said.Asia isn’t the only area where trade disputes are dragging out uncertainties in oil consumption. In Europe, the U.K. is still in the throes of coming up with a Brexit agreement. “Being unable to come up with a deal on Brexit efficiently could slow down trade. And that would affect oil demand,” said Vikas Dwivedi, a global oil and gas economist at Macquarie Capital USA Inc. in Houston.West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery settled 85 cents higher at $55.78 a barrel, after touching $56.75.Brent for October settled up 98 cents at $60.49 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange, after earlier touching $61. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $4.71 a barrel to its U.S. counterpart.Still, one thing the market has to watch out for in the coming weeks is U.S. production. Today’s record weekly volume at 12.5 million barrels a day, as it accumulates, will drag on prices, said Dwivedi.“The draws can come and go and fade off seasonally because of refinery turnarounds and demand softness,” he said. “But the supply, if the growth is as fast as today’s numbers, it could keep being a worry for several months.”&#92;--With assistance from Grant Smith.To contact the reporter on this story: Sheela Tobben in New York at vtobben@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Catherine TraywickFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-extends-gain-report-shows-064858680.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 17:24:37	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Enbridge Oil-Shipping Revamp Hits Snag as Regulator Steps In	(Bloomberg) -- Enbridge Inc.’s proposed shift to long-term crude shipping contracts on its Mainline pipeline network is drawing the ire of a growing number of producers, and now Canada’s energy regulator is getting involved, which could delay the process.After ConocoPhillips and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. became the latest companies to object to Enbridge’s search for long-term shipping commitments, the regulator on Tuesday asked all involved to present their views. It’s asking for arguments on whether the so-called open season should be delayed until the new system has been approved by the regulator. Enbridge has argued that it needs the commitments before it seeks approval.The tussle is just the latest outcome of a pipeline bottleneck that’s dogging the Canadian oil industry as producers await major projects like Keystone XL and the Trans Mountain expansion to be built. With a dearth of options, producers fear a shift from the current monthly sign-up system will leave them less room to maneuver.Enbridge says that long-term contracts, which would only apply to Canadian segments of the system, would be the best way to balance the needs of all shippers. The change could also lend an advantage to some of the largest refiners in the U.S. Midwest, such as BP Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp., who source crude on the Mainline, according to Mike Walls, an analyst at Genscape Inc.“Producers are concerned that if a relative few large refiners in the U.S. control a large portion of the Mainline space, their access to customers will be limited as well as their ability to get to more diverse markets like the Gulf Coast,” Walls said in an email. “They would have less spot capacity and in the end would have to sell to the owners of the committed capacity.”Exxon declined to comment. BP didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Enbridge wants to reserve as much as 90% of space on the Mainline to companies with multiyear contracts, charging them whether they ship oil on the line or not. The 2.8 million barrel-a-day Mainline has seen heavy rationing as surging production has run into nationwide pipeline bottlenecks. Enbridge aims to start sending contracted volumes down the line in 2021.“The offering that we’ve got in that open season is responding to the needs of our customers and is supported by shippers representing the majority of the volume on our system,” Guy Jarvis, Enbridge’s executive vice president for liquids pipelines, said by phone. In his objection Tuesday, Canadian Natural President Tim McKay argued that the plan disadvantages non-integrated producers in favor of “shippers who can supply their own downstream” facilities.Separately, ConocoPhillips Canada President Kirk Johnson said the plan creates uncertainty for companies with contracts to ship on connecting pipelines such as the Flanagan South system that runs from Illinois to Oklahoma. The plan already has drawn objections from Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest integrated energy producer, as well as oil-sands driller MEG Energy Corp. and the Explorers & Producers Association of Canada, which represents small- and medium-sized producers.To contact the reporters on this story: Robert Tuttle in Calgary at rtuttle@bloomberg.net;Kevin Orland in Calgary at korland@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Carlos Caminada, Simon CaseyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-pipeline-contracts-seen-putting-110000044.html?.tsrc=rss

Last month the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada, which represents smaller producers, also wrote to Canada’s National Energy Board opposing the change because of concerns it will favor larger oil producers and refiners.  The 2.85 million barrel-per-day Mainline is North America's largest pipeline system and a crucial conduit for Canadian producers exporting crude to the United States.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-meg-energy-joins-opposition-191115255.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-02	2019-08-02 15:35:24	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Pipelines Add Room on ‘Unrelenting’ Demand for Canada’s Oil	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. refiners want more Canadian oil, and pipeline companies are finding ways to get it to them.Companies are adding space to their congested oil export pipelines from Canada even as plans for bigger expansions and new lines face delays. TC Energy Corp. will offer as much as 50,000 barrels a day of new capacity on its Keystone pipeline as early as next year by using chemicals, called drag resistance agents, to ease flows thorough the system.That “will allow TC Energy to respond to the demand for additional transportation capacity for crude oil from western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast,” Jamie Harding, a spokesman for the company, said in an email.Enbridge Inc., operator of the largest oil pipeline system, is using similar methods to add about 135,000 barrels a day of extra capacity to its system by early next year. The company begins an open season Friday, allowing shippers to sign up for secure, contracted space on the Enbridge mainline system starting in July 2021.Since June, flows on Enbridge’s Mainline are up 213,000 barrels a day from a year earlier, said Tim Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors in Calgary. Rail exports are also ramping up and are forecast to reach half a million barrels a day, Tim McKay, present of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., said Thursday.“When you put the Enbridge mainline and increased rail, that’s whats bringing in differentials” between heavy Canadian crude and WTI futures, Pickering said.Heavy Canadian crude for January was less than $20 a barrel below to West Texas Intermediate futures Wednesday versus almost $22 a month ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Enbridge has optimized its pipeline system to create about 220,000 barrels a day of new capacity over the past “couple of years,” Jesse Semko, a spokesman for the company, said in an email.Alberta CurtailmentCanadian oil producers have been struggling to export their crude for more than a year after pipelines filled to capacity, sending the price of heavy Western Canadian Select crude to a $50 discount to futures last October. The situation became dire enough that Alberta’s government imposed mandatory limits on the largest suppliers.Prices are strengthening even after Enbridge announced that its Line 3 pipeline expansion won’t start operation until late next year, about 12 months behind schedule, a situation that could prompt an extension of the production limits into 2020. At the same time, new low-sulfur ship fuel rules that go into force next year threaten to cut demand for the heavy, high-sulfur grades of crude produced in Canada.Still, demand for heavy crude by refiners in the U.S. Gulf Coast and abroad has strengthened as Venezuelan production collapsed amid sanctions and political unrest, OPEC cut output and as sanctions were tightened on Iran. A cargo of Kearl crude was shipped from the Gulf Coast to Malaysia last month, the first such shipment in five years.“The demand we are seeing from the refiners for heavy barrels is unrelenting,” Pickering said. “It’s massive.”(Adds Enbridge open season in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Sheela Tobben.To contact the reporter on this story: Robert Tuttle in Calgary at rtuttle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Catherine TraywickFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pipelines-add-room-meet-unrelenting-213645265.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-01	2019-08-01 17:23:33	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Deadly Blast on Major Natural Gas Pipeline Spurs U.S. Probe	(Bloomberg) -- A deadly explosion on an Enbridge Inc. natural gas pipeline killed one woman and burned several structures in central Kentucky, including nearby homes.The U.S. Transportation Department sent a Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration investigator to the site and officials from the office of pipeline safety are on their way, spokesman Darius Kirkwood said in an email.The blast early Thursday prompted an evacuation in Lincoln County. Flames shot 300 feet to 400 feet (91 to 122 meters) up in the air and were visible from up to 70 miles away, Lincoln County Emergency Management Director Don Gilliam said over the phone. Emergency responders are checking on two nearby pipelines to make sure they are secure after the fire.Six people were sent to a nearby hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, including a law enforcement deputy who suffered burns from rescuing residents from a burning house, said Robert Purdy, the public affairs officer at Kentucky State Police Post 7 in Richmond. All missing people have been accounted for.Enbridge has isolated a section of the 30-inch pipeline, part of the Texas Eastern system, near Danville and is working with authorities to secure the site, Michael Barnes, a company spokesman, said in an interview. Texas Eastern is one of the largest pipeline systems in the U.S., stretching almost 9,000 miles from the Northeast to the Gulf Coast.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who represents Kentucky, said in a statement that his office is “closely monitoring” the explosion.Natural gas futures for Sept. delivery rose as much as 4.5% Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $2.333, the highest since July 18. They declined 0.7% to $2.217 per million British thermal units at 1:17 p.m. Enbridge shares were up 1.4%.Supply for next-day delivery at hubs serving Appalachia, the largest U.S. producing region, fell as the blast left output stranded in the area. Tetco M3 for delivery Friday fell to $1.96 per million British thermal units from $2.04, while Dominion South traded at $1.85 after settling at $1.94 Wednesday, according to David Hoy, a trader at Dynasty Power Inc. in Calgary.The explosion comes as gas suppliers face increased scrutiny about safety following a number of recent blasts. In September, a series of explosions on a systems operated by NiSource Inc.’s Columbia Gas of Massachusetts erupted in the towns of Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, killing one person and injuring more than two dozen. And in October, a rupture on Enbridge’s Westcoast Mainline gas system caused fuel shortages in the Pacific Northwest.This was the third significant incident on the line in four years, and it’s cutting southbound flows to zero from 1.7 billion cubic feet per day on Wednesday, according to BloombergNEF analysts.What BloombergNEF saysThe explosion in Kentucky, which killed one person, will create a major supply shortfall for the South Central region. Spot and prompt futures on the Nymex September contract are bid as a result this morning, while Appalachian basis is getting offered violently.--Jennifer Cogburn and Laurent Key, analystsClick here to read the research(Updates with impacts of the fire starting in third paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Naureen S.

Canadian pipeline company Enbridge plans to turn the Mainline system from a common carrier system in which shippers submit monthly bids for capacity, to one that is mostly contracted for up to two decades.  The open season, a period in which shippers can submit bids for contracted space, was meant to start in mid-July and last for two months, Enbridge said previously.	https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-delays-start-open-season-193330821.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-11	2019-07-11 09:00:00	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Top High-Yield Manager Sees Rally Enduring in Low-Inflation Era	(Bloomberg) -- The rally in risky corporate debt is far from over, according to the manager of the world’s best-performing high-yield bond fund.Nicholas Leach sees a tech-driven world that’s put a “mobile price-discovery device” in every pocket keeping inflation low. As a result, global monetary policy will stay loose, according to the portfolio manager at CIBC Asset Management, the C$134 billion ($102 billion) investing arm of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.“Central banks are pushing investors into corporates worldwide,” said Leach, whose Renaissance High Yield Bond Fund at CIBC has returned 14% this year, the most among 68 global peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “There will be an even stronger bid for corporates as global sovereign bonds sink further into negative yields.”Leach’s call for further gains comes after a blistering first-half for bonds amid bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. U.S. high-yield debt has returned just over 10% this year, compared with 6% for investment-grade sovereign and corporate bonds, according to the Bloomberg Barclays indexes. That helped lure $3 billion to the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF in June, a monthly record, pushing its assets to $18.7 billion as of Wednesday.The frenzy has prompted some managers to cut high-yield exposure, including Pilar Gomez-Bravo. The portfolio manager at MFS Investment sees similarities in current markets to the speculative mania that brought on the financial crisis. She’s betting the rally is on its last legs.But Toronto-based Leach, who started his career as a computer programmer, said low inflation will keep the rally going.“Every single person now, including kids, teenagers, are all walking around with a mobile price-discovery device and that’s one of the key reasons why inflation is staying low,” he said. “You can just go to YouTube and learn how to fix old things, you don’t need to buy new ones. Also, if you need something, you can just buy second hand.”Enbridge BetHis high yield fund is 85% allocated to U.S. companies and 15% to Canadian, in both local currency and U.S. dollars. He invests in roughly 125 names, focusing on companies that are positioned to survive a cycle, but allowing for small positions in several distressed names.One of his largest bets is Enbridge Inc.’s hybrid securities due 2077. While not technically high-yield, they are trading like it, a strategy he’s used to buy other debt including Ford Motor Co. and Seagate Technology Plc.Enbridge hybrid notes are convertible to shares in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency. He likes the company for its stable business, strong recurring cash flow and C$97 billion market value.“I’m not worried about a restructuring with Enbridge,” said Leach. “That is just extremely remote, so I don’t really need to worry about whether I have unsecured or secured notes.”With C$63 billion in debt, Enbridge’s subordinated notes are rated one notch below investment grade at Moody’s Investors Service, which means that some institutional investors can’t hold it. That’s causing them to trade about 380 basis points above benchmark government bonds, in line with companies that are way further into junk, he said.Leach, who holds an economics degree, uses models supplemented with credit and equity market metrics to quantify credit risk on a more granular level than spreads, taking the human emotion out of the equation, he said. The second step is to then analyze this data to figure out where the “markets might have it wrong.”“While part of me is happy I’m not writing code anymore, it has helped me a lot in terms of building some of these algorithms for our quantitative models,” Leach said.&#92;--With assistance from Shin Pei.To contact the reporter on this story: Paula Sambo in Toronto at psambo@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Jacqueline Thorpe, Christopher DeRezaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-high-yield-manager-sees-090000424.html?.tsrc=rss

The Line 3 replacement project would ship 760,000 barrels  per day of Canadian crude from Alberta to Wisconsin, doubling  current capacity and providing much-needed relief from  congestion on existing Canadian pipelines.  It is the furthest advanced of three proposed pipeline  expansions - along with the Canadian government-owned Trans  Mountain and TC Energy Corp's Keystone XL - that would  ease a glut of oil in Alberta.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/minnesota-court-rules-environmental-assessment-164405030.html?.tsrc=rss

Southeast Supply Header, LLC -- Moody's affirms Southeast Supply Header's Baa2 rating; changes outlook to negative	"Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") affirmed Southeast Supply Header, LLC's (SESH) Baa2 senior unsecured rating and changed the outlook to negative from stable.  ""Southeast Supply Header's negative outlook reflects the approaching 2020 expiration of its largest contract, a material credit negative that could result in significantly weaker financial metrics starting in late 2020, barring successful capacity re-contracting at similar terms "", said Moody's Analyst Lesley Ritter.  A failure to renegotiate SESH's largest customer contract, a 500,000 Dth/d capacity contract with Florida Power and Light Company (FPL, A1 stable), by September 2020 would have a substantial negative impact since the capacity represents about 46% of total pipeline capacity and 50% of total revenues."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/041d6e75-c388-345f-9558-a7b07379c582/southeast-supply-header%2C-llc.html?.tsrc=rss

TransCanada says Keystone likely source of Missouri oil leak	"TransCanada Corp. believes its Keystone pipeline is likely the source of an oil leak near St. Louis that Missouri officials have estimated at 1,800 gallons (6,814 liters), a spokesman for the company said Friday.  Sections of both the Keystone pipeline and Enbridge Inc.'s Platte pipeline were closed as crews sought to find the source of the leak, which was discovered Wednesday in St. Charles County.  ""Following overnight activity and excavation, preliminary investigation has led TransCanada to believe that the oil discovered in St. Charles County likely originates from the Keystone Pipeline system and we will continue to conduct our activities accordingly,"" TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-highly-confident-platte-not-175718269.html?.tsrc=rss

Two Key Pipeline Shutdowns Cause Canadian Oil Price to Slip	Heavy Western Canadian Select for March traded at $10.30 below the calendar average for West Texas Intermediate crude futures, compared with a $9.40 discount earlier Thursday, according to data from Net Energy Exchange.  Prices weakened as shutdowns of TransCanada Corp.’s Keystone pipeline and Enbridge Inc.’s Platte line on Wednesday dragged on and threatened a pile-up of crude in Alberta.  Canada’s oil-sands crude serves as a similar substitute, but Alberta has struggled with pipeline bottlenecks that have forced rationing on export pipelines and prompted the province to impose mandatory production curtailments.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/two-key-pipeline-shutdowns-cause-195631815.html?.tsrc=rss

Enbridge restores some natgas flows on damaged TETCO pipe in Ohio	Enbridge Inc restored southbound  natural gas flows over the weekend through parts of its Texas  Eastern (TETCO) pipeline in Ohio that were damaged in an  explosion last week.  The blast last Monday forced drillers using the pipe to  reduce output in the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania,  Ohio and West Virginia, the nation's biggest gas producing  region, during the week before a polar vortex is expected to  freeze the eastern half of the United States.  Total output in the Marcellus and Utica returned to 30  billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), the same as before the pipe  blast, which cut production there by around 1 bcfd last week,  according to financial data provider Refinitiv.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-restores-natgas-flows-damaged-153647771.html?.tsrc=rss

Planned Great Lakes oil pipeline tunnel clears final hurdle	A proposal to run an oil pipeline beneath a crucial section of the Great Lakes cleared its final hurdle Wednesday, gaining approval of a Michigan panel created a week earlier in a dash to complete the deal before Republican Gov. Rick Snyder leaves office.  The three-member Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority unanimously backed an agreement between the state and Canadian pipeline company Enbridge to drill a tunnel through bedrock up to 100 feet (30.4 meters) below the more than 4-mile-wide (6.4 kilometer) channel that links Lakes Huron and Michigan.  A new segment of pipeline would extend through the tunnel, replacing twin pipes that have lain along the lake bed since 1953.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/michigan-panel-consider-great-lakes-pipeline-tunnel-134746105.html?.tsrc=rss

Shale Boom Raises Specter of New Glut: Gulf Coast Oil Terminals	Within 18 months, new pipelines opening in the nation’s most prolific shale basin promise to carry an added 2 million barrels of oil a day to the Gulf Coast.  Meanwhile, some of the terminals proposed are being designed to load a supertanker every other day, each capable of carrying 2 million barrels.  The result: It’s likely only one or two new terminals are needed, with the edge going to companies such as Enbridge Inc., whose Freeport, Texas, effort could be fed by two pipelines it already owns interests in.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shale-boom-raises-specter-glut-140000766.html?.tsrc=rss

Enbridge Counters Claim ‘Air Barrels’ Sent Through Pipeline	The owner of Canada’s biggest crude export pipeline system is facing scrutiny after a surge of production sent crude prices in Western Canada to their lowest level in at least a decade, with heavy Western Canadian Select trading at a discount to West Texas Intermediate futures of $50 a barrel last month.  Steve Laut, vice chairman of oil sands producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd, said this week that the current system for nominating barrels on Enbridge’s Mainline is partly to blame for low prices and allows “a few players” to exploit others by nominating barrels of oil they don’t have or intend to ship, known as “air barrels.” Rachel Notley, Alberta’s premier, also expressed concern at a press conference on Monday, saying the issue will be discussed in consultation with industry.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-counters-claim-air-barrels-200018862.html?.tsrc=rss

Enbridge, Canada's largest pipeline operator, isolated and  depressurized a 36-inch (91-cm) pipeline, which carries gas to  the Pacific Northwest, after it ruptured on Tuesday evening  causing gas to ignite.

The focus on Iran has overwhelmed other news that might have otherwise sent oil prices lower — including a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that U.S. crude inventories rose by 8 million barrels in the last week of September.  Oil prices are expected to rise for the foreseeable future and that should give a lift to a number of energy companies.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a1fe7066-d364-3fae-b5cd-a148162990aa/the-5-best-energy-stocks-for.html?.tsrc=rss

Enbridge Is Said to Eye Long-Term Deals on Biggest Oil Pipeline	Enbridge Inc. plans to overhaul its system of awarding space on the biggest pipeline carrying Canadian oil to U.S. refiners.  Canada’s largest pipeline operator wants to contract 90 percent of the capacity on its 2.85 million-barrel-a-day mainline system by signing long-term deals with potential shippers in an open season early next year, according to people familiar with the matter.  This would effectively displace Enbridge’s current system of operating the mainline as a common carrier, where anyone can seek to ship crude on the line.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/98d35614-f1f4-30b4-af9e-5ab4778eab04/enbridge-is-said-to-eye.html?.tsrc=rss

The 5 Best Energy Stocks for 2018	Oil prices have recovered from three year lows recently amid dwindling supplies and higher export demand – and the outlook for the rest of the year is positive.  Crude stocks, other than the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, are at two-year lows due to greater demand and an effort on the part of oil producers to limit supply.  The International Energy Agency says oversupply appears to be ending and OPEC and 10 other producers cut a deal in December to extend production limits through the end of 2018.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b9cf37e6-1fbe-3987-aa59-93e536c32e4b/the-5-best-energy-stocks-for.html?.tsrc=rss

Accordingly, the stock has sold off throughout the year on any news that may negatively affect the company, most recently a Minnesota judge recommending that the Line 3 replacement project follow the pipeline's existing route.  Enbridge sports a near-term CAD 22 billion in commercially secured capital projects in its growth portfolio, which is highlighted by the Line 3 replacement project.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/911ce581-8e74-3397-a3dd-f8c4a045a627/concerns-about-enbridge%27s.html?.tsrc=rss

Report: Tunnel, trench offer options for replacing pipeline	A 65-year-old pipeline that carries crude oil beneath a sensitive waterway connecting two of the Great Lakes could be replaced with pipes buried in a tunnel or partially enclosed in trenches that would pose virtually no risk of leakage but require years and hundreds of millions of dollars to build, according to a report released Friday.  Enbridge Inc., the Canadian company whose Line 5 runs 645 miles (1,038 kilometers) between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, produced the analysis of possible alternatives for replacing the 4.5-mile-long (7-kilometer-long) segment at the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac between Lakes Huron and Michigan.  The study was required under an agreement between the company and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder amid rising concern about the safety of Line 5, which recently sustained slight damage from a suspected ship anchor strike and has been the target of a campaign by environmentalists demanding it be shut down.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/report-tunnel-trench-offer-options-172321262.html?.tsrc=rss

Short Sellers Circle Oil and Gas Stocks as Crude Price Climbs	Short-selling activity is creeping back into the oil and gas market as the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, a key oil benchmark, rallies again, according to S3 Partners.  In a research note, the financial technology and analytics firm claimed that short interest in the U.S./Canadian oil and gas and consumable fuel sector has increased by 27% to $54.9 billion since WTI crude recovered from its year-to-date low of $58.98 in mid-February to reach $67.75.  In conclusion, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of S3 Partners and the author of the note, said that short-selling activity is clearly moving in tandem with the oil price.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b0df5a2d-7048-3c5b-bb4e-5a6caf4f0423/short-sellers-circle-oil-and.html?.tsrc=rss

Natural gas conduits include the cost of future tax payments in customer fees.  Because the Trump administration lowered the tax rate 21 percent from 35 percent earlier this year, pipelines have effectively been overcharging customers, according to East Daley Capital Management Inc.

The International Energy Agency says oversupply appears to be ending and OPEC and 10 other producers cut a deal earlier in December to extend production limits through the end of 2018.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/96790576-2c6c-3f3a-94bb-76972b571a93/the-5-best-energy-stocks-for.html?.tsrc=rss

2018-02-15	2018-02-15 21:21:03	ENB	Enbridge Inc.	Enbridge to double 2018 asset sales, targets about C$8 bln -sources	NEW YORK/TORONTO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc  , Canada's biggest pipeline operator, plans to  accelerate its divestment program by selling assets valued at  about C$8 billion ($6.4 billion) in 2018, more than twice its  initial sale target, according to people familiar with the  situation.  Under pressure from both investors and rating agencies, the  Calgary, Alberta-based firm wants to ramp up the sale of  non-core assets from the previous C$3 billion it forecast in  November, the people said on condition of anonymity because the  process is private.  Enbridge is trying to take advantage of favorable selling  conditions to rid itself of unwanted units and pay down its  C$61.4 billion long-term debt, the people said.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-double-asset-sales-targets-200909275.html?.tsrc=rss
